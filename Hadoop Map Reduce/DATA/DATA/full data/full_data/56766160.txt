56766160	the island pharisees   by john galsworthy               but this is a worshipful society                                   king john     preface  each man born into the world is born like shelton in this bookto go a journey and for the most part he is born on the high road at first he sits there in the dust with his little chubby hands reaching at nothing and his little solemn eyes staring into space as soon as he can toddle he moves by the queer instinct we call the love of life straight along this road looking neither to the right nor left so pleased is he to walk and he is charmed with everythingwith the nice flat road all broad and white with his own feet and with the prospect he can see on either hand the sun shines and he finds the road a little hot and dusty the rain falls and he splashes through the muddy puddles it makes no matterall is pleasant his fathers went this way before him they made this road for him to tread and when they bred him passed into his fibre the love of doing things as they themselves had done them so he walks on and on resting comfortably at nights under the roofs that have been raised to shelter him by those who went before  suddenly one day without intending to he notices a path or opening in the hedge leading to right or left and he stands looking at the undiscovered after that he stops at all the openings in the hedge one day with a beating heart he tries one  and this is where the fun begins  out of ten of him that try the narrow path nine of him come back to the broad road and when they pass the next gap in the hedge they say no no my friend i found you pleasant for a while but after thatah after that the way my fathers went is good enough for me and it is obviously the proper one for nine of me came back and that poor silly tenthi really pity him  and when he comes to the next inn and snuggles in his wellwarmed bed he thinks of the wild waste of heather where he might have had to spend the night alone beneath the stars nor does it i think occur to him that the broad road he treads all day was once a trackless heath itself  but the poor silly tenth is faring on it is a windy night that he is travelling through a windy night with all things new around and nothing to help him but his courage nine times out of ten that courage fails and he goes down into the bog he has seen the undiscovered andlike ferrand in this bookthe undiscovered has engulfed him his spirit tougher than the spirit of the nine that burned back to sleep in inns was yet not tough enough the tenth time he wins across and on the traces he has left others follow slowly cautiouslya new road is opened to mankind a true saying goes whatever is is right and if all men from the worlds beginning had said that the world would never have begunat all not even the protoplasmic jelly could have commenced its journey there would have been no motive force to make it start  and so that other saying had to be devised before the world could set up business whatever is is wrong but since the cosmic spirit found that matters moved too fast if those that felt all things that are are wrong equalled in number those that felt all things that are are right it solemnly devised polygamy all be it said in a spiritual way of speaking and to each male spirit crowing all things that are are wrong it decreed nine female spirits clucking all things that are are right the cosmic spirit who was very much an artist knew its work and had previously devised a quality called courage and divided it in three naming the parts spiritual moral physical to all the malebird spirits but to no female spiritually not corporeally speaking it gave courage that was spiritual to nearly all both male and female it gave courage that was physical to very many henbird spirits it gave moral courage too but because it knew that if all the malebird spirits were complete the proportion of male to femaleone to tenwould be too great and cause upheavals it so arranged that only one in ten malebird spirits should have all three kinds of courage so that the other nine having spiritual courage but lacking either in moral or in physical should fail in their extensions of the poultryrun and having started them upon these lines it left them to get along as best they might  thus in the subdivision of the poultryrun that we call england the proportion of the others to the complete malebird spirit who of course is not infrequently a woman is ninetynine to one and with every island pharisee when he or she starts out in life the interesting question ought to be am i that one ninety very soon find out that they are not and having found it out lest others should discover they say they are nine of the other ten blinded by their spiritual courage are harder to convince but one by one they sink still proclaiming their virility the hundredth pharisee alone sits out the play  now the journey of this young man shelton who is surely not the hundredth pharisee is but a ragged effort to present the working of the truth all things that are are wrong upon the truth all things that are are right  the institutions of this country like the institutions of all other countries are but halftruths they are the working daily clothing of the nation no more the bodys permanent dress than is a babys frock slowly but surely they wear out or are outgrown and in their fashion they are always thirty years at least behind the fashions of those spirits who are concerned with what shall take their place the conditions that dictate our education the distribution of our property our marriage laws amusements worship prisons and all other things change imperceptibly from hour to hour the moulds containing them being inelastic do not change but hold on to the point of bursting and then are hastily often clumsily enlarged the ninety desiring peace and comfort for their spirit the ninety of the wellwarmed beds will have it that the fashions need not change that morality is fixed that all is ordered and immutable that every one will always marry play and worship in the way that they themselves are marrying playing worshipping they have no speculation and they hate with a deep hatred those who speculate with thought this is the function they were made for they are the dough and they dislike that yeasty stuff of life which comes and works about in them the yeasty stuffthe other tenchafed by all things that are desirous ever of new forms and moulds hate in their turn the comfortable ninety each party has invented for the other the hardest names that it can think of philistines bourgeois mrs grundy rebels anarchists and neerdoweels so we go on and so as each of us is born to go his journey he finds himself in time ranged on one side or on the other and joins the choruses of nameslingers  but now and thenah very seldomwe find ourselves so near that thing which has no breadth the middle line that we can watch them both and positively smile to see the fun  when this book was published first many of its critics found that shelton was the only pharisee and a most unsatisfactory young manand so no doubt he is belonging to the comfortable ninety they felt in fact the need of slinging names at one who obviously was of the ten others of its critics belonging to the ten wielded their epithets upon antonia and the serried ranks behind her and called them pharisees as dull as ditchwaterand so i fear they are  one of the greatest charms of authorship is the privilege it gives the author of studying the secret springs of many unseen persons of analysing human nature through the criticism that his work evokescriticism welling out of the instinctive likings or aversions out of the very fibre of the human being who delivers it criticism that often seems to leap out against the critics will startled like a fawn from some deep bed of sympathy or of antipathy and so all authors love to be abusedas any man can see  in the little matter of the title of this book we are all pharisees whether of the ninety or the ten and we certainly do live upon an island john galsworthy  january 1 1908     part i  the town     chapter i  society  a quiet welldressed man named shelton with a brown face and a short fair beard stood by the bookstall at dover station he was about to journey up to london and had placed his bag in the corner of a thirdclass carriage  after his long travel the flatvowelled voice of the bookstall clerk offering the latest novel sounded pleasantpleasant the independent answers of a bearded guard and the stodgy farewell sayings of a man and wife the limber porters trundling their barrows the greyness of the station and the good stolid humour clinging to the people air and voices all brought to him the sense of home meanwhile he wavered between purchasing a book called market hayborough which he had read and would certainly enjoy a second time and carlyles french revolution which he had not read and was doubtful of enjoying he felt that he ought to buy the latter but he did not relish giving up the former while he hesitated thus his carriage was beginning to fill up so quickly buying both he took up a position from which he could defend his rights nothing he thought shows people up like travelling  the carriage was almost full and putting his bag up in the rack he took his seat at the moment of starting yet another passenger a girl with a pale face scrambled in  i was a fool to go third thought shelton taking in his neighbours from behind his journal  they were seven a grizzled rustic sat in the far corner his empty pipe bowl downwards jutted like a handle from his face all bleared with the smear of nothingness that grows on those who pass their lives in the current of hard facts next to him a ruddy heavyshouldered man was discussing with a greyhaired hatchetvisaged person the condition of their gardens and shelton watched their eyes till it occurred to him how curious a look was in thema watchful friendliness an allied distrustand that their voices cheerful even jovial seemed to be cautious all the time his glance strayed off and almost rebounded from the semiroman slightly cross and wholly selfcomplacent face of a stout lady in a blackandwhite costume who was reading the strand magazine while her other sleek plump hand freed from its black glove and ornamented with a thick watchbracelet rested on her lap a younger brightcheeked and selfconscious female was sitting next her looking at the pale girl who had just got in  theres something about that girl thought shelton they dont like her brown eyes certainly looked frightened her clothes were of a foreign cut suddenly he met the glance of another pair of eyes these eyes prominent and blue stared with a sort of subtle roguery from above a thin lopsided nose and were at once averted they gave shelton the impression that he was being judged and mocked enticed initiated his own gaze did not fall this sanguine face with its twoday growth of reddish beard long nose full lips and irony puzzled him a cynical face he thought and then but sensitive and then too cynical again  the young man who owned it sat with his legs parted at the knees his dusty trouserends and boots slanting back beneath the seat his yellow fingertips crisped as if rolling cigarettes a strange air of detachment was about that youthful shabby figure and not a scrap of luggage filled the rack above his head  the frightened girl was sitting next this pagan personality it was possibly the lack of fashion in his looks that caused her to select him for her confidence  monsieur she asked do you speak french  perfectly  then can you tell me where they take the tickets  the young man shook his head  no said he i am a foreigner  the girl sighed  but what is the matter mamoiselle  the girl did not reply twisting her hands on an old bag in her lap silence had stolen on the carriagea silence such as steals on animals at the first approach of danger all eyes were turned towards the figures of the foreigners  yes broke out the redfaced man he was a bit squiffy that eveningold tom  ah replied his neighbour he would be  something seemed to have destroyed their look of mutual distrust the plump sleek hand of the lady with the roman nose curved convulsively and this movement corresponded to the feeling agitating sheltons heart it was almost as if hand and heart feared to be asked for something  monsieur said the girl with a tremble in her voice i am very unhappy can you tell me what to do i had no money for a ticket  the foreign youths face flickered  yes he said that might happen to anyone of course  what will they do to me sighed the girl  dont lose courage mamoiselle the young man slid his eyes from left to right and rested them on shelton although i dont as yet see your way out  oh monsieur sighed the girl and though it was clear that none but shelton understood what they were saying there was a chilly feeling in the carriage  i wish i could assist you said the foreign youth unfortunately he shrugged his shoulders and again his eyes returned to shelton  the latter thrust his hand into his pocket  can i be of any use he asked in english  certainly sir you could render this young lady the greatest possible service by lending her the money for a ticket  shelton produced a sovereign which the young man took passing it to the girl he said  a thousand thanksvoila une belle action  the misgivings which attend on casual charity crowded up in sheltons mind he was ashamed of having them and of not having them and he stole covert looks at this young foreigner who was now talking to the girl in a language that he did not understand though vagabond in essence the fellows face showed subtle spirit a fortitude and irony not found upon the face of normal man and in turning from it to the other passengers shelton was conscious of revolt contempt and questioning that he could not define leaning back with halfclosed eyes he tried to diagnose this new sensation he found it disconcerting that the faces and behaviour of his neighbours lacked anything he could grasp and secretly abuse they continued to converse with admirable and slightly conscious phlegm yet he knew as well as if each one had whispered to him privately that this shady incident had shaken them something unsettling to their notions of proprietysomething dangerous and destructive of complacencyhad occurred and this was unforgivable each had a different way humorous or philosophic contemptuous sour or sly of showing this resentment but by a flash of insight shelton saw that at the bottom of their minds and of his own the feeling was the same because he shared in their resentment he was enraged with them and with himself he looked at the plump sleek hand of the woman with the roman nose the insulation and complacency of its pale skin the passive righteousness about its curve the prim separation from the others of the fat little finger had acquired a wholly unaccountable importance it embodied the verdict of his fellowpassengers the verdict of society for he knew that whether or no repugnant to the wellbred mind each assemblage of eight persons even in a thirdclass carriage contains the kernel of society  but being in love and recently engaged shelton had a right to be immune from discontent of any kind and he reverted to his mental image of the cool fair face quick movements and the brilliant smile that now in his probationary exile haunted his imagination he took out his fiancees last letter but the voice of the young foreigner addressing him in rapid french caused him to put it back abruptly  from what she tells me sir he said bending forward to be out of hearing of the girl hers is an unhappy case i should have been only too glad to help her but as you seeand he made a gesture by which shelton observed that he had parted from his waistcoati am not rothschild she has been abandoned by the man who brought her over to dover under promise of marriage lookand by a subtle flicker of his eyes he marked how the two ladies had edged away from the french girl they take good care not to let their garments touch her they are virtuous women how fine a thing is virtue sir and finer to know you have it especially when you are never likely to be tempted  shelton was unable to repress a smile and when he smiled his face grew soft  havent you observed went on the youthful foreigner that those who by temperament and circumstance are worst fitted to pronounce judgment are usually the first to judge the judgments of society are always childish seeing that its composed for the most part of individuals who have never smelt the fire and look at this they who have money run too great a risk of parting with it if they dont accuse the penniless of being rogues and imbeciles  shelton was startled and not only by an outburst of philosophy from an utter stranger in poor clothes but at this singular wording of his own private thoughts stifling his sense of the unusual for the queer attraction this young man inspired he said  i suppose youre a stranger over here  ive been in england seven months but not yet in london replied the other i count on doing some good thereit is time a bitter and pathetic smile showed for a second on his lips it wont be my fault if i fail you are english sir  shelton nodded  forgive my asking your voice lacks something ive nearly always noticed in the english a kind ofcomment cela sappellecocksureness coming from your nations greatest quality  and what is that asked shelton with a smile  complacency replied the youthful foreigner  complacency repeated shelton do you call that a great quality  i should rather say monsieur a great defect in what is always a great people you are certainly the most highlycivilised nation on the earth you suffer a little from the fact if i were an english preacher my desire would be to prick the heart of your complacency  shelton leaning back considered this impertinent suggestion  hum he said at last youd be unpopular i dont know that were any cockier than other nations  the young foreigner made a sign as though confirming this opinion  in effect said he it is a sufficiently widespread disease look at these people hereand with a rapid glance he pointed to the inmates of the carnagevery average persons what have they done to warrant their making a virtuous nose at those who do not walk as they do that old rustic perhaps is differenthe never thinks at allbut look at those two occupied with their stupidities about the price of hops the prospects of potatoes what george is doing a thousand things all of that sortlook at their faces i come of the bourgeoisie myselfhave they ever shown proof of any quality that gives them the right to pat themselves upon the back no fear outside potatoes they know nothing and what they do not understand they dread and they despisethere are millions of that breed voila la societe the sole quality these people have shown they have is cowardice i was educated by the jesuits he concluded it has given me a way of thinking  under ordinary circumstances shelton would have murmured in a wellbred voice ah quite so and taken refuge in the columns of the daily telegraph in place of this for some reason that he did not understand he looked at the young foreigner and asked  why do you say all this to me  the trampfor by his boots he could hardly have been betterhesitated  when youve travelled like me he said as if resolved to speak the truth you acquire an instinct in choosing to whom and how you speak it is necessity that makes the law if you want to live you must learn all that sort of thing to make face against life  shelton who himself possessed a certain subtlety could not but observe the complimentary nature of these words it was like saying im not afraid of you misunderstanding me and thinking me a rascal just because i study human nature  but is there nothing to be done for that poor girl  his new acquaintance shrugged his shoulders  a broken jug said he youll never mend her shes going to a cousin in london to see if she can get help youve given her the means of getting thereits all that you can do one knows too well whatll become of her  shelton said gravely  oh thats horrible could nt she be induced to go back home i should be glad  the foreign vagrant shook his head  mon cher monsieur he said you evidently have not yet had occasion to know what the family is like the family does not like damaged goods it will have nothing to say to sons whose hands have dipped into the till or daughters no longer to be married what the devil would they do with her better put a stone about her neck and let her drown at once all the world is christian but christian and good samaritan are not quite the same  shelton looked at the girl who was sitting motionless with her hands crossed on her bag and a revolt against the unfair ways of life arose within him  yes said the young foreigner as if reading all his thoughts whats called virtue is nearly always only luck he rolled his eyes as though to say ah la conventions have them by all meansbut dont look like peacocks because you are preserving them it is but cowardice and luck my friendsbut cowardice and luck  look here said shelton ill give her my address and if she wants to go back to her family she can write to me  shell never go back she wont have the courage  shelton caught the cringing glance of the girls eyes in the droop of her lip there was something sensuous and the conviction that the young mans words were true came over him  i had better not give them my private address he thought glancing at the faces opposite and he wrote down the following richard paramor shelton co paramor and herring lincolns inn fields  youre very good sir my name is louis ferrand no address at present ill make her understand shes half stupefied just now  shelton returned to the perusal of his paper too disturbed to read the young vagrants words kept sounding in his ears he raised his eyes the plump hand of the lady with the roman nose still rested on her lap it had been recased in its black glove with large white stitching her frowning gaze was fixed on him suspiciously as if he had outraged her sense of decency  he did nt get anything from me said the voice of the redfaced man ending a talk on taxgatherers the train whistled loudly and shelton reverted to his paper this time he crossed his legs determined to enjoy the latest murder once more he found himself looking at the vagrants longnosed mocking face that fellow he thought has seen and felt ten times as much as i although he must be ten years younger  he turned for distraction to the landscape with its april clouds trim hedgerows homely coverts but strange ideas would come and he was discontented with himself the conversation he had had the personality of this young foreigner disturbed him it was all as though he had made a start in some fresh journey through the fields of thought     chapter ii  antonia  five years before the journey just described shelton had stood one afternoon on the barge of his old college at the end of the summer races he had been down from oxford for some years but these olympian contests still attracted him  the boats were passing and in the usual rush to the barge side his arm came in contact with a soft young shoulder he saw close to him a young girl with fair hair knotted in a ribbon whose face was eager with excitement the pointed chin long neck the fluffy hair quick gestures and the calm strenuousness of her greyblue eyes impressed him vividly  oh we must bump them he heard her sigh  do you know my people shelton said a voice behind his back and he was granted a touch from the girls shy impatient hand the warmer fingers of a lady with kindly eyes resembling a hares the dry handclasp of a gentleman with a thin arched nose and a quizzical brown face  are you the mr shelton who used to play the bones at eton said the lady oh we so often heard of you from bernard he was your fag was nt he how distressin it is to see these poor boys in the boats  mother they like it cried the girl  antonia ought to be rowing herself said her father whose name was dennant  shelton went back with them to their hotel walking beside antonia through the christchurch meadows telling her details of his college life he dined with them that evening and when he left had a feeling like that produced by a first glass of champagne  the dennants lived at holm oaks within six miles of oxford and two days later he drove over and paid a call amidst the avocations of reading for the bar of cricket racing shooting it but required a whiff of some fresh scenthay honeysuckle cloverto bring antonias face before him with its uncertain colour and its frank distant eyes but two years passed before he again saw her then at an invitation from bernard dennant he played cricket for the manor of holm oaks against a neighbouring house in the evening there was dancing oh the lawn the fair hair was now turned up but the eyes were quite unchanged their steps went together and they outlasted every other couple on the slippery grass thence perhaps sprang her respect for him he was wiry a little taller than herself and seemed to talk of things that interested her he found out she was seventeen and she found out that he was twentynine the following two years shelton went to holm oaks whenever he was asked to him this was a period of enchanted games of cubhunting theatricals and distant sounds of practised music and during it antonias eyes grew more friendly and more curious and his own more shy and schooled more furtive and more ardent then came his fathers death a voyage round the world and that peculiar hour of mixed sensations when one march morning abandoning his steamer at marseilles he took train for hyeres  he found her at one of those exclusive hostelries amongst the pines where the best english go in common with americans russian princesses and jewish families he would not have been shocked to find her elsewhere but he would have been surprised his sunburnt face and the new beard on which he set some undefined value apologetically displayed were scanned by those blue eyes with rapid glances at once more friendly and less friendly ah they seemed to say here you are how glad i am butwhat now  he was admitted to their sacred table at the table dhote a snowy oblong in an airy alcove where the honourable mrs dennant miss dennant and the honourable charlotte penguin a maiden aunt with insufficient lungs sat twice a day in their own atmosphere a momentary weakness came on shelton the first time he saw them sitting there at lunch what was it gave them their look of strange detachment mrs dennant was bending above a camera  im afraid d you know its underexposed she said  what a pity the kitten was rather nice the maiden aunt placing the knitting of a red silk tie beside her plate turned her aspiring wellbred gaze on shelton  look auntie said antonia in her clear quick voice theres the funny little man again  oh said the maiden aunta smile revealed her upper teeth she looked for the funny little man who was not englishhes rather nice  shelton did not look for the funny little man he stole a glance that barely reached antonias brow where her eyebrows took their tiny upward slant at the outer corners and her hair was still ruffled by a windy walk from that moment he became her slave  mr shelton do you know anything about these periscopic binoculars said mrs dennants voice theyre splendid for buildins but buildins are so disappointin the thing is to get human interest isnt it and her glance wandered absently past shelton in search of human interest  you havent put down what youve taken mother  from a little leather bag mrs dennant took a little leather book  its so easy to forget what theyre about she said thats so annoyin  shelton was not again visited by his uneasiness at their detachment he accepted them and all their works for there was something quite sublime about the way that they would leave the diningroom unconscious that they themselves were funny to all the people they had found so funny while they had been sitting there and he would follow them out unnecessarily upright and feeling like a fool  in the ensuing fortnight chaperoned by the maiden aunt for mrs dennant disliked driving he sat opposite to antonia during many drives he played sets of tennis with her but it was in the evenings after dinnerthose long evenings on a parquet floor in wicker chairs dragged as far as might be from the heating apparatusthat he seemed so very near her the community of isolation drew them closer in place of a companion he had assumed the part of friend to whom she could confide all her homesick aspirations so that even when she was sitting silent a slim long foot stretched out in front bending with an air of cool absorption over some pencil sketches which she would not show himeven then by her very attitude by the sweet freshness that clung about her by her quick offended glances at the strange persons round she seemed to acknowledge in some secret way that he was necessary he was far from realising this his intellectual and observant parts were hypnotised and fascinated even by her failings the faint freckling across her nose the slim and virginal severeness of her figure with its narrow hips and arms the curve of her long neckall were added charms she had the wind and rain look a taste of home and over the glaring roads where the palmtree shadows lay so black she seemed to pass like the very image of an english day  one afternoon he had taken her to play tennis with some friends and afterwards they strolled on to her favourite view down the toulon road gardens and hills were bathed in the colour of ripe apricot an evening crispness had stolen on the air the blood released from the suns numbing ran gladly in the veins on the right hand of the road was a frenchman playing bowls enormous busy pleased and upright as a soldier pathetically trotting his vast carcass from end to end he delighted shelton but antonia threw a single look at the huge creature and her face expressed disgust she began running up towards the ruined tower  shelton let her keep in front watching her leap from stone to stone and throw back defiant glances when he pressed behind she stood at the top and he looked up at her over the world gloriously spread below she like a statue seemed to rule the colour was brilliant in her cheeks her young bosom heaved her eyes shone and the flowing droop of her long full sleeves gave to her poised figure the look of one who flies he pulled himself up and stood beside her his heart choked him all the colour had left his cheeks  antonia he said i love you  she started as if his whisper had intruded on her thoughts but his face must have expressed his hunger for the resentment in her eyes vanished  they stood for several minutes without speaking and then went home shelton painfully revolved the riddle of the colour in her face had he a chance then was it possible that evening the instinct vouchsafed at times to lovers in place of reason caused him to pack his bag and go to cannes on returning two days later and approaching the group in the centre of the winter garden the voice of the maiden aunt reading aloud an extract from the morning post reached him across the room  dont you think thats rather nice he heard her ask and then oh here you aye its very nice to see you back  shelton slipped into a wicker chair antonia looked up quickly from her sketchbook put out a hand but did not speak  he watched her bending head and his eagerness was changed to gloom with desperate vivacity he sustained the five intolerable minutes of inquiry where had he been what had he been doing then once again the maiden aunt commenced her extracts from the morning post  a touch on his sleeve startled him antonia was leaning forward her cheeks were crimson above the pallor of her neck  would you like to see my sketches  to shelton bending above those sketches that drawl of the wellbred maiden aunt intoning the wellbred paper was the most pleasant sound that he had ever listened to  my dear dick mrs dennant said to him a fortnight later we would rather after you leave here that you dont see each other again until july of course i know you count it an engagement and all that and everybodys been writin to congratulate you but algie thinks you ought to give yourselves a chance young people dont always know what theyre about you know its not long to wait  three months gasped shelton  he had to swallow down this pill with what grace he could command there was no alternative antonia had acquiesced in the condition with a queer grave pleasure as if she expected it to do her good  itll be something to look forward to dick she said  he postponed departure as long as possible and it was not until the end of april that he left for england she came alone to see him off it was drizzling but her tall slight figure in the golf cape looked impervious to cold and rain amongst the shivering natives desperately he clutched her hand warm through the wet glove her smile seemed heartless in its brilliancy he whispered you will write  of course dont be so stupid you old dick  she ran forward as the train began to move her clear goodbye sounded shrill and hard above the rumble of the wheels he saw her raise her hand an umbrella waving and last of all vivid still amongst receding shapes the red spot of her scarlet tamoshanter     chapter iii  a zoological garden  after his journey up from dover shelton was still fathering his luggage at charing cross when the foreign girl passed him and in spite of his desire to say something cheering he could get nothing out but a shamefaced smile her figure vanished wavering into the hurlyburly one of his bags had gone astray and so all thought of her soon faded from his mind his cab however overtook the foreign vagrant marching along towards pall mall with a curious lengthy stridean observant disillusioned figure  the first bustle of installation over time hung heavy on his hands july loomed distant as in some future century antonias eyes beckoned him faintly hopelessly she would not even be coming back to england for another month     i met a young foreigner in the train from dover he wrote to hera curious sort of person altogether who seems to have infected me everything here has gone flat and unprofitable the only good things in life are your letters john noble dined with me yesterday the poor fellow tried to persuade me to stand for parliament why should i think myself fit to legislate for the unhappy wretches one sees about in the streets if peoples faces are a fair test of their happiness i d rather not feel in any way responsible  the streets in fact after his long absence in the east afforded him much food for thought the curious smugness of the passersby the utterly unending bustle the fearful medley of miserable overdriven women and fullfed men with leering bullbeef eyes whom he saw everywherein club windows on their beats on box seats on the steps of hotels discharging dilatory duties the appalling chaos of hardeyed capable dames with defiant clothes and whitecheeked huntedlooking men of splendid creatures in their cabs and cadging creatures in their broken hatsthe callousness and the monotony  one afternoon in may he received this letter couched in french   3 blank row  westminster  my dear sir  excuse me for recalling to your memory the offer of assistance you so kindly made me during the journey from dover to london in which i was so fortunate as to travel with a man like you having beaten the whole town ignorant of what wood to make arrows nearly at the end of my resources my spirit profoundly discouraged i venture to avail myself of your permission knowing your good heart since i saw you i have run through all the misfortunes of the calendar and cannot tell what door is left at which i have not knocked i presented myself at the business firm with whose name you supplied me but being unfortunately in rags they refused to give me your address is this not very much in the english character they told me to write and said they would forward the letter i put all my hopes in you  believe me my dear sir  whatever you may decide  your devoted  louis ferrand   shelton looked at the envelope and saw that it bore date a week ago the face of the young vagrant rose before him vital mocking sensitive the sound of his quick french buzzed in his ears and oddly the whole whiff of him had a power of raising more vividly than ever his memories of antonia it had been at the end of the journey from hyeres to london that he had met him that seemed to give the youth a claim  he took his hat and hurried to blank row dismissing his cab at the corner of victoria street he with difficulty found the house in question it was a doorless place with stoneflagged corridorin other words a dosshouse by tapping on a sort of ticketoffice with a sliding window he attracted the attention of a blowsy woman with soapsuds on her arms who informed him that the person he was looking for had gone without leaving his address  but isnt there anybody asked shelton of whom i can make inquiry  yes theres a frenchman and opening an inner door she bellowed frenchy wanted and disappeared  a driedup yellow little man cynical and weary in the face as if a moral steamroller had passed over it answered this call and stood sniffing as it were at shelton on whom he made the singular impression of some little creature in a cage  he left here ten days ago in the company of a mulatto what do you want with him if i may ask the little mans yellow cheeks were wrinkled with suspicion  shelton produced the letter  ah now i know youa pale smile broke through the frenchmans crowsfeethe spoke of you if i can only find him he used to say i m saved i liked that young man he had ideas  is there no way of getting at him through his consul  the frenchman shook his head  might as well look for diamonds at the bottom of the sea  do you think he will come back here but by that time i suppose youll hardly be here yourself  a gleam of amusement played about the frenchmans teeth  i oh yes sir once upon a time i cherished the hope of emerging i no longer have illusions i shave these specimens for a living and shall shave them till the day of judgment but leave a letter with me by all means he will come back theres an overcoat of his here on which he borrowed moneyits worth more oh yes he will come backa youth of principle leave a letter with me im always here  shelton hesitated but those last three words im always here touched him in their simplicity nothing more dreadful could be said  can you find me a sheet of paper then he asked please keep the change for the trouble i am giving you  thank you said the frenchman simply he told me that your heart was good if you dont mind the kitchen you could write there at your ease  shelton wrote his letter at the table of this stoneflagged kitchen in company with an aged driedup gentleman who was muttering to himself and shelton tried to avoid attracting his attention suspecting that he was not sober just as he was about to take his leave however the old fellow thus accosted him  did you ever go to the dentist mister he said working at a loose tooth with his shrivelled fingers i went to a dentist once who professed to stop teeth without giving pain and the beggar did stop my teeth without pain but did they stay in those stoppings no my bhoy they came out before you could say jack robinson now i shimply ask you dyou call that dentistry fixing his eyes on sheltons collar which had the misfortune to be high and clean he resumed with drunken scorn uts the same all over this pharisaical counthry talk of high morality and angloshaxon civilisation the world was never at such low ebb phwhats all this morality ut stinks of the shop look at the condition of art in this counthry look at the fools you see upon th stage look at the pictures and books that sell i know what im talking about though i am a sandwich man phwhats the secret of ut all shop my bhoy ut dont pay to go below a certain depth scratch the skin but pierce utoh dear no we hate to see the blood fly eh  shelton stood disconcerted not knowing if he were expected to reply but the old gentleman pursing up his lips went on  sir there are no extremes in this fogsmitten land do ye think blanks loike me ought to exist whoy dont they kill us off palliativespalliativesand whoy because they object to th extreme course look at women the streets here are a scandal to the world they wont recognise that they existtheir noses are so dam high they blink the truth in this middleclass counthry my bhoyand he whispered confidentiallyut pays em eh you say why shouldnt they then but shelton had not spoken well letem let em but dont tell me thatsh morality dont tell me thatsh civilisation what can you expect in a counthry where the crimson emotions are never allowed to smell the air and whatsh the result my bhoy the result is sentiment a yellow thing with blue spots like a fungus or a stilton cheese go to the theatre and see one of these things they call plays tell me are they food for men and women why theyre pap for babes and shopboys i was a blanky actor moyself  shelton listened with mingled feelings of amusement and dismay till the old actor having finished resumed his crouching posture at the table  you dont get dhrunk i suppose he said suddenlytoo much of n englishman no doubt  very seldom said shelton  pity think of the pleasures of oblivion oi m dhrunk every night  how long will you last at that rate  there speaks the englishman why should oi give up me only pleasure to keep me wretched life in if youve anything left worth the keeping shober for keep shober by all means if not the sooner you are dhrunk the betterthat stands to reason  in the corridor shelton asked the frenchman where the old man came from  oh and englishman yes yes from belfast very drunken old man you are a drunken nationhe made a motion with his hands he no longer eatsno inside left it is unfortunatea man of spirit if you have never seen one of these palaces monsieur i shall be happy to show you over it  shelton took out his cigarette case  yes yes said the frenchman making a wry nose and taking a cigarette im accustomed to it but youre wise to fumigate the air one is nt in a harem  and shelton felt ashamed of his fastidiousness  this said the guide leading him upstairs and opening a door is a specimen of the apartments reserved for these princes of the blood there were four empty beds on iron legs and with the air of a showman the frenchman twitched away a dingy quilt they go out in the mornings earn enough to make them drunk sleep it off and then begin again thats their life there are people who think they ought to be reformed mon cher monsieur one must face reality a little even in this country it would be a hundred times better for these people to spend their time reforming high society your high society makes all these creatures theres no harvest without cutting stalks selon moi he continued putting back the quilt and dribbling cigarette smoke through his nose theres no grand difference between your high society and these individuals here both want pleasure both think only of themselves which is very natural one lot have had the luck the otherwell you see he shrugged a common set ive been robbed here half a dozen times if you have new shoes a good waistcoat an overcoat you want eyes in the back of your head and they are populated change your bed and youll run all the dangers of not sleeping alone vla ma clientele the half of them dont pay me he snapped his yellow sticks of fingers a penny for a shave twopence a cut quelle vie here he continued standing by a bed is a gentleman who owes me fivepence heres one who was a soldier hes done for all brutalised not one with any courage left but believe me monsieur he went on opening another door when you come down to houses of this sort you must have a vice its as necessary as breath is to the lungs no matter what you must have a vice to give you a little solaceun peu de soulagement ah yes before you judge these swine reflect on life ive been through it monsieur it is not nice never to know where to get your next meal gentlemen who have food in their stomachs money in their pockets and know where to get more they never think why should theypas de danger all these cages are the same come down and you shall see the pantry he took shelton through the kitchen which seemed the only sittingroom of the establishment to an inner room furnished with dirty cups and saucers plates and knives another fire was burning there we always have hot water said the frenchman and three times a week they make a fire down therehe pointed to a cellarfor our clients to boil their vermin oh yes we have all the luxuries  shelton returned to the kitchen and directly after took leave of the little frenchman who said with a kind of moral buttonholing as if trying to adopt him as a patron  trust me monsieur if he comes backthat young manhe shall have your letter without fail my name is carolan jules carolan and i am always at your service     chapter iv  the play  shelton walked away he had been indulging in a nightmare that old actor was drunk thought he and no doubt he was an irishman still there may be truth in what he said i am a pharisee like all the rest who are nt in the pit my respectability is only luck what should i have become if id been born into his kind of life and he stared at a stream of people coming from the stares trying to pierce the mask of their serious complacent faces if these ladies and gentlemen were put into that pit into which he had been looking would a single one of them emerge again but the effort of picturing them there was too much for him it was too fartoo ridiculously far  one particular couple a large fine man and wife who in the midst of all the dirt and rumbling hurry the gloomy ludicrous and desperately jovial streets walked side by side in wellbred silence had evidently bought some article which pleased them there was nothing offensive in their manner they seemed quite unconcerned at the passing of the other people the man had that fine solidity of shoulder and of waist the glossy selfpossession that belongs to those with horses guns and dressingbags the wife her chin comfortably settled in her fur kept her grey eyes on the ground and when she spoke her even and unruffled voice reached sheltons ears above all the whirring of the traffic it was leisurely precise as if it had never hurried had never been exhausted or passionate or afraid their talk like that of many dozens of fine couples invading london from their country places was of where to dine what theatre they should go to whom they had seen what they should buy and shelton knew that from days end to end and even in their bed these would be the subjects of their conversation they were the bestbred people of the sort he met in country houses and accepted as of course with a vague discomfort at the bottom of his soul antonias home for instance had been full of them they were the bestbred people of the sort who supported charities knew everybody had clear calm judgment and intolerance of all such conduct as seemed to them impossible all breaches of morality such as mistakes of etiquette such as dishonesty passion sympathy except with a canonised class of objectsthe legitimate sufferings for instance of their own families and class how healthy they were the memory of the dosshouse worked in sheltons mind like poison he was conscious that in his own groomed figure in the undemonstrative assurance of his walk he bore resemblance to the couple he apostrophised ah he thought how vulgar our refinement is but he hardly believed in his own outburst these people were so well mannered so well conducted and so healthy he could not really understand what irritated him what was the matter with them they fulfilled their duties had good appetites clear consciences all the furniture of perfect citizens they merely lackedfeelers a loss that he had read was suffered by plants and animals which no longer had a need for using them some rare national faculty of seeing only the obvious and materially useful had destroyed their power of catching gleams or scents to right or left  the lady looked up at her husband the light of quiet proprietary affection shone in her calm grey eyes decorously illumining her features slightly reddened by the wind and the husband looked back at her calm practical protecting they were very much alike so doubtless he looked when he presented himself in snowy shirtsleeves for her to straighten the bow of his white tie so nightly she would look standing before the fulllength mirror fixing his gifts upon her bosom calm proprietary kind he passed them and walked behind a second less distinguished couple who manifested a mutual dislike as matteroffact and free from nonsense as the unruffled satisfaction of the first this dislike was just as healthy and produced in shelton about the same sensation it was like knocking at a neveropened door looking at a circlecouple after couple all the same no heads toes angles of their souls stuck out anywhere in the sea of their environments they were drowned no leg braved the air no arm emerged wet and naked waving at the skies shoppersons aristocrats workmen officials they were all respectable and he himself as respectable as any  he returned thus moody to his rooms and with the impetuosity which distinguished him when about to do an unwise thing he seized a pen and poured out before antonia some of his impressions   mean is the word darling we are mean thats what s the matter with us dukes and dustmen the whole human speciesas mean as caterpillars to secure our own property and our own comfort to dole out our sympathy according to rule just so that it wont really hurt us is what were all after theres something about human nature that is awfully repulsive and the healthier people are the more repulsive they seem to me to be  he paused biting his pen had he one acquaintance who would not counsel him to see a doctor for writing in that style how would the world go round how could society exist without commonsense practical ability and the lack of sympathy  he looked out of the open window down in the street a footman was settling the rug over the knees of a lady in a carriage and the decorous immovability of both their faces which were clearly visible to him was like a portion of some welloiled engine  he got up and walked up and down his rooms in a narrow square skirting belgravia were unchanged since the death of his father had made him a man of means selected for their centrality they were furnished in a very miscellaneous way they were not bare but close inspection revealed that everything was damaged more or less and there was absolutely nothing that seemed to have an interest taken in it his goods were accidents presents or the haphazard acquisitions of a pressing need nothing of course was frowsy but everything was somewhat dusty as if belonging to a man who never rebuked a servant above all there was nothing that indicated hobbies  three days later he had her answer to his letter     i dont think i understand what you mean by the healthier people are the more repulsive they seem to be one must be healthy to be perfect must nt one i dont like unhealthy people i had to play on that wretched piano after reading your letter it made me feel unhappy ive been having a splendid lot of tennis lately got the backhanded lifting stroke at lasthurrah     by the same post too came the following note in an autocratic writing   dear bird for this was sheltons college nickname  my wife has gone down to her people so im en garcon for a few days if youve nothing better to do come and dine tonight at seven and go to the theatre its ages since i saw you  yours as ever  b m halidome   shelton had nothing better to do for pleasant were his friend halidomes wellappointed dinners at seven therefore he went to chester square his friend was in his study reading matthew arnold by the light of an electric lamp the walls of the room were hung with costly etchings arranged with solid and unfailing taste from the carving of the mantelpiece to the binding of the books from the miraculouslycoloured meerschaums to the chased fireirons everything displayed an unpretentious luxury an order and a finish significant of life completely under rule of thumb everything had been collected the collector rose as shelton entered a fine figure of a man clean shavenwith dark hair a roman nose good eyes and the rather weighty dignity of attitude which comes from the assurance that one is in the right  taking shelton by the lapel he drew him into the radius of the lamp where he examined him smiling a slow smile glad to see you old chap i rather like your beard he said with genial brusqueness and nothing perhaps could better have summed up his faculty for forming independent judgments which shelton found so admirable he made no apology for the smallness of the dinner which consisting of eight courses and three wines served by a butler and one footman smacked of the same perfection as the furniture in fact he never apologised for anything except with a jovial brusqueness that was worse than the offence the suave and reasonable weight of his dislikes and his approvals stirred shelton up to feel ironical and insignificant but whether from a sense of the solid humane and healthy quality of his friends egoism or merely from the fact that this friendship had been long in bottle he did not resent his mixed sensations  by the way i congratulate you old chap said halidome while driving to the theatre there was no vulgar hurry about his congratulations no more than about himself theyre awfully nice people the dennants  a sense of having had a seal put on his choice came over shelton  where are you going to live you ought to come down and live near us there are some ripping houses to be had down there its really a ripping neighbourhood have you chucked the bar you ought to do something you know itll be fatal for you to have nothing to do i tell you what bird you ought to stand for the county council  but before shelton had replied they reached the theatre and their energies were spent in sidling to their stalls he had time to pass his neighbours in review before the play began seated next to him was a lady with large healthy shoulders displayed with splendid liberality beyond her a husband redcheeked with drooping yellowgrey moustache and a bald head beyond him again two men whom he had known at eton one of them had a cleanshaved face dark hair and a weathertanned complexion his small mouth with its upper lip pushed out above the lower his eyelids a little drooped over his watchful eyes gave him a satirical and resolute expression ive got hold of your tail old fellow he seemed to say as though he were always busy with the catching of some kind of fox the others goggling eyes rested on shelton with a chaffing smile his thick sleek hair brushed with water and parted in the middle his neat moustache and admirable waistcoat suggested the sort of dandyism that despises women from his recognition of these old schoolfellows shelton turned to look at halidome who having cleared his throat was staring straight before him at the curtain antonias words kept running in her lovers head i dont like unhealthy people well all these people anyway were healthy they looked as if they had defied the elements to endow them with a spark of anything but health just then the curtain rose  slowly unwillingly for he was of a trustful disposition shelton recognised that this play was one of those masterpieces of the modern drama whose characters were drawn on the principle that men were made for morals rather than morals made by men and he watched the play unfold with all its careful sandwiching of grave and gay  a married woman anxious to be ridded of her husband was the pivot of the story and a number of scenes ingeniously contrived with a hundred reasons why this desire was wrong and inexpedient were revealed to sheltons eyes these reasons issued mainly from the mouth of a wellpreserved old gentleman who seemed to play the part of a sort of moral salesman he turned to halidome and whispered  can you stand that old woman  his friend fixed his fine eyes on him wonderingly  what old woman  why the old ass with the platitudes  halidomes countenance grew cold a little shocked as though he had been assailed in person  do you mean pirbright he said i think hes ripping  shelton turned to the play rebuffed he felt guilty of a breach of manners sitting as he was in one of his friends stalls and he naturally set to work to watch the play more critically than ever antonias words again recurred to him i dont like unhealthy people and they seemed to throw a sudden light upon this play it was healthy  the scene was a drawingroom softly lighted by electric lamps with a cat shelton could not decide whether she was real or not asleep upon the mat  the husband a thickset healthy man in evening dress was drinking off neat whisky he put down his tumbler and deliberately struck a match then with even greater deliberation he lit a goldtipped cigarette  shelton was no inexperienced playgoer he shifted his elbows for he felt that something was about to happen and when the match was pitched into the fire he leaned forward in his seat the husband poured more whisky out drank it at a draught and walked towards the door then turning to the audience as if to admit them to the secret of some tremendous resolution he puffed at them a puff of smoke he left the room returned and once more filled his glass a lady now entered pale of face and dark of eyehis wife the husband crossed the stage and stood before the fire his legs astride in the attitude which somehow shelton had felt sure he would assume he spoke  come in and shut the door  shelton suddenly perceived that he was face to face with one of those dumb moments in which two people declare their inextinguishable hatredthe hatred underlying the sexual intimacy of two illassorted creaturesand he was suddenly reminded of a scene he had once witnessed in a restaurant he remembered with extreme minuteness how the woman and the man had sat facing each other across the narrow patch of white emblazoned by a candle with cheap shades and a thin green vase with yellow flowers he remembered the curious scornful anger of their voices subdued so that only a few words reached him he remembered the cold loathing in their eyes and above all he remembered his impression that this sort of scene happened between them every other day and would continue so to happen and as he put on his overcoat and paid his bill he had asked himself why in the name of decency do they go on living together and now he thought as he listened to the two players wrangling on the stage what s the good of all this talk theres something here past words  the curtain came down upon the act and he looked at the lady next him she was shrugging her shoulders at her husband whose face was healthy and offended  i do dislike these unhealthy women he was saying but catching sheltons eye he turned square in his seat and sniffed ironically  the face of sheltons friend beyond composed satirical as ever was clothed with a mask of scornful curiosity as if he had been listening to something that had displeased him not a little the goggleeyed man was yawning shelton turned to halidome  can you stand this sort of thing said he  no i call that scene a bit too hot replied his friend  shelton wriggled he had meant to say it was not hot enough  ill bet you anything he said i know whats going to happen now youll have that old asswhats his namelunching off cutlets and champagne to fortify himselffor a lecture to the wife hell show her how unhealthy her feelings arei know himand hell take her hand and say dear lady is there anything in this poor world but the good opinion of society and hell pretend to laugh at himself for saying it but youll see perfectly well that the old woman means it and then hell put her into a set of circumstances that are nt her own but his version of them and show her the only way of salvation is to kiss her husband and shelton grinned anyway ill bet you anything he takes her hand and says dear lady  halidome turned on him the disapproval of his eyes and again he said  i think pirbright s ripping  but as shelton had predicted so it turned out amidst great applause     chapter v  the good citizen  leaving the theatre they paused a moment in the hall to don their coats a stream of people with spotless bosoms eddied round the doors as if in momentary dread of leaving this hothouse of false morals and emotions for the wet gusty streets where human plants thrive and die human weeds flourish and fade under the fresh impartial skies the lights revealed innumerable solemn faces gleamed innumerably on jewels on the silk of hats then passed to whiten a pavement wet with newlyfallen rain to flare on horses on the visages of cabmen and stray queer objects that do not bear the light  shall we walk asked halidome  has it ever struck you answered shelton that in a play nowadays theres always a chorus of scandalmongers which seems to have acquired the attitude of god  halidome cleared his throat and there was something portentous in the sound  youre so dd fastidious was his answer  ive a prejudice for keeping the two things separate went on shelton that ending makes me sick  why replied halidome what other end is possible you dont want a play to leave you with a bad taste in your mouth  but this does  halidome increased his stride already much too long for in his walk as in all other phases of his life he found it necessary to be in front  how do you mean he asked urbanely its better than the woman making a fool of herself  im thinking of the man  what man  the husband  what s the matter with him he was a bit of a bounder certainly  i cant understand any man wanting to live with a woman who doesnt want him  some note of battle in sheltons voice rather than the sentiment itself caused his friend to reply with dignity  theres a lot of nonsense talked about that sort of thing women dont really care its only whats put into their heads  thats much the same as saying to a starving man you dont really want anything its only whats put into your head you are begging the question my friend  but nothing was more calculated to annoy halidome than to tell him he was begging the question for he prided himself on being strong in logic  that be dd he said  not at all old chap here is a case where a woman wants her freedom and you merely answer that she dogs nt want it  women like that are impossible better leave them out of court  shelton pondered this and smiled he had recollected an acquaintance of his own who when his wife had left him invented the theory that she was mad and this struck him now as funny but then he thought poor devil he was bound to call her mad if he didnt it would be confessing himself distasteful however true you cant expect a man to consider himself that but a glance at his friends eye warned him that he too might think his wife mad in such a case  surely he said even if shes his wife a mans bound to behave like a gentleman  depends on whether she behaves like a lady  does it i dont see the connection  halidome paused in the act of turning the latchkey in his door there was a rather angry smile in his fine eyes  my dear chap he said youre too sentimental altogether  the word sentimental nettled shelton a gentleman either is a gentleman or he is nt what has it to do with the way other people behave  halidome turned the key in the lock and opened the door into his hall where the firelight fell on the decanters and huge chairs drawn towards the blaze  no bird he said resuming his urbanity and gathering his coattails in his hands its all very well to talk but wait until youre married a man must be master and show it too  an idea occurred to shelton  look here hal he said what should you do if your wife got tired of you  the expression on halidomes face was a mixture of amusement and contempt  i dont mean anything personal of course but apply the situation to yourself  halidome took out a toothpick used it brusquely and responded  i shouldnt stand any humbugtake her travelling shake her mind up shed soon come round  but suppose she really loathed you  halidome cleared his throat the idea was so obviously indecent how could anybody loathe him with great composure however regarding shelton as if he were a forward but amusing child he answered  there are a great many things to be taken into consideration  it appears to me said shelton to be a question of common pride how can you ask anything of a woman who doesnt want to give it  his friends voice became judicial  a man ought not to suffer he said poring over his whisky because a woman gets hysteria you have to think of society your children house money arrangements a thousand things its all very well to talk how do you like this whisky  the part of the good citizen in fact said shelton selfpreservation  commonsense returned his friend i believe in justice before sentiment he drank and callously blew smoke at shelton besides there are many people with religious views about it  its always seemed to me said shelton to be quaint that people should assert that marriage gives them the right to an eye for an eye and call themselves christians did you ever know anybody stand on their rights except out of wounded pride or for the sake of their own comfort let them call their reasons what they like you know as well as i do that its cant  i dont know about that said halidome more and more superior as shelton grew more warm when you stand on your rights you do it for the sake of society as well as for your own if you want to do away with marriage why dont you say so  but i dont said shelton is it likely why im going he stopped without adding the words to be married myself for it suddenly occurred to him that the reason was not the most lofty and philosophic in the world all i can say is he went on soberly that you cant make a horse drink by driving him generosity is the surest way of tightening the knot with people whove any sense of decency as to the rest the chief thing is to prevent their breeding  halidome smiled  youre a rum chap he said  shelton jerked his cigarette into the fire  i tell you whatfor late at night a certain power of vision came to himits humbug to talk of doing things for the sake of society its nothing but the instinct to keep our own heads above the water  but halidome remained unruffled  all right he said call it that i dont see why i should go to the wall it wouldnt do any good  you admit then said shelton that our morality is the sum total of everybodys private instinct of selfpreservation  halidome stretched his splendid frame and yawned  i dont know he began that i should quite call it that  but the compelling complacency of his fine eyes the dignified posture of his healthy body the lofty slope of his narrow forehead the perfectly humane look of his cultivated brutality struck shelton as ridiculous  hang it hall he cried jumping from his chair what an old fraud you are ill be off  no look here said halidome the faintest shade of doubt had appeared upon his face he took shelton by a lapel youre quite wrong  very likely goodnight old chap  shelton walked home letting the spring wind into him it was saturday and he passed many silent couples in every little patch of shadow he could see two forms standing or sitting close together and in their presence words the impostors seemed to hold their tongues the wind rustled the buds the stars one moment bright as diamonds vanished the next in the lower streets a large part of the world was under the influence of drink but by this shelton was far from being troubled it seemed better than drama than dressingbagged men unruffled women and padded points of view better than the immaculate solidity of his friends possessions  so he reflected its right for every reason social religious and convenient to inflict ones society where its not desired there are obviously advantages about the married state charming to feel respectable while youre acting in a way that in any other walk of life would bring on you contempt if old halidome showed that he was tired of me and i continued to visit him hed think me a bit of a cad but if his wife were to tell him she couldnt stand him hed still consider himself a perfect gentleman if he persisted in giving her the burden of his society and he has the cheek to bring religion into ita religion that says do unto others  but in this he was unjust to halidome forgetting how impossible it was for him to believe that a woman could not stand him he reached his rooms and the more freely to enjoy the clear lamplight the soft gusty breeze and waning turmoil of the streets waited a moment before entering  i wonder thought he if i shall turn out a cad when i marry like that chap in the play its natural we all want our moneys worth our pound of flesh pity we use such fine wordssociety religion morality humbug  he went in and throwing his window open remained there a long time his figure outlined against the lighted room for the benefit of the dark square below his hands in his pockets his head down a reflective frown about his eyes a halfintoxicated old ruffian a policeman and a man in a straw hat had stopped below and were holding a palaver  yus the old ruffian said im a rackety old blank but what i say is if we wus all alike this would nt be a world  they went their way and before the listeners eyes there rose antonias face with its unruffled brow halidomes all health and dignity the forehead of the goggleeyed man with its line of hair parted in the centre and brushed across a light seemed to illumine the plane of their existence as the electric lamp with the green shade had illumined the pages of the matthew arnold serene before sheltons vision lay that elysium untouched by passion or extremes of any kind autocratic complacent possessive and wellkept as any midland landscape healthy wealthy wise no room but for perfection selfpreservation the survival of the fittest the part of the good citizen he thought no if we were all alike this would nt be a world     chapter vi  marriage settlement  my dear richard wrote sheltons uncle the next day i shall be glad to see you at three oclock tomorrow afternoon upon the question of your marriage settlement at that hour accordingly shelton made his way to lincolns inn fields where in fat black letters the names paramor and herring commissioners for oaths were written on the wall of a stone entrance he ascended the solid steps with nervousness and by a small redhaired boy was introduced to a back room on the first floor here seated at a table in the very centre as if he thereby better controlled his universe a pugfeatured gentleman without a beard was writing he paused ow mr richard he said glad to see you sir take a chair your uncle will be disengaged in arf a minute and in the tone of his allusion to his employer was the satirical approval that comes with long and faithful service he will do everything himself he went on screwing up his sly greenish honest eyes and he s not a young man  shelton never saw his uncles clerk without marvelling at the prosperity deepening upon his face in place of the look of harassment which on most faces begins to grow after the age of fifty his old friends countenance as though in sympathy with the nation had expandeda little greasily a little genially a little coarselyevery time he met it a contemptuous tolerance for people who were not getting on was spreading beneath its surface it left each time a deeper feeling that its owner could never be in the wrong  i hope youre well sir he resumed most important for you to have your health now youre goingtoand feeling for the delicate way to put it he involuntarily winkedto become a family man we saw it in the paper my wife said to me the other morning at breakfast bob heres a mr richard paramor shelton goin to be married is that any relative of your mr shelton my dear i said to her its the very man  it disquieted shelton to perceive that his old friend did not pass the whole of his life at that table writing in the centre of the room but that somewhere vistas of little grey houses rose before his eyes he actually lived another life where someone called him bob bob and this too was a revelation bob why of course it was the only name for him a bell rang  thats your uncle and again the head clerks voice sounded ironical goodbye sir  he seemed to clip off intercourse as one clips off electric light shelton left him writing and preceded the redhaired boy to an enormous room in the front where his uncle waited  edmund paramor was a mediumsized and upright man of seventy whose brown face was perfectly cleanshaven his grey silky hair was brushed in a cocks comb from his fine forehead bald on the left side he stood before the hearth facing the room and his figure had the springy abruptness of men who cannot fatten there was a certain youthfulness too in his eyes yet they had a look as though he had been through fire and his mouth curled at the corners in surprising smiles the room was like the manmorally large void of redtape and almost void of furniture no tin boxes were ranged against the walls no papers littered up the table a single bookcase contained a complete edition of the law reports and resting on the law directory was a single red rose in a glass of water it looked the room of one with a sober magnanimity who went to the heart of things despised haggling and before whose smiles the more immediate kinds of humbug faded  well dick said he hows your mother  shelton replied that his mother was all right  tell her that im going to sell her easterns after all and put into this brass thing you can say its safe from me  shelton made a face  mother said he always believes things are safe  his uncle looked through him with his keen halfsuffering glance and up went the corners of his mouth  shes splendid he said  yes said shelton splendid  the transaction however did not interest him his uncles judgment in such matters had a breezy soundness he would never dream of questioning  well about your settlement and touching a bell three times mr paramor walked up and down the room bring me the draft of mr richards marriage settlement  the stalwart commissionaire reappearing with a documentnow then dick said mr paramor she s not bringing anything into settlement i understand how s that  i did nt want it replied shelton unaccountably ashamed  mr paramors lips quivered he drew the draft closer took up a blue pencil and squeezing sheltons arm began to read the latter following his uncles rapid exposition of the clauses was relieved when he paused suddenly  if you die and she marries again said mr paramor she forfeits her life interestsee  oh said shelton wait a minute uncle ted  mr paramor waited biting his pencil a smile flickered on his mouth and was decorously subdued it was sheltons turn to walk about  if she marries again he repeated to himself  mr paramor was a keen fisherman he watched his nephew as he might have watched a fish he had just landed  its very usual he remarked  shelton took another turn  she forfeits thought he exactly  when he was dead he would have no other way of seeing that she continued to belong to him exactly  mr paramors haunting eyes were fastened on his nephews face  well my dear they seemed to say what s the matter  exactly why should she have his money if she married again she would forfeit it there was comfort in the thought shelton came back and carefully reread the clause to put the thing on a purely business basis and disguise the real significance of what was passing in his mind  if i die and she marries again he repeated aloud she forfeits  what wiser provision for a man passionately in love could possibly have been devised his uncles eye travelled beyond him humanely turning from the last despairing wriggles of his fish  i dont want to tie her said shelton suddenly  the corners of mr paramours mouth flew up  you want the forfeiture out he asked  the blood rushed into sheltons face he felt he had been detected in a piece of sentiment  yees he stammered  sure  quite the answer was a little sulky  her uncles pencil descended on the clause and he resumed the reading of the draft but shelton could not follow it he was too much occupied in considering exactly why mr paramor had been amused and to do this he was obliged to keep his eyes upon him those features just pleasantly rugged the springy poise of the figure the hair neither straight nor curly neither short nor long the haunting look of his eyes and the humorous look of his mouth his clothes neither shabby nor dandified his serviceable fine hands above all the equability of the hovering blue pencil conveyed the impression of a perfect balance between heart and head sensibility and reason theory and its opposite  during coverture quoted mr paramor pausing again you understand of course if you dont get on and separate she goes on taking  if they didnt get on shelton smiled mr paramor did not smile and again shelton had the sense of having knocked up against something poised but firm he remarked irritably  if we re not living together all the more reason for her having it  this time his uncle smiled it was difficult for shelton to feel angry at that ironic merriment with its sudden ending it was too impersonal to irritate it was too concerned with human nature  ifhumit came to the other thing said mr paramor the settlements at an end as far as she s concerned we re bound to look at every case you know old boy  the memory of the play and his conversation with halidome was still strong in shelton he was not one of those who could not face the notion of transferred affectionsat a safe distance  all right uncle ted said he for one mad moment he was attacked by the desire to throw in the case of divorce would it not be common chivalry to make her independent able to change her affections if she wished unhampered by monetary troubles you only needed to take out the words during coverture  almost anxiously he looked into his uncles face there was no meanness there but neither was there encouragement in that comprehensive brow with its wide sweep of hair quixotism it seemed to say has merits but the room too with its wide horizon and tall windows looking as if it dealt habitually in commonsense discouraged him innumerable men of breeding and the soundest principles must have bought their wives in here it was perfumed with the atmosphere of wisdom and lawcalf the aroma of precedent was strong shelton swerved his lance and once more settled down to complete the purchase of his wife  i cant conceive what yourein such a hurry for you re not going to be married till the autumn said mr paramor finishing at last  replacing the blue pencil in the rack he took the red rose from the glass and sniffed at it will you come with me as far as pall mall i m going to take an afternoon off too cold for lords i suppose  they walked into the strand  have you seen this new play of borogroves asked shelton as they passed the theatre to which he had been with halidome  i never go to modern plays replied mr paramor too dd gloomy  shelton glanced at him he wore his hat rather far back on his head his eyes haunted the street in front he had shouldered his umbrella  psychology s not in your line uncle ted  is that what they call putting into words things that cant be put in words  the french succeed in doing it replied shelton and the russians why should nt we  mr paramor stopped to look in at a fishmongers  whats right for the french and russians dick he said is wrong for us when we begin to be real we only really begin to be false i should like to have had the catching of that fellow lets send him to your mother he went in and bought a salmon  now my dear he continued as they went on do you tell me that its decent for men and women on the stage to writhe about like eels is nt life bad enough already  it suddenly struck shelton that for all his smile his uncles face had a look of crucifixion it was perhaps only the stronger sunlight in the open spaces of trafalgar square  i dont know he said i think i prefer the truth  bad endings and the rest said mr paramor pausing under one of nelsons lions and taking shelton by a button truth s the very devil  he stood there very straight his eyes haunting his nephews face there seemed to shelton a touching muddle in his optimisma muddle of tenderness and of intolerance of truth and secondhandedness like the lion above him he seemed to be defying life to make him look at her  no my dear he said handing sixpence to a sweeper feelings are snakes only fit to be kept in bottles with tight corks you wont come to my club well goodbye old boy my love to your mother when you see her and turning up the square he left shelton to go on to his own club feeling that he had parted not from his uncle but from the nation of which they were both members by birth and blood and education     chapter vii  the club  he went into the library of his club and took up burkes peerage the words his uncle had said to him on hearing his engagement had been these dennant are those the holm oaks dennants she was a penguin  no one who knew mr paramor connected him with snobbery but there had been an ah that s right this is due to us tone about the saying  shelton hunted for the name of baltimore charles penguin fifth baron baltimore issue alice b 184 m 186algernon dennant esq of holm oaks cross eaton oxfordshire he put down the peerage and took up the landed gentry dennant algernon cuffe eldest son of the late algernon cuffe dennant esq j p and irene 2nd daur of the honble philip and lady lillian march mallow ed eton and ch ch oxford j p for oxfordshire residence holm oaks etc etc dropping the landed gentry he took up a volume of the arabian nights which some member had left reposing on the bookrest of his chair but instead of reading he kept looking round the room in almost every seat reading or snoozing were gentlemen who in their own estimation might have married penguins for the first time it struck him with what majestic leisureliness they turned the pages of their books trifled with their teacups or lightly snored yet no two were alikea tall manwith dark moustache thick hair and red smooth cheeks another bald with stooping shoulders a tremendous old buck with a grey pointed beard and large white waistcoat a cleanshaven dapper man past middle age whose face was like a birds a long sallow misanthrope and a sanguine creature fast asleep asleep or awake reading or snoring fat or thin hairy or bald the insulation of their red or pale faces was complete they were all the creatures of good form staring at them or reading the arabian nights shelton spent the time before dinner he had not been long seated in the diningroom when a distant connection strolled up and took the next table  ah shelton back somebody told me you were goin round the world he scrutinised the menu through his eyeglass clear soup    read jellabys speech amusing the way he squashes all those fellows best man in the house he really is  shelton paused in the assimilation of asparagus he too had been in the habit of admiring jellaby but now he wondered why the red and shaven face beside him above a broad pure shirtfront was swollen by good humour his small very usual and hard eyes were fixed introspectively on the successful process of his eating  success thought shelton suddenly enlightenedsuccess is what we admire in jellaby we all want success     yes he admitted a successful beast  oh said his neighbour i forgot youre in the other camp  not particularly where did you get that idea  his neighbour looked round negligently  oh said he i somehow thought so and shelton almost heard him adding theres something not quite sound about you  why do you admire jellaby he asked  knows his own mind replied his neighbour it s more than the others do     this whitebait is nt fit for cats clever fellow jellaby no nonsense about him have you ever heard him speak awful good sport to watch him sittin on the opposition a poor lot they are and he laughed either from appreciation of jellaby sitting on a small minority or from appreciation of the champagne bubbles in his glass  minorities are always depressing said shelton dryly  eh what  i mean said shelton its irritating to look at people who have nt a chance of successfellows who make a mess of things fanatics and all that  his neighbour turned his eyes inquisitively  eryes quite said he dont you take mint sauce its the best part of lamb i always think  the great room with its countless little tables arranged so that every man might have the support of the gold walls to his back began to regain its influence on shelton how many times had he not sat there carefully nodding to acquaintances happy if he got the table he was used to a paper with the latest racing and someone to gossip with who was not a bounder while the sensation of having drunk enough stole over him happy that is happy as a horse is happy who never leaves his stall  look at poor little bing puffin about said his neighbour pointing to a weazened hunchy waiter his asthmas awfly bad you can hear him wheezin from the street  he seemed amused  there s no such thing as moral asthma i suppose said shelton  his neighbour dropped his eyeglass  here take this away its overdone said he bring me some lamb  shelton pushed his table back  goodnight he said the stiltons excellent  his neighbour raised his brows and dropped his eyes again upon his plate  in the hall shelton went from force of habit to the weighingscales and took his weight eleven stone he thought gone up and clipping a cigar he sat down in the smokingroom with a novel  after half an hour he dropped the book there seemed something rather fatuous about this story for though it had a thrilling plot and was full of wellconnected people it had apparently been contrived to throw no light on anything whatever he looked at the authors name everyone was highly recommending it he began thinking and staring at the fire  looking up he saw antonias second brother a young man in the rifles bending over him with sunny cheeks and lazy smile clearly just a little drunk  congratulate you old chap i say what made you grow that bbeastly beard  shelton grinned  pillbottle of the duchess read young dennant taking up the book you been reading that rippin is nt it  oh ripping replied shelton  rippin plot when you get hold of a novel you dont want any rot aboutwhat dyou call itpsychology you want to be amused  rather murmured shelton  thats an awfully good bit where the president steals her diamonds theres old benjy hallo benjy  hallo bill old man  this benjy was a young cleanshaven creature whose face and voice and manner were a perfect blend of steel and geniality  in addition to this young man who was so smooth and hard and cheery a grey shortbearded gentleman with misanthropic eyes called stroud came up together with another man of sheltons age with a moustache and a bald patch the size of a crownpiece who might be seen in the club any night of the year when there was no racing out of reach of london  you know began young dennant that this bounderhe slapped the young man benjy on the kneeis going to be spliced tomorrow miss casserolyou know the casserolsmuncaster gate  by jove said shelton delighted to be able to say something they would understand  young champions the best man and i m the second best i tell you what old chap you d better come with me and get your eye in you wont get such another chance of practice benjy ll give you a card  delighted murmured benjy  where is it  st briabas twothirty come and see how they do the trick ill call for you at one well have some lunch and go together again he patted benjys knee  shelton nodded his assent the piquant callousness of the affair had made him shiver and furtively he eyed the steely benjy whose suavity had never wavered and who appeared to take a greater interest in some approaching race than in his coming marriage but shelton knew from his own sensations that this could not really be the case it was merely a question of good form the conceit of a superior breeding the duty not to give oneself away and when in turn he marked the eyes of stroud fixed on benjy under shaggy brows and the curious greedy glances of the racing man he felt somehow sorry for him  who s that fellow with the game legim always seeing him about asked the racing man  and shelton saw a sallow man conspicuous for a want of parting in his hair and a certain restlessness of attitude  his name is bayes said stroud spends half his time among the chinesemust have a grudge against them and now he s got his leg he cant go there any more  chinese what does he do to them  bibles or guns dont ask me an adventurer  looks a bit of a bounder said the racing man  shelton gazed at the twitching eyebrows of old stroud he saw at once how it must annoy a man who had a billet in the woods and forests and plenty of time for bridge and gossip at his club to see these people with untidy lives a minute later the man with the game leg passed close behind his chair and shelton perceived at once how intelligible the resentment of his fellowmembers was he had eyes which not uncommon in this country looked like fires behind steel bars he seemed the very kind of man to do all sorts of things that were bad form a man who might even go as far as chivalry he looked straight at shelton and his uncompromising glance gave an impression of fierce loneliness altogether an improper person to belong to such a club shelton remembered the words of an old friend of his fathers yes dick all sorts of fellows belong here and they come here for all sorts o reasons and a lot of em come because theyve nowhere else to go poor beggars and glancing from the man with the game leg to stroud it occurred to shelton that even he old stroud might be one of these poor beggars one never knew a look at benjy contained and cheery restored him ah the lucky devil he would not have to come here any more and the thought of the last evening he himself would be spending before long flooded his mind with a sweetness that was almost pain  benjy ill play you a hundred up said young bill dennant  stroud and the racing man went to watch the game shelton was left once more to reverie  good form thought he that fellow must be made of steel theyll go on somewhere stick about half the night playing poker or some such foolery  he crossed over to the window rain had begun to fall the streets looked wild and draughty the cabmen were putting on their coats two women scurried by huddled under one umbrella and a thinclothed doggedlooking scarecrow lounged past with a surly desperate step shelton returning to his chair threaded his way amongst his fellowmembers a procession of old school and college friends came up before his eyes after all what had there been in his own education or theirs to give them any other standard than this good form what had there been to teach them anything of life their imbecility was incredible when you came to think of it they had all the air of knowing everything and really they knew nothingnothing of nature art or the emotions nothing of the bonds that bind all men together why even such words were not good form nothing outside their little circle was good form they had a fixed point of view over life because they came of certain schools and colleges and regiments and they were those in charge of the state of laws and science of the army and religion well it was their systemthe system not to start too young to form healthy fibre and let the afterlife develop it  successful he thought nearly stumbling over a pair of patentleather boots belonging to a moonfaced geniallooking member with gold nosenippers oh it s successful  somebody came and picked up from the table the very volume which had originally inspired this train of thought and shelton could see his solemn pleasure as he read in the white of his eye there was a torpid and composed abstraction there was nothing in that book to startle him or make him think  the moonfaced member with the patent boots came up and began talking of his recent visit to the south of france he had a scandalous anecdote or two to tell and his broad face beamed behind his gold nosenippers he was a large man with such a store of easy worldly humour that it was impossible not to appreciate his gossip he gave so perfect an impression of enjoying life and doing himself well well goodnight he murmuredan engagementand the certainty he left behind that his engagement must be charming and illicit was pleasant to the soul  and slowly taking up his glass shelton drank the sense of wellbeing was upon him his superiority to these his fellowmembers soothed him he saw through all the sham of this club life the meanness of this worship of success the sham of kidgloved novelists good form and the terrific decency of our education it was soothing thus to see through things soothing thus to be superior and from the soft recesses of his chair he puffed out smoke and stretched his limbs toward the fire and the fire burned back at him with a discreet and venerable glow     chapter viii  the wedding  punctual to his word bill dennant called for shelton at one oclock  i bet old benjys feeling a bit cheap said he as they got out of their cab at the church door and passed between the crowded files of unelect whose eyes so curious and pitiful devoured them from the pavement  the ashen face of a woman with a baby in her arms and two more by her side looked as eager as if she had never experienced the pangs of ragged matrimony shelton went in inexplicably uneasy the price of his tie was their board and lodging for a week he followed his future brotherinlaw to a pew on the bridegrooms side for with intuitive perception of the sexes endless warfare each of the opposing parties to this contract had its serried battalion the arrows of whose suspicion kept glancing across and across the central aisle  bill dennants eyes began to twinkle  theres old benjy he whispered and shelton looked at the hero of the day a subdued pallor was traceable under the weathered uniformity of his shaven face but the wellbred artificial smile he bent upon the guests had its wonted steely suavity about his dress and his neat figure was that studied ease which lifts men from the ruck of common bridegrooms there were no holes in his armour through which the impertinent might pry  good old benjy whispered young dennant i say they look a bit short of class those casserols  shelton who was acquainted with this family smiled the sensuous sanctity all round had begun to influence him a perfume of flowers and dresses fought with the natural odour of the church the rustle of whisperings and skirts struck through the native silence of the aisles and shelton idly fixed his eyes on a lady in the pew in front without in the least desiring to make a speculation of this sort he wondered whether her face was as charming as the lines of her back in their delicate skintight setting of pearl grey his glance wandered to the chancel with its stacks of flowers to the grave business faces of the presiding priests till the organ began rolling out the wedding march  theyre off whispered young dermant  shelton was conscious of a shiver running through the audience which reminded him of a bullfight he had seen in spain the bride came slowly up the aisle antonia will look like that he thought and the church will be filled with people like this     shell be a show to them the bride was opposite him now and by an instinct of common chivalry he turned away his eyes it seemed to him a shame to look at that downcast head above the silver mystery of her perfect raiment the modest head full doubtless of devotion and pure yearnings the stately head where no such thought as how am i looking this day of all days before all london had ever entered the proud head which no such fear as how am i carrying it off could surely be besmirching  he saw below the surface of this drama played before his eyes and set his face as a man might who found himself assisting at a sacrifice the words fell unrelenting on his ears for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health and opening the prayer book he found the marriage service which he had not looked at since he was a boy and as he read he had some very curious sensations  all this would soon be happening to himself he went on reading in a kind of stupor until aroused by his companion whispering no luck all around there rose a rustling of skirts he saw a tall figure mount the pulpit and stand motionless massive and highfeatured sunken of eye he towered in snowy cambric and a crimson stole above the blackness of his rostrum it seemed he had been chosen for his beauty shelton was still gazing at the stitching of his gloves when once again the organ played the wedding march all were smiling and a few were weeping craning their heads towards the bride carnival of secondhand emotions thought shelton and he too craned his head and brushed his hat then smirking at his friends he made his way towards the door  in the casserols house he found himself at last going round the presents with the eldest casserol surviving a tall girl in pale violet who had been chief bridesmaid  did nt it go off well mr shelton she was saying  oh awfully  i always think its so awkward for the man waiting up there for the bride to come  yes murmured shelton  dont you think its smart the bridesmaids having no hats  shelton had not noticed this improvement but he agreed  that was my idea i think it s very chic they ve had fifteen teasetsso dull is nt it  by jove shelton hastened to remark  oh its fearfully useful to have a lot of things you dont want of course you change them for those you do  the whole of london seemed to have disgorged its shops into this room he looked at miss casserols face and was greatly struck by the shrewd acquisitiveness of her small eyes  is that your future brotherinlaw she asked pointing to bill dennant with a little movement of her chin i think hes such a bright boy i want you both to come to dinner and help to keep things jolly its so deadly after a wedding  and shelton said they would  they adjourned to the hall now to wait for the brides departure her face as she came down the stairs was impassive gay with a furtive trouble in the eyes and once more shelton had the odd sensation of having sinned against his manhood jammed close to him was her old nurse whose puffy yellow face was pouting with emotion while tears rolled from her eyes she was trying to say something but in the hubbub her farewell was lost there was a scamper to the carriage a flurry of rice and flowers the shoe was flung against the sharply drawnup window then benjys shaven face was seen a moment bland and steely the footman folded his arms and with a solemn crunch the brougham wheels rolled away how splendidly it went off said a voice on sheltons right she looked a little pale said a voice on sheltons left he put his hand up to his forehead behind him the old nurse sniffed  dick said young dennant in his ear this isnt good enough i vote we bolt  shelton assenting they walked towards the park nor could he tell whether the slight nausea he experienced was due to afternoon champagne or to the ceremony that had gone so well  whats up with you asked dennant you look as glum as any mmonkey  nothing said shelton i was only thinking what humbugs we all are  bill dennant stopped in the middle of the crossing and clapped his future brotherinlaw upon the shoulder  oh said he if youre going to talk shop i m off     chapter ix  the dinner  the dinner at the casserols was given to those of the brides friends who had been conspicuous in the days festivities shelton found himself between miss casserol and a lady undressed to much the same degree opposite sat a man with a single diamond stud a white waistcoat black moustache and hawklike face this was in fact one of those interesting houses occupied by people of the upper middle class who have imbibed a taste for smart society its inhabitants by nature acquisitive and cautious economical tenacious had learnt to worship the word smart the result was a kind of heavy froth an air of thoroughly domestic vice in addition to the conventionally fast shelton had met there one or two ladies who having been divorced or having yet to be still maintained their position in society divorced ladies who did not so maintain their place were never to be found for the casserols had a great respect for marriage he had also met there american ladies who were too amusingnever of course american men mesopotamians of the financial or the racing type and several of those gentlemen who had been or were about to be engaged in a transaction which might or again might not come off and in conduct of an order which might or again might not be spotted the line he knew was always drawn at those in any category who were actually found out for the value of these ladies and these gentlemen was not their claim to pitynothing so sentimentalbut their smartness clothes jokes racing tips their bridge parties and their motors  in sum the house was one whose fundamental domesticity attracted and sheltered those who were too smart to keep their heads for long above the water  his host a grey cleanshaven city man with a long upper lip was trying to understand a lady the audacity of whose speech came ringing down the table shelton himself had given up the effort with his neighbours and made love to his dinner which surviving the incoherence of the atmosphere emerged as a work of art it was with surprise that he found miss casserol addressing him  i always say that the great thing is to be jolly if you cant find anything to make you laugh pretend you do its so much smarter to be amusin now dont you agree  the philosophy seemed excellent  we cant all be geniuses but we can all look jolly  shelton hastened to look jolly  i tell the governor when he s glum that i shall put up the shutters and leave him whats the good of mopin and lookin miserable are you going to the fourinhand meet were making a party such fun all the smart people  the splendour of her shoulders her frizzy hair clearly not two hours out of the barbers hands might have made him doubtful but the frank shrewdness in her eyes and her carefully clipped tone of voice were guarantees that she was part of the element at the table which was really quite respectable he had never realised before how smart she was and with an effort abandoned himself to a sort of gaiety that would have killed a frenchman  and when she left him he reflected upon the expression of her eyes when they rested on a lady opposite who was a true birdofprey what is it their envious inquisitive glance had seemed to say that makes you so really smart and while still seeking for the reason he noticed his host pointing out the merits of his port to the hawklike man with a deferential air quite pitiful to see for the hawklike man was clearly a bad hat what in the name of goodness did these staid bourgeois mean by making up to vice was it a craving to be thought distinguished a dread of being dull or merely an effect of overfeeding again he looked at his host who had not yet enumerated all the virtues of his port and again felt sorry for him  so youre going to marry antonia dennant said a voice on his right with that easy coarseness which is a mark of caste pretty girl theyve a nice place the dennants d ye know youre a lucky feller  the speaker was an old baronet with small eyes a dusky ruddy face and peculiar hailfellowwellmet expression at once morose and sly he was always hard up but being a man of enterprise knew all the best people as well as all the worst so that he dined out every night  youre a lucky feller he repeated hes got some deuced good shootin dennant they come too high for me though never touched a feather last time i shot there shes a pretty girl you re a lucky feller  i know that said shelton humbly  wish i were in your shoes who was that sittin on the other side of you im so dashed shortsighted mrs carruther oh ay an expression which if he had not been a baronet would have been a leer came on his lips  shelton felt that he was referring to the leaf in his mental pocketbook covered with the anecdotes figures and facts about that lady the old ogre means thought he that im lucky because his leaf is blank about antonia but the old baronet had turned with his smile and his sardonic wellbred air to listen to a bit of scandal on the other side  the two men to sheltons left were talking  what you dont collect anything hows that everybody collects something i should be lost without my pictures  no i dont collect anything given it up i was too awfully had over my walkers  shelton had expected a more lofty reason he applied himself to the madeira in his glass that had been collected by his host and its price was going up you couldnt get it every day worth two guineas a bottle how precious the idea that other people couldnt get it made it seem liquid delight the price was going up soon there would be none left immense absolutely no one then could drink it  wish i had some of this said the old baronet but i have drunk all mine  poor old chap thought shelton after all hes not a bad old boy i wish i had his pluck his liver must be splendid  the drawingroom was full of people playing a game concerned with horses ridden by jockeys with the latest seat and shelton was compelled to help in carrying on this sport till early in the morning at last he left exhausted by his animation  he thought of the wedding he thought over his dinner and the wine that he had drunk his mood of satisfaction fizzled out these people were incapable of being real even the smartest even the most respectable they seemed to weigh their pleasures in the scales and to get the most that could be gotten for their money  between the dark safe houses stretching for miles and miles his thoughts were of antonia and as he reached his rooms he was overtaken by the moment when the town is born again the first new air had stolen down the sky was living but not yet alight the trees were quivering faintly no living creature stirred and nothing spoke except his heart suddenly the city seemed to breathe and shelton saw that he was not alone an unconsidered trifle with inferior boots was asleep upon his doorstep     chapter x  an alien  the individual on the doorstep had fallen into slumber over his own knees no greater air of prosperity clung about him than is conveyed by a rusty overcoat and wisps of cloth in place of socks shelton endeavoured to pass unseen but the sleeper woke  ah its you monsieur he said i received your letter this evening and have lost no time he looked down at himself and tittered as though to say but what a state i m in  the young foreigners condition was indeed more desperate than on the occasion of their first meeting and shelton invited him upstairs  you can well understand stammered ferrand following his host that i did nt want to miss you this time when one is like this and a spasm gripped his face  i m very glad you came said shelton doubtfully  his visitors face had a weeks growth of reddish beard the deep tan of his cheeks gave him a robust appearance at variance with the fit of trembling which had seized on him as soon as he had entered  sit downsit down said shelton you re feeling ill  ferrand smiled its nothing said he bad nourishment  shelton left him seated on the edge of an armchair and brought him in some whisky  clothes said ferrand when he had drunk are what i want these are really not good enough  the statement was correct and shelton placing some garments in the bathroom invited his visitor to make himself at home while the latter then was doing this shelton enjoyed the luxuries of selfdenial hunting up things he did not want and laying them in two portmanteaus this done he waited for his visitors return  the young foreigner at length emerged unshaved indeed and innocent of boots but having in other respects an air of gratifying affluence  this is a little different he said the boots i fearand pulling down his or rather sheltons socks he exhibited sores the size of half a crown one does nt sow without reaping some harvest or another my stomach has shrunk he added simply to see things one must suffer voyager cest plus fort que moi  shelton failed to perceive that this was one way of disguising the human animals natural dislike of workthere was a touch of pathos a suggestion of godknowswhatmighthavebeen about this fellow  i have eaten my illusions said the young foreigner smoking a cigarette when youve starved a few times your eyes are opened savoir cest mon metier mais remarquez ceci monsieur it s not always the intellectuals who succeed  when you get a job said shelton you throw it away i suppose  you accuse me of restlessness shall i explain what i think about that im restless because of ambition i want to reconquer an independent position i put all my soul into my trials but as soon as i see theres no future for me in that line i give it up and go elsewhere je ne veux pas etre rond de cuir breaking my back to economise sixpence a day and save enough after forty years to drag out the remains of an exhausted existence thats not in my character this ingenious paraphrase of the words i soon get tired of things he pronounced with an air of letting shelton into a precious secret  yes it must be hard agreed the latter  ferrand shrugged his shoulders  its not all butter he replied one is obliged to do things that are not too delicate theres nothing i pride myself on but frankness  like a good chemist however he administered what shelton could stand in a judicious way yes yes he seemed to say youd like me to think that you have a perfect knowledge of life no morality no prejudices no illusions youd like me to think that you feel yourself on an equality with me one human animal talking to another without any barriers of position money clothes or the restca cest un peu trop fort youre as good an imitation as i ve come across in your class notwithstanding your unfortunate education and i m grateful to you but to tell you everything as it passes through my mind would damage my prospects you can hardly expect that  in one of sheltons old frockcoats he was impressive with his air of natural almost sensitive refinement the room looked as if it were accustomed to him and more amazing still was the sense of familiarity that he inspired as though he were a part of sheltons soul it came as a shock to realise that this young foreign vagabond had taken such a place within his thoughts the pose of his limbs and head irregular but not ungraceful his disillusioned lips the rings of smoke that issued from themall signified rebellion and the overthrow of law and order his thin lopsided nose the rapid glances of his goggling prominent eyes were subtlety itself he stood for discontent with the accepted  how do i live when i am on the tramp he said well there are the consuls the system is not delicate but when its a question of starving much is permissible besides these gentlemen were created for the purpose theres a coterie of german jews in paris living entirely upon consuls he hesitated for the fraction of a second and resumed yes monsieur if you have papers that fit you you can try six or seven consuls in a single town you must know a language or two but most of these gentlemen are not too well up in the tongues of the country they represent obtaining money under false pretences well it is but whats the difference at bottom between all this honourable crowd of directors fashionable physicians employers of labour ferrybuilders military men country priests and consuls themselves perhaps who take money and give no value for it and poor devils who do the same at far greater risk necessity makes the law if those gentlemen were in my position do you think that they would hesitate  sheltons face remaining doubtful ferrand went on instantly youre right they would from fear not principle one must be hard pressed before committing these indelicacies look deep enough and you will see what indelicate things are daily done by the respectable for not half so good a reason as the want of meals  shelton also took a cigarettehis own income was derived from property for which he gave no value in labour  i can give you an instance said ferrand of what can be done by resolution one day in a german town etant dans la misere i decided to try the french consul well as you know i am a fleming but something had to be screwed out somewhere he refused to see me i sat down to wait after about two hours a voice bellowed has nt the brute gone and my consul appears i ve nothing for fellows like you says he clear out  monsieur i answered i am skin and bone i really must have assistance  clear out he says or the police shall throw you out  i dont budge another hour passes and back he comes again  still here says he fetch a sergeant  the sergeant comes  sergeant says the consul turn this creature out  sergeant i say this house is france naturally i had calculated upon that in germany theyre not too fond of those who undertake the business of the french  he is right says the sergeant i can do nothing  you refuse  absolutely and he went away  what do you think youll get by staying says my consul  i have nothing to eat or drink and nowhere to sleep says i  what will you go for  ten marks  here then get out i can tell you monsieur one must nt have a thin skin if one wants to exploit consuls  his yellow fingers slowly rolled the stump of his cigarette his ironical lips flickered shelton thought of his own ignorance of life he could not recollect ever having gone without a meal  i suppose he said feebly youve often starved for having always been so well fed the idea of starvation was attractive  ferrand smiled  four days is the longest said he you wont believe that story it was in paris and i had lost my money on the racecourse there was some due from home which didnt come four days and nights i lived on water my clothes were excellent and i had jewellery but i never even thought of pawning them i suffered most from the notion that people might guess my state you dont recognise me now  how old were you then said shelton  seventeen its curious what ones like at that age  by a flash of insight shelton saw the welldressed boy with sensitive smooth face always on the move about the streets of paris for fear that people should observe the condition of his stomach the story was a valuable commentary his thoughts were brusquely interrupted looking in ferrands face he saw to his dismay tears rolling down his cheeks  i ve suffered too much he stammered what do i care now what becomes of me  shelton was disconcerted he wished to say something sympathetic but being an englishman could only turn away his eyes  your turn s coming he said at last  ah when youve lived my life broke out his visitor nothing s any good my hearts in rags find me anything worth keeping in this menagerie  moved though he was shelton wriggled in his chair a prey to racial instinct to an ingrained overtenderness perhaps of soul that forbade him from exposing his emotions and recoiled from the revelation of other peoples he could stand it on the stage he could stand it in a book but in real life he could not stand it when ferrand had gone off with a portmanteau in each hand he sat down and told antonia     the poor chap broke down and sat crying like a child and instead of making me feel sorry it turned me into stone the more sympathetic i wanted to be the gruffer i grew is it fear of ridicule independence or consideration for others that prevents one from showing ones feelings  he went on to tell her of ferrands starving four days sooner than face a pawnbroker and reading the letter over before addressing it the faces of the three ladies round their snowy cloth arose before himantonias face so fair and calm and windfresh her mothers face a little creased by time and weather the maiden aunts somewhat too thinand they seemed to lean at him alert and decorous and the words thats rather nice rang in his ears he went out to post the letter and buying a fiveshilling order enclosed it to the little barber carolan as a reward for delivering his note to ferrand he omitted to send his address with this donation but whether from delicacy or from caution he could not have said beyond doubt however on receiving through ferrand the following reply he felt ashamed and pleased   3 blank row westminster  from every wellborn soul humanity is owing a thousand thanks i received this morning your postal order your heart henceforth for me will be placed beyond all praise  j carolan     chapter xi  the vision  a few days later he received a letter from antonia which filled him with excitement      aunt charlotte is ever so much better so mother thinks we can go homehurrah but she says that you and i must keep to our arrangement not to see each other till july there will be something fine in being so near and having the strength to keep apart    all the english are gone i feel it so empty out here these people are so funnyall foreign and shallow oh dick how splendid to have an ideal to look up to write at once to brewers hotel and tell me you think the same we arrive at charing cross on sunday at halfpast seven stay at brewers for a couple of nights and go down on tuesday to holm oaks  always your  antonia   tomorrow he thought shes coming tomorrow and leaving his neglected breakfast he started out to walk off his emotion his square ran into one of those slums that still rub shoulders with the most distinguished situations and in it he came upon a little crowd assembled round a dogfight one of the dogs was being mauled but the day was muddy and shelton like any wellbred englishman had a horror of making himself conspicuous even in a decent cause he looked for a policeman one was standing by to see fair play and shelton made appeal to him the official suggested that he should not have brought out a fighting dog and advised him to throw cold water over them  it is n t my dog said shelton  then i should let em be remarked the policeman with evident surprise  shelton appealed indefinitely to the lower orders the lower orders however were afraid of being bitten  i would nt meddle with that there job if i was you said one  nasty breed o dawg is that  he was therefore obliged to cast away respectability spoil his trousers and his gloves break his umbrella drop his hat in the mud and separate the dogs at the conclusion of the job the lower orders said to him in a rather shamefaced spanner  well i never thought youd have managed that sir but like all men of inaction shelton after action was more dangerous  dn it he said one cant let a dog be killed and he marched off towing the injured dog with his pockethandkerchief and looking scornfully at harmless passersby having satisfied for once the smouldering fires within him he felt entitled to hold a low opinion of these men in the street the brutes he thought wont stir a finger to save a poor dumb creature and as for policemen but growing cooler he began to see that people weighted down by honest toil could not afford to tear their trousers or get a bitten hand and that even the policeman though he had looked so like a demigod was absolutely made of flesh and blood he took the dog home and sending for a vet had him sewn up  he was already tortured by the doubt whether or no he might venture to meet antonia at the station and after sending his servant with the dog to the address marked on its collar he formed the resolve to go and see his mother with some vague notion that she might help him to decide she lived in kensington and crossing the brompton road he was soon amongst that maze of houses into the fibre of whose structure architects have wrought the motto keep what you havewives money a good address and all the blessings of a moral state  shelton pondered as he passed house after house of such intense respectability that even dogs were known to bark at them his blood was still too hot it is amazing what incidents will promote the loftiest philosophy he had been reading in his favourite review an article eulogising the freedom and expansion which had made the upper middle class so fine a body and with eyes wandering from side to side he nodded his head ironically expansion and freedom ran his thoughts freedom and expansion  each housefront was cold and formal the shell of an owner with from three to five thousand pounds a year and each one was armoured against the opinion of its neighbours by a sort of daring regularity conscious of my rectitude and by the strict observance of exactly what is necessary and no more i am enabled to hold my head up in the world the person who lives in me has only four thousand two hundred and fiftyfive pounds each year after allowing for the income tax such seemed the legend of these houses  shelton passed ladies in ones and twos and threes going out shopping or to classes of drawing cooking ambulance hardly any men were seen and they were mostly policemen but a few disillusioned children were being wheeled towards the park by freshcheeked nurses accompanied by a great army of hairy or of hairless dogs  there was something of her brothers large liberality about mrs shelton a tiny lady with affectionate eyes warm cheeks and chilly feet fond as a cat of a chair by the fire and full of the sympathy that has no insight she kissed her son at once with rapture and as usual began to talk of his engagement for the first time a tremor of doubt ran through her son his mothers view of it grated on him like the sight of a bluepink dress it was too rosy her splendid optimism damped him it had too little traffic with the reasoning powers  what right he asked himself has she to be so certain it seems to me a kind of blasphemy  the dear she cooed and she is coming back tomorrow hurrah how i long to see her  but you know mother weve agreed not to meet again until july  mrs shelton rocked her foot and holding her head on one side like a little bird looked at her son with shining eyes  dear old dick she said how happy you must be  half a century of sympathy with weddings of all sortsgood bad indifferentbeamed from her  i suppose said shelton gloomily i ought not to go and see her at the station  cheer up replied the mother and her son felt dreadfully depressed  that cheerupthe panacea which had carried her blind and bright through every evilwas as void of meaning to him as wine without a flavour  and how is your sciatica he asked  oh pretty bad returned his mother i expect its all right really cheer up she stretched her little figure canting her head still more  wonderful woman shelton thought she had in fact like many of her fellowcountrymen mislaid the darker side of things and enjoying the benefits of orthodoxy with an easy conscience had kept as young in heart as any girl of thirty  shelton left her house as doubtful whether he might meet antonia as when he entered it he spent a restless afternoon  the next daythat of her arrivalwas a sunday he had made ferrand a promise to go with him to hear a sermon in the slums and catching at any diversion which might allay excitement he fulfilled it the preacher in questionan amateur so ferrand told himhad an original method of distributing the funds that he obtained to male sheep he gave nothing to ugly female sheep a very little to pretty female sheep the rest ferrand hazarded an inference but he was a foreigner the englishman preferred to look upon the preacher as guided by a purely abstract love of beauty his eloquence at any rate was unquestionable and shelton came out feeling sick  it was not yet seven oclock so entering an italian restaurant to kill the halfhour before antonias arrival he ordered a bottle of wine for his companion a cup of coffee for himself and lighting a cigarette compressed his lips there was a strange sweet sinking in his heart his companion ignorant of this emotion drank his wine crumbled his roll and blew smoke through his nostrils glancing caustically at the rows of little tables the cheap mirrors the hot red velvet the chandeliers his juicy lips seemed to be murmuring ah if you only knew of the dirt behind these feathers shelton watched him with disgust though his clothes were now so nice his nails were not quite clean and his fingertips seemed yellow to the bone an anaemic waiter in a shirt some four days old with greasespots on his garments and a crumpled napkin on his arm stood leaning an elbow amongst doubtful fruits and reading an italian journal resting his tired feet in turn he looked like overwork personified and when he moved each limb accused the sordid smartness of the walls in the far corner sat a lady eating and mirrored opposite her feathered hat her short round face its coat of powder and dark eyes gave shelton a shiver of disgust his companions gaze rested long and subtly on her  excuse me monsieur he said at length i think i know that lady and leaving his host he crossed the room bowed accosted her and sat down with pharisaic delicacy shelton refrained from looking but presently ferrand came back the lady rose and left the restaurant she had been crying the young foreigner was flushed his face contorted he did not touch his wine  i was right he said she is the wife of an old friend i used to know her well  he was suffering from emotion but someone less absorbed than shelton might have noticed a kind of relish in his voice as though he were savouring lifes dishes and glad to have something new and spiced with tragic sauce to set before his patron  you can find her story by the hundred in your streets but nothing hinders these paragons of virtuehe nodded at the stream of carriagesfrom turning up their eyes when they see ladies of her sort pass she came to londonjust three years ago after a year one of her little boys took feverthe shop was avoidedher husband caught it and died there she was left with two children and everything gone to pay the debts she tried to get work no one helped her there was no money to pay anyone to stay with the children all the work she could get in the house was not enough to keep them alive shes not a strong woman well she put the children out to nurse and went to the streets the first week was frightful but now shes used to itone gets used to anything  can nothing be done asked shelton startled  no returned his companion i know that sort if they once take to it alls over they get used to luxury one does nt part with luxury after tasting destitution she tells me she does very nicely the children are happy shes able to pay well and see them sometimes she was a girl of good family too who loved her husband and gave up much for him what would you have three quarters of your virtuous ladies placed in her position would do the same if they had the necessary looks  it was evident that he felt the shock of this discovery and shelton understood that personal acquaintance makes a difference even in a vagabond  this is her beat said the young foreigner as they passed the illuminated crescent where nightly the shadows of hypocrites and women fall and shelton went from these comments on christianity to the station of charing cross there as he stood waiting in the shadow his heart was in his mouth and it struck him as odd that he should have come to this meeting fresh from a vagabonds society  presently amongst the stream of travellers he saw antonia she was close to her mother who was parleying with a footman behind them were a maid carrying a bandbox and a porter with the travellingbags antonias figure with its throat settled in the collar of her cape slender tall severe looked impatient and remote amongst the bustle her eyes shadowed by the journey glanced eagerly about welcoming all she saw a wisp of hair was loose above her ear her cheeks glowed cold and rosy she caught sight of shelton and bending her neck staglike stood looking at him a brilliant smile parted her lips and shelton trembled here was the embodiment of all he had desired for weeks he could not tell what was behind that smile of herspassionate aching or only some ideal some chaste and glacial intangibility it seemed to be shining past him into the gloomy station there was no trembling and uncertainty no rage of possession in that brilliant smile it had the gleam of fixedness like the smiling of a star what did it matter she was there beautiful as a young day and smiling at him and she was his only divided from him by a space of time he took a step her eyes fell at once her face regained aloofness he saw her encircled by mother footman maid and porter take her seat and drive away it was over she had seen him she had smiled but alongside his delight lurked another feeling and by a bitter freak not her face came up before him but the face of that lady in the restaurantshort round and powdered with blackcircled eyes what right had we to scorn them had they mothers footmen porters maids he shivered but this time with physical disgust the powdered face with darkfringed eyes had vanished the fair remote figure of the railwaystation came back again  he sat long over dinner drinking dreaming he sat long after smoking dreaming and when at length he drove away wine and dreams fumed in his brain the dance of lamps the creamcheese moon the rays of clean wet light on his horses harness the jingling of the cab bell the whirring wheels the night air and the branchesit was all so good he threw back the hansom doors to feel the touch of the warm breeze the crowds on the pavement gave him strange delight they were like shadows in some great illusion happy shadows thronging wheeling round the single figure of his world     chapter xii  rotten row  with a headache and a sense of restlessness hopeful and unhappy shelton mounted his hack next morning for a gallop in the park  in the sky was mingled all the languor and the violence of the spring the trees and flowers wore an awakened look in the gleams of light that came stealing down from behind the purple of the clouds the air was rainwashed and the passers by seemed to wear an air of tranquil carelessness as if anxiety were paralysed by their responsibility of the firmament  thronged by riders the row was all astir  near to hyde park corner a figure by the rails caught sheltons eye straight and thin one shoulder humped a little as if its owner were reflecting clothed in a frockcoat and a brown felt hat pinched up in lawless fashion this figure was so detached from its surroundings that it would have been noticeable anywhere it belonged to ferrand obviously waiting till it was time to breakfast with his patron shelton found pleasure in thus observing him unseen and sat quietly on his horse hidden behind a tree  it was just at that spot where riders unable to get further are for ever wheeling their horses for another turn and there ferrand the bird of passage with his head a little to one side watched them cantering trotting wheeling up and down  three men walking along the rails were snatching off their hats before a horsewoman at exactly the same angle and with precisely the same air as though in the modish performance of this ancient rite they were satisfying some instinct very dear to them  shelton noted the curl of ferrands lip as he watched this sight many thanks gentlemen it seemed to say in that charming little action you have shown me all your souls  what a singular gift the fellow had of divesting things and people of their garments of tearing away their veil of shams and their phylacteries shelton turned and cantered on his thoughts were with antonia and he did not want the glamour stripped away  he was glancing at the sky that every moment threatened to discharge a violent shower of rain when suddenly he heard his name called from behind and who should ride up to him on either side but bill dennant andantonia herself  they had been galloping and she was flushedflushed as when she stood on the old tower at hyeres but with a joyful radiance different from the calm and conquering radiance of that other moment to sheltons delight they fell into line with him and all three went galloping along the strip between the trees and rails the look she gave him seemed to say i dont care if it is forbidden but she did not speak he could not take his eyes off her how lovely she looked with the resolute curve of her figure the glimpse of gold under her hat the glorious colour in her cheeks as if she had been kissed  it s so splendid to be at home let s go faster faster she cried out  take a pull we shall get run in grumbled her brother with a chuckle  they reined in round the bend and jogged more soberly down on the far side still not a word from her to shelton and shelton in his turn spoke only to bill dennant he was afraid to speak to her for he knew that her mind was dwelling on this chance forbidden meeting in a way quite different from his own  approaching hyde park corner where ferrand was still standing against the rails shelton who had forgotten his existence suffered a shock when his eyes fell suddenly on that impassive figure he was about to raise his hand when he saw that the young foreigner noting his instinctive feeling had at once adapted himself to it they passed again without a greeting unless that swift inquisition followed by unconsciousness in ferrands eyes could so be called but the feeling of idiotic happiness left shelton he grew irritated at this silence it tantalised him more and more for bill dennant had lagged behind to chatter to a friend shelton and antonia were alone walking their horses without a word not even looking at each other at one moment he thought of galloping ahead and leaving her then of breaking the vow of muteness she seemed to be imposing on him and he kept thinking it ought to be either one thing or the other i cant stand this her calmness was getting on his nerves she seemed to have determined just how far she meant to go to have fixed coldbloodedly a limit in her happy young beauty and radiant coolness she summed up that sane consistent something existing in nine out of ten of the people shelton knew i cant stand it long he thought and all of a sudden spoke but as he did so she frowned and cantered on when he caught her she was smiling lifting her face to catch the raindrops which were falling fast she gave him just a nod and waved her hand as a sign for him to go and when he would not she frowned he saw bill dennant posting after them and seized by a sense of the ridiculous lifted his hat and galloped off  the rain was coming down in torrents now and every one was scurrying for shelter he looked back from the bend and could still make out antonia riding leisurely her face upturned and revelling in the shower why had nt she either cut him altogether or taken the sweets the gods had sent it seemed wicked to have wasted such a chance and ploughing back to hyde park corner he turned his head to see if by any chance she had relented  his irritation was soon gone but his longing stayed was ever anything so beautiful as she had looked with her face turned to the rain she seemed to love the rain it suited hersuited her ever so much better than the sunshine of the south yes she was very english puzzling and fretting he reached his rooms ferrand had not arrived in fact did not turn up that day his nonappearance afforded shelton another proof of the delicacy that went hand in hand with the young vagrants cynicism in the afternoon he received a note     you see dick he read i ought to have cut you but i felt too crazyeverything seems so jolly at home even this stuffy old london of course i wanted to talk to you badlythere are heaps of things one cant say by letterbut i should have been sorry afterwards i told mother she said i was quite right but i dont think she took it in dont you feel that the only thing that really matters is to have an ideal and to keep it so safe that you can always look forward and feel that you have beeni cant exactly express my meaning  shelton lit a cigarette and frowned it seemed to him queer that she should set more store by an ideal than by the fact that they had met for the first and only time in many weeks  i suppose she s right he thoughti suppose she s right i ought not to have tried to speak to her as a matter of fact he did not at all feel that she was right     chapter xiii  an at home  on tuesday morning he wandered off to paddington hoping for a chance view of her on her way down to holm oaks but the sense of the ridiculous on which he had been nurtured was strong enough to keep him from actually entering the station and lurking about until she came with a pang of disappointment he retraced his steps from praed street to the park and once there tried no further to waylay her he paid a round of calls in the afternoon mostly on her relations and seeking out aunt charlotte he dolorously related his encounter in the row but she found it rather nice and on his pressing her with his views she murmured that it was quite romantic dont you know  still its very hard said shelton and he went away disconsolate  as he was dressing for dinner his eye fell on a card announcing the at home of one of his own cousins her husband was a composer and he had a vague idea that he would find at the house of a composer some quite unusually free kind of atmosphere after dining at the club therefore he set out for chelsea the party was held in a large room on the groundfloor which was already crowded with people when shelton entered they stood or sat about in groups with smiles fixed on their lips and the light from balloonlike lamps fell in patches on their heads and hands and shoulders someone had just finished rendering on the piano a composition of his own an expert could at once have picked out from amongst the applauding company those who were musicians by profession for their eyes sparkled and a certain acidity pervaded their enthusiasm this freemasonry of professional intolerance flew from one to the other like a breath of unanimity and the faint shrugging of shoulders was as harmonious as though one of the high windows had been opened suddenly admitting a draught of chill may air  shelton made his way up to his cousina fragile greyhaired woman in black velvet and venetian lace whose starry eyes beamed at him until her duties after the custom of these social gatherings obliged her to break off conversation just as it began to interest him he was passed on to another lady who was already talking to two gentlemen and their volubility being greater than his own he fell into the position of observer instead of the profound questions he had somehow expected to hear raised everybody seemed gossiping or searching the heart of such topics as where to go this summer or how to get new servants trifling with coffeecups they dissected their fellow artists in the same way as his society friends of the other night had dissected the fellowsmart and the varnish on the floor the pictures and the piano were reflected on all the faces around shelton moved from group to group disconsolate  a tall imposing person stood under a japanese print holding the palm of one hand outspread his unwieldy trunk and thin legs wobbled in concert to his ingratiating voice  war he was saying is not necessary war is not necessary i hope i make myself clear war is not necessary it depends on nationality but nationality is not necessary he inclined his head to one side why do we have nationality let us do away with boundarieslet us have the warfare of commerce if i see france looking at brightonhe laid his head upon one side and beamed at sheltonwhat do i do do i say hands off no take it i saytake it he archly smiled but do you think they would  and the softness of his contours fascinated shelton  the soldier the person underneath the print resumed is necessarily on a lower planeintellectuallyoh intellectuallythan the philanthropist his sufferings are less acute he enjoys the compensations of advertisementyou admit that he breathed persuasively for instancei am quite impersonali suffer but do i talk about it but someone gazing at his wellfilled waistcoat he put his thesis in another form i have one acre and one cow my brother has one acre and one cow do i seek to take them away from him  shelton hazarded perhaps you re weaker than your brother  come come take the case of women now i consider our marriage laws are barbarous  for the first time shelton conceived respect for them he made a comprehensive gesture and edged himself into the conversation of another group for fear of having all his prejudices overturned here an irish sculptor standing in a curve was saying furiously bees are not bhumpkins dn their sowls a scotch painter who listened with a curly smile seemed trying to compromise this proposition which appeared to have relation to the middle classes and though agreeing with the irishman shelton felt nervous over his discharge of electricity next to them two american ladies assembled under the tent of hair belonging to a writer of songs were discussing the emotions aroused in them by wagners operas  they produce a strange condition of affairs in me said the thinner one  they re just divine said the fatter  i dont know if you can call the fleshly lusts divine replied the thinner looking into the eyes of the writer of the songs  amidst all the hum of voices and the fumes of smoke a sense of formality was haunting shelton sandwiched between a dutchman and a prussian poet he could understand neither of his neighbours so assuming an intelligent expression he fell to thinking that an assemblage of free spirits is as much bound by the convention of exchanging their ideas as commonplace people are by the convention of having no ideas to traffic in he could not help wondering whether in the bulk they were not just as dependent on each other as the inhabitants of kensington whether like locomotives they could run at all without these opportunities for blowing off the steam and what would be left when the steam had all escaped somebody ceased playing the violin and close to him a group began discussing ethics aspirations were in the air all round like a lot of hungry ghosts he realised that if tongue be given to them the flavour vanishes from ideas which haunt the soul  again the violinist played  cock gracious said the prussian poet falling into english as the fiddle ceased colossal aber wie er ist grossartig  have you read that thing of besoms asked shrill voice behind  oh my dear fellow too horrid for words he ought to be hanged  the mans dreadful pursued the voice shriller than ever nothing but a volcanic eruption would cure him  shelton turned in alarm to look at the authors of these statements they were two men of letters talking of a third  cest un grand naif vous savez said the second speaker  these fellows dont exist resumed the first his small eyes gleamed with a green light his whole face had a look as if he gnawed himself though not a man of letters shelton could not help recognising from those eyes what joy it was to say those words these fellows dont exist  poor besom you know what moulter said     shelton turned away as if he had been too close to one whose hair smelt of cantharides and looking round the room he frowned with the exception of his cousin he seemed the only person there of english blood americans mesopotamians irish italians germans scotch and russians he was not contemptuous of them for being foreigners it was simply that god and the climate had made him different by a skin or so  but at this point his conclusions were denied as will sometimes happen by his introduction to an englishmana major somebody who with smooth hair and blond moustache neat eyes and neater clothes seemed a little anxious at his own presence there shelton took a liking to him partly from a fellowfeeling and partly because of the gentle smile with which he was looking at his wife almost before he had said how do you do he was plunged into a discussion on imperialism  admitting all that said shelton what i hate is the humbug with which we pride ourselves on benefiting the whole world by our socalled civilising methods  the soldier turned his reasonable eyes  but is it humbug  shelton saw his argument in peril if we really thought it was it humbug he replied however  why should we a small portion of the worlds population assume that our standards are the proper ones for every kind of race if it s not humbug it s sheer stupidity  the soldier without taking his hands out of his pockets but by a forward movement of his face showing that he was both sincere and just rereplied  well it must be a good sort of stupidity it makes us the nation that we are  shelton felt dazed the conversation buzzed around him he heard the smiling prophet saying altruism altruism and in his voice a something seemed to murmur oh i do so hope i make a good impression  he looked at the soldiers clearcut head with its wellopened eyes the tiny crowsfeet at their corners the conventional moustache he envied the certainty of the convictions lying under that wellparted hair  i would rather we were men first and then englishmen he muttered i think its all a sort of national illusion and i cant stand illusions  if you come to that said the soldier the world lives by illusions i mean if you look at history youll see that the creation of illusions has always been her business dont you know  this shelton was unable to deny  so continued the soldier who was evidently a highly cultivated man if you admit that movement labour progress and all that have been properly given to building up these illusions thaterin fact theyre what you might callerthe outcome of the worlds crescendo he rushed his voice over this phrase as if ashamed of itwhy do you want to destroy them  shelton thought a moment then squeezing his body with his folded arms replied  the past has made us what we are of course and cannot be destroyed but how about the future it s surely time to let in air cathedrals are very fine and everybody likes the smell of incense but when they ve been for centuries without ventilation you know what the atmosphere gets like  the soldier smiled  by your own admission he said youll only be creating a fresh set of illusions  yes answered shelton but at all events theyll be the honest necessities of the present  the pupils of the soldiers eyes contracted he evidently felt the conversation slipping into generalities he answered  i cant see how thinking small beer of ourselves is going to do us any good  an at home  shelton felt in danger of being thought unpractical in giving vent to the remark  one must trust ones reason i never can persuade myself that i believe in what i dont  a minute later with a cordial handshake the soldier left and shelton watched his courteous figure shepherding his wife away  dick may i introduce you to mr wilfrid curly said his cousins voice behind and he found his hand being diffidently shaken by a freshcheeked youth with a domelike forehead who was saying nervously  how do you do yes i am very well thank you  he now remembered that when he had first come in he had watched this youth who had been standing in a corner indulging himself in private smiles he had an uncommon look as though he were in love with lifeas though he regarded it as a creature to whom one could put questions to the very endinteresting humorous earnest questions he looked diffident and amiable and independent and he too was evidently english  are you good at argument said shelton at a loss for a remark  the youth smiled blushed and putting back his hair replied  yesnoi dont know i think my brain does nt work fast enough for argument you know how many motions of the braincells go to each remark it s awfully interesting and bending from the waist in a mathematical position he extended the palm of one hand and started to explain  shelton stared at the youths hand at his frowns and the taps he gave his forehead while he found the expression of his meaning he was intensely interested the youth broke off looked at his watch and blushing brightly said  i m afraid i have to go i have to be at the den before eleven  i must be off too said shelton making their adieux together they sought their hats and coats     chapter xiv  the night club  may i ask said shelton as he and the youth came out into the chilly street what it is you call the den  his companion smilingly answered  oh the night club we take it in turns thursday is my night would you like to come you see a lot of types its only round the corner  shelton digested a momentary doubt and answered  yes immensely  they reached the corner house in an angle of a dismal street through the open door of which two men had just gone in following they ascended some wooden freshwashed stairs and entered a large boarded room smelling of sawdust gas stale coffee and old clothes it was furnished with a bagatelle board two or three wooden tables some wooden forms and a wooden bookcase seated on these wooden chairs or standing up were youths and older men of the working class who seemed to shelton to be peculiarly dejected one was reading one against the wall was drinking coffee with a disillusioned air two were playing chess and a group of four made a ceaseless clatter with the bagatelle  a little man in a dark suit with a pale face thin lips and deepset blackencircled eyes who was obviously in charge came up with an anaemic smile  you re rather late he said to curly and looking ascetically at shelton asked without waiting for an introduction do you play chess there s young smith wants a game  a youth with a wooden face already seated before a flyblown chessboard asked him drearily if he would have black or white shelton took white he was oppressed by the virtuous odour of this room  the little man with the deep blue eyes came up stood in an uneasy attitude and watched  your plays improving young smith he said i should think youd be able to give banks a knight his eyes rested on shelton fanatical and dreary his monotonous voice was suffering and nasal he was continually sucking in his lips as though determined to subdue the flesh you should come here often he said to shelton as the latter received checkmate you d get some good practice weve several very fair players youre not as good as jones or bartholomew he added to sheltons opponent as though he felt it a duty to put the latter in his place you ought to come here often he repeated to shelton we have a lot of very good young fellows and with a touch of complacence he glanced around the dismal room there are not so many here tonight as usual where are toombs and body  shelton too looked anxiously around he could not help feeling sympathy with toombs and body  they re getting slack im afraid said the little deepeyed man our principle is to amuse everyone excuse me a minute i see that carpenter is doing nothing he crossed over to the man who had been drinking coffee but shelton had barely time to glance at his opponent and try to think of a remark before the little man was back do you know anything about astronomy he asked of shelton we have several very interested in astronomy if you could talk to them a little it would help  shelton made a motion of alarm  pleaseno said he i  i wish youd come sometimes on wednesdays we have most interesting talks and a service afterwards were always anxious to get new blood and his eyes searched sheltons brown rather toughlooking face as though trying to see how much blood there was in it young curly says you ve just been around the world you could describe your travels  may i ask said shelton how your club is made up  again a look of complacency and blessed assuagement visited the little man  oh he said we take anybody unless there s anything against them the day society sees to that of course we shouldnt take anyone if they were to report against them you ought to come to our committee meetings theyre on mondays at seven the womens side too  thank you said shelton you re very kind  we should be pleased said the little man and his face seemed to suffer more than ever they re mostly young fellows here tonight but we have married men too of course we re very careful about that he added hastily as though he might have injured sheltons prejudicesthat and drink and anything criminal you know  and do you give pecuniary assistance too  oh yes replied the little man if you were to come to our committee meetings you would see for yourself everything is most carefully gone into we endeavour to sift the wheat from the chaff  i suppose said shelton you find a great deal of chaff  the little man smiled a suffering smile the twang of his toneless voice sounded a trifle shriller  i was obliged to refuse a man todaya man and a woman quite young people with three small children he was ill and out of work but on inquiry we found that they were not man and wife  there was a slight pause the little mans eyes were fastened on his nails and with an appearance of enjoyment he began to bite them sheltons face had grown a trifle red  and what becomes of the woman and the children in a case like that he said  the little mans eyes began to smoulder  we make a point of not encouraging sin of course excuse me a minute i see theyve finished bagatelle  he hurried off and in a moment the clack of bagatelle began again he himself was playing with a cold and spurious energy running after the balls and exhorting the other players upon whom a wooden acquiescence seemed to fall  shelton crossed the room and went up to young curly he was sitting on a bench smiling to himself his private smiles  are you staying here much longer shelton asked  young curly rose with nervous haste  i m afraid he said there s nobody very interesting here tonight  oh not at all said shelton on the contrary only i ve had a rather tiring day and somehow i dont feel up to the standard here  his new acquaintance smiled  oh really do you thinkthat is  but he had not time to finish before the clack of bagatelle balls ceased and the voice of the little deepeyed man was heard saying anybody who wants a book will put his name down there will be the usual prayermeeting on wednesday next will you all go quietly i am going to turn the lights out  one gasjet vanished and the remaining jet flared suddenly by its harder glare the wooden room looked harder too and disenchanting the figures of its occupants began filing through the door the little man was left in the centre of the room his deep eyes smouldering upon the backs of the retreating members his thumb and finger raised to the turncock of the metre  do you know this part asked young curly as they emerged into the street it s really jolly one of the darkest bits in londonit is really if you care i can take you through an awfully dangerous place where the police never go he seemed so anxious for the honour that shelton was loath to disappoint him i come here pretty often he went on as they ascended a sort of alley rambling darkly between a wall and row of houses  why asked shelton it does nt smell too nice  the young man threw up his nose and sniffed as if eager to add any new scent that might be about to his knowledge of life  no thats one of the reasons you know he said one must find out the darkness is jolly too anything might happen here last week there was a murder there s always the chance of one  shelton stared but the charge of morbidness would not lie against this freshcheeked stripling  theres a splendid drain just here his guide resumed the people are dying like flies of typhoid in those three houses and under the first light he turned his grave cherubic face to indicate the houses if we were in the east end i could show you other places quite as good theres a coffeestall keeper in one that knows all the thieves in london he s a splendid type but he added looking a little anxiously at shelton it might nt be safe for you with me its different they re beginning to know me ive nothing to take you see  im afraid it cant be tonight said shelton i must get back  do you mind if i walk with you its so jolly now the stars are out  delighted said shelton do you often go to that club  his companion raised his hat and ran his fingers through his hair  they re rather too highclass for me he said i like to go where you can see people eatschool treats or somewhere in the country it does one good to see them eat they dont get enough you see as a rule to make bone its all used up for brain and muscle there are some places in the winter where they give them bread and cocoa i like to go to those  i went once said shelton but i felt ashamed for putting my nose in  oh they dont mind most of them are halfdead with cold you know you see splendid types lots of dipsomaniacs     it s useful to me he went on as they passed a policestation to walk about at night one can take so much more notice i had a jolly night last week in hyde park a chance to study human nature there  and do you find it interesting asked shelton  his companion smiled  awfully he replied i saw a fellow pick three pockets  what did you do  i had a jolly talk with him  shelton thought of the little deepeyed man who made a point of not encouraging sin  he was one of the professionals from notting hill you know told me his life never had a chance of course the most interesting part was telling him i d seen him pick three pocketslike creeping into a cave when you cant tell what s inside  well  he showed me what he d gotonly fivepence halfpenny  and what became of your friend asked shelton  oh went off he had a splendidly low forehead  they had reached sheltons rooms  will you come in said the latter and have a drink  the youth smiled blushed and shook his head  no thank you he said i have to walk to whitechapel i m living on porridge now splendid stuff for making bone i generally live on porridge for a week at the end of every month it s the best diet if youre hard up once more blushing and smiling he was gone  shelton went upstairs and sat down on his bed he felt a little miserable sitting there slowly pulling out the ends of his white tie disconsolate he had a vision of antonia with her gaze fixed wonderingly on him and this wonder of hers came as a revelationjust as that morning when looking from his window he had seen a passerby stop suddenly and scratch his leg and it had come upon him in a flash that that man had thoughts and feelings of his own he would never know what antonia really felt and thought till i saw her at the station i did nt know how much i loved her or how little i knew her and sighing deeply he hurried into bed     chapter xv  pole to pole  the waiting in london for july to come was daily more unbearable to shelton and if it had not been for ferrand who still came to breakfast he would have deserted the metropolis on june first the latter presented himself rather later than was his custom and announced that through a friend he had heard of a position as interpreter to an hotel at folkestone  if i had money to face the first necessities he said swiftly turning over a collection of smeared papers with his yellow fingers as if searching for his own identity i d leave today this london blackens my spirit  are you certain to get this place asked shelton  i think so the young foreigner replied i ve got some good enough recommendations  shelton could not help a dubious glance at the papers in his hand a hurt look passed on to ferrands curly lips beneath his nascent red moustache  you mean that to have false papers is as bad as theft no no i shall never be a thiefi ve had too many opportunities said he with pride and bitterness thats not in my character i never do harm to anyone thishe touched the papersis not delicate but it does harm to no one if you have no money you must have papers they stand between you and starvation society has an excellent eye for the helplessit never treads on people unless they re really down he looked at shelton  you ve made me what i am amongst you he seemed to say now put up with me  but there are always the workhouses shelton remarked at last  workhouses returned ferrand certainly there areregular palaces i will tell you one thing ive never been in places so discouraging as your workhouses they take ones very heart out  i always understood said shelton coldly that our system was better than that of other countries  ferrand leaned over in his chair an elbow on his knee his favourite attitude when particularly certain of his point  well he replied it s always permissible to think well of your own country but frankly ive come out of those places here with little strength and no heart at all and i can tell you why his lips lost their bitterness and he became an artist expressing the result of his experience you spend your money freely you have fine buildings selfrespecting officers but you lack the spirit of hospitality the reason is plain you have a horror of the needy you invite usand when we come you treat us justly enough but as if we were numbers criminals beneath contemptas if we had inflicted a personal injury on you and when we get out again we are naturally degraded  shelton bit his lips  how much money will you want for your ticket and to make a start he asked  the nervous gesture escaping ferrand at this juncture betrayed how far the most independent thinkers are dependent when they have no money in their pockets he took the note that shelton proffered him  a thousand thanks said he i shall never forget what you have done for me and shelton could not help feeling that there was true emotion behind his titter of farewell  he stood at the window watching ferrand start into the world again then looked back at his own comfortable room with the number of things that had accumulated somehowthe photographs of countless friends the old armchairs the stock of coloured pipes into him restlessness had passed with the farewell clasp of the foreigners damp hand to wait about in london was unbearable  he took his hat and heedless of direction walked towards the river it was a clear bright day with a bleak wind driving showers before it during one of such shelton found himself in little blank street i wonder how that little frenchman that i saw is getting on he thought on a fine day he would probably have passed by on the other side he now entered and tapped upon the wicket  no 3 little blank street had abated nothing of its stoneflagged dreariness the same blowsy woman answered his inquiry yes carolan was always in you could never catch him outseemed afraid to go into the street to her call the little frenchman made his appearance as punctually as if he had been the rabbit of a conjurer his face was as yellow as a guinea  ah its you monsieur he said  yes said shelton and how are you  it s five days since i came out of hospital muttered the little frenchman tapping on his chest a crisis of this bad atmosphere i live here shut up in a box it does me harm being from the south if theres anything i can do for you monsieur it will give me pleasure  nothing replied shelton i was just passing and thought i should like to hear how you were getting on  come into the kitchenmonsieur there is nobody in there brr il fait un froid etonnant  what sort of customers have you just now asked shelton as they passed into the kitchen  always the same clientele replied the little man not so numerous of course it being summer  could nt you find anything better than this to do  the barbers crowsfeet radiated irony  when i first came to london said he i secured an engagement at one of your public institutions i thought my fortune made imagine monsieur in that sacred place i was obliged to shave at the rate of ten a penny here its true they dont pay me half the time but when im paid i m paid in this climate and being poitrinaire one doesnt make experiments i shall finish my days here have you seen that young man who interested you there s another he has spirit as i had onceil fait de la philosophie as i doand you will see monsieur it will finish him in this world what you want is to have no spirit spirit ruins you  shelton looked sideways at the little man with his sardonic yellow halfdead face and the incongruity of the word spirit in his mouth struck him so sharply that he smiled a smile with more pity in it than any burst of tears  shall we sit down he said offering a cigarette  merci monsieur it is always a pleasure to smoke a good cigarette you remember that old actor who gave you a jeremiad well hes dead i was the only one at his bedside un vrai drole he was another who had spirit and you will see monsieur that young man in whom you take an interest hell die in a hospital or in some hole or other or even on the highroad having closed his eyes once too often some cold night and all because he has something in him which will not accept things as they are believing always that they should be better il ny a riens de plus tragique  according to you then said sheltonand the conversation seemed to him of a sudden to have taken too personal a turnrebellion of any sort is fatal  ah replied the little man with the eagerness of one whose ideal it is to sit under the awning of a cafe and talk life upside down you pose me a great problem there if one makes rebellion it is always probable that one will do no good to any one and harm ones self the law of the majority arranges that but i would draw your attention to thisand he paused as if it were a real discovery to blow smoke through his noseif you rebel it is in all likelihood because you are forced by your nature to rebel this is one of the most certain things in life in any case it is necessary to avoid falling between two stoolswhich is unpardonable he ended with complacence  shelton thought he had never seen a man who looked more completely as if he had fallen between two stools and he had inspiration enough to feel that the little barbers intellectual rebellion and the action logically required by it had no more than a bowing acquaintanceship  by nature went on the little man i am an optimist it is in consequence of this that i now make pessimism i have always had ideals seeing myself cut off from them for ever i must complain to complain monsieur is very sweet  shelton wondered what these ideals had been but had no answer ready so he nodded and again held out his cigarettes for like a true southerner the little man had thrown the first away half smoked  the greatest pleasure in life continued the frenchman with a bow is to talk a little to a being who is capable of understanding you at present we have no one here now that that old actors dead ah there was a man who was rebellion incarnate he made rebellion as other men make money cetait son metier when he was no longer capable of active revolution he made it getting drunk at the last this was his only way of protesting against society an interesting personality je le regrette beaucoup but as you see he died in great distress without a soul to wave him farewell because as you can well understand monsieur i dont count myself he died drunk cetait un homme  shelton had continued staring kindly at the little man the barber added hastily  its difficult to make an end like that one has moments of weakness  yes assented shelton one has indeed  the little barber looked at him with cynical discretion  oh he said it s to the destitute that such things are important when one has money all these matters  he shrugged his shoulders a smile had lodged amongst his crowsfeet he waved his hand as though to end the subject  a sense of having been exposed came over shelton  you think then said he that discontent is peculiar to the destitute  monsieur replied the little barber a plutocrat knows too well that if he mixes in that galere there s not a dog in the streets more lost than he  shelton rose  the rain is over i hope you ll soon be better perhaps you ll accept this in memory of that old actor and he slipped a sovereign into the little frenchmans hand  the latter bowed  whenever you are passing monsieur he said eagerly i shall be charmed to see you  and shelton walked away not a dog in the streets more lost thought he now what did he mean by that  something of that lost dog feeling had gripped his spirit another month of waiting would kill all the savour of anticipation might even kill his love in the excitement of his senses and his nerves caused by this strain of waiting everything seemed too vivid all was beyond life size like artwhose truths too strong for daily use are thus unpopular with healthy people as will the bones in a worn face the spirit underlying things had reached the surface the meanness and intolerable measure of hard facts were too apparent some craving for help some instinct drove him into kensington for he found himself before his mothers house providence seemed bent on flinging him from pole to pole  mrs shelton was in town and though it was the first of june sat warming her feet before a fire her face with its pleasant colour was crowsfooted like the little barbers but from optimism not rebellion she smiled when she saw her son and the wrinkles round her eyes twinkled with vitality  well my dear boy she said its lovely to see you and how is that sweet girl  very well thank you replied shelton  she must be such a dear  mother stammered shelton i must give it up  give it up my dear dick give what up you look quite worried come and sit down and have a cosy chat cheer up and mrs shelton with her head askew gazed at her son quite irrepressibly  mother said shelton who confronted by her optimism had never since his time of trial began felt so wretchedly dejected i cant go on waiting about like this  my dear boy what is the matter  everything is wrong  wrong cried mrs shelton come tell me all about it  but shelton shook his head  you surely have not had a quarrel  mrs shelton stopped the question seemed so vulgarone might have asked it of a groom  no said shelton and his answer sounded like a groan  you know my dear old dick murmured his mother it seems a little mad  i know it seems mad  come said mrs shelton taking his hand between her own you never used to be like this  no said shelton with a laugh i never used to be like this  mrs shelton snuggled in her chuda shawl  oh she said with cheery sympathy i know exactly how you feel  shelton holding his head stared at the fire which played and bubbled like his mothers face  but youre so fond of each other she began again such a sweet girl  you dont understand muttered shelton gloomily it s not herits nothingitsmyself  mrs shelton again seized his hand and this time pressed it to her soft warm cheek that had lost the elasticity of youth  oh she cried again i understand i know exactly what you re feeling but shelton saw from the fixed beam in her eyes that she had not an inkling to do him justice he was not so foolish as to try to give her one mrs shelton sighed it would be so lovely if you could wake up tomorrow and think differently if i were you my dear i would have a good long walk and then a turkish bath and then i would just write to her and tell her all about it and youll see how beautifully itll all come straight and in the enthusiasm of advice mrs shelton rose and with a faint stretch of her tiny figure still so young clasped her hands together now do that s a dear old dick you ll just see how lovely itll be shelton smiled he had not the heart to chase away this vision and give her my warmest love and tell her i m longing for the wedding come now my dear boy promise me thats what you ll do  and shelton said ill think about it  mrs shelton had taken up her stand with one foot on the fender in spite of her sciatica  cheer up she cried her eyes beamed as if intoxicated by her sympathy  wonderful woman the uncomplicated optimism that carried her through good and ill had not descended to her son  from pole to pole he had been thrown that day from the french barber whose intellect accepted nothing without carping and whose little fingers worked all day to save himself from dying out to his own mother whose intellect accepted anything presented with sufficient glow but who until she died would never stir a finger when shelton reached his rooms he wrote to antonia  i cant wait about in london any longer i am going down to bideford to start a walking tour i shall work my way to oxford and stay there till i may come to holm oaks i shall send you my address do write as usual  he collected all the photographs he had of heramateur groups taken by mrs dennantand packed them in the pocket of his shootingjacket there was one where she was standing just below her little brother who was perched upon a wall in her halfclosed eyes round throat and softly tilted chin there was something cool and watchful protecting the ragamuffin up above her head this he kept apart to be looked at daily as a man says his prayers     part ii  the country     chapter xvi  the indian civilian  one morning then a week later shelton found himself at the walls of princetown prison  he had seen this lugubrious stone cage before but the magic of his morning walk across the moor the sight of the pagan tors the songs of the last cuckoo had unprepared him for that dreary building he left the street and entering the fosse began a circuit scanning the walls with morbid fascination  this then was the system by which men enforced the will of the majority and it was suddenly borne in on him that all the ideas and maxims which his christian countrymen believed themselves to be fulfilling daily were stultified in every cellule of the social honeycomb such teachings as he that is without sin amongst you had been pronounced unpractical by peers and judges bishops statesmen merchants husbandsin fact by every truly christian person in the country  yes thought shelton as if he had found out something new the more christian the nation the less it has to do with the christian spirit  society was a charitable organisation giving nothing for nothing little for sixpence and it was only fear that forced it to give at all  he took a seat on a wall and began to watch a warder who was slowly paring a last years apple the expression of his face the way he stood with his solid legs apart his head poked forward and his lower jaw thrust out all made him a perfect pillar of society he was undisturbed by sheltons scrutiny watching the rind coil down below the apple until in a springing spiral it fell on the path and collapsed like a toy snake he took a bite his teeth were jagged and his mouth immense it was obvious that he considered himself a most superior man shelton frowned got down slowly from the wall and proceeded on his way  a little further down the hill he stopped again to watch a group of convicts in a field they seemed to be dancing in a slow and sad cotillon while behind the hedge on every side were warders armed with guns just such a sight substituting spears could have been seen in roman times  while he thus stood looking a man walking rapidly stopped beside him and asked how many miles it was to exeter his round visage and long brown eyes sliding about beneath their brows his cropped hair and short neck seemed familiar  your name is crocker is nt it  why its the bird exclaimed the traveller putting out his hand have nt seen you since we both went down  shelton returned his handgrip crocker had lived above his head at college and often kept him sleepless half the night by playing on the hautboy  where have you sprung from  india got my long leave i say are you going this way lets go together  they went and very fast faster and faster every minute  where are you going at this pace asked shelton  london  oh only as far as london  i ve set myself to do it in a week  are you in training  no  you ll kill yourself  crocker answered with a chuckle  shelton noted with alarm the expression of his eye there was a sort of stubborn aspiration in it still an idealist he thought poor fellow well he inquired what sort of a time have you had in india  oh said the indian civilian absently ive had the plague  good god  crocker smiled and added  caught it on famine duty  i see said shelton plague and famine i suppose you fellows really think you re doing good out there  his companion looked at him surprised then answered modestly  we get very good screws  that s the great thing responded shelton  after a moments silence crocker looking straight before him asked  dont you think we are doing good  i m not an authority but as a matter of fact i dont  crocker seemed disconcerted  why he bluntly asked  shelton was not anxious to explain his views and he did not reply  his friend repeated  why dont you think were doing good in india  well said shelton gruffly how can progress be imposed on nations from outside  the indian civilian glancing at shelton in an affectionate and doubtful way replied  you have nt changed a bit old chap  no no said shelton you re not going to get out of it that way give me a single example of a nation or an individual for that matter who s ever done any good without having worked up to it from within  crocker grunting muttered evils  that s it said shelton we take peoples entirely different from our own and stop their natural development by substituting a civilisation grown for our own use suppose looking at a tropical fern in a hothouse you were to say this heat s unhealthy for me therefore it must be bad for the fern i ll take it up and plant it outside in the fresh air  do you know that means giving up india said the indian civilian shrewdly  i dont say that but to talk about doing good to india ishm  crocker knitted his brows trying to see the point of view his friend was showing him  come now should we go on administering india if it were dead loss no well to talk about administering the country for the purpose of pocketing money is cynical and there s generally some truth in cynicism but to talk about the administration of a country by which we profit as if it were a great and good thing is cant i hit you in the wind for the benefit of myselfall right law of nature but to say it does you good at the same time is beyond me  no no returned crocker grave and anxious you cant persuade me that we re not doing good  wait a bit its all a question of horizons you look at it from too close put the horizon further back you hit india in the wind and say its virtuous well now lets see what happens either the wind never comes back and india gasps to an untimely death or the wind does come back and in the pant of reaction your blowthats to say your labouris lost morally lost labour that you might have spent where it would nt have been lost  are nt you an imperialist asked crocker genuinely concerned  i may be but i keep my mouth shut about the benefits we re conferring upon other people  then you cant believe in abstract right or justice  what on earth have our ideas of justice or right got to do with india  if i thought as you do sighed the unhappy crocker i should be all adrift  quite so we always think our standards best for the whole world its a capital belief for us read the speeches of our public men does nt it strike you as amazing how sure they are of being in the right its so charming to benefit yourself and others at the same time though when you come to think of it one mans meat is usually anothers poison look at nature but in england we never look at naturetheres no necessity our national point of view has filled our pockets thats all that matters  i say old chap thats awfully bitter said crocker with a sort of wondering sadness  it s enough to make any one bitter the way we pharisees wax fat and at the same time give ourselves the moral airs of a balloon i must stick a pin in sometimes just to hear the gas escape shelton was surprised at his own heat and for some strange reason thought of antoniasurely she was not a pharisee  his companion strode along and shelton felt sorry for the signs of trouble on his face  to fill your pockets said crocker is nt the main thing one has just got to do things without thinking of why we do them  do you ever see the other side to any question asked shelton i suppose not you always begin to act before you stop thinking dont you  crocker grinned  hes a pharisee too thought shelton without a pharisees pride queer thing that  after walking some distance as if thinking deeply crocker chuckled out  you re not consistent you ought to be in favour of giving up india  shelton smiled uneasily  why should nt we fill our pockets i only object to the humbug that we talk  the indian civilian put his hand shyly through his arm  if i thought like you he said i could nt stay another day in india  and to this shelton made no reply  the wind had now begun to drop and something of the mornings magic was stealing again upon the moor they were nearing the outskirt fields of cultivation it was past five when dropping from the level of the tors they came into the sunny vale of monkland  they say said crocker reading from his guidebookthey say this place occupies a position of unique isolation  the two travellers in tranquil solitude took their seats under an old limetree on the village green the smoke of their pipes the sleepy air the warmth from the baked ground the constant hum made shelton drowsy  do you remember his companion asked those jaws you used to have with busgate and old halidome in my rooms on sunday evenings how is old halidome  married replied shelton  crocker sighed and are you he asked  not yet said shelton grimly i mengaged  crocker took hold of his arm above the elbow and squeezing it he grunted shelton had not received congratulations that pleased him more there was the spice of envy in them  i should like to get married while i m home said the civilian after a long pause his legs were stretched apart throwing shadows on the green his hands deep thrust into his pockets his head a little to one side an absentminded smile played round his mouth  the sun had sunk behind a tor but the warmth kept rising from the ground and the sweetbriar on a cottage bathed them with its spicy perfume from the converging lanes figures passed now and then lounged by staring at the strangers gossiping amongst themselves and vanished into the cottages that headed the incline a clock struck seven and round the shady limetree a chafer or some heavy insect commenced its booming rushes all was marvellously sane and slumbrous the soft air the drawling voices the shapes and murmurs the rising smell of woodsmoke from freshkindled fireswere full of the spirit of security and of home the outside world was far indeed typical of some island nation was this nest of refugewhere men grew quietly tall fattened and without fuss dropped off their perches where contentment flourished as sunflowers flourished in the sun  crockers cap slipped off he was nodding and shelton looked at him from a manor house in some such village he had issued to one of a thousand such homes he would find his way at last untouched by the struggles with famines or with plagues uninfected in his fibre his prejudices and his principles unchanged by contact with strange peoples new conditions odd feelings or queer points of view  the chafer buzzed against his shoulder gathered flight again and boomed away crocker roused himself and turning his amiable face jogged sheltons arm  what are you thinking about bird he asked     chapter xvii  a parson  shelton continued to travel with his college friend and on wednesday night four days after joining company they reached the village of dowdenhame all day long the road had lain through pastureland with thick green hedges and heavily feathered elms once or twice they had broken the monotony by a stretch along the towingpath of a canal which choked with waterlily plants and shining weeds brooded sluggishly beside the fields nature in one of her ironic moods had cast a grey and ironhard cloak over all the countrys bland luxuriance from dawn till darkness fell there had been no movement in the steely distant sky a cold wind ruffed in the hedgetops and sent shivers through the branches of the elms the cattle dappled pied or bay or white continued grazing with an air of grumbling at their birthright in a meadow close to the canal shelton saw five magpies and about five oclock the rain began a steady coldlysneering rain which crocker looking at the sky declared was going to be over in a minute but it was not over in a minute they were soon drenched shelton was tired and it annoyed him very much that his companion who was also tired should grow more cheerful his thoughts kept harping upon ferrand this must be something like what he described to me tramping on and on when youre deadbeat until you can cadge up supper and a bed and sulkily he kept on ploughing through the mud with glances at the exasperating crocker who had skinned one heel and was limping horribly it suddenly came home to him that life for three quarters of the world meant physical exhaustion every day without a possibility of alternative and that as soon as for some cause beyond control they failed thus to exhaust themselves they were reduced to beg or starve and then we who dont know the meaning of the word exhaustion call them idle scamps he said aloud  it was past nine and dark when they reached dowdenhame the street yielded no accommodation and while debating where to go they passed the church with a square tower and next to it a house which was certainly the parsonage  suppose said crocker leaning on his arms upon the gate we ask him where to go and without waiting for sheltons answer he rang the bell  the door was opened by the parson a bloodless and cleanshaven man whose hollow cheeks and bony hands suggested a perpetual struggle ascetically benevolent were his grey eyes a pale and ghostly smile played on the curves of his thin lips  what can i do for you he asked inn yes theres the blue chequers but i m afraid you ll find it shut they re early people i m glad to say and his eyes seemed to muse over the proper fold for these damp sheep are you oxford men by any chance he asked as if that might throw some light upon the matter of marys really im of pauls myself ladymanbillington ladyman you might remember my youngest brother i could give you a room here if you could manage without sheets my housekeeper has two days holiday shes foolishly taken the keys  shelton accepted gladly feeling that the intonation in the parsons voice was necessary unto his calling and that he did not want to patronise  you re hungry i expect after your tramp im very much afraid there sernothing in the house but bread i could boil you water hot lemonade is better than nothing  conducting them into the kitchen he made a fire and put a kettle on to boil then after leaving them to shed their soaking clothes returned with ancient greenish coats some carpet slippers and some blankets wrapped in these and carrying their glasses the travellers followed to the study where by doubtful lamplight he seemed from books upon the table to have been working at his sermon  we re giving you a lot of trouble said shelton its really very good of you  not at all the parson answered im only grieved the house is empty  it was a truly dismal contrast to the fatness of the land they had been passing through and the parsons voice issuing from bloodless lips although complacent was pathetic it was peculiar that voice of his seeming to indicate an intimate acquaintanceship with what was fat and fine to convey contempt for the vulgar need of money while all the time his eyesthose watery ascetic eyesas plain as speech they said oh to know what it must be like to have a pound or two to spare just once a year or so  everything in the room had been bought for cheapness no luxuries were there and necessaries not enough it was bleak and bare the ceiling cracked the wallpaper discoloured and those booksprim shining books fatbacked with arms stamped on themglared in the surrounding barrenness  my predecessor said the parson played rather havoc with the house the poor fellow had a dreadful struggle i was told you can unfortunately expect nothing else these days when livings have come down so terribly in value he was a married manlarge family  crocker who had drunk his steaming lemonade was smiling and already nodding in his chair with his black garment buttoned closely round his throat his long legs rolled up in a blanket and stretched towards the feeble flame of the newlylighted fire he had a rather patchy air shelton on the other hand had lost his feeling of fatigue the strangeness of the place was stimulating his brain he kept stealing glances at the scantiness around the room the parson the furniture the very fire all gave him the feeling caused by seeing legs that have outgrown their trousers but there was something underlying that leanness of the landscape something superior and academic which defied all sympathy it was pure nervousness which made him say  ah why do they have such families  a faint red mounted to the parsons cheeks its appearance there was startling and crocker chuckled as a sleepy man will chuckle who feels bound to show that he is not asleep  its very unfortunate murmured the parson certainly in many cases  shelton would now have changed the subject but at this moment the unhappy crocker snored being a man of action he had gone to sleep  it seems to me said shelton hurriedly as he saw the parsons eyebrows rising at the sound almost what you might call wrong  dear me but how can it be wrong  shelton now felt that he must justify his saying somehow  i dont know he said only one hears of such a lot of casesclergymens families ive two uncles of my own who  a new expression gathered on the parsons face his mouth had tightened and his chin receded slightly why he s like a mule thought shelton his eyes too had grown harder greyer and more parroty shelton no longer liked his face  perhaps you and i the parson said would not understand each other on such matters  and shelton felt ashamed  i should like to ask you a question in turn however the parson said as if desirous of meeting shelton on his low ground how do you justify marriage if it is not to follow the laws of nature  i can only tell you what i personally feel  my dear sir you forget that a womans chief delight is in her motherhood  i should have thought it a pleasure likely to pall with too much repetition motherhood is motherhood whether of one or of a dozen  i m afraid replied the parson with impatience though still keeping on his guests low ground your theories are not calculated to populate the world  have you ever lived in london shelton asked it always makes me feel a doubt whether we have any right to have children at all  surely said the parson with wonderful restraint and the joints of his fingers cracked with the grip he had upon his chair you are leaving out duty towards the country national growth is paramount  there are two ways of looking at that it depends on what you want your country to become  i did nt know said the parsonfanaticism now had crept into his smilethere could be any doubt on such a subject  the more shelton felt that commands were being given him the more controversial he naturally becameapart from the merits of this subject to which he had hardly ever given thought  i dare say im wrong he said fastening his eyes on the blanket in which his legs were wrapped but it seems to me at least an open question whether its better for the country to be so well populated as to be quite incapable of supporting itself  surely said the parson whose face regained its pallor youre not a little englander  on shelton this phrase had a mysterious effect resisting an impulse to discover what he really was he answered hastily  of course im not  the parson followed up his triumph and shifting the ground of the discussion from sheltons to his own he gravely said  surely you must see that your theory is founded in immorality it is if i may say so extravagant even wicked  but shelton suffering from irritation at his own dishonesty replied with heat  why not say at once sir hysterical unhealthy any opinion which goes contrary to that of the majority is always called so i believe  well returned the parson whose eyes seemed trying to bind shelton to his will i must say your ideas do seem to me both extravagant and unhealthy the propagation of children is enjoined of marriage  shelton bowed above his blanket but the parson did not smile  we live in very dangerous times he said and it grieves me when a man of your standing panders to these notions  those said shelton whom the shoe does nt pinch make this rule of morality and thrust it on to such as the shoe does pinch  the rule was never made said the parson it was given us  oh said shelton i beg your pardon he was in danger of forgetting the delicate position he was in he wants to ram his notions down my throat he thought and it seemed to him that the parsons face had grown more like a mules his accent more superior his eyes more dictatorial to be right in this argument seemed now of great importance whereas in truth it was of no importance whatsoever that which however was important was the fact that in nothing could they ever have agreed  but crocker had suddenly ceased to snore his head had fallen so that a peculiar whistling arose instead both shelton and the parson looked at him and the sight sobered them  your friend seems very tired said the parson  shelton forgot all his annoyance for his host seemed suddenly pathetic with those baggy garments hollow cheeks and the slightly reddened nose that comes from not imbibing quite enough a kind fellow after all  the kind fellow rose and putting his hands behind his back placed himself before the blackening fire whole centuries of authority stood behind him it was an accident that the mantelpiece was chipped and rusty the fireirons bent and worn his linen frayed about the cuffs  i dont wish to dictate said he but where it seems to me that you are wholly wrong in that your ideas foster in women those lax views of the family life that are so prevalent in society nowadays  thoughts of antonia with her candid eyes the touch of freckling on her pinkwhite skin the fair hair gathered back sprang up in shelton and that wordlax seemed ridiculous and the women he was wont to see dragging about the streets of london with two or three small children women bent beneath the weight of babies that they could not leave women going to work with babies still unborn anaemiclooking women impecunious mothers in his own class with twelve or fourteen children all the victims of the sanctity of marriage and again the word lax seemed to be ridiculous  we are not put into the world to exercise our witsmuttered shelton  our wanton wills the parson said severely  that sir may have been all right for the last generation the country is more crowded now i cant see why we should nt decide it for ourselves  such a view of morality said the parson looking down at crocker with a ghostly smile to me is unintelligible  crackers whistling grew in tone and in variety  what i hate said shelton is the way we men decide what women are to bear and then call them immoral decadent or what you will if they dont fall in with our views  mr shelton said the parson i think we may safely leave it in the hands of god  shelton was silent  the questions of morality said the parson promptly have always lain through god in the hands of men not women we are the reasonable sex  shelton stubbornly replied  we re certainly the greater humbugs if that s the same  this is too bad exclaimed the parson with some heat  i m sorry sir but how can you expect women nowadays to have the same views as our grandmothers we men by our commercial enterprise have brought about a different state of things yet for the sake of our own comfort we try to keep women where they were its always those men who are most keen about their comfortand in his heat the sarcasm of using the word comfort in that room was lost on himwho are so ready to accuse women of deserting the old morality  the parson quivered with impatient irony  old morality new morality he said these are strange words  forgive me explained shelton we re talking of working morality i imagine theres not a man in a million fit to talk of true morality  the eyes of his host contracted  i think he saidand his voice sounded as if he had pinched it in the endeavour to impress his listenerthat any welleducated man who honestly tries to serve his god has the right humblyi say humblyto claim morality  shelton was on the point of saying something bitter but checked himself here am i thought he trying to get the last word like an old woman  at this moment there was heard a piteous mewing the parson went towards the door  excuse me a moment i m afraid thats one of my cats out in the wet he returned a minute later with a wet cat in his arms they will get out he said to shelton with a smile on his thin face suffused by stooping and absently he stroked the dripping cat while a drop of wet ran off his nose poor pussy poor pussy the sound of that poor pussy like nothing human in its cracked superiority the softness of that smile like the smile of gentleness itself haunted shelton till he fell asleep     chapter xviii  academic  the last sunlight was playing on the roofs when the travellers entered that high street grave and holy to all oxford men the spirit hovering above the spires was as different from its concretions in their caps and gowns as ever the spirit of christ was from church dogmas  shall we go into grinnings asked shelton as they passed the club  but each looked at his clothes for two elegant young men in flannel suits were coming out  you go said crocker with a smirk  shelton shook his head never before had he felt such love for this old city it was gone now from out his life but everything about it seemed so good and fine even its exclusive air was not ignoble clothed in the calm of history the golden web of glorious tradition radiant with the alchemy of memories it bewitched him like the perfume of a womans dress at the entrance of a college they glanced in at the cool grey patch of stone beyond and the scarlet of a window flowerboxsecluded mysteriously calma narrow vision of the sacred past pale and trenchercapped a youth with pimply face and random nose grabbing at his cloven gown was gazing at the noticeboard the college porterlarge man freshfaced and smallmouthedstood at his lodge door in a frank and deferential attitude an image of routine he looked like one engaged to give a decorous air to multitudes of pecadilloes his blue eyes rested on the travellers i dont know you sirs but if you want to speak i shall be glad to hear the observations you may have to make they seemed to say  against the wall reposed a bicycle with tennisracquet buckled to its handle a bulldog bitch working her snout from side to side was snuffling horribly the great ironstudded door to which her chain was fastened stayed immovable through this narrow mouth human metal had been poured for centuriespoured moulded given back  come along said shelton  they now entered the bishops head and had their dinner in the room where shelton had given his derby dinner to fourandtwenty wellbred youths here was the picture of the racehorse that the wineglass thrown by one of them had missed when it hit the waiter and there serving crocker with anchovy sauce was the very waiter when they had finished shelton felt the old desire to rise with difficulty from the table the old longing to patrol the streets with arm hooked in some other arm the old eagerness to dare and do something heroicand unlawful the old sense that he was of the forest set in the forest college of the forest country in the finest world the streets all grave and mellow in the sunset seemed to applaud this afterdinner stroll the entrance quad of his old collegespaciously majestic monastically modern for years the heart of his universe the focus of what had gone before it in his life casting the shadow of its grey walls over all that had come afterbrought him a sense of rest from conflict and trust in his own important safety the gardengate whose lofty spikes he had so often crowned with empty waterbottles failed to rouse him nor when they passed the staircase where he had flung a leg of lamb at some indelicate disturbing tutor did he feel remorse high on that staircase were the rooms in which he had crammed for his degree upon the system by which the scholar simmers on the fire of cramming boils over at the moment of examination and is extinct for ever after his coachs face recurred to him a man with thrusting eyes who reeled off knowledge all the week and disappeared to town on sundays  they passed their tutors staircase  i wonder if little turl would remember us said crocker i should like to see him shall we go and look him up  little turl said shelton dreamily  mounting they knocked upon a solid door  come in said the voice of sleep itself  a little man with a pink face and large red ears was sitting in a fat pink chair as if he had been grown there  what do you want he asked of them blinking  dont you know me sir  god bless me crocker isnt it i didnt recognise you with a beard  crocker who had not been shaved since starting on his travels chuckled feebly  you remember shelton sir he said  shelton oh yes how do you do shelton sit down take a cigar and crossing his fat little legs the little gentleman looked them up and down with drowsy interest as who should say now after all you know why come and wake me up like this  shelton and crocker took two other chairs they too seemed thinking yes why did we come and wake him up like this and shelton who could not tell the reason why took refuge in the smoke of his cigar the panelled walls were hung with prints of celebrated greek remains the soft thick carpet on the floor was grateful to his tired feet the backs of many books gleamed richly in the light of the oil lamps the culture and tobacco smoke stole on his senses he but vaguely comprehended crockers amiable talk vaguely the answers of his little host whose face blinking behind the bowl of his huge meerschaum pipe had such a queer resemblance to a moon the door was opened and a tall creature whose eyes were large and brown whose face was rosy and ironical entered with a manly stride  oh he said looking round him with his chin a little in the air am i intruding turl  the little host blinking more than ever murmured  not at all berrymantake a pew  the visitor called berryman sat down and gazed up at the wall with his fine eyes  shelton had a faint remembrance of this don and bowed but the newcomer sat smiling and did not notice the salute  trimmer and washer are coming round he said and as he spoke the door opened to admit these gentlemen of the same height but different appearance their manner was faintly jocular faintly supercilious as if they tolerated everything the one whose name was trimmer had patches of red on his large cheekbones and on his cheeks a bluish tint his lips were rather full so that he had a likeness to a spider washer who was thin and pale wore an intellectual smile  the little fat host moved the hand that held the meerschaum  crocker shelton he said  an awkward silence followed shelton tried to rouse the cultured portion of his wits but the sense that nothing would be treated seriously paralysed his faculties he stayed silent staring at the glowing tip of his cigar it seemed to him unfair to have intruded on these gentlemen without its having been made quite clear to them beforehand who and what he was he rose to take his leave but washer had begun to speak  madame bovary he said quizzically reading the title of the book on the little fat mans bookrest and holding it closer to his boiledlooking eyes he repeated as though it were a joke madame bovary  do you mean to say turl that you can stand that stuff said berryman  as might have been expected this celebrated novels name had galvanised him into life he strolled over to the bookcase took down a book opened it and began to read wandering in a desultory way about the room  ha berryman said a conciliatory voice behindit came from trimmer who had set his back against the hearth and grasped with either hand a fistful of his gownthe books a classic  classic exclaimed berryman transfixing shelton with his eyes the fellow ought to have been horsewhipped for writing such putridity  a feeling of hostility instantly sprang up in shelton he looked at his little host who however merely blinked  berryman only means explains washer a certain malice in his smile that the author is nt one of his particular pets  for gods sake you know dont get berryman on his horse growled the little fat man suddenly  berryman returned his volume to the shelf and took another down there was something almost godlike in his sarcastic absentmindedness  imagine a man writing that stuff he said if hed ever been at eton what do we want to know about that sort of thing a writer should be a sportsman and a gentleman and again he looked down over his chin at shelton as though expecting him to controvert the sentiment  dont you began the latter  but berrymans attention had wandered to the wall  i really dont care said he to know what a woman feels when she is going to the dogs it does nt interest me  the voice of trimmer made things pleasant  question of moral standards that and nothing more  he had stretched his legs like compassesand the way he grasped his gownwings seemed to turn him to a pair of scales his lowering smile embraced the room deprecating strong expressions after all he seemed to say we are men of the world we know there s not very much in anything this is the modern spirit why not give it a look in  do i understand you to say berryman that you dont enjoy a spicy book asked washer with his smile and at this question the little fat man sniggered blinking tempestuously as if to say nothing pleasanter dont you know before a hot fire in cold weather  berryman paid no attention to the impertinent inquiry continuing to dip into his volume and walk up and down  ive nothing to say he remarked stopping before shelton and looking down as if at last aware of him to those who talk of being justified through art i call a spade a spade  shelton did not answer because he could not tell whether berryman was addressing him or society at large and berryman went on  do we want to know about the feelings of a middleclass woman with a taste for vice tell me the point of it no man who was in the habit of taking baths would choose such a subject  you come to the question ofahsubjects the voice of trimmer genially buzzed he had gathered his garments tight across his backmy dear fellow art properly applied justifies all subjects  for art squeaked berryman putting back his second volume and taking down a third you have homer cervantes shakespeare ossian for garbage a number of unwashed gentlemen  there was a laugh shelton glanced round at all in turn with the exception of crocker who was half asleep and smiling idiotically they wore one and all a look as if by no chance could they consider any subject fit to move their hearts as if one and all they were so profoundly anchored on the sea of life that waves could only seem impertinent it may have been some glimmer in this glance of sheltons that brought trimmer once more to the rescue with his compromising air  the french said he have quite a different standard from ourselves in literature just as they have a different standard in regard to honour all this is purely artificial  what he meant however shelton found it difficult to tell  honour said washer lhonneur die ehre duelling unfaithful wives  he was clearly going to add to this but it was lost for the little fat man taking the meerschaum with trembling fingers and holding it within two inches of his chin murmured  you fellows berrymans awfly strong on honour  he blinked twice and put the meerschaum back between his lips  without returning the third volume to its shelf berryman took down a fourth with chest expanded he appeared about to use the books as dumbbells  quite so said trimmer the change from duelling to law courts is profoundly  whether he were going to say significant or insignificant in sheltons estimate he did not know himself fortunately berryman broke in  law courts or not when a man runs away with a wife of mine i shall punch his head  come come said turner spasmodically grasping his two wings  shelton had a gleam of inspiration if your wife deceived you he thought looking at trimmers eyes you d keep it quiet and hold it over her  washer passed his hand over his pale chaps his smile had never wavered he looked like one for ever lost in the making of an epigram  the punching theorist stretched his body holding the books level with his shoulders as though to stone his hearers with his point of view his face grew paler his fine eyes finer his lips ironical almost painful was this combination of the strong man and the student who was bound to go to pieces if you hit him a smart blow  as for forgiving faithless wives he said and all that sort of thing i dont believe in sentiment  the words were highpitched and sarcastic shelton looked hastily around all their faces were complacent he grew red and suddenly remarked in a soft clear voice  i see  he was conscious that he had never before made an impression of this sort and that he never would again the cold hostility flashing out all round was most enlightening it instantly gave way to the polite satirical indulgence peculiar to highlycultivated men crocker rose nervously he seemed scared and was obviously relieved when shelton following his example grasped the little fat mans hand who said goodnight in a voice shaken by tobacco  who are your unshaven friends he heard as the door was closed behind them     chapter xix  an incident  eleven oclock said crocker as they went out of college i dont feel sleepy shall we stroll along the high a bit  shelton assented he was too busy thinking of his encounter with the dons to heed the soreness of his feet this too was the last day of his travels for he had not altered his intention of waiting at oxford till july  we call this place the heart of knowledge he said passing a great building that presided white and silent over darkness it seems to me as little that as society is the heart of true gentility  crockers answer was a grunt he was looking at the stars calculating possibly in how long he could walk to heaven  no proceeded shelton weve too much commonsense up here to strain our minds we know when its time to stop we pile up news of papias and all the verbs in ui but as for news of life or of oneself real seekers after knowledge are a different sort they fight in the darkno quarter given we dont grow that sort up here  how jolly the limes smell said crocker  he had halted opposite a garden and taken hold of shelton by a button of his coat his eyes like a dogs stared wistfully it seemed as though he wished to speak but feared to give offence  they tell you pursued shelton that we learn to be gentlemen up here we learn that better through one incident that stirs our hearts than we learn it here in all the time were up  hum muttered crocker twisting at the button those fellows who seemed the best sorts up here have turned out the best sorts afterwards  i hope not said shelton gloomily i was a snob when i was up here i believed all i was told anything that made things pleasant my set were nothing but  crocker smiled in the darkness he had been too cranky to belong to sheltons set  you never were much like your set old chap he said  shelton turned away sniffing the perfume of the limes images were thronging through his mind the faces of his old friends strangely mixed with those of people he had lately metthe girl in the train ferrand the lady with the short round powdered face the little barber others too and floating mysteriousconnected with them all antonias face the scent of the limetrees drifted at him with its magic sweetness from the street behind the footsteps of the passersby sounded muffled yet exact and on the breeze was borne the strain for hes a jolly good fellow  for hes a jolly good fellow for hes a jolly good feellow and so say all of us  ah he said they were good chaps  i used to think said crocker dreamily that some of them had too much side  and shelton laughed  the thing sickens me said he the whole snobbish selfish business the place sickens me lined with cottonwoolmade so beastly comfortable  crocker shook his head  its a splendid old place he said his eyes fastening at last on sheltons boots you know old chap he stammered i think youyou ought to take care  take care what of  crocker pressed his arm convulsively  dont be waxy old boy he said i mean that you seem somehowto beto be losing yourself  losing myself finding myself you mean  crocker did not answer his face was disappointed of what exactly was he thinking in sheltons heart there was a bitter pleasure in knowing that his friend was uncomfortable on his account a sort of contempt a sort of aching crocker broke the silence  i think i shall do a bit more walking tonight he said i feel very fit dont you really mean to come any further with me bird  and there was anxiety in his voice as though shelton were in danger of missing something good the latters feet had instantly begun to ache and burn  no he said you know what im staying here for  crocker nodded  she lives near here well then ill say goodbye i should like to do another ten miles tonight  my dear fellow youre tired and lame  crocker chuckled  no he said i want to get on see you in london goodbye and gripping sheltons hand he turned and limped away  shelton called after him dont be an idiot you ll only knock yourself up  but the sole answer was the pale moon of crockers face screwed round towards him in the darkness and the waving of his stick  shelton strolled slowly on leaning over the bridge he watched the oily gleam of lamps on the dark water underneath the trees he felt relieved yet sorry his thoughts were random curious half mutinous half sweet that afternoon five years ago when he had walked back from the river with antonia across the christchurch meadows was vivid to his mind the scent of that afternoon had never died away from himthe aroma of his love soon she would be his wifehis wife the faces of the dons sprang up before him they had wives perhaps fat lean satirical and compromisingwhat was it that through diversity they had in common cultured intolerance    honour    a queer subject to discuss honour the honour that made a fuss and claimed its rights and shelton smiled as if mans honour suffered when hes injured and slowly he walked along the echoing empty street to his room at the bishops head next morning he received the following wire       thirty miles left eighteen hours heel bad but going      strong                         crocker  he passed a fortnight at the bishops head waiting for the end of his probation and the end seemed long in coming to be so near antonia and as far as if he lived upon another planet was worse than ever each day he took a sculling skiff and pulled down to near holm oaks on the chance of her being on the river but the house was two miles off and the chance but slender she never came after spending the afternoons like this he would return pulling hard against the stream with a queer feeling of relief dine heartily and fall adreaming over his cigar each morning he awoke in an excited mood devoured his letter if he had one and sat down to write to her these letters of his were the most amazing portion of that fortnight they were remarkable for failing to express any single one of his real thoughts but they were full of sentiments which were not what he was truly feeling and when he set himself to analyse he had such moments of delirium that he was scared and shocked and quite unable to write anything he made the discovery that no two human beings ever tell each other what they really feel except perhaps in situations with which he could not connect antonias iceblue eyes and brilliant smile all the world was too engaged in planning decency  absorbed by longings he but vaguely realised the turmoil of commemoration which had gathered its hundreds for their annual cure of salmon mayonnaise and cheap champagne in preparation for his visit to holm oaks he shaved his beard and had some clothes sent down from london with them was forwarded a letter from ferrand which ran as follows   imperial peacock hotel folkestone  june 20  my dear sir  forgive me for not having written to you before but i have been so bothered that i have felt no taste for writing when i have the time i have some curious stories to tell you once again i have encountered that demon of misfortune which dogs my footsteps being occupied all day and nearly all night upon business which brings me a heap of worries and next to no profit i have no chance to look after my things thieves have entered my room stolen everything and left me an empty box i am once again almost without clothes and know not where to turn to make that figure necessary for the fulfilment of my duties you see i am not lucky since coming to your country the sole piece of fortune i have had was to tumble on a man like you excuse me for not writing more at this moment hoping that you are in good health and in affectionately pressing your hand  i am  always your devoted  louis ferrand   upon reading this letter shelton had once more a sense of being exploited of which he was ashamed he sat down immediately and wrote the following reply   bishops head hotel oxford  june 25  my dear ferrand  i am grieved to hear of your misfortunes i was much hoping that you had made a better start i enclose you post office orders for four pounds always glad to hear from you  yours sincerely  richard shelton   he posted it with the satisfaction that a man feels who nobly shakes off his responsibilities  three days before july he met with one of those disturbing incidents which befall no persons who attend quietly to their property and reputation  the night was unbearably hot and he had wandered out with his cigar a woman came sidling up and spoke to him he perceived her to be one of those made by men into mediums for their pleasure to feel sympathy with whom was sentimental her face was flushed her whisper hoarse she had no attractions but the curves of a tawdry figure shelton was repelled by her proprietary tone by her blowzy face and by the scent of patchouli her touch on his arm startled him sending a shiver through his marrow he almost leaped aside and walked the faster but her breathing as she followed sounded laboured it suddenly seemed pitiful that a woman should be panting after him like that  the least i can do he thought is to speak to her he stopped and with a mixture of hardness and compassion said it s impossible  in spite of her smile he saw by her disappointed eyes that she accepted the impossibility  i m sorry he said  she muttered something shelton shook his head  i m sorry he said once more goodnight  the woman bit her lower lip  goodnight she answered dully  at the corner of the street he turned his head the woman was hurrying uneasily a policeman coming from behind had caught her by the arm  his heart began to beat heavens he thought what shall i do now his first impulse was to walk away and think no more about itto act indeed like any averagely decent man who did not care to be concerned in such affairs  he retraced his steps however and halted half a dozen paces from their figures  ask the gentleman he spoke to me she was saying in her brassy voice through the emphasis of which shelton could detect her fear  thats all right returned the policeman we know all about that  youpolice cried the woman tearfully i ve got to get my living have nt i the same as you  shelton hesitated then catching the expression in her frightened face stepped forward the policeman turned and at the sight of his pale heavy jowl cut by the cheekstrap and the bullying eyes he felt both hate and fear as if brought face to face with all that he despised and loathed yet strangely dreaded the cold certainty of law and order upholding the strong treading underfoot the weak the smug front of meanness that only the purest spirits may attack seemed to be facing him and the odd thing was this man was only carrying out his duty shelton moistened his lips  youre not going to charge her  arent i returned the policeman  look here constable you re making a mistake  the policeman took out his notebook  oh i m making a mistake i ll take your name and address please we have to report these things  by all means said shelton angrily giving it i spoke to her first  perhaps youll come up to the court tomorrow morning and repeat that replied the policeman with incivility  shelton looked at him with all the force at his command  you had better be careful constable he said but in the act of uttering these words he thought how pitiable they sounded  we re not to be trifled with returned the policeman in a threatening voice  shelton could think of nothing but to repeat  you had better be careful constable  youre a gentleman replied the policeman im only a policeman youve got the riches ive got the power  grasping the womans arm he began to move along with her  shelton turned and walked away  he went to grinnings club and flung himself down upon a sofa his feeling was not one of pity for the woman nor of peculiar anger with the policeman but rather of dissatisfaction with himself  what ought i to have done he thought the beggar was within his rights  he stared at the pictures on the wall and a tide of disgust surged up in him  one or other of us he reflected we make these women what they are and when weve made them we cant do without them we dont want to but we give them no proper homes so that theyre reduced to prowl about the streets and then we run them in ha thats goodthats excellent we run them in and here we sit and carp but what do we do nothing our system is the most highly moral known we get the benefit without soiling even the hem of our phylacteriesthe women are the only ones that suffer and why should nt theyinferior things  he lit a cigarette and ordered the waiter to bring a drink  ill go to the court he thought but suddenly it occurred to him that the case would get into the local papers the press would never miss so nice a little bit of scandalgentleman v policeman and he had a vision of antonias father a neighbouring and conscientious magistrate solemnly reading this someone at all events was bound to see his name and make a point of mentioning it too good to be missed and suddenly he saw with horror that to help the woman he would have to assert again that he had spoken to her first i must go to the court he kept thinking as if to assure himself that he was not a coward  he lay awake half the night worrying over this dilemma  but i did nt speak to her first he told himself i shall only be telling a lie and they ll make me swear it too  he tried to persuade himself that this was against his principles but at the bottom of his heart he knew that he would not object to telling such a lie if only guaranteed immune from consequences it appeared to him indeed but obvious humanity  but why should i suffer he thought ive done nothing its neither reasonable nor just  he hated the unhappy woman who was causing him these horrors of uncertainty whenever he decided one way or other the policemans face with its tyrannical and muddy eyes rose before him like a nightmare and forced him to an opposite conviction he fell asleep at last with the full determination to go and see what happened  he woke with a sense of odd disturbance i can do no good by going he thought remembering aid lying very still they re certain to believe the policeman i shall only blacken myself for nothing and the combat began again within him but with far less fury it was not what other people thought not even the risk of perjury that mattered all this he made quite clearit was antonia it was not fair to her to put himself in such a false position in fact not decent  he breakfasted in the room were some americans and the face of one young girl reminded him a little of antonia fainter and fainter grew the incident it seemed to have its right proportions  two hours later looking at the clock he found that it was lunchtime he had not gone had not committed perjury but he wrote to a daily paper pointing out the danger run by the community from the power which a belief in their infallibility places in the hands of the policehow since they are the sworn abettors of right and justice their word is almost necessarily taken to be gospel how one and all they hang together from mingled interest and esprit de corps was it not he said reasonable to suppose that amongst thousands of human beings invested with such opportunities there would be found bullies who would take advantage of them and rise to distinction in the service upon the helplessness of the unfortunate and the cowardice of people with anything to lose those who had in their hands the sacred duties of selecting a practically irresponsible body of men were bound for the sake of freedom and humanity to exercise those duties with the utmost care and thoroughness      however true none of this helped him to think any better of himself at heart and he was haunted by the feeling that a stout and honest bit of perjury was worth more than a letter to a daily paper  he never saw his letter printed containing as it did the germs of an unpalatable truth  in the afternoon he hired a horse and galloped on port meadow the strain of his indecision over he felt like a man recovering from an illness and he carefully abstained from looking at the local papers there was that within him however which resented the worsting of his chivalry     chapter xx  holm oaks  holm oaks stood back but little from the roadan old manorhouse not set upon display but dwelling close to its barns stables and walled gardens like a good mother long flatroofed red it had queen anne windows on whose whiteframed diamond panes the sunbeams glinted  in front of it a fringe of elms of all trees the tree of most established principle bordered the stretch of turf between the gravel drive and road and these elms were the homes of rooks of all birds the most conventional a huge aspenimpressionable creatureshivered and shook beyond apologising for appearance among such imperturbable surroundings it was frequented by a cuckoo who came once a year to hoot at the rules of life but seldom made long stay for boys threw stones at it exasperated by the absence of its morals  the village which clustered in the dip had not yet lost its dread of motorcars about this group of flatfaced cottages with gabled roofs the scent of hay manure and roses clung continually just now the odour of the limes troubled its servile sturdiness beyond the dip again a squaretowered church kept within grey walls the record of the village flock births deaths and marriageseven the births of bastards even the deaths of suicidesand seemed to stretch a hand invisible above the heads of common folk to grasp the forgers of the manorhouse decent and discreet the two roofs caught the eye to the exclusion of all meaner dwellings seeming to have joined in a conspiracy to keep them out of sight  the july sun had burned his face all the way from oxford yet pale was shelton when he walked up the drive and rang the bell  mrs dennant at home dobson he asked of the grave butler who old servant that he was still wore coloured trousers for it was not yet twelve oclock and he regarded coloured trousers up to noon as a sacred distinction between the footmen and himself  mrs dennant replied this personage raising his round and hairless face while on his mouth appeared that apologetic pout which comes of living with good familiesmrs dennant has gone into the village sir but miss antonia is in the morningroom  shelton crossed the panelled lowroofed hall through whose far side the lawn was visible a vision of serenity he mounted six wide shallow steps and stopped from behind a closed door there came the sound of scales and he stood a prey to his emotions the notes mingling in his ears with the beating of his heart he softly turned the handle a fixed smile on his lips  antonia was at the piano her head was bobbing to the movements of her fingers and pressing down the pedals were her slim monotonously moving feet she had been playing tennis for a racquet and her tamoshanter were flung down and she was dressed in a blue skirt and creamy blouse fitting collarless about her throat her face was flushed and wore a little frown and as her fingers raced along the keys her neck swayed and the silk clung and shivered on her arms  sheltons eyes fastened on the silent counting lips on the fair hair about her forehead the darker eyebrows slanting down towards the nose the undimpled cheeks with the faint fingermarks beneath the iceblue eyes the softlypouting and undimpled chin the whole remote sweet suntouched glacial face  she turned her head and springing up cried  dick what fun she gave him both her hands but her smiling face said very plainly oh dont let us be sentimental  are nt you glad to see me muttered shelton  glad to see you you are funny dickas if you did nt know why you ve shaved your beard mother and sybil have gone into the village to see old mrs hopkins shall we go out thea and the boys are playing tennis its so jolly that you ve come she caught up the tamoshanter and pinned it to her hair almost as tall as shelton she looked taller with arms raised and loose sleeves quivering like wings to the movements of her fingers we might have a game before lunch you can have my other racquet  ive got no things said shelton blankly  her calm glance ran over him  you can have some of old bernards hes got any amount ill wait for you she swung her racquet looked at shelton cried be quick and vanished  shelton ran upstairs and dressed in the undecided way of men assuming other peoples clothes she was in the hall when he descended humming a tune and prodding at her shoe her smile showed all her pearly upper teeth he caught hold of her sleeve and whispered  antonia  the colour rushed into her cheeks she looked back across her shoulder  come along old dick she cried and flinging open the glass door ran into the garden  shelton followed  the tennisground was divided by tall netting from a paddock a holm oak tree shaded one corner and its thick dark foliage gave an unexpected depth to the green smoothness of the scene as shelton and antonia came up bernard dennant stopped and cordially grasped sheltons hand from the far side of the net thea in a shortish skirt tossed back her straight fair hair and warding off the sun came strolling up to them the umpire a small boy of twelve was lying on his stomach squealing and tickling a collie shelton bent and pulled his hair  hallo toddles you young ruffian  one and all they stood round shelton and there was a frank and pitiless inquiry in their eyes in the angle of their noses something chaffing and distrustful as though about him were some subtle poignant scent exciting curiosity and disapproval  when the setts were over and the girls resting in the double hammock underneath the holm oak shelton went with bernard to the paddock to hunt for the lost balls  i say old chap said his old schoolfellow smiling dryly youre in for a wigging from the mater  a wigging murmured shelton  i dont know much about it but from something she let drop it seems youve been saying some queer things in your letters to antonia and again he looked at shelton with his dry smile  queer things said the latter angrily what d you mean  oh dont ask me the mater thinks shes in a bad wayunsettled or what d you call at youve been telling her that things are not what they seem thats bad you know and still smiling he shook his head  shelton dropped his eyes  well they are nt he said  oh thats all right but dont bring your philosophy down here old chap  philosophy said shelton puzzled  leave us a sacred prejudice or two  sacred nothings sacred except but shelton did not finish his remark i dont understand he said  ideals that sort of thing youve been diving down below the line of practical politics thats about the size of it my boy and stooping suddenly he picked up the last ball there is the mater shelton saw mrs dennant coming down the lawn with her second daughter sybil  by the time they reached the holm oak the three girls had departed towards the house walking arm in arm and mrs dennant was standing there alone in a grey dress talking to an undergardener her hands cased in tan gauntlets held a basket which warded off the bearded gardener from the severe but ample lines of her usefullooking skirt the collie erect upon his haunches looked at their two faces pricking his ears in his endeavour to appreciate how one of these two bipeds differed from the other  thank you that ll do bunyan ah dick charmin to see you here at last  in his intercourse with mrs dennant shelton never failed to mark the typical nature of her personality it always seemed to him that he had met so many other ladies like her he felt that her undoubtable quality had a nonindividual flavour as if standing for her class she thought that standing for herself was not the thing yet she was full of character tall with nose a trifle beaked long sloping chin and an assured benevolent mouth showing perhaps too many teeththough thin she was not unsubstantial her accent in speaking showed her heritage it was a kind of drawl which disregarded vulgar merits such as tone leaned on some syllables and despised the final gthe peculiar accent in fact of aristocracy adding its deliberate joys to life  shelton knew that she had many interests she was never really idle from the time 7 am when her maid brought her a little china pot of tea with a single biscuit and her pet dog tops till eleven oclock at night when she lighted a wax candle in a silver candlestick and with this in one hand and in the other a new novel or better still one of those charming volumes written by great people about the still greater people they have met she said goodnight to her children and her guests no what with photography the presidency of a local league visiting the rich superintending all the poor gardening reading keeping all her ideas so tidy that no foreign notions might stray in she was never idle the information she collected from these sources was both vast and varied but she never let it flavour her opinions which lacked sauce and were drawn from some sort of dish into which with all her class she dipped her fingers  he liked her no one could help liking her she was kind and of such good quality with a suggestion about her of thin excellent and useful china and she was scented toonot with verbena violets or those essences which women love but with nothing as if she had taken stand against all meretricity in her intercourse with persons not quite the thing she excepted the vicar from this category though his father had dealt in haberdashery her refinement gently unobtrusively and with great practical good sense seemed continually to murmur i am and youwell are you dont you know but there was no selfconsciousness about this attitude for she was really not a common woman she simply could not help it all her people had done this their nurses breathed above them in their cradles something that inhaled into their systems ever afterwards prevented them from taking good clear breaths and her manner ah her mannerit concealed the inner woman so as to leave doubt of her existence  shelton listened to the kindly briskness with which she dwelt upon the undergardener  poor bunyan he lost his wife six months ago and was quite cheerful just at first but now he s really too distressin i ve done all i can to rouse him its so melancholy to see him mopin and my dear dick the way he mangles the new rosetrees im afraid hes goin mad i shall have to send him away poor fellow  it was clear that she sympathised with bunyan or rather believed him entitled to a modicum of wholesome grief the loss of wives being a canonised and legal sorrow but excesses o dear no  i ve told him i shall raise his wages she sighed he used to be such a splendid gardener that reminds me my dear dick i want to have a talk with you shall we go in to lunch  consulting the memorandumbook in which she had been noting the case of mrs hopkins she slightly preceded shelton to the house  it was somewhat late that afternoon when shelton had his wigging nor did it seem to him hypnotised by the momentary absence of antonia such a very serious affair  now dick the honourable mrs dennant said in her decisive drawl i dont think it s right to put ideas into antonias head  ideas murmured shelton in confusion  we all know continued mrs dennant that things are not always what they ought to be  shelton looked at her she was seated at her writingtable addressing in her large free writing a dinner invitation to a bishop there was not the faintest trace of awkwardness about her yet shelton could not help a certain sense of shock if sheshedid not think things were what they ought to bein a bad way things must be indeed  things he muttered  mrs dennant looked at him firmly but kindly with the eyes that would remind him of a hares  she showed me some of your letters you know well it s not a bit of use denyin my dear dick that youve been thinkin too much lately  shelton perceived that he had done her an injustice she handled things as she handled undergardenersput them away when they showed signs of running to extremes  i cant help that i m afraid he answered  my dear boy youll never get on that way now i want you to promise me you wont talk to antonia about those sort of things  shelton raised his eyebrows  oh you know what i mean  he saw that to press mrs dennant to say what she meant by things would really hurt her sense of form it would be cruel to force her thus below the surface  he therefore said quite so  to his extreme surprise flushing the peculiar and pathetic flush of women past their prime she drawled out  about the poorand criminalsand marriagesthere was that wedding dont you know  shelton bowed his head motherhood had been too strong for her in her maternal flutter she had committed the solecism of touching in so many words on things  does nt she really see the fun he thought in one man dining out of gold and another dining in the gutter or in two married people living on together in perfect discord pour encourages les autres or in worshipping jesus christ and claiming all her rights at the same time or in despising foreigners because they are foreigners or in war or in anything that is funny but he did her a certain amount of justice by recognising that this was natural since her whole life had been passed in trying not to see the fun in all these things  but antonia stood smiling in the doorway brilliant and gay she looked yet resentful as if she knew they had been talking of her she sat down by sheltons side and began asking him about the youthful foreigner whom he had spoken of and her eyes made him doubt whether she too saw the fun that lay in one human being patronising others  but i suppose hes really good she said i mean all those things he told you about were only  good he answered fidgeting i dont really know what the word means  her eyes clouded dick how can you they seemed to say  shelton stroked her sleeve  tell us about mr crocker she said taking no heed of his caress  the lunatic he said  lunatic why in your letters he was splendid  so he is said shelton half ashamed hes not a bit mad reallythat is i only wish i were half as mad  whos that mad queried mrs dennant from behind the urntom crocker ah yes i knew his mother she was a springer  did he do it in the week said thea appearing in the window with a kitten  i dont know shelton was obliged to answer  thea shook back her hair  i call it awfully slack of you not to have found out she said  antonia frowned  you were very sweet to that young foreigner dick she murmured with a smile at shelton i wish that we could see him  but shelton shook his head  it seems to me he muttered that i did about as little for him as i could  again her face grew thoughtful as though his words had chilled her  i dont see what more you could have done she answered  a desire to get close to her half fear half ache a sense of futility and bafflement an inner burning made him feel as though a flame were licking at his heart     chapter xxi  english  just as shelton was starting to walk back to oxford he met mr dennant coming from a ride antonias father was a spare man of medium height with yellowish face grey moustache ironical eyebrows and some tiny crowsfeet in his old short grey coat with a little slit up the middle of the back his drab cord breeches ancient mahogany leggings and carefully blacked boats he had a dry threadbare quality not without distinction  ah shelton he said in his quietly festive voice glad to see the pilgrim here at last youre not off already and laying his hand on sheltons arm he proposed to walk a little way with him across the fields  this was the first time they had met since the engagement and shelton began to nerve himself to express some sentiment however bald about it he squared his shoulders cleared his throat and looked askance at mr dennant that gentleman was walking stiffly his cord breeches faintly squeaking he switched a yellow jointed cane against his leggings and after each blow looked at his legs satirically he himself was rather like that yellow canepale and slim and jointed with features arching just a little like the arching of its handle  they say itll be a bad year for fruit shelton said at last  my dear fellow you dont know your farmer i m afraid we ought to hang some farmersdo a world of good dear souls ive got some perfect strawberries  i suppose said shelton glad to postpone the evil moment in a climate like this a man must grumble  quite so quite so look at us poor slaves of landowners if i couldnt abuse the farmers i should be wretched did you ever see anything finer than this pasture and they want me to lower their rents  and mr dennants glance satirically wavered rested on shelton and whisked back to the ground as though he had seen something that alarmed him there was a pause  now for it thought the younger man  mr dennant kept his eyes fixed on his boots  if theyd said now he remarked jocosely that the frost had nipped the partridges there d have been some sense in it but what can you expect theyve no consideration dear souls  shelton took a breath and with averted eyes he hurriedly began  its awfully hard sir to  mr dennant switched his cane against his shin  yes he said it s awfully hard to put up with but what can a fellow do one must have farmers why if it was nt for the farmers there d be still a hare or two about the place  shelton laughed spasmodically again he glanced askance at his future fatherinlaw what did the waggling of his head mean the deepening of his crowsfeet the odd contraction of the mouth and his eye caught mr dennants eye its expression was queer above the fine dry nose one of the sort that reddens in a wind  ive never had much to do with farmers he said at last  have nt you lucky fellow the mostyes quite the most trying portion of the human speciesnext to daughters  well sir you can hardly expect me began shelton  i dontoh i dont d you know i really believe were in for a ducking  a large black cloud had covered up the sun and some drops were spattering on mr dennants hard felt hat  shelton welcomed the shower it appeared to him an intervention on the part of providence he would have to say something but not now later  i ll go on he said i dont mind the rain but youd better get back sir  dear me ive a tenant in this cottage said mr dennant in his leisurely dry manner and a beggar he is to poach too least we can do s to ask for a little shelter what do you think and smiling sarcastically as though deprecating his intention to keep dry he rapped on the door of a prosperouslooking cottage  it was opened by a girl of antonias age and height  ah phoebe your father in  no replied the girl fluttering fathers out mr dennant  so sorry will you let us bide a bit out of the rain  the sweetlooking phoebe dusted them two chairs and curtseying left them in the parlour  what a pretty girl said shelton  yes shes a pretty girl half the young fellows are after her but she wont leave her father oh he s a charming rascal is that fellow  this remark suddenly brought home to shelton the conviction that he was further than ever from avoiding the necessity for speaking he walked over to the window the rain was coming down with fury though a golden line far down the sky promised the showers quick end for goodness sake he thought let me say something however idiotic and get it over but he did not turn a kind of paralysis had seized on him  tremendous heavy rain he said at last coming down in waterspouts  it would have been just as easy to say i believe your daughter to be the sweetest thing on earth i love her and i m going to make her happy just as easy just about the same amount of breath required but he couldnt say it he watched the rain stream and hiss against the leaves and churn the dust on the parched road with its insistent torrent and he noticed with precision all the details of the process going on outside how the raindrops darted at the leaves like spears and how the leaves shook themselves free a hundred times a minute while little runnels of water iceclear rolled over their edges soft and quick he noticed too the mournful head of a sheltering cow that was chewing at the hedge  mr dennant had not replied to his remark about the rain so disconcerting was this silence that shelton turned his future fatherinlaw upon his wooden chair was staring at his wellblacked boots bending forward above his parted knees and prodding at the carpet a glimpse at his face disturbed sheltons resolution it was not forbidding stern discouragingnot in the least it had merely for the moment ceased to look satirical this was so startling that shelton lost his chance of speaking there seemed a heart to mr dennants gravity as though for once he were looking grave because he felt so but glancing up at shelton his dry jocosity reappeared at once  what a day for ducks he said and again there was unmistakable alarm about the eye was it possible that he too dreaded something  i cant express began shelton hurriedly  yes its beastly to get wet said mr dennant and he sang            for we can wrestle and fight my boys           and jump out anywhere  you ll be with us for that dinnerparty next week eh capital theres the bishop of blumenthal and old sir jack buckwell i must get my wife to put you between them            for its my delight of a starry night  the bishops a great antidivorce man and old buckwell s been in the court at least twice            in the season of the year  will you please to take some tea gentlemen said the voice of phoebe in the doorway  no thank you phoebe that girl ought to get married went on mr dennant as phoebe blushingly withdrew a flush showed queerly on his sallow cheeks a shame to keep her tied like this to her fathers apronstringsselfish fellow that he looked up sharply as if he had made a dangerous remark            the keeper he was watching us           for him we did nt care  shelton suddenly felt certain that antonias father was just as anxious to say something expressive of his feelings and as unable as himself and this was comforting  you know sir he began  but mr dennants eyebrows rose his crowsfeet twinkled his personality seemed to shrink together  by jove he said its stopped nows our chance come along my dear fellow delays are dangerous and with his bantering courtesy he held the door for shelton to pass out i think well part here he saidi almost think so good luck to you  he held out his dry yellow hand shelton seized it wrung it hard and muttered the word  grateful  again mr dennants eyebrows quivered as if they had been tweaked he had been found out and he disliked it the colour in his face had died away it was calm wrinkled deadlooking under the flattened narrow brim of his black hat his grey moustache drooped thinly the crowsfeet hardened round his eyes his nostrils were distended by the queerest smile  gratitude he said almost a vice is nt it goodnight  sheltons face quivered he raised his hat and turning as abruptly as his senior proceeded on his way he had been playing in a comedy that could only have been played in england he could afford to smile now at his past discomfort having no longer the sense of duty unfulfilled everything had been said that was right and proper to be said in the way that we such things should say no violence had been done he could afford to smilesmile at himself at mr dennant at tomorrow smile at the sweet aroma of the earth the shy unwilling sweetness that only rain brings forth     chapter xxii  the country house  the luncheon hour at holm oaks was as in many wellbred country housesout of the shooting season be it understoodthe soulful hour the ferment of the daily doings was then at its full height and the clamour of its conversation on the weather and the dogs the horses neighbours cricket golf was mingled with a literary murmur for the dennants were superior and it was quite usual to hear remarks like these have you read that charmin thing of posers or yes ive got the new edition of old bablington delightfully boundso light and it was in july that holm oaks as a gatheringplace of the elect was at its best for in july it had become customary to welcome there many of those poor souls from london who arrived exhausted by the season and than whom no seamstress in a twopair back could better have earned a holiday the dennants themselves never went to london for the season it was their good pleasure not to a week or fortnight of it satisfied them they had a radical weakness for fresh air and antonia even after her presentation two seasons back had insisted on returning home stigmatising london balls as stuffy things  when shelton arrived the stream had only just begun but every day brought fresh or rather jaded people to occupy the old dark sweetsmelling bedrooms individually he liked his fellowguests but he found himself observing them he knew that if a man judged people singly almost all were better than himself only when judged in bulk were they worthy of the sweeping criticisms he felt inclined to pass on them he knew this just as he knew that the conventions having been invented to prevent man following his natural desires were merely the disapproving sums of innumerable individual approvals  it was in the bulk then that he found himself observing but with his amiability and dread of notoriety he remained to all appearance a wellbred docile creature and he kept his judgments to himself  in the matter of intellect he made a rough division of the gueststhose who accepted things without a murmur those who accepted them with carping jocularity in the matter of morals he found they all accepted things without the semblance of a kick to show sign of private moral judgment was to have lost your soul and worse to be a bit of an outsider he gathered this by intuition rather than from conversation for conversation naturally tabooed such questions and was carried on in the loud and cheerful tones peculiar to people of good breeding shelton had never been able to acquire this tone and he could not help feeling that the inability made him more or less an object of suspicion the atmosphere struck him as it never had before causing him to feel a doubt of his gentility could a man suffer from passion heartsearchings or misgivings and remain a gentleman it seemed improbable one of his fellowguests a man called edgbaston smalleyed and semibald with a dark moustache and a distinguished air of meanness disconcerted him one day by remarking of an unknown person a halfbred lookin chap did nt seem to know his mind shelton was harassed by a horrid doubt  everything seemed divided into classes carefully docketed and valued for instance a briton was of more value than a man and wives than women those things or phases of life with which people had no personal acquaintance were regarded with a faint amusement and a certain disapproval the principles of the upper class in fact were strictly followed  he was in that hypersenstive and nervous state favourable for recording currents foreign to itself things he had never before noticed now had profound effect on him such as the tone in which men spoke of womennot precisely with hostility nor exactly with contempt best perhaps described as cultured jeering never of course when men spoke of their own wives mothers sisters or immediate friends but merely when they spoke of any other women he reflected upon this and came to the conclusion that among the upper classes each mans own property was holy while other women were created to supply him with gossip jests and spice another thing that struck him was the way in which the war then going on was made into an affair of class in their view it was a baddish business because poor hack blank and peter blankblank had lost their lives and poor teddy blank had now one arm instead of two humanity in general was omitted but not the upper classes nor incidentally the country which belonged to them for there they were all seated in a row with eyes fixed on the horizon of their lawns  late one evening billiards and music being over and the ladies gone shelton returned from changing to his smokingsuit and dropped into one of the great armchairs that even in summer made a semicircle round the fendered hearth fresh from his goodnight parting with antonia he sat perhaps ten minutes before he began to take in all the figures in their particoloured smoking jackets crosslegged with glasses in their hands and cigars between their teeth  the man in the next chair roused him by putting down his tumbler with a tap and seating himself upon the cushioned fender through the mist of smoke with shoulders hunched elbows and knees crooked out cigar protruding beakways below his nose and the crimson collar of his smoking jacket buttoned close as plumage on his breast he looked a little like a gorgeous bird  they do you awfully well he said  a voice from the chair on sheltons right replied  they do you better at verados  the veau dor s the best place they give you turkish baths for nothing drawled a fat man with a tiny mouth  the suavity of this pronouncement enfolded all as with a blessing and at once as if by magic in the old oakpanelled room the world fell naturally into its three departments that where they do you well that where they do you better and that where they give you turkish baths for nothing  if you want turkish baths said a tall youth with clean red face who had come into the room and stood his mouth a little open and long feet jutting with sweet helplessness in front of him you should go you know to buda pesth most awfully rippin there  shelton saw an indescribable appreciation rise on every face as though they had been offered truffles or something equally delicious  oh no poodles said the man perched on the fender a johnny i know tells me they re nothing to sofia his face was transfigured by the subtle gloating of a man enjoying vice by proxy  ah drawled the smallmouthed man there s nothing fit to hold a candle to baghdaad  once again his utterance enfolded all as with a blessing and once again the world fell into its three departments that where they do you well that where they do you better andbaghdad  shelton thought to himself why dont i know a place thats better than baghdad  he felt so insignificant it seemed that he knew none of these delightful spots that he was of no use to any of his fellowmen though privately he was convinced that all these speakers were as ignorant as himself and merely found it warming to recall such things as they had heard with that peculiar gloating look alas his anecdotes would never earn for him that prize of persons in society the label of a good chap and sportsman  have you ever been in baghdad he feebly asked  the fat man did not answer he had begun an anecdote and in his broad expanse of face his tiny mouth writhed like a caterpillar the anecdote was humorous  with the exception of antonia shelton saw but little of the ladies for following the wellknown custom of the country house men and women avoided each other as much as might be they met at meals and occasionally joined in tennis and in croquet otherwise it seemedalmost orientallyagreed that they were better kept apart  chancing one day to enter the withdrawing room while searching for antonia he found that he had lighted on a feminine discussion he would have beaten a retreat of course but it seemed too obvious that he was merely looking for his fiancee so sitting down he listened  the honourable charlotte penguin still knitting a silk tiethe sixth since that she had been knitting at hyeressat on the low windowseat close to a hydrangea the petals of whose round flowers almost kissed her sanguine cheek her eyes were fixed with languid aspiration on the lady who was speaking this was a square woman of medium height with grey hair brushed from her low forehead the expression of whose face was brisk and rather cross she was standing with a book as if delivering a sermon had she been a man she might have been described as a bright young man of business for though grey she never could be old nor ever lose the power of forming quick decisions her features and her eyes were prompt and slightly hard tinged with faith fanatical in the justice of her judgments and she had that fussy simpleness of dress which indicates the right to meddle not red not white neither yellow nor quite blue her complexion was suffused with a certain mixture of these colours adapted to the climate and her smile had a strange sour sweetness like nothing but the flavour of an apple on the turn  i dont care what they tell you she was sayingnot offensively though her voice seemed to imply that she had no time to waste in pleasingin all my dealings with them ive found it best to treat them quite like children  a lady behind the times smiled her mouthindeed her whole hard handsome facewas reminiscent of dappled rockinghorses found in the soho bazaar she crossed her feet and some rich and silk stuff rustled her whole personality seemed to creak as without looking she answered in harsh tones  i find the poor are most delightful persons  sybil dennant seated on the sofa with a feathery laugh shot a barking terrier dog at shelton  heres dick she said well dick whats your opinion  shelton looked around him scared the elder ladies who had spoken had fixed their eyes on him and in their gaze he read his utter insignificance  oh that young man they seemed to say expect a practical remark from him now come  opinion he stammered of the poor i havent any  the person on her feet whose name was mrs mattock directing her peculiar sweetsour smile at the distinguished lady with the times said  perhaps you ve not had experience of them in london lady bonington  lady bonington in answer rustled  oh do tell us about the slums mrs mattock cried sybil  slumming must be splendid its so deadly herenothing but flannel petticoats  the poor my dear began mrs mattock are not the least bit what you think them  oh d you know i think theyre rather nice broke in aunt charlotte close to the hydrangea  you think so said mrs mattock sharply i find they do nothing but grumble  they dont grumble at me they are delightful persons and lady bonington gave shelton a grim smile  he could not help thinking that to grumble in the presence of that rich despotic personality would require a superhuman courage  theyre the most ungrateful people in the world said mrs mattock  why then thought shelton do you go amongst them  she continued one must do them good one must do ones duty but as to getting thanks  lady bonington sardonically said  poor things they have a lot to bear  the little children murmured aunt charlotte with a flushing cheek and shining eyes it s rather pathetic  children indeed said mrs mattock it puts me out of all patience to see the way that they neglect them people are so sentimental about the poor  lady bonington creaked again her splendid shoulders were wedged into her chair her fine dark hair gleaming with silver sprang back upon her brow a ruby bracelet glowed on the powerful wrist that held the journal she rocked her copperslippered foot she did not appear to be too sentimental  i know they often have a very easy time said mrs mattock as if some one had injured her severely and shelton saw not without pity that fate had scored her kind and squashedup face with wrinkles whose tiny furrows were eloquent of good intentions frustrated by the unpractical and discontented poor do what you will they are never satisfied they only resent ones help or else they take the help and never thank you for it  oh murmured aunt charlotte thats rather hard  shelton had been growing more uneasy he said abruptly  i should do the same if i were they  mrs mattocks brown eyes flew at him lady bonington spoke to the times her ruby bracelet and a bangle jingled  we ought to put ourselves in their places  shelton could not help a smile lady bonington in the places of the poor  oh exclaimed mrs mattock i put myself entirely in their place i quite understand their feelings but ingratitude is a repulsive quality  they seem unable to put themselves in your place murmured shelton and in a fit of courage he took the room in with a sweeping glance  yes that room was wonderfully consistent with its air of perfect secondhandedness as if each picture and each piece of furniture each book each lady present had been made from patterns they were all widely different yet all like works of art seen in some exhibitions had the look of being after the designs of some original spirit the whole room was chaste restrained derived practical and comfortable neither in virtue nor in work neither in manner speech appearance nor in theory could it give itself away     chapter xxiii  the stainedglass man  still looking for antonia shelton went up to the morningroom thea dennant and another girl were seated in the window talking from the look they gave him he saw that he had better never have been born he hastily withdrew descending to the hall he came on mr dennant crossing to his study with a handful of officiallooking papers  ah shelton said he you look a little lost is the shrine invisible  shelton grinned said yes and went on looking he was not fortunate in the diningroom sat mrs dennant making up her list of books  do give me your opinion dick she said everybody s readin this thing of katherine astericks i believe its simply because shes got a title  one must read a book for some reason or other answered shelton  well returned mrs dennant i hate doin things just because other people do them and i shant get it  good  mrs dennant marked the catalogue  here s linseeds last of course though i must say i dont care for him but i suppose we ought to have it in the house and theres qualitys the splendid diatribes that s sure to be good hes always so refined but what am i to do about this of arthur baals they say that hes a charlatan but everybody reads him dont you know and over the catalogue shelton caught the gleam of harelike eyes  decision had vanished from her face with its arched nose and slightly sloping chin as though some one had suddenly appealed to her to trust her instincts it was quite pathetic still there was always the books circulation to form her judgment by  i think i d better mark it she said dont you were you lookin for antonia if you come across bunyan in the garden dick do say i want to see him hes gettin to be a perfect nuisance i can understand his feelins but really he s carryin it too far  primed with his message to the undergardener shelton went he took a despairing look into the billiardroom antonia was not there instead a tall and fatcheeked gentleman with a neat moustache called mabbey was practising the spotstroke he paused as shelton entered and pouting like a baby asked in a sleepy voice  play me a hundred up  shelton shook his head stammered out his sorrow and was about to go  the gentleman called mabbey plaintively feeling the places where his moustaches joined his pink and glossy cheeks asked with an air of some surprise  whats your general game then  i really dont know said shelton  the gentleman called mabbey chalked his cue and moving his round knockkneed legs in their tight trousers took up his position for the stroke  what price that he said as he regained the perpendicular and his wellfed eyes followed shelton with sleepy inquisition curious dark horse shelton they seemed to say  shelton hurried out and was about to run down the lower lawn when he was accosted by another person walking in the sunshinea slightbuilt man in a turneddown collar with a thin and fair moustache and a faint bluish tint on one side of his high forehead caused by a network of thin veins his face had something of the youthful optimistic stainedglass look peculiar to the refined english type he walked elastically yet with trim precision as if he had a pleasant taste in furniture and churches and held the spectator in his hand  ah shelton he said in hightuned tones halting his legs in such an easy attitude that it was impossible to interrupt it come to take the air  sheltons own brown face nondescript nose and his amiable but dogged chin contrasted strangely with the clearcut features of the stainedglass man  i hear from halidome that youre going to stand for parliament the latter said  shelton recalling halidomes autocratic manner of settling other peoples business smiled  do i look like it he asked  the eyebrows quivered on the stainedglass man it had never occurred to him perhaps that to stand for parliament a man must look like it he examined shelton with some curiosity  ah well he said now you mention it perhaps not his eyes so carefully ironical although they differed from the eyes of mabbey also seemed to ask of shelton what sort of a dark horse he was  you re still in the domestic office then asked shelton  the stainedglass man stooped to sniff a rosebush yes he said it suits me very well i get lots of time for my art work  that must be very interesting said shelton whose glance was roving for antonia i never managed to begin a hobby  never had a hobby said the stainedglass man brushing back his hair he was walking with no hat why what the deuce d you do  shelton could not answer the idea had never troubled him  i really dont know he said embarrassed theres always something going on as far as i can see  the stainedglass man placed his hands within his pockets and his bright glance swept over his companion  a fellow must have a hobby to give him an interest in life he said  an interest in life repeated shelton grimly life itself is good enough for me  oh replied the stainedglass man as though he disapproved of regarding life itself as interesting  thats all very well but you want something more than that why dont you take up woodcarving  woodcarving  the moment i get fagged with office papers and that sort of thing i take up my woodcarving good as a game of hockey  i have nt the enthusiasm  the eyebrows of the stainedglass man twitched he twisted his moustache  you ll find not having a hobby does nt pay he said you ll get old then where ll you be  it came as a surprise that he should use the words it does nt pay for he had a kind of partially enamelled look like that modern jewellery which really seems unconscious of its market value  youve given up the bar dont you get awfully bored having nothing to do pursued the stainedglass man stopping before an ancient sundial  shelton felt a delicacy as a man naturally would in explaining that being in love was in itself enough to do to do nothing is unworthy of a man but he had never felt as yet the want of any occupation his silence in no way disconcerted his acquaintance  thats a nice old article of virtue he said pointing with his chin and walking round the sundial he made its acquaintance from the other side its grey profile cast a thin and shortening shadow on the turf tongues of moss were licking at its sides the daisies clustered thick around its base it had acquired a look of growing from the soil i should like to get hold of that the stainedglass man remarked i dont know when i ve seen a better specimen and he walked round it once again  his eyebrows were still ironically arched but below them his eyes were almost calculating and below them again his mouth had opened just a little a person with a keener eye would have said his face looked greedy and even shelton was surprised as though he had read in the spectator a confession of commercialism  you could nt uproot a thing like that he said it would lose all its charm  his companion turned impatiently and his countenance looked wonderfully genuine  couldnt i he said by jove i thought so 1690 the best period he ran his forger round the sundials edge splendid lineclean as the day they made it you dont seem to care much about that sort of thing and once again as though accustomed to the indifference of vandals his face regained its mask  they strolled on towards the kitchen gardens shelton still busy searching every patch of shade he wanted to say cant stop and hurry off but there was about the stainedglass man a something that while stinging sheltons feelings made the showing of them quite impossible feelings that person seemed to say all very well but you want more than that why not take up woodcarving    feelings i was born in england and have been at cambridge  are you staying long he asked shelton i go on to halidomes tomorrow suppose i shant see you there good chap old halidome collection of etchings very fine  no i m staying on said shelton  ah said the stainedglass man charming people the dennants  shelton reddening slowly turned his head away he picked a gooseberry and muttered yes  the eldest girl especially no nonsense about her i thought she was a particularly nice girl  shelton heard this praise of antonia with an odd sensation it gave him the reverse of pleasure as though the words had cast new light upon her he grunted hastily  i suppose you know that we re engaged  really said the stainedglass man and again his bright clear ironcommittal glance swept over sheltonreally i didnt know congratulate you  it was as if he said youre a man of taste i should say she would go well in almost any drawingroom  thanks said shelton there she is if youll excuse me i want to speak to her     chapter xxiv  paradise  antonia in a sunny angle of the old brick wall amid the pinks and poppies and cornflowers was humming to herself shelton saw the stainedglass man pass out of sight then unobserved he watched her smelling at the flowers caressing her face with each in turn casting away spoiled blossoms and all the time humming that soft tune  in two months or three all barriers between himself and this inscrutable young eve would break she would be a part of him and he a part of her he would know all her thoughts and she all his together they would be as one and all would think of them and talk of them as one and this would come about by standing half an hour together in a church by the passing of a ring and the signing of their names  the sun was burnishing her hairshe wore no hat flushing her cheeks sweetening and making sensuous her limbs it had warmed her through and through so that like the flowers and bees the sunlight and the air she was all motion light and colour  she turned and saw shelton standing there  oh dick she said lend me your handkerchief to put these flowers in there s a good boy  her candid eyes blue as the flowers in her hands were clear and cool as ice but in her smile was all the warm profusion of that corner the sweetness had soaked into her and was welling forth again the sight of those sunwarmed cheeks and fingers twining round the flowerstalks her pearly teeth and hair all fragrant stole the reason out of shelton he stood before her weak about the knees  found you at last he said  curving back her neck she cried out catch and with a sweep of both her hands flung the flowers into sheltons arms  under the rain of flowers all warm and odorous he dropped down on his knees and put them one by one together smelling at the pinks to hide the violence of his feelings antonia went on picking flowers and every time her hand was full she dropped them on his hat his shoulder or his arms and went on plucking more she smiled and on her lips a little devil danced that seemed to know what he was suffering and shelton felt that she did know  are you tired she asked there are heaps more wanted these are the bedroomflowersfourteen lots i cant think how people can live without flowers can you and close above his head she buried her face in pinks  he kept his eyes on the plucked flowers before him on the grass and forced himself to answer  i think i can hold out  poor old dick she had stepped back the sun lit the clearcut profile of her cheek and poured its gold over the bosom of her blouse poor old dick awfully hard luck is nt it burdened with mignonette she came so close again that now she touched his shoulder but shelton did not look breathless with wildly beating heart he went on sorting out the flowers the seeds of mignonette rained on his neck and as she let the blossoms fall their perfume fanned his face you need nt sort them out she said  was she enticing him he stole a look but she was gone again swaying and sniffing at the flowers  i suppose im only hindering you he growled i d better go  she laughed  i like to see you on your knees you look so funny and as she spoke she flung a clove carnation at him does nt it smell good  too good oh antonia why are you doing this  why am i doing what  dont you know what you are doing  why picking flowers and once more she was back bending and sniffing at the blossoms  thats enough  oh no she called its not not nearly  keep on putting them together if you love me  you know i love you answered shelton in a smothered voice  antonia gazed at him across her shoulder puzzled and inquiring was her face  im not a bit like you she said what will you have for your room  choose  cornflowers and clove pinks poppies are too frivolous and pinks too  white said shelton  and mignonette too hard and  sweet why cornflowers  antonia stood before him with her hands against her sides her figure was so slim and young her face uncertain and so grave  because theyre dark and deep  and why clove pinks  antonia did not answer  and why clove pinks  because she said and flushing touched a bee that had settled on her skirt because of something in you i dont understand  ah and what flowers shall t give you  she put her hands behind her  there are all the other flowers for me  shelton snatched from the mass in front of him an iceland poppy with straight stem and a curved neck white pinks and sprigs of hard sweet mignonette and held it out to her  there he said thats you but antonia did not move  oh no it is nt and behind her back her fingers slowly crushed the petals of a bloodred poppy she shook her head smiling a brilliant smile the blossoms fell he flung his arms around her and kissed her on the lips  but his hands dropped not fear exactly nor exactly shame had come to him she had not resisted but he had kissed the smile away had kissed a strange cold frightened look into her eyes  she did nt mean to tempt me then he thought in surprise and anger what did she mean and like a scolded dog he kept his troubled watch upon her face     chapter xxv  the ride  where now antonia asked wheeling her chestnut mare as they turned up high street oxford city i wont go back the same way dick  we could have a gallop on port meadow cross the upper river twice and get home that way but you ll be tired  antonia shook her head aslant her cheek the brim of a straw hat threw a curve of shade her ear glowed transparent in the sun  a difference had come in their relations since that kiss outwardly she was the same good comrade cool and quick but as before a change one feels the subtle difference in the temper of the wind so shelton was affected by the inner change in her he had made a blot upon her candour he had tried to rub it out again but there was left a mark and it was ineffaceable antonia belonged to the most civilised division of the race most civilised in all the world whose creed is let us love and hate let us work and marry but let us never give ourselves away to give ourselves away is to leave a mark and that is past forgive ness let our lives be like our faces free from every kind of wrinkle even those of laughter in this way alone can we be really civilised  he felt that she was ruffled by a vague discomfort that he should give himself away was natural perhaps and only made her wonder but that he should give her the feeling that she had given herself away was a very different thing  do you mind if i just ask at the bishops head for letters he said as they passed the old hotel  a dirty and thin envelope was brought to him addressed mr richard shelton esq in handwriting that was passionately clear as though the writer had put his soul into securing delivery of the letter it was dated three days back and as they rode away shelton read as follows   imperial peacock hotel  folkestone  mon cher monsieur shelton  this is already the third time i have taken up pen to write to you but having nothing but misfortune to recount i hesitated awaiting better days indeed i have been so profoundly discouraged that if i had not thought it my duty to let you know of my fortunes i know not even now if i should have found the necessary spirit les choses vont de mal en mal from what i hear there has never been so bad a season here nothing going on all the same i am tormented by a mob of little matters which bring me not sufficient to support my life i know not what to do one thing is certain in no case shall i return here another year the patron of this hotel my good employer is one of those innumerable specimens who do not forge or steal because they have no need and if they had would lack the courage who observe the marriage laws because they have been brought up to believe in them and know that breaking them brings risk and loss of reputation who do not gamble because they dare not do not drink because it disagrees with them go to church because their neighbours go and to procure an appetite for the midday meal commit no murder because not transgressing in any other fashion they are not obliged what is there to respect in persons of this sort yet they are highly esteemed and form three quarters of society the rule with these good gentlemen is to shut their eyes never use their thinking powers and close the door on all the dogs of life for fear they should get bitten  shelton paused conscious of antonias eyes fixed on him with the inquiring look that he had come to dread in that chilly questioning she seemed to say i am waiting i am prepared to be told thingsthat is useful thingsthings that help one to believe without the risk of too much thinking  its from that young foreigner he said and went on reading to himself  i have eyes and here i am i have a nose pour flairer le humbug i see that amongst the value of things nothing is the equal of free thought everything else they can take from me on ne pent pas moter cela i see no future for me here and certainly should have departed long ago if i had had the money but as i have already told you all that i can do barely suffices to procure me de quoi vivre je me sens ecceuye do not pay too much attention to my jeremiads you know what a pessimist i am je ne perds pas courage  hoping that you are well and in the cordial pressing of your hand i subscribe myself  your very devoted  louis ferrand   he rode with the letter open in his hand frowning at the curious turmoil which ferrand excited in his heart it was as though this foreign vagrant twanged within him a neglected string which gave forth moans of a mutiny  what does he say antonia asked  should he show it to her if he might not what should he do when they were married  i dont quite know he said at last it s not particularly cheering  what is he like dicki mean to look at like a gentleman or what  shelton stifled a desire to laugh  he looks very well in a frockcoat he replied his father was a wine merchant  antonia flicked her whip against her skirt  of course she murmured i dont want to hear if theres anything i ought not  but instead of soothing shelton these words had just the opposite effect his conception of the ideal wife was not that of one from whom the half of life must be excluded  its only he stammered again that its not cheerful  oh all right she cried and touching her horse flew off in front i hate dismal things  shelton bit his lips it was not his fault that half the world was dark he knew her words were loosed against himself and as always at a sign of her displeasure was afraid he galloped after her on the scorched turf  what is it he said you re angry with me  oh no  darling i cant help it if things are nt cheerful we have eyes he added quoting from the letter  antonia did not look at him but touched her horse again  well i dont want to see the gloomy side she said and i cant see why you should its wicked to be discontented and she galloped off  it was not his fault if there were a thousand different kinds of men a thousand different points of view outside the fence of her experience what business he thought digging in his dummy spurs has our class to patronise we re the only people who have nt an idea of what life really means chips of dried turf and dust came flying back stinging his face he gained on her drew almost within reach then as though she had been playing with him was left hopelessly behind  she stooped under the far hedge fanning her flushed face with dockleaves  aha dick i knew youd never catch me and she patted the chestnut mare who turned her blowing muzzle with contemptuous humour towards sheltons steed while her flanks heaved rapturously gradually darkening with sweat  wed better take them steadily grunted shelton getting off and loosening his girths if we mean to get home at all  dont be cross dick  we oughtnt to have galloped them like this they re not in condition wed better go home the way we came  antonia dropped the reins and straightened her back hair  there s no fun in that she said out and back again i hate a dogs walk  very well said shelton he would have her longer to himself  the road led up and up a hill and from the top a vision of saxonia lay disclosed in waves of wood and pasture their way branched down a gateless glade and shelton sidled closer till his knee touched the mares offflank  antonias profile conjured up visions she was youth itself her eyes so brilliant and so innocent her cheeks so glowing and her brow unruffled but in her smile and in the setting of her jaw lurked something resolute and mischievous shelton put his hand out to the mares mane  what made you promise to marry me he said  she smiled  well what made you  i cried shelton  she slipped her hand over his hand  oh dick she said  i want he stammered to be everything to you do you think i shall  of course  of course the words seemed very much or very little  she looked down at the river gleaming below the glade in a curving silver line dick there are such a lot of splendid things that we might do  did she mean amongst those splendid things that they might understand each other or were they fated to pretend to only in the old timehonoured way  they crossed the river by a ferry and rode a long time in silence while the twilight slowly fell behind the aspens and all the beauty of the evening with its restless leaves its grave young moon and lighted campion flowers was but a part of her the scents the witchery and shadows the quaint field noises the yokels whistling and the splash of waterfowl each seemed to him enchanted the flighting bats the forms of the dim hayricks and sweetbrier perfumeshe summed them all up in herself the fingermarks had deepened underneath her eyes a languor came upon her it made her the more sweet and youthful her shoulders seemed to bear on them the very image of our landgrave and aspiring eager yet containedbefore there came upon that land the grin of greed the folds of wealth the simper of content fair unconscious free  and he was silent with a beating heart     chapter xxvi  the bird of passage  that night after the ride when shelton was about to go to bed his eyes fell on ferrands letter and with a sleepy sense of duty he began to read it through a second time in the dark oakpanelled bedroom his fourpost bed with back of crimson damask and its dainty sheets was lighted by the candle glow the copper pitcher of hot water in the basin the silver of his brushes and the line of his wellpolished boots all shone and sheltons face alone was gloomy staring at the yellowish paper in his hand  the poor chap wants money of course he thought but why go on for ever helping one who had no claim on him a hopeless case incurableone whom it was his duty to let sink for the good of the community at large ferrands vagabond refinement had beguiled him into charity that should have been bestowed on hospitals or any charitable work but foreign missions to give a helping hand a bit of himself a nod of fellowship to any fellowbeing irrespective of a claim merely because he happened to be down was sentimental nonsense the line must be drawn but in the muttering of this conclusion he experienced a twinge of honesty humbug you dont want to part with your money thats all  so sitting down in shirtsleeves at his writing table he penned the following on paper stamped with the holm oaks address and crest   my dear ferrand  i am sorry you are having such a bad spell you seem to be dead out of luck i hope by the time you get this things will have changed for the better i should very much like to see you again and have a talk but shall be away for some time longer and doubt even when i get back whether i should be able to run down and look you up keep me au courant as to your movements i enclose a cheque  yours sincerely  richard shelton   before he had written out the cheque a moth fluttering round the candle distracted his attention and by the time he had caught and put it out he had forgotten that the cheque was not enclosed the letter removed with his clothes before he was awake was posted in an empty state  one morning a week later he was sitting in the smokingroom in the company of the gentleman called mabbey who was telling him how many grouse he had deprived of life on august 12 last year and how many he intended to deprive of life on august 12 this year when the door was opened and the butler entered carrying his head as though it held some fatal secret  a young man is asking for you sir he said to shelton bending down discreetly i dont know if you would wish to see him sir  a young man repeated shelton what sort of a young man  i should say a sort of foreigner sir apologetically replied the butler hes wearing a frockcoat but he looks as if he had been walking a good deal  shelton rose with haste the description sounded to him ominous  where is he  i put him in the young ladies little room sir  all right said shelton i ll come and see him now what the deuce he thought running down the stairs  it was with a queer commingling of pleasure and vexation that he entered the little chamber sacred to the birds beasts racquets golfclubs and general young ladies litter ferrand was standing underneath the cage of a canary his hands folded on his pinchedup hat a nervous smile upon his lips he was dressed in sheltons old frockcoat tightly buttoned and would have cut a stylish figure but far his look of travel he wore a pair of pincenez too which somewhat veiled his cynical blue eyes and clashed a little with the pagan look of him in the midst of the strange surroundings he still preserved that air of knowing and being master of his fate which was his chief attraction  i m glad to see you said shelton holding out his hand  forgive this liberty began ferrand but i thought it due to you after all youve done for me not to throw up my efforts to get employment in england without letting you know first im entirely at the end of my resources  the phrase struck shelton as one that he had heard before  but i wrote to you he said did nt you get my letter  a flicker passed across the vagrants face he drew the letter from his pocket and held it out  here it is monsieur  shelton stared at it  surely said he i sent a cheque  ferrand did not smile there was a look about him as though shelton by forgetting to enclose that cheque had done him a real injury  shelton could not quite hide a glance of doubt  of course he said iimeant to enclose a cheque  too subtle to say anything ferrand curled his lip i am capable of much but not of that he seemed to say and at once shelton felt the meanness of his doubt  stupid of me he said  i had no intention of intruding here said ferrand i hoped to see you in the neighbourhood but i arrive exhausted with fatigue ive eaten nothing since yesterday at noon and walked thirty miles he shrugged his shoulders you see i had no time to lose before assuring myself whether you were here or not  of course began shelton but again he stopped  i should very much like the young foreigner went on for one of your good legislators to find himself in these country villages with a penny in his pocket in other countries bakers are obliged to sell you an equivalent of bread for a penny here they wont sell you as much as a crust under twopence you dont encourage poverty  what is your idea now asked shelton trying to gain time  as i told you replied ferrand there s nothing to be done at folkestone though i should have stayed there if i had had the money to defray certain expenses and again he seemed to reproach his patron with the omission of that cheque they say things will certainly be better at the end of the month now that i know english well i thought perhaps i could procure a situation for teaching languages  i see said shelton  as a fact however he was far from seeing he literally did not know what to do it seemed so brutal to give ferrand money and ask him to clear out besides he chanced to have none in his pocket  it needs philosophy to support what i ve gone through this week said ferrand shrugging his shoulders on wednesday last when i received your letter i had just eighteenpence and at once i made a resolution to come and see you on that sum i ve done the journey my strength is nearly at an end  shelton stroked his chin  well he had just begun we must think it over when by ferrands face he saw that some one had come in he turned and saw antonia in the doorway excuse me he stammered and going to antonia drew her from the room  with a smile she said at once its the young foreigner im certain oh what fun  yes answered shelton slowly hes come to see me about getting some sort of tutorship or other do you think your mother would mind if i took him up to have a wash hes had a longish walk and might he have some breakfast he must be hungry  of course ill tell dobson shall i speak to mother he looks nice dick  he gave her a grateful furtive look and went back to his guest an impulse had made him hide from her the true condition of affairs  ferrand was standing where he had been left his face still clothed in mordant impassivity  come up to my room said shelton and while his guest was washing brushing and otherwise embellishing his person he stood reflecting that ferrand was by no means unpresentable and he felt quite grateful to him  he took an opportunity when the young mans back was turned of examining his counterfoils there was no record naturally of a cheque drawn in ferrands favour shelton felt more mean than ever  a message came from mrs dennant so he took the traveller to the diningroom and left him there while he himself went to the lady of the house he met antonia coming down  how many days did you say he went without food that timeyou know she asked in passing  four  he does nt look a bit common dick  shelton gazed at her dubiously  theyre surely not going to make a show of him he thought  mrs dennant was writing in a darkblue dress starred over with white spots whose fine lawn collar was threaded with black velvet  have you seen the new hybrid algys brought me back from kidstone is nt it charmin and she bent her face towards this perfect rose they say unique im awfully interested to find out if thats true ive told algy i really must have some  shelton thought of the unique hybrid breakfasting downstairs he wished that mrs dennant would show in him the interest she had manifested in the rose but this was absurd of him he knew for the potent law of hobbies controlled the upper classes forcing them to take more interest in birds and roses missionaries or limited and highlybound editions of old books things in a word in treating which you knew exactly where you were than in the manifestations of mere life that came before their eyes  oh dick about that young frenchman antonia says he wants a tutorship now can you really recommend him theres mrs robinson at the gateways wants someone to teach her boys languages and if he were quite satisfactory its really time toddles had a few lessons in french he goes to eton next half  shelton stared at the rose he had suddenly realised why it was that people take more interest in roses than in human beingsone could do it with a quiet heart  hes not a frenchman you know he said to gain a little time  hes not a german i hope mrs dennant answered passing her forgers round a petal to impress its fashion on her brain i dont like germans is nt he the one you wrote aboutcome down in the world such a pity with so young a fellow his father was a merchant i think you told us antonia says he s quite refined to look at  oh yes said shelton feeling on safe ground hes refined enough to look at  mrs dennant took the rose and put it to her nose  delicious perfume that was a very touchin story about his goin without food in paris old mrs hopkins has a room to let i should like to do her a good turn im afraid theres a hole in the ceilin though or theres the room here in the left wing on the groundfloor where john the footman used to sleep its quite nice perhaps he could have that  you re awfully kind said shelton but  i should like to do something to restore his selfrespect went on mrs dennant if as you say he s clever and all that seein a little refined life again might make a world of difference to him its so sad when a young man loses selfrespect  shelton was much struck by the practical way in which she looked at things restore his selfrespect it seemed quite a splendid notion he smiled and said  youre too kind i think  i dont believe in doin things by halves said mrs dennant he does nt drink i suppose  oh no said shelton hes rather a tobacco maniac of course  well thats a mercy you would nt believe the trouble i ve had with drink especially over cooks and coachmen and now bunyans taken to it  oh youd have no trouble with ferrand returned shelton you couldnt tell him from a gentleman as far as manners go  mrs dennant smiled one of her rather sweet and kindly smiles  my dear dick she said theres not much comfort in that look at poor bobby surcingle look at oliver semples and victor medallion you could nt have better families but if you re sure he does nt drink algy ll laugh of course that does nt matterhe laughs at everything  shelton felt guilty being quite unprepared for so rapid an adoption of his client  i really believe theres a lot of good in him he stammered but of course i know very little and from what he tells me hes had a very curious life i shouldnt like  where was he educated inquired mrs dennant they have no public schools in france so i ve been told but of course he cant help that poor young fellow oh and dick there s one thinghas he relations one has always to be so careful about that it s one thing to help a young fellow but quite another to help his family too one sees so many cases of that where men marry girls without money dont you know  he has told me answered shelton his only relations are some cousins and they are rich  mrs dennant took out her handkerchief and bending above the rose removed a tiny insect  these greenfly get in everywhere she said  very sad story cant they do anything for him and she made researches in the roses heart  hes quarrelled with them i believe said shelton i have nt liked to press him about that  no of course not assented mrs dennant absentlyshe had found another greenfly i always think its painful when a young man seems so friendless  shelton was silent he was thinking deeply he had never before felt so distrustful of the youthful foreigner  i think he said at last the best thing would be for you to see him for yourself  very well said mrs dennant i should be so glad if you would tell him to come up i must say i do think that was a most touchin story about paris i wonder whether this lights strong enough now for me to photograph this rose  shelton withdrew and went downstairs ferrand was still at breakfast antonia stood at the sideboard carving beef for him and in the window sat thea with her persian kitten  both girls were following the travellers movements with inscrutable blue eyes a shiver ran down sheltons spine to speak truth he cursed the young mans coming as though it affected his relations with antonia     chapter xxvii  sub rosa  from the interview which shelton had the mixed delight of watching between ferrand and the honourable mrs dennant certain definite results accrued the chief of which was the permission accorded the young wanderer to occupy the room which had formerly been tenanted by the footman john shelton was lost in admiration of ferrands manner in this scene its subtle combination of deference and dignity was almost paralysing paralysing too the subterranean smile upon his lips  charmin young man dick said mrs dennant when shelton lingered to say once more that he knew but very little of him i shall send a note round to mrs robinson at once theyre rather common you knowthe robinsons i think theyll take anyone i recommend  i m sure they will said shelton thats why i think you ought to know  but mrs dennants eyes fervent harelike were fixed on something far away turning he saw the rose in a tall vase on a tall and spindly stool it seemed to nod towards them in the sunshine mrs dennant dived her nose towards her camera  the lights perfect now she said in a voice muffled by the cloth i feel sure that livin with decent people will do wonders for him of course he understands that his meals will be served to him apart  shelton doubly anxious now that his efforts had lodged his client in a place of trust fell back on hoping for the best his instinct told him that vagabond as ferrand was he had a curious selfrespect that would save him from a mean ingratitude  in fact as mrs dennant who was by no means void of commonsense foresaw the arrangement worked all right ferrand entered on his duties as french tutor to the little robinsons in the dennants household he kept himself to his own room which day and night he perfumed with tobacco emerging at noon into the garden or if wet into the study to teach young toddles french after a time it became customary for him to lunch with the houseparty partly through a mistake of toddles who seemed to think that it was natural and partly through john noble one of sheltons friends who had come to stay and discovered ferrand to be a most awfully interesting person he was always indeed discovering the most awfully interesting persons in his grave and toneless voice brushing his hair from off his brow he descanted upon ferrand with enthusiasm to which was joined a kind of shocked amusement as who should say of course i know its very odd but really he s such an awfully interesting person for john noble was a politician belonging to one of those two peculiar parties which thoroughly in earnest of an honesty above suspicion and always very busy are constitutionally averse to anything peculiar for fear of finding they have overstepped the limit of what is practical in politics as such he inspired confidence not caring for things unless he saw some immediate benefit to be had from them having a perfect sense of decency and a small imagination he discussed all sorts of things with ferrand on one occasion shelton overheard them arguing on anarchism  no englishman approves of murder noble was saying in the gloomy voice that contrasted with the optimistic cast of his fine head but the main principle is right equalisation of property is bound to come i sympathise with then not with their methods  forgive me struck in ferrand do you know any anarchists  no returned noble i certainly do not  you say you sympathise with them but the first time it comes to action  well  oh monsieur one doesnt make anarchism with the head  shelton perceived that he had meant to add but with the heart the lungs the liver he drew a deeper meaning from the saying and seemed to see curling with the smoke from ferrands lips the words what do you an english gentleman of excellent position and all the prejudices of your class know about us outcasts if you want to understand us you must be an outcast too we are not playing at the game  this talk took place upon the lawn at the end of one of toddless french lessons and shelton left john noble maintaining to the youthful foreigner with stubborn logic that he john noble and the anarchists had much in common he was returning to the house when someone called his name from underneath the holm oak there sitting turkish fashion on the grass a pipe between his teeth he found a man who had arrived the night before and impressed him by his friendly taciturnity his name was whyddon and he had just returned from central africa a brownfaced largejawed man with small but good and steady eyes and strong spare figure  oh mr shelton he said i wondered if you could tell me what tips i ought to give the servants here after ten years away i ve forgotten all about that sort of thing  shelton sat down beside him unconsciously assuming too a crosslegged attitude which caused him much discomfort  i was listening said his new acquaintance to the little chap learning his french ive forgotten mine one feels a hopeless duffer knowing no languages  i suppose you speak arabic said shelton  oh arabic and a dialect or two they dont count that tutor has a curious face  you think so said shelton interested hes had a curious life  the traveller spread his hands palms downwards on the grass and looked at shelton with a smile  i should say he was a rolling stone he said it s odd i ve seen white men in central africa with a good deal of his look about them  your diagnosis is a good one answered shelton  i m always sorry for those fellows theres generally some good in them they are their own enemies a bad business to be unable to take pride in anything one does and there was a look of pity on his face  thats exactly it said shelton i ve often tried to put it into words is it incurable  i think so  can you tell me why  whyddon pondered  i rather think he said at last it must be because they have too strong a faculty of criticism you cant teach a man to be proud of his own work that lies in his blood  folding his arms across his breast he heaved a sigh under the dark foliage his eyes on the sunlight he was the type of all those englishmen who keep their spirits bright and wear their bodies out in the dark places of hard work you cant think he said showing his teeth in a smile how delightful it is to be at home you learn to love the old country when youre away from it  shelton often thought afterwards of this diagnosis of the vagabond for he was always stumbling on instances of that power of subtle criticism which was the young foreigners prime claim to be a most awfully interesting and perhaps a rather shocking person  an old schoolfellow of sheltons and his wife were staying in the house who offered to the eye the picture of a perfect domesticity passionless and smiling it was impossible to imagine they could ever have a difference shelton whose bedroom was next to theirs could hear them in the mornings talking in exactly the tones they used at lunch and laughing the same laughs their life seemed to accord them perfect satisfaction they were supplied with their convictions by society just as when at home they were supplied with all the other necessaries of life by some cooperative stores their fairly handsome faces with the fairly kind expressions quickly and carefully regulated by a sense of compromise began to worry him so much that when in the same room he would even read to avoid the need of looking at them and yet they were kindthat is fairly kindand clean and quiet in the house except when they laughed which was often and at things which made him want to howl as a dog howls at music  mr shelton ferrand said one day i m not an amateur of marriagenever had the chance as you may well suppose but in any case you have some people in the house who would make me mark time before i went committing it they seem the ideal young married peopledont quarrel have perfect health agree with everybody go to church have childrenbut i should like to hear what is beautiful in their life and he grimaced it seems to me so ugly that i can only gasp i would much rather they illtreated each other just to show they had the corner of a soul between them if that is marriage dieu men garde  but shelton did not answer he was thinking deeply  the saying of john nobles hes really a most interesting person grew more and more upon his nerves it seemed to describe the dennant attitude towards this stranger within their gates they treated him with a sort of wonder on the dont touch system like an object in an exhibition the restoration however of his selfrespect proceeded with success for all the semblance of having grown too big for sheltons clothes for all his vividly burnt face and the quick but guarded play of cynicism on his lipshe did much credit to his patrons he had subdued his terror of a razor and looked well in a suit of sheltons flannels for after all he had only been eight years exiled from middleclass gentility and he had been a waiter half that time but shelton wished him at the devil not for his manners sakehe was never tired of watching how subtly the vagabond adapted his conduct to the conduct of his hosts while keeping up his critical detachmentbut because that critical detachment was a constant spur to his own vision compelling him to analyse the life into which he had been born and was about to marry this process was disturbing and to find out when it had commenced he had to go back to his meeting with ferrand on the journey up from dover  there was kindness in a hospitality which opened to so strange a bird admitting the kindness shelton fell to analysing it to himself to people of his class the use of kindness was a luxury not significant of sacrifice but productive of a pleasant feeling in the heart such as massage will setup in the legs everybodys kind he thought the question is what understanding is there what real sympathy this problem gave him food for thought  the progress which mrs dennant not unfrequently remarked upon in ferrands conquest of his strange position seemed to shelton but a sign that he was getting what he could out of his sudden visit to green pastures under the same circumstances shelton thought that he himself would do the same he felt that the young foreigner was making a convenient bow to property but he had more respect for the sarcastic smile on the lips of ferrands heart  it was not long before the inevitable change came in the spirit of the situation more and more was shelton conscious of a quaint uneasiness in the very breathing of the household  curious fellow youve got hold of there shelton mr dennant said to him during a game of croquet he ll never do any good for himself im afraid  in one sense im afraid not admitted shelton  do you know his story i will bet you sixpenceand mr dennant paused to swing his mallet with a proper accuracy that hes been in prison  prison ejaculated shelton  i think said mr dennant with bent knees carefully measuring his next shot that you ought to make inquiriesah missed it awkward these hoops one must draw the line somewhere  i never could draw returned shelton nettled and uneasy but i understandi ll give him a hint to go  dont said mr dennant moving after his second ball which shelton had smitten to the farther end be offended my dear shelton and by no means give him a hint he interests me very mucha very clever quiet young fellow  that this was not his private view shelton inferred by studying mr dennants manner in the presence of the vagabond underlying the wellbred banter of the tranquil voice the guarded quizzicality of his pale brown face it could be seen that algernon cuffe dennant esq jp accustomed to laugh at other people suspected that he was being laughed at what more natural than that he should grope about to see how this could be a vagrant alien was making himself felt by an english justice of the peaceno small tribute this to ferrands personality the latter would sit silent through a meal and yet make his effect he the object of their kindness education patronage inspired their fear there was no longer any doubt it was not of ferrand that they were afraid but of what they did not understand in him of horrid subtleties meandering in the brain under that straight wetlooking hair of something bizarre popping from the curving lips below that thin lopsided nose  but to shelton in this as in all else antonia was what mattered at first anxious to show her lover that she trusted him she seemed never tired of doing things for his young protege as though she too had set her heart on his salvation but watching her eyes when they rested on the vagabond shelton was perpetually reminded of her saying on the first day of his visit to holm oaks i suppose he s really goodi mean all these things you told me about were only  curiosity never left her glance nor did that story of his four days starving leave her mind a sentimental picturesqueness clung about that incident more valuable by far than this mere human being with whom she had so strangely come in contact she watched ferrand and shelton watched her if he had been told that he was watching her he would have denied it in good faith but he was bound to watch her to find out with what eyes she viewed this visitor who embodied all the rebellious underside of life all that was absent in herself  dick she said to him one day you never talk to me of monsieur ferrand  do you want to talk of him  dont you think that hes improved  hes fatter  antonia looked grave  no but really  i dont know said shelton i cant judge him  antonia turned her face away and something in her attitude alarmed him  he was once a sort of gentleman she said why shouldnt he become one again  sitting on the low wall of the kitchengarden her head was framed by golden plums the sun lay barred behind the foliage of the holm oak but a little patch filtering through a gap had rested in the plumtrees heart it crowned the girl her raiment the dark leaves the red wall the golden plums were woven by the passing glow to a block of pagan colour and her face above it chaste serene was like the scentless summer evening a bird amongst the currant bushes kept a little chant vibrating and all the plumtrees shape and colour seemed alive  perhaps he does nt want to be a gentleman said shelton  antonia swung her foot  how can he help wanting to  he may have a different philosophy of life  antonia was slow to answer  i know nothing about philosophies of life she said at last  shelton answered coldly  no two people have the same  with the falling sunglow the charm passed off the tree chilled and harder yet less deep it was no more a block of woven colour warm and impassive like a southern goddess it was now a northern tree with a grey light through its leaves  i dont understand you in the least she said everyone wishes to be good  and safe asked shelton gently  antonia stared  suppose he saidi dont pretend to know i only supposewhat ferrand really cares for is doing things differently from other people if you were to load him with a character and give him money on condition that he acted as we all act do you think he would accept it  why not  why are nt cats dogs or pagans christians  antonia slid down from the wall  you dont seem to think there s any use in trying she said and turned away  shelton made a movement as if he would go after her and then stood still watching her figure slowly pass her head outlined above the wall her hands turned back across her narrow hips she halted at the bend looked back then with an impatient gesture disappeared  antonia was slipping from him  a moments vision from without himself would have shown him that it was he who moved and she who was standing still like the figure of one watching the passage of a stream with clear direct and sullen eyes     chapter xxviii  the river  one day towards the end of august shelton took antonia on the riverthe river that like soft music soothes the land the river of the reeds and poplars the silver swansails sun and moon woods and the white slumbrous clouds where cuckoos and the wind the pigeons and the weirs are always singing and in the flash of naked bodies the play of waterlily leaves queer goblin stumps and the twilight faces of the twisted treeroots pan lives once more  the reach which shelton chose was innocent of launches champagne bottles and loud laughter it was uncivilised and seldom troubled by these humanising influences he paddled slowly silent and absorbed watching antonia an unaccustomed languor clung about her her eyes had shadows as though she had not slept colour glowed softly in her cheeks her frock seemed all alight with golden radiance she made shelton pull into the reeds and plucked two rounded lilies sailing like ships against slowmoving water  pull into the shade please she said its too hot out here  the brim of her linen hat kept the sun from her face but her head was drooping like a flowers head at noon  shelton saw that the heat was really harming her as too hot a day will dim the icy freshness of a northern plant he dipped his sculls the ripples started out and swam in grave diminuendo till they touched the banks  he shot the boat into a cleft and caught the branches of an overhanging tree the skiff rested balancing with mutinous vibration like a living thing  i should hate to live in london said antonia suddenly the slums must be so awful what a pity when there are places like this but its no good thinking  no answered shelton slowly i suppose it is no good  there are some bad cottages at the lower end of cross eaton i went them one day with miss truecote the people wont help themselves its so discouraging to help people who wont help themselves  she was leaning her elbows on her knees and with her chin resting on her hands gazed up at shelton all around them hung a tent of soft thick leaves and below the water was deepdyed with green refraction willow boughs swaying above the boat caressed antonias arms and shoulders her face and hair alone were free  so discouraging she said again  a silence fell antonia seemed thinking deeply  doubts dont help you she said suddenly how can you get any good from doubts the thing is to win victories  victories said shelton i d rather understand than conquer  he had risen to his feet and grasped stunted branch canting the boat towards the bank  how can you let things slide like that dick its like ferrand  have you such a bad opinion of him then asked shelton he felt on the verge of some discovery  she buried her chin deeper in her hands  i liked him at first she said i thought that he was different i thought he couldnt really be  really be what  antonia did not answer  i dont know she said at last i cant explain i thought  shelton still stood holding to the branch and the oscillation of the boat freed an infinity of tiny ripples  you thoughtwhat he said  he ought to have seen her face grow younger more childish even timid she said in a voice smooth round and young  you know dick i do think we ought to try i know i dont try half hard enough it does nt do any good to think when you think everything seems so mixed as if there were nothing to lay hold of i do so hate to feel like that it is nt as if we didnt know whats right sometimes i think and think and it s all no good only a waste of time and you feel at the end as if you had been doing wrong  shelton frowned  what has nt been through fires no good he said and letting go the branch sat down freed from restraint the boat edged out towards the current but what about ferrand  i lay awake last night wondering what makes you like him so hes so bitter he makes me feel unhappy he never seems content with anything and he despisesher face hardenedi mean he hates us all  so should i if i were he said shelton  the boat was drifting on and gleams of sunlight chased across their faces antonia spoke again  he seems to be always looking at dark things or else he seems as ifas if he couldenjoy himself too much i thoughti thought at first she stammered that we could do him good  do him good ha ha  a startled rat went swimming for its life against the stream and shelton saw that he had done a dreadful thing he had let antonia with a jerk into a secret not hitherto admitted even by himselfthe secret that her eyes were not his eyes her way of seeing things not his nor ever would be he quickly muffled up his laughter antonia had dropped her gaze her face regained its languor but the bosom of her dress was heaving shelton watched her racking his brains to find excuses for that fatal laugh none could he find it was a little piece of truth he paddled slowly on close to the bank in the long silence of the river  the breeze had died away not a fish was rising save for the lost music of the larks no birds were piping alone a single pigeon at brief intervals cooed from the neighbouring wood  they did not stay much longer in the boat  on the homeward journey in the ponycart rounding a corner of the road they came on ferrand in his pincenez holding a cigarette between his fingers and talking to a tramp who was squatting on the bank the young foreigner recognised them and at once removed his hat  there he is said shelton returning the salute  antonia bowed  oh she cried when they were out of hearing i wish he d go i cant bear to see him its like looking at the dark     chapter xxix  on the wing  that night having gone up to his room shelton filled his pipe for his unpleasant duty he had resolved to hint to ferrand that he had better go he was still debating whether to write or go himself to the young foreigner when there came a knock and ferrand himself appeared  i should be sorry he said breaking an awkward silence if you were to think me ungrateful but i see no future for me here it would be better for me to go i should never be content to pass my life in teaching languages ce nest guere dans mon caractre  as soon as what he had been cudgelling his brains to find a way of saying had thus been said for him shelton experienced a sense of disapproval  what do you expect to get thats better he said avoiding ferrands eyes  thanks to your kindness replied the latter i find myself restored i feel that i ought to make some good efforts to dominate my social position  i should think it well over if i were you said shelton  i have and it seems to me that im wasting my time for a man with any courage languages are no career and though i ve many defects i still have courage  shelton let his pipe go out so pathetic seemed to him this young mans faith in his career it was no pretended faith but neither was it he felt his true motive for departure hes tired he thought that s it tired of one place and having the instinctive sense that nothing would keep ferrand he redoubled his advice  i should have thought he said that you would have done better to have held on here and saved a little before going off to god knows what  to save said ferrand is impossible for me but thanks to you and your good friends i ve enough to make front to first necessities im in correspondence with a friend its of great importance for me to reach paris before all the world returns i ve a chance to get a post in one of the west african companies one makes fortunes out thereif one survives and as you know i dont set too much store by life  we have a proverb said shelton a bird in the hand is worth two birds in the bush  that returned ferrand like all proverbs is just half true this is an affair of temperament it s not in my character to dandle one when i see two waiting to be caught voyager apprendre cest plus fort que moi he paused then with a nervous goggle of the eyes and an ironic smile he said besides mon cher monsieur it is better that i go i have never been one to hug illusions and i see pretty clearly that my presence is hardly acceptable in this house  what makes you say that asked shelton feeling that the murder was now out  my dear sir all the world has not your understanding and your lack of prejudice and though your friends have been extremely kind to me i am in a false position i cause them embarrassment which is not extraordinary when you reflect what i have been and that they know my history  not through me said shelton quickly for i dont know it myself  its enough the vagrant said that they feel im not a bird of their feather they cannot change neither can i i have never wanted to remain where i m not welcome  shelton turned to the window and stared into the darkness he would never quite understand this vagabond so delicate so cynical and he wondered if ferrand had been swallowing down the words why even you wont be sorry to see my back  well he said at last if you must go you must when do you start  i ve arranged with a man to carry my things to the early train i think it better not to say goodbye i ve written a letter instead here it is i left it open for you to read if you should wish  then said shelton with a curious mingling of relief regret goodwill i shant see you again  ferrand gave his hand a stealthy rub and held it out  i shall never forget what you have done for me he said  mind you write said shelton  yes yesthe vagrants face was oddly twistedyou dont know what a difference it makes to have a correspondent it gives one courage i hope to remain a long time in correspondence with you  i dare say you do thought shelton grimly with a certain queer emotion  you will do me the justice to remember that i have never asked you for anything said ferrand thank you a thousand times goodbye  he again wrung his patrons hand in his damp grasp and going out left shelton with an odd sensation in his throat you will do me the justice to remember that i have never asked you for anything the phrase seemed strange and his mind flew back over all this queer acquaintanceship it was a fact from the beginning to the end the youth had never really asked for anything shelton sat down on his bed and began to read the letter in his hand it was in french   dear madame it ran  it will be insupportable to me after your kindness if you take me for ungrateful unfortunately a crisis has arrived which plunges me into the necessity of leaving your hospitality in all lives as you are well aware there arise occasions that one cannot govern and i know that you will pardon me that i enter into no explanation on an event which gives me great chagrin and above all renders me subject to an imputation of ingratitude which believe me dear madame by no means lies in my character i know well enough that it is a breach of politeness to leave you without in person conveying the expression of my profound reconnaissance but if you consider how hard it is for me to be compelled to abandon all that is so distinguished in domestic life you will forgive my weakness people like me who have gone through existence with their eyes open have remarked that those who are endowed with riches have a right to look down on such as are not by wealth and breeding fitted to occupy the same position i shall never dispute a right so natural and salutary seeing that without this distinction this superiority which makes of the wellborn and the wellbred a race apart the rest of the world would have no standard by which to rule their lives no anchor to throw into the depths of that vast sea of fortune and of misfortune on which we others drive before the wind it is because of this dear madame that i regard myself so doubly fortunate to have been able for a few minutes in this bitter pilgrimage called life to sit beneath the tree of safety to have been able if only for an hour to sit and set the pilgrims pass the pilgrims with the blistered feet and ragged clothes and who yet dear madame guard within their hearts a certain joy in life illegal joy like the desert air which travellers will tell you fills men as with wine to be able thus to sit an hour and with a smile to watch them pass lame and blind in all the rags of their deserved misfortunes can you not conceive dear madame how that must be for such as i a comfort whatever one may say it is sweet from a position of security to watch the sufferings of others it gives one a good sensation in the heart  in writing this i recollect that i myself once had the chance of passing all my life in this enviable safety and as you may suppose dear madame i curse myself that i should ever have had the courage to step beyond the boundaries of this fine tranquil state yet too there have been times when i have asked myself do we really differ from the wealthywe others birds of the fields who have our own philosophy grown from the pains of needing breadwe who see that the human heart is not always an affair of figures or of those good maxims that one finds in copybooksdo we really differ it is with shame that i confess to have asked myself a question so heretical but now when for these four weeks i have had the fortune of this rest beneath your roof i see how wrong i was to entertain such doubts it is a great happiness to have decided once for all this point for it is not in my character to pass through life uncertainmistaken perhapson psychological matters such as these no madame rest happily assured that there is a great difference which in the future will be sacred for me for believe me madame it would be calamity for high society if by chance there should arise amongst them any understanding of all that side of life whichvast as the plains and bitter as the sea black as the ashes of a corpse and yet more free than any wings of birds who fly awayis so justly beyond the grasp of their philosophy yes believe me dear madame there is no danger in the world so much to be avoided by all the members of that circle most illustrious most respectable called high society  from what i have said you may imagine how hard it is for me to take my flight i shall always keep for you the most distinguished sentiments with the expression of my full regard for you and your good family and of a gratitude as sincere as it is badly worded  believe me dear madame  your devoted  louis ferrand   sheltons first impulse was to tear the letter up but this he reflected he had no right to do remembering too that mrs dennants french was orthodox he felt sure she would never understand the young foreigners subtle innuendoes he closed the envelope and went to bed haunted still by ferrands parting look  it was with no small feeling of embarrassment however that having sent the letter to its destination by an early footman he made his appearance at the breakfasttable behind the austrian coffeeurn filled with french coffee mrs dennant who had placed four eggs in a german eggboiler said goodmorning with a kindly smile  dick an egg she asked him holding up a fifth  no thank you replied shelton greeting the table and fitting down  he was a little late the buzz of conversation rose hilariously around  my dear continued mr dennant who was talking to his youngest daughter youll have no chance whatevernot the least little bit of chance  father what nonsense you know we shall beat your heads off  before it s too late then i will eat a muffin shelton pass the muffins but in making this request mr dennant avoided looking in his face  antonia too seemed to keep her eyes away from him she was talking to a connoisseur on art of supernatural appearances and seemed in the highest spirits shelton rose and going to the sideboard helped himself to grouse  who was the young man i saw yesterday on the lawn he heard the connoisseur remark struck me as having anerquite intelligent physiog  his own intelligent physiog raised at a slight slant so that he might look the better through his nosenippers was the very pattern of approval its curious how ones always meeting with intelligence it seemed to say mrs dennant paused in the act of adding cream and shelton scrutinised her face it was harelike and superior as ever thank goodness she had smelt no rat he felt strangely disappointed  you mean monsieur ferrand teachin toddles french dobson the professors cup  i hope i shall see him again cooed the connoisseur he was quite interesting on the subject of young german working men it seems they tramp from place to place to learn their trades what nationality was he may i ask  mr dennant of whom he asked this question lifted his brows and said  ask shelton  half dutch half french  very interesting breed i hope i shall see him again  well you wont said thea suddenly hes gone  shelton saw that their good breeding alone prevented all from adding and thank goodness too  gone dear me its very  yes said mr dennant very sudden  now algie murmured mrs dennant it s quite a charmin letter must have taken the poor young man an hour to write  oh mother cried antonia  and shelton felt his face go crimson he had suddenly remembered that her french was better than her mothers  he seems to have had a singular experience said the connoisseur  yes echoed mr dennant he s had some singular experience if you want to know the details ask friend shelton its quite romantic in the meantime my dear another cup  the connoisseur never quite devoid of absentminded malice spurred his curiosity to a further effort and turning his welldefended eyes on shelton murmured  well mr shelton you are the historian it seems  there is no history said shelton without looking up  ah thats very dull remarked the connoisseur  my dear dick said mrs dennant that was really a most touchin story about his goin without food in paris  shelton shot another look at antonia her face was frigid i hate your dd superiority he thought staring at the connoisseur  theres nothing said that gentleman more enthralling than starvation come mr shelton  i cant tell stories said shelton never could  he cared not a straw for ferrand his coming going or his history for looking at antonia his heart was heavy     chapter xxx  the lady from beyond  the morning was sultry brooding steamy antonia was at her music and from the room where shelton tried to fix attention on a book he could hear her practising her scales with a cold fury that cast an added gloom upon his spirit he did not see her until lunch and then she again sat next the connoisseur her cheeks were pale but there was something feverish in her chatter to her neighbour she still refused to look at shelton he felt very miserable after lunch when most of them had left the table the rest fell to discussing country neighbours  of course said mrs dennant there are the foliots but nobody calls on them  ah said the connoisseur the foliotsthe foliotsthe peopleerwhoquite so  its really distressin she looks so sweet ridin about many people with worse stories get called on continued mrs dennant with that large frankness of intrusion upon doubtful subjects which may be made by certain people in a certain way but after all one couldnt ask them to meet anybody  no the connoisseur assented i used to know foliot thousand pities they say she was a very pretty woman  oh not pretty said mrs dennant more interestin than pretty i should say  shelton who knew the lady slightly noticed that they spoke of her as in the past he did not look towards antonia for though a little troubled at her presence while such a subject was discussed he hated his conviction that her face was as unruffled as though the foliots had been a separate species there was in fact a curiosity about her eyes a faint impatience on her lips she was rolling little crumbs of bread suddenly yawning she muttered some remark and rose shelton stopped her at the door  where are you going  for a walk  may nt i come  she shook her head  i m going to take toddles  shelton held the door open and went back to the table  yes the connoisseur said sipping at his sherry i m afraid its all over with young foliot  such a pity murmured mrs dennant and her kindly face looked quite disturbed ive known him ever since he was a boy of course i think he made a great mistake to bring her down here not even bein able to get married makes it doubly awkward oh i think he made a great mistake  ah said the connoisseur but d you suppose that makes much difference even if what shisname gave her a divorce i dont think dont you know that  oh it does so many people would be inclined to look over it in time but as it is its hopeless quite so very awkward for people too meetin them about the telfords and the butterwicksby the way theyre comin here to dine tonightlive near them dont you know  did you ever meet her beforeerbefore the flood the connoisseur inquired and his lips parting and unexpectedly revealing teeth gave him a shadowy resemblance to a goat  yes i did meet her once at the branksomes i thought her quite a charmin person  poor fellow said the connoisseur they tell me he was going to take the hounds  and there are his delightful coverts too algie often used to shoot there and now they say he just has his brother down to shoot with him its really quite too melancholy did you know him dick  foliot replied shelton absently no i never met him ive seen her once or twice at ascot  through the window he could see antonia in her scarlet tamoshanter swinging her stick and he got up feigning unconcern just then toddles came bounding up against his sister they went off arm in arm she had seen him at the window yet she gave no friendly glance shelton felt more miserable than ever he stepped out upon the drive there was a lurid gloomy canopy above the elmtrees drooped their heavy blackish green the wonted rustle of the aspentree was gone even the rooks were silent a store of force lay heavy on the heart of nature he started pacing slowly up and down his pride forbidding him to follow her and presently sat down on an old stone seat that faced the road he stayed a long time staring at the elms asking himself what he had done and what he ought to do and somehow he was frightened a sense of loneliness was on him so real so painful that he shivered in the sweltering heat he was there perhaps an hour alone and saw nobody pass along the road then came the sound of horses hoofs and at the same time he heard a motorcar approaching from the opposite direction the rider made appearance first riding a grey horse with an arabs high set head and tail she was holding him with difficulty for the whirr of the approaching car grew every moment louder shelton rose the car flashed by he saw the horse stagger in the gateway crushing its rider up against the gatepost  he ran but before he reached the gate the lady was on foot holding the plunging horses bridle  are you hurt cried shelton breathlessly and he too grabbed the bridle those beastly cars  i dont know she said please dont he wont let strangers touch him  shelton let go and watched her coax the horse she was rather tall dressed in a grey habit with a grey russian cap upon her head and he suddenly recognised the mrs foliot whom they had been talking of at lunch  he ll be quiet now she said if you would nt mind holding him a minute  she gave the reins to him and leaned against the gate she was very pale  i do hope he has nt hurt you shelton said he was quite close to her well able to see her facea curious face with high cheekbones and a flatfish moulding enigmatic yet strangely passionate for all its listless pallor her smiling tightened lips were pallid pallid too her grey and deepset eyes with greenish tints above all pale the ashy mass of hair coiled under her grey cap  ththanks she said i shall be all right directly im sorry to have made a fuss  she bit her lips and smiled  i m sure youre hurt do let me go for stammered shelton i can easily get help  help she said with a stony little laugh oh no thanks  she left the gate and crossed the road to where he held the horse shelton to conceal embarrassment looked at the horses legs and noticed that the grey was resting one of them he ran his hand down  i m afraid he said your horse has knocked his off knee its swelling  she smiled again  then were both cripples  hell be lame when he gets cold would nt you like to put him in the stable here i m sure you ought to drive home  no thanks if i m able to ride him he can carry me give me a hand up  her voice sounded as though something had offended her rising from inspection of the horses leg shelton saw antonia and toddles standing by they had come through a wicketgate leading from the fields  the latter ran up to him at once  we saw it he whisperedjolly smashup cant i help  hold his bridle answered shelton and he looked from one lady to the other  there are moments when the expression of a face fixes itself with painful clearness to shelton this was such a moment those two faces close together under their coverings of scarlet and of grey showed a contrast almost cruelly vivid antonia was flushed her eyes had grown deep blue her look of startled doubt had passed and left a question in her face  would you like to come in and wait we could send you home in the brougham she said  the lady called mrs foliot stood one arm across the crupper of her saddle biting her lips and smiling still her enigmatic smile and it was her face that stayed most vividly on sheltons mind its ashy hail its pallor and fixed scornful eyes  oh no thanks youre very kind  out of antonias face the timid doubting friendliness had fled and was replaced by enmity with a long cold look at both of them she turned away mrs foliot gave a little laugh and raised her foot for sheltons help he heard a hiss of pain as he swung her up but when he looked at her she smiled  anyway he said impatiently let me come and see you dont break down  she shook her head it s only two miles im not made of sugar  then i shall simply have to follow  she shrugged her shoulders fixing her resolute eyes on him  would that boy like to come she asked  toddles left the horses head  by jove he cried would nt i just  then she said i think that will be best you ve been so kind  she bowed smiled inscrutably once more touched the arab with her whip and started toddles trotting at her side  shelton was left with antonia underneath the elms a sudden puff of tepid air blew in their faces like a warning message from the heavy purple heat clouds low rumbling thunder travelled slowly from afar  were going to have a storm he said  antonia nodded she was pale now and her face still wore its cold look of offence  i ve got a headache she said i shall go in and lie down  shelton tried to speak but something kept him silentsubmission to what was coming like the mute submission of the fields and birds to the menace of the storm  he watched her go and went back to his seat and the silence seemed to grow the flowers ceased to exude their fragrance numbed by the weighty air all the long house behind him seemed asleep deserted no noise came forth no laughter the echo of no music the ringing of no bell the heat had wrapped it round with drowsiness and the silence added to the solitude within him what an unlucky chance that womans accident designed by providence to put antonia further from him than before why was not the world composed of the immaculate alone he started pacing up and down tortured by a dreadful heartache  i must get rid of this he thought i ll go for a good tramp and chance the storm  leaving the drive he ran on toddles returning in the highest spirits  i saw her home he crowed i say what a ripper isnt she she ll be as lame as a tree tomorrow so will the gee jolly hot  this meeting showed shelton that he had been an hour on the stone seat he had thought it some ten minutes and the discovery alarmed him it seemed to bring the import of his miserable fear right home to him he started with a swinging stride keeping his eyes fixed on the road the perspiration streaming down his face     chapter xxxi  the storm  it was seven and more when shelton returned from his walk a few heat drops had splashed the leaves but the storm had not yet broken in brooding silence the world seemed pent beneath the purple firmament  by rapid walking in the heat shelton had got rid of his despondency he felt like one who is to see his mistress after long estrangement he bathed and straightening his tieends stood smiling at the glass his fear unhappiness and doubts seemed like an evil dream how much worse off would he not have been had it all been true  it was dinnerparty night and when he reached the drawingroom the guests were there already chattering of the coming storm antonia was not yet down and shelton stood by the piano waiting for her entry red faces spotless shirtfronts white arms and freshlytwisted hair were all around him some one handed him a clove carnation and as he held it to his nose antonia came in breathless as though she had rushed downstairs her cheeks were pale no longer her hand kept stealing to her throat the flames of the coming storm seemed to have caught fire within her to be scorching her in her white frock she passed him close and her fragrance whipped his senses  she had never seemed to him so lovely  never again will shelton breathe the perfume of melons and pineapples without a strange emotion from where he sat at dinner he could not see antonia but amidst the chattering of voices the clink of glass and silver the sights and sounds and scents of feasting he thought how he would go to her and say that nothing mattered but her love he drank the frosted palegold liquid of champagne as if it had been water  the windows stood wide open in the heat the garden lay in thick soft shadow where the pitchy shapes of trees could be discerned there was not a breath of air to fan the candleflames above the flowers but two large moths fearful of the heavy dark flew in and wheeled between the lights over the diners heads one fell scorched into a dish of fruit and was removed the other eluding all the swish of napkins and the efforts of the footmen continued to make soft fluttering rushes till shelton rose and caught it in his hand he took it to the window and threw it out into the darkness and he noticed that the air was thick and tepid to his face at a sign from mr dennant the muslin curtains were then drawn across the windows and in gratitude perhaps for this protection this filmy barrier between them and the muffled threats of nature everyone broke out in talk it was such a night as comes in summer after perfect weather frightening in its heat and silence which was broken by the distant thunder travelling low along the ground like the muttering of all dark places on the earthsuch a night as seems by very breathlessness to smother life and with its fateful threats to justify mans cowardice  the ladies rose at last the circle of the rosewood diningtable which had no cloth strewn with flowers and silver gilt had a likeness to some autumn pool whose brown depths of oily water gleam under the sunset with red and yellow leaves above it the smoke of cigarettes was clinging like a mist to water when the sun goes down shelton became involved in argument with his neighbour on the english character  in england weve mislaid the recipe of life he said pleasures a lost art we dont get drunk were ashamed of love and as to beauty weve lost the eye for it in exchange we have got money but what s the good of money when we dont know how to spend it excited by his neighbours smile he added as to thought we think so much of what our neighbours think that we never think at all have you ever watched a foreigner when hes listening to an englishman we re in the habit of despising foreigners the scorn we have for them is nothing to the scorn they have for us and they are right look at our taste what is the good of owning riches if we dont know how to use them  thats rather new to me his neighbour said there may be something in it did you see that case in the papers the other day of old hornblower who left the 1820 port that fetched a guinea a bottle when the purchaserpoor fellercame to drink it he found eleven bottles out of twelve completely ullagedha ha well theres nothing wrong with this and he drained his glass  no answered shelton  when they rose to join the ladies he slipped out on the lawn  at once he was enveloped in a bath of heat a heavy odour sensual sinister was in the air as from a sudden flowering of amorous shrubs he stood and drank it in with greedy nostrils putting his hand down he felt the grass it was dry and charged with electricity then he saw pale and candescent in the blackness three or four great lilies the authors of that perfume the blossoms seemed to be rising at him through the darkness as though putting up their faces to be kissed he straightened himself abruptly and went in  the guests were leaving when shelton who was watching saw antonia slip through the drawingroom window he could follow the white glimmer of her frock across the lawn but lost it in the shadow of the trees casting a hasty look to see that he was not observed he too slipped out the blackness and the heat were stifling he took great breaths of it as if it were the purest mountain air and treading softly on the grass stole on towards the holm oak his lips were dry his heart beat painfully the mutter of the distant thunder had quite ceased waves of hot air came wheeling in his face and in their midst a sudden rush of cold he thought the storm is coming now and stole on towards the tree she was lying in the hammock her figure a white blur in the heart of the trees shadow rocking gently to a little creaking of the branch shelton held his breath she had not heard him he crept up close behind the trunk till he stood in touch of her i mustnt startle her he thought antonia  there was a faint stir in the hammock but no answer he stood over her but even then he could not see her face he only had a sense of something breathing and alive within a yard of himof something warm and soft he whispered again antonia but again there came no answer and a sort of fear and frenzy seized on him he could no longer hear her breathe the creaking of the branch had ceased what was passing in that silent living creature there so close and then he heard again the sound of breathing quick and scared like the fluttering of a bird in a moment he was staring in the dark at an empty hammock  he stayed beside the empty hammock till he could bear uncertainty no longer but as he crossed the lawn the sky was rent from end to end by jagged lightning rain spattered him from head to foot and with a deafening crack the thunder broke  he sought the smokingroom but recoiling at the door went to his own room and threw himself down on the bed the thunder groaned and sputtered in long volleys the lightning showed him the shapes of things within the room with a weird distinctness that rent from them all likeness to the purpose they were made for bereaved them of utility of their matteroffactness presented them as skeletons abstractions with indecency in their appearance like the naked nerves and sinews of a leg preserved in spirit the sound of the rain against the house stunned his power of thinking he rose to shut his windows then returning to his bed threw himself down again he stayed there till the storm was over in a kind of stupor but when the boom of the retreating thunder grew every minute less distinct he rose then for the first time he saw something white close by the door  it was a note  i have made a mistake please forgive me and go awayantonia     chapter xxxii  wilderness  when he had read this note shelton put it down beside his sleevelinks on his dressing table stared in the mirror at himself and laughed but his lips soon stopped him laughing he threw himself upon his bed and pressed his face into the pillows he lay there halfdressed throughout the night and when he rose soon after dawn he had not made his mind up what to do the only thing he knew for certain was that he must not meet antonia  at last he penned the following  i have had a sleepless night with toothache and think it best to run up to the dentist at once if a tooth must come out the sooner the better  he addressed it to mrs dennant and left it on his table after doing this he threw himself once more upon his bed and this time fell into a doze  he woke with a start dressed and let himself quietly out the likeness of his going to that of ferrand struck him both outcasts now he thought  he tramped on till noon without knowing or caring where he went then entering a field threw himself down under the hedge and fell asleep  he was awakened by a whirr a covey of partridges with wings glistening in the sun were straggling out across the adjoining field of mustard they soon settled in the oldmaidish way of partridges and began to call upon each other  some cattle had approached him in his sleep and a beautiful bay cow with her head turned sideways was snuffing at him gently exhaling her peculiar sweetness she was as fine in legs and coat as any racehorse she dribbled at the corners of her black moist lips her eye was soft and cynical breathing the vague sweetness of the mustardfield rubbing dry graspstalks in his fingers shelton had a moments happinessthe happiness of sun and sky of the eternal quiet and untold movements of the fields why could not human beings let their troubles be as this cow left the flies that clung about her eyes he dozed again and woke up with a laugh for this was what he dreamed  he fancied he was in a room at once the hall and drawingroom of some country house in the centre of this room a lady stood who was looking in a handglass at her face beyond a door or window could be seen a garden with a row of statues and through this door people passed without apparent object  suddenly shelton saw his mother advancing to the lady with the handglass whom now he recognised as mrs foliot but as he looked his mother changed to mrs dennant and began speaking in a voice that was a sort of abstract of refinement je fais de la philosophic it said i take the individual for what shes worth i do not condemn above all one must have spirit the lady with the mirror continued looking in the glass and though he could not see her face he could see its imagepale with greenish eyes and a smile like scorn itself then by a swift transition he was walking in the garden talking to mrs dennant  it was from this talk that he awoke with laughter but she had been saying dick ive always been accustomed to believe what i was told it was so unkind of her to scorn me just because i happen to be secondhand and her voice awakened sheltons pity it was like a frightened childs i dont know what i shall do if i have to form opinions for myself i was nt brought up to it i ve always had them nice and secondhand how am i to go to work one must believe what other people do not that i think much of other people but you do know what it isone feels so much more comfortable and her skirts rustled but dick whatever happensher voice entreateddo let antonia get her judgments secondhand never mind for meif i must form opinions for myself i mustbut dont let her any old opinions so long as they are old it s dreadful to have to think out new ones for oneself and he awoke his dream had had in it the element called art for in its gross absurdity mrs dennant had said things that showed her soul more fully than anything she would have said in life  no said a voice quite close behind the hedge not many frenchmen thank the lord a few coveys of hungarians over from the dukes sir james some pie  shelton raised himself with drowsy curiositystill half asleepand applied his face to a gap in the high thick osiers of the hedge four men were seated on campstools round a foldingtable on which was a pie and other things to eat a gamecart welladorned with birds and hares stood at a short distance the tails of some dogs were seen moving humbly and a valet opening bottles shelton had forgotten that it was the first the host was a soldierly and freckled man an older man sat next him squarejawed with an absentlooking eye and sharpened nose next him again there was a bearded person whom they seemed to call the commodore in the fourth to his alarm shelton recognised the gentleman called mabbey it was really no matter for surprise to meet him miles from his own place for he was one of those who wander with a valet and two guns from the twelfth of august to the end of january and are then supposed to go to monte carlo or to sleep until the twelfth of august comes again  he was speaking  did you hear what a bag we made on the twelfth sir james  ah yes what was that have you sold your bay horse glennie  shelton had not decided whether or no to sneak away when the commodores thick voice began  my man tellsh me that mrs foliothawhas lamed her arab does she mean to come out cubbing  shelton observed the smile that came on all their faces foliot s paying for his good time now what a donkey to get caught it seemed to say he turned his back and shut his eyes  cubbing replied glennie hardly  never could shee anything wonderful in her looks went on the commodore so quiet you never knew that she was in the room i remember sayin to her once mrs lutheran now what do you like besht in all the world and what do you think she answered music haw  the voice of mabbey said  he was always a dark horse foliot it s always the dark horses that get let in for this kind of thing and there was a sound as though he licked his lips  they say said the voice of the host he never gives you back a greeting now queer fish they say that shes devoted to him  coming so closely on his meeting with this lady and on the dream from which he had awakened this conversation mesmerised the listener behind the hedge  if he gives up his huntin and his shootin i dont see what the deuce he ll do hes resigned his clubs as to his chance of parliament said the voice of mabbey  thousand pities said sir james still he knew what to expect  very queer fellows those foliots said the commodore there was his father he d always rather talk to any scarecrow he came across than to you or me wonder what hell do with all his horses i should like that chestnut of his  you cant tell what a fellow ll do said the voice of mabbeytake to drink or writin books old charlie wayne came to gazin at stars and twice a week he used to go and paddle round in whitechapel teachin pothooks  glennie said sir james what s become of smollett your old keeper  obliged to get rid of him shelton tried again to close his ears but again he listened getting a bit too old lost me a lot of eggs last season  ah said the commodore when they oncesh begin to lose eggsh  as a matter of fact his sonyou remember him sir james he used to load for yougot a girl into trouble when her people gave her the chuck old smollet took her in beastly scandal it made too the girl refused to marry smollett and old smollett backed her up naturally the parson and the village cut up rough my wife offered to get her into one of those reformatory whatd youcallems but the old fellow said she should nt go if she did nt want to bad business altogether put him quite off his stroke i only got five hundred pheasants last year instead of eight  there was a silence shelton again peeped through the hedge all were eating pie  in warwickshire said the commodore they always marryhawand live reshpectable ever after  quite so remarked the host it was a bit too thick her refusing to marry him she said he took advantage of her  shes sorry by this time said sir james lucky escape for young smollett queer the obstinacy of some of these old fellows  what are we doing after lunch asked the commodore  the next field said the host is pasture we line up along the hedge and drive that mustard towards the roots there ought to be a good few birds  shelton rose and crouching stole softly to the gate  on the twelfth shootin in two parties followed the voice of mabbey from the distance  whether from his walk or from his sleepless night shelton seemed to ache in every limb but he continued his tramp along the road he was no nearer to deciding what to do it was late in the afternoon when he reached maidenhead and after breaking fast got into a london train and went to sleep at ten oclock that evening he walked into st jamess park and there sat down  the lamplight dappled through the tired foliage on to these benches which have rested many vagrants darkness has ceased to be the lawful cloak of the unhappy but mother night was soft and moonless and man had not despoiled her of her comfort quite  shelton was not alone upon the seat for at the far end was sitting a young girl with a red round sullen face and beyond and further still were dim benches and dim figures sitting on them as though lifes institutions had shot them out in an endless line of rubbish  ah thought shelton in the dreamy way of tired people the institutions are all right its the spirit thats all  wrong said a voice behind him why of course youve taken the wrong turn old man  he saw a policeman with a red face shining through the darkness talking to a strange old figure like some aged and dishevelled bird  thank you constable the old man said as ive come wrong ill take a rest chewing his gums he seemed to fear to take the liberty of sitting down  shelton made room and the old fellow took the vacant place  youll excuse me sir im sure he said in shaky tones and snatching at his battered hat i see you was a gentlemanand lovingly he dwelt upon the wordwould nt disturb you for the world im not used to being out at night and the seats do get so full old age must lean on something youll excuse me sir i m sure  of course said shelton gently  im a respectable old man really said his neighbour i never took a liberty in my life but at my age sir you get nervous standin about the streets as i been this last week an sleepin in them dosshousesoh theyre dreadful rough placesa dreadful rough lot there yes the old man said again as shelton turned to look at him struck by the real selfpity in his voice dreadful rough places  a movement of his head which grew on a lean plucked neck like that of an old fowl had brought his face into the light it was long and run to seed and had a large red nose its thin colourless lips were twisted sideways and apart showing his semitoothless mouth and his eyes had that aged look of eyes in which all colour runs into a thin rim round the iris and over them kept coming films like the films over parrots eyes he was or should have been cleanshaven his hairfor he had taken off his hat was thick and lank of dusty colour as far as could be seen without a speck of grey and parted very beautifully just about the middle  i can put up with that he said again i never interferes with nobody and nobody dont interfere with me but what frightens mehis voice grew steady as if too terrified to shake is never knowin day to day what s to become of yer oh that a dreadful that is  it must be answered shelton  ah it is the old man said and the winter cumin on i never was much used to open air bein in domestic service all my life but i dont mind that so long as i can see my way to earn a livin well thank god ive got a job at last and his voice grew cheerful suddenly sellin papers is not what i been accustomed to but the westminister they tell me thats one of the most respectable of the evenin papersin fact i know it is so now im sure to get on i try hard  how did you get the job asked shelton  i ve got my character the old fellow said making a gesture with a skinny hand towards his chest as if it were there he kept his character  thank god nobody cant take that away i never parts from that and fumbling he produced a packet holding first one paper to the light and then another and he looked anxiously at shelton in that house where i been sleepin theyre not honest they ve stolen a parcel of my thingsa lovely shirt an a pair of beautiful gloves a gentleman gave me for holdin of his horse now would nt you prosecute em sir  it depends on what you can prove  i know they had em a man must stand up for his rights thats only proper i cant afford to lose beautiful things like them i think i ought to prosecute now dont you sir  shelton restrained a smile  there said the old man smoothing out a piece of paper shakily thats sir george and his withered fingertips trembled on the middle of the page joshua creed in my service five years as butler during which time i have found him all that a servant should be and this erehe fumbled with anotherthis ere s lady glengow joshua creed i thought id like you to read em since youve been so kind  will you have a pipe  thank ye sir replied the aged butler filling his clay from sheltons pouch then taking a front tooth between his finger and his thumb he began to feel it tenderly working it to and fro with a sort of melancholy pride  my teeths acomin out he said but i enjoys pretty good health for a man of my age  how old is that  seventytwo barrin my cough and my rupture and this ere afflictionhe passed his hand over his facei ve nothing to complain of everybody has somethink it seems im a wonder for my age i think  shelton for all his pity would have given much to laugh  seventytwo he said yes a great age you remember the country when it was very different to what it is now  ah said the old butler there was gentry then i remember them drivin down to newmarket my native place sir with their own horses there was nt so much o these here middle classes then there was more too what you might call the milk o human kindness in people thennone o them amalgamated stores every man keepin his own little shop not so eager to cut his neighbours throat as you might say and then look at the price of bread o dear why it is nt a quarter what it was  and are people happier now than they were then asked shelton  the old butler sucked his pipe  no he answered shaking his old head theyve lost the contented spirit i see people runnin here and runnin there readin books findin things out they aint not so selfcontented as they were  is that possible thought shelton  no repeated the old man again sucking at his pipe and this time blowing out a lot of smoke i dont see as much happiness about not the same look on the faces t isnt likely see these ere motorcars too they say orses is goin out and as if dumbfounded at his own conclusion he sat silent for some time engaged in the lighting and relighting of his pipe  the girl at the far end stirred cleared her throat and settled down again her movement disengaged a scent of frowsy clothes the policeman had approached and scrutinised these illassorted faces his glance was jovially contemptuous till he noticed shelton and then was modified by curiosity  theres good men in the police the aged butler said when the policeman had passed ontheres good men in the police as good men as you can see and there s them that treats you like the dirta dreadful low class of man oh dear yes when they see you down in the world they think they can speak to you as they like i dont give them no chance to worry me i keeps myself to myself and speak civil to all the world you have to hold the candle to them for oh dear if they re crossedsome of themthey re a dreadful unscruplous lot of men  are you going to spend the night here  its nice and warm tonight replied the aged butler i said to the man at that low place i said dont you ever speak to me again i said dont you come near me straightforward and honest s been my motto all my life i dont want to have nothing to say to them low fellowshe made an annihilating gestureafter the way they treated me takin my things like that tomorrow i shall get a room for three shillins a week dont you think so sir well then i shall be all right i m not afraid now the mind at rest so long as i ran keep myself thats all i want i shall do firstrate i think and he stared at shelton but the look in his eyes and the halfscared optimism of his voice convinced the latter that he lived in dread so long as i can keep myself he said again i shant need no workhouse nor lose respectability  no thought shelton and for some time sat without a word when you can he said at last come and see me heres my card  the aged butler became conscious with a jerk for he was nodding  thank ye sir i will he said with pitiful alacrity down by belgravia oh i know it well i lived down in them parts with a gentleman of the name of batesonperhaps you knew him he s dead nowthe honourable bateson thank ye sir ill be sure to come and snatching at his battered hat he toilsomely secreted sheltons card amongst his character a minute later he began again to nod  the policeman passed a second time his gaze seemed to say now whats a toff doing on that seat with those two rotters and shelton caught his eye  ah he thought exactly you dont know what to make of mea man of my position sitting here poor devil to spend your days in spying on your fellowcreatures poor devil but you dont know that you re a poor devil and so you re not one  the man on the next bench sneezeda shrill and disapproving sneeze  the policeman passed again and seeing that the lower creatures were both dozing he spoke to shelton  not very safe on these ere benches sir he said you never know who you may be sittin next to if i were you sir i should be gettin onif you re not goin to spend the night here that is and he laughed as at an admirable joke  shelton looked at him and itched to say why shouldnt i but it struck him that it would sound very odd besides he thought i shall only catch a cold and without speaking he left the seat and went along towards his rooms     chapter xxxiii  the end  he reached his rooms at midnight so exhausted that without waiting to light up he dropped into a chair the curtains and blinds had been removed for cleaning and the tall windows admitted the nights staring gaze shelton fixed his eyes on that outside darkness as one lost man might fix his eyes upon another  an unaired dusty odour clung about the room but like some godsent whiff of grass or flowers wafted to one sometimes in the streets a perfume came to him the spice from the withered clove carnation still clinging to his buttonhole and he suddenly awoke from his queer trance there was a decision to be made he rose to light a candle the dust was thick on everything he touched ugh he thought how wretched and the loneliness that had seized him on the stone seat at holm oaks the day before returned with fearful force  on his table heaped without order were a pile of bills and circulars he opened them tearing at their covers with the random haste of men back from their holidays a single long envelope was placed apart   my dear dick he read  i enclose you herewith the revised draft of your marriage settlement it is now shipshape return it before the end of the week and i will have it engrossed for signature i go to scotland next wednesday for a month shall be back in good time for your wedding my love to your mother when you see her  youraffectionate uncle  edmund paramor   shelton smiled and took out the draft  this indenture made the  day of 190 between richard paramor shelton  he put it down and sank back in his chair the chair in which the foreign vagrant had been wont to sit on mornings when he came to preach philosophy  he did not stay there long but in sheer unhappiness got up and taking his candle roamed about the room fingering things and gazing in the mirror at his face which seemed to him repulsive in its wretchedness he went at last into the hall and opened the door to go downstairs again into the street but the sudden certainty that in street or house in town or country he would have to take his trouble with him made him shut it to he felt in the letterbox drew forth a letter and with this he went back to the sittingroom  it was from antonia and such was his excitement that he was forced to take three turns between the window and the wall before he could read then with a heart beating so that he could hardly hold the paper he began  i was wrong to ask you to go away i see now that it was breaking my promise and i did nt mean to do that i dont know why things have come to be so different you never think as i do about anything  i had better tell you that that letter of monsieur ferrands to mother was impudent of course you did nt know what was in it but when professor brayne was asking you about him at breakfast i felt that you believed that he was right and we were wrong and i cant understand it and then in the afternoon when that woman hurt her horse it was all as if you were on her side how can you feel like that  i must say this because i dont think i ought to have asked you to go away and i want you to believe that i will keep my promise or i should feel that you and everybody else had a right to condemn me i was awake all last night and have a bad headache this morning i cant write any more antonia  his first sensation was a sort of stupefaction of relief that had in it an element of anger he was reprieved she would not break her promise she considered herself bound in the midst of the exaltation of this thought he smiled and that smile was strange  he read it through again and like a judge began to weigh what she had written her thoughts when she was writing the facts which had led up to this  the vagrants farewell document had done the business true to his fatal gift of divesting things of clothing ferrand had not vanished without showing up his patron in his proper colours even to shelton those colours were made plain antonia had felt her lover was a traitor sounding his heart even in his stress of indecision shelton knew that this was true  then in the afternoon when that woman hurt her horse that woman it was as if you were on her side  he saw too well her mind its clear rigidity its intuitive perception of that with which it was not safe to sympathise its instinct for selfpreservation its spontaneous contempt for those without that instinct and she had written these words considering herself bound to hima man of sentiment of rebellious sympathies of untidiness of principle here was the answer to the question he had asked all day how have things come to such a pass and he began to feel compassion for her  poor child she could not jilt him there was something vulgar in the word never should it be said that antonia dennant had accented him and thrown him over no lady did these things they were impossible at the bottom of his heart he had a queer unconscious sympathy with this impossibility  once again he read the letter which seemed now impregnated with fresh meaning and the anger which had mingled with his first sensation of relief detached itself and grew in force in that letter there was something tyrannous a denial of his right to have a separate point of view it was like a finger pointed at him as an unsound person in marrying her he would be marrying not only her but her classhis class she would be there always to make him look on her and on himself and all the people that they knew and all the things they did complacently she would be there to make him feel himself superior to everyone whose life was cast in other moral moulds to feel himself superior not blatantly not consciously but with subconscious righteousness  but his anger which was like the paroxysm that two days before had made him mutter at the connoisseur i hate your dd superiority struck him all at once as impotent and ludicrous what was the good of being angry he was on the point of losing her and the anguish of that thought reacting on his anger intensified it threefold she was so certain of herself so superior to her emotions to her natural impulsessuperior to her very longing to be free from him of that fact at all events shelton had no longer any doubt it was beyond argument she did not really love him she wanted to be free of him  a photograph hung in his bedroom at holm oaks of a group round the hall door the honourable charlotte penguin mrs dennant lady bonington halidome mr dennant and the stainedglass manall were there and on the lefthand side looking straight in front of her antonia her face in its youthfulness more than all those others expressed their point of view behind those calm young eyes lay a world of safety and tradition i am not as others are they seemed to say  and from that photograph mr and mrs dennant singled themselves out he could see their faces as they talkedtheir faces with a
