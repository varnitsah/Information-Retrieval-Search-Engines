72567263	an inquiry into the nature and progress of rent  and the principles by which it is regulated  by the rev t r malthus  professor of history and political economy in the east india college hertfordshire  london  printed for john murray albemarle street  1815   contents       advertisement       rent     advertisement   the following tract contains the substance of some notes on rent which with others on different subjects relating to political economy i have collected in the course of my professional duties at the east india college it has been my intention at some time or other to put them in a form for publication and the very near connection of the subject of the present inquiry with the topics immediately under discussion has induced me to hasten its appearance at the present moment it is the duty of those who have any means of contributing to the public stock of knowledge not only to do so but to do it at the time when it is most likely to be useful if the nature of the disquisition should appear to the reader hardly to suit the form of a pamphlet my apology must be that it was not originally intended for so ephemeral a shape      rent c   the rent of land is a portion of the national revenue which has always been considered as of very high importance  according to adam smith it is one of the three original sources of wealth on which the three great divisions of society are supported  by the economists it is so preeminently distinguished that it is considered as exclusively entitled to the name of riches and the sole fund which is capable of supporting the taxes of the state and on which they ultimately fall  and it has perhaps a particular claim to our attention at the present moment on account of the discussions which are going on respecting the corn laws and the effects of rent on the price of raw produce and the progress of agricultural improvement  the rent of land may be defined to be that portion of the value of the whole produce which remains to the owner of the land after all the outgoings belonging to its cultivation of whatever kind have been paid including the profits of the capital employed estimated according to the usual and ordinary rate of the profits of agricultural stock at the time being  it sometimes happens that from accidental and temporary circumstances the farmer pays more or less than this but this is the point towards which the actual rents paid are constantly gravitating and which is therefore always referred to when the term is used in a general sense  the immediate cause of rent is obviously the excess of price above the cost of production at which raw produce sells in the market  the first object therefore which presents itself for inquiry is the cause or causes of the high price of raw produce  after very careful and repeated revisions of the subject i do not find myself able to agree entirely in the view taken of it either by adam smith or the economists and still less by some more modern writers  almost all these writers appear to me to consider rent as too nearly resembling in its nature and the laws by which it is governed the excess of price above the cost of production which is the characteristic of a monopoly  adam smith though in some parts of the eleventh chapter of his first book he contemplates rent quite in its true light 1 and has interspersed through his work more just observations on the subject than any other writer has not explained the most essential cause of the high price of raw produce with sufficient distinctness though he often touches on it and by applying occasionally the term monopoly to the rent of land without stopping to mark its more radical peculiarities he leaves the reader without a definite impression of the real difference between the cause of the high price of the necessaries of life and of monopolized commodities  some of the views which the economists have taken of the nature of rent appear to me in like manner to be quite just but they have mixed them with so much error and have drawn such preposterous and contradictory conclusions from them that what is true in their doctrines has been obscured and lost in the mass of superincumbent error and has in consequence produced little effect their great practical conclusion namely the propriety of taxing exclusively the net rents of the landlords evidently depends upon their considering these rents as completely disposable like that excess of price above the cost of production which distinguishes a common monopoly  m say in his valuable treatise on political economy in which he has explained with great clearness many points which have not been sufficiently developed by adam smith has not treated the subject of rent in a manner entirely satisfactory in speaking of the different natural agents which as well as the land cooperate with the labours of man he observes heureusement personne na pu dire le vent et le soleil mappartiennent et le service quils rendent doit metre paye 2 and though he acknowledges that for obvious reasons property in land is necessary yet he evidently considers rent as almost exclusively owing to such appropriation and to external demand  in the excellent work of m de sismondi de la richesse commerciale he says in a note on the subject of rent cette partie de la rente fonciere est celle que les economistes ont decoree du nom du produit net comme etant le seul fruit du travail qui aj outat quelquechose a la richesse nationale on pourrait au contraire soutenir contre eux que cest la seule partie du produit du travail dont la valeur soit purement nominale et nait rien de reelle cest en effet le resultat de laugmentation de prix quobtient un vendeur en vertu de son privilege sans que la chose vendue en vaille reellement davantage 3 the prevailing opinions among the more modern writers in our own country have appeared to me to incline towards a similar view of the subject and not to multiply citations i shall only add that in a very respectable edition of the wealth of nations lately published by mr buchanan of edinburgh the idea of monopoly is pushed still further and while former writers though they considered rent as governed by the laws of monopoly were still of opinion that this monopoly in the case of land was necessary and useful mr buchanan sometimes speaks of it even as prejudicial and as depriving the consumer of what it gives to the landlord  in treating of productive and unproductive labour in the last volume he observes 4 that the net surplus by which the economists estimate the utility of agriculture plainly arises from the high price of its produce which however advantageous to the landlord who receives it is surely no advantage to the consumer who pays it were the produce of agriculture to be sold for a lower price the same net surplus would not remain after defraying the expenses of cultivation but agriculture would be still equally productive to the general stock and the only difference would be that as the landlord was formerly enriched by the high price at the expense of the community the community would now profit by the low price at the expense of the landlord the high price in which the rent or net surplus originates while it enriches the landlord who has the produce of agriculture to sell diminishes in the same proportion the wealth of those who are its purchasers and on this account it is quite inaccurate to consider the landlords rent as a clear addition to the national wealth in other parts of his work he uses the same or even stronger language and in a note on the subject of taxes he speaks of the high price of the produce of land as advantageous to those who receive it it but proportionably injurious to those who pay it in this view he adds it can form no general addition to the stock of the community as the net surplus in question is nothing more than a revenue transferred from one class to another and from the mere circumstance of its thus changing hands it is clear that no fund can arise out of which to pay taxes the revenue which pays for the produce of land exists already in the hands of those who purchase that produce and if the price of subsistence were lower it would still remain in their hands where it would be just as available for taxation as when by a higher price it is transferred to the landed proprietor 5  that there are some circumstances connected with rent which have an affinity to a natural monopoly will be readily allowed the extent of the earth itself is limited and cannot be enlarged by human demand and the inequality of soils occasions even at an early period of society a comparative scarcity of the best lands and so far is undoubtedly one of the causes of rent properly so called on this account perhaps the term partial monopoly might be fairly applicable but the scarcity of land thus implied is by no means alone sufficient to produce the effects observed and a more accurate investigation of the subject will show us how essentially different the high price of raw produce is both in its nature and origin and the laws by which it is governed from the high price of a common monopoly  the causes of the high price of raw produce may be stated to be three  first and mainly that quality of the earth by which it can be made to yield a greater portion of the necessaries of life than is required for the maintenance of the persons employed on the land  secondly that quality peculiar to the necessaries of life of being able to create their own demand or to raise up a number of demanders in proportion to the quantity of necessaries produced  and thirdly the comparative scarcity of the most fertile land  the qualities of the soil and of its products here noticed as the primary causes of the high price of raw produce are the gifts of nature to man they are quite unconnected with monopoly and yet are so absolutely essential to the existence of rent that without them no degree of scarcity or monopoly could have occasioned that excess of the price of raw produce above the cost of production which shows itself in this form  if for instance the soil of the earth had been such that however well directed might have been the industry of man he could not have produced from it more than was barely sufficient to maintain those whose labour and attention were necessary to its products though in this case food and raw materials would have been evidently scarcer than at present and the land might have been in the same manner monopolized by particular owners vet it is quite clear that neither rent nor any essential surplus produce of the land in the form of high profits could have existed  it is equally clear that if the necessaries of life the most important products of landhad not the property of creating an increase of demand proportioned to their increased quantity such increased quantity would occasion a fall in their exchangeable value however abundant might be the produce of a country its population might remain stationary and this abundance without a proportionate demand and with a very high corn price of labour which would naturally take place under these circumstances might reduce the price of raw produce like the price of manufactures to the cost of production  it has been sometimes argued that it is mistaking the principle of population to imagine that the increase of food or of raw produce alone can occasion a proportionate increase of population this is no doubt true but it must be allowed as has been justly observed by adam smith that when food is provided it is comparatively easy to find the necessary clothing and lodging and it should always be recollected that land does not produce one commodity alone but in addition to that most indispensable of all commoditiesfoodit produces also the materials for the other necessaries of life and the labour required to work up these materials is of course never excluded from the consideration 6  it is therefore strictly true that land produces the necessaries of life produces food materials and labour produces the means by which and by which alone an increase of people may be brought into being and supported in this respect it is fundamentally different from every other kind of machine known to man and it is natural to suppose that it should be attended with some peculiar effects  if the cotton machinery in this country were to go on increasing at its present rate or even much faster but instead of producing one particular sort of substance which may be used for some parts of dress and furniture etc had the qualities of land and could yield what with the assistance of a little labour economy and skill could furnish food clothing and lodging in such proportions as to create an increase of population equal to the increased supply of these necessaries the demand for the products of such improved machinery would continue in excess above the cost of production and this excess would no longer exclusively belong to the machinery of the land 7  there is a radical difference in the cause of a demand for those objects which are strictly necessary to the support of human life and a demand for all other commodities in all other commodities the demand is exterior to and independent of the production itself and in the case of a monopoly whether natural or artificial the excess of price is in proportion to the smallness of the supply compared with the demand while this demand is comparatively unlimited in the case of strict necessaries the existence and increase of the demand or of the number of demanders must depend upon the existence and increase of these necessaries themselves and the excess of their price above the cost of their production must depend upon and is permanently limited by the excess of their quantity above the quantity necessary to maintain the labour required to produce them without which excess of quantity no demand could have existed according to the laws of nature for more than was necessary to support the producers  it has been stated in the new edition of the wealth of nations that the cause of the high price of raw produce is that such price is required to proportion the consumption to the supply 8 this is also true but it affords no solution of the point in question we still want to know why the consumption and supply are such as to make the price so greatly exceed the cost of production and the main cause is evidently the fertility of the earth in producing the necessaries of life diminish this plenty diminish the fertility of the soil and the excess will diminish diminish it still further and it will disappear the cause of the high price of the necessaries of life above the cost of production is to be found in their abundance rather than their scarcity and is not only essentially different from the high price occasioned by artificial monopolies but from the high price of those peculiar products of the earth not connected with food which may be called natural and necessary monopolies  the produce of certain vineyards in france which from the peculiarity of their soil and situation exclusively yield wine of a certain flavour is sold of course at a price very far exceeding the cost of production and this is owing to the greatness of the competition for such wine compared with the scantiness of its supply which confines the use of it to so small a number of persons that they are able and rather than go without it willing to give an excessively high price but if the fertility of these lands were increased so as very considerably to increase the produce this produce might so fall in value as to diminish most essentially the excess of its price above the cost of production while on the other hand if the vineyards were to become less productive this excess might increase to almost any extent  the obvious cause of these effects is that in all monopolies properly so called whether natural or artificial the demand is exterior to and independent of the production itself the number of persons who might have a taste for scarce wines and would be desirous of entering into a competition for the purchase of them might increase almost indefinitely while the produce itself was decreasing and its price therefore would have no other limit than the numbers powers and caprices of the competitors for it  in the production of the necessaries of life on the contrary the demand is dependent upon the produce itself and the effects are in consequence widely different in this case it is physically impossible that the number of demanders should increase while the quantity of produce diminishes as the demanders only exist by means of this produce the fertility of soil and consequent abundance of produce from a certain quantity of land which in the former case diminished the excess of price above the cost of production is in the present case the specific cause of such excess and the diminished fertility which in the former case might increase the price to almost any excess above the cost of production may be safely asserted to be the sole cause which could permanently maintain the necessaries of life at a price not exceeding the cost of production  is it then possible to consider the price of the necessaries of life as regulated upon the principle of a common monopoly is it possible with m de sismondi to regard rent as the sole produce of labour which has a value purely nominal and the mere result of that augmentation of price which a seller obtains in consequence of a peculiar privilege or with mr buchanan to consider it as no addition to the national wealth but merely as a transfer of value advantageous only to the landlords and proportionately injurious to the consumers  is it not on the contrary a clear indication of a most inestimable quality in the soil which god has bestowed on manthe quality of being able to maintain more persons than are necessary to work it is it not a part and we shall see further on that it is an absolutely necessary part of that surplus produce from the land 9 which has been justly stated to be the source of all power and enjoyment and without which in fact there would be no cities no military or naval force no arts no learning none of the finer manufactures none of the conveniences and luxuries of foreign countries and none of that cultivated and polished society which not only elevates and dignifies individuals but which extends its beneficial influence through the whole mass of the people  in the early periods of society or more remarkably perhaps when the knowledge and capital of an old society are employed upon fresh and fertile land this surplus produce this bountiful gift of providence shows itself chiefly in extraordinary high profits and extraordinary high wages and appears but little in the shape of rent while fertile land is in abundance and may be had by whoever asks for it nobody of course will pay a rent to a landlord but it is not consistent with the laws of nature and the limits and quality of the earth that this state of things should continue diversities of soil and situation must necessarily exist in all countries all land cannot be the most fertile all situations cannot be the nearest to navigable rivers and markets but the accumulation of capital beyond the means of employing it on land of the greatest natural fertility and the greatest advantage of situation must necessarily lower profits while the tendency of population to increase beyond the means of subsistence must after a certain time lower the wages of labour  the expense of production will thus be diminished but the value of the produce that is the quantity of labour and of the other products of labour besides corn which it can command instead of diminishing will be increased there will be an increasing number of people demanding subsistence and ready to offer their services in any way in which they can be useful the exchangeable value of food will therefore be in excess above the cost of production including in this cost the full profits of the stock employed upon the land according to the actual rate of profits at the time being and this excess is rent  nor is it possible that these rents should permanently remain as parts of the profits of stock or of the wages of labour if such an accumulation were to take place as decidedly to lower the general profits of stock and consequently the expenses of cultivation so as to make it answer to cultivate poorer land the cultivators of the richer land if they paid no rent would cease to be mere farmers or persons living upon the profits of agricultural stock they would unite the characters of farmers and landlordsa union by no means uncommon but which does not alter in any degree the nature of rent or its essential separation from profits if the general profits of stock were 20 per cent and particular portions of land would yield 30 per cent on the capital employed 10 per cent of the 30 would obviously be rent by whomsoever received  it happens indeed sometimes that from bad government extravagant habits and a faulty constitution of society the accumulation of capital is stopped while fertile land is in considerable plenty in which case profits may continue permanently very high but even in this case wages must necessarily fall which by reducing the expenses of cultivation must occasion rents there is nothing so absolutely unavoidable in the progress of society as the fall of wages that is such a fall as combined with the habits of the labouring classes will regulate the progress of population according to the means of subsistence and when from the want of an increase of capital the increase of produce is checked and the means of subsistence come to a stand the wages of labour must necessarily fall so low as only just to maintain the existing population and to prevent any increase  we observe in consequence that in all those countries such as poland where from the want of accumulation the profits of stock remain very high and the progress of cultivation either proceeds very slowly or is entirely stopped the wages of labour are extremely low and this cheapness of labour by diminishing the expenses of cultivation as far as labour is concerned counteracts the effects of the high profits of stock and generally leaves a larger rent to the landlord than in those countries such as america where by a rapid accumulation of stock which can still find advantageous employment and a great demand for labour which is accompanied by an adequate increase of produce and population profits cannot be low and labour for some considerable time remains very high  it may be laid down therefore as an incontrovertible truth that as a nation reaches any considerable degree of wealth and any considerable fullness of population which of course cannot take place without a great fall both in the profits of stock and the wages of labour the separation of rents as a kind of fixture upon lands of a certain quality is a law as invariable as the action of the principle of gravity and that rents are neither a mere nominal value nor a value unnecessarily and injuriously transferred from one set of people to another but a most real and essential part of the whole value of the national property and placed by the laws of nature where they are on the land by whomsoever possessed whether the landlord the crown or the actual cultivator  rent then has been traced to the same common nature with that general surplus from the land which is the result of certain qualities of the soil and its products and it has been found to commence its separation from profits as soon as profits and wages fall owing to the comparative scarcity of fertile land in the natural progress of a country towards wealth and population  having examined the nature and origin of rent it remains for us to consider the laws by which it is governed and by which its increase or decrease is regulated  when capital has accumulated and labour fallen on the most eligible lands of a country other lands less favourably circumstanced with respect to fertility or situation may be occupied with advantage the expenses of cultivation including profits having fallen poorer land or land more distant from markets though yielding at first no rent may fully repay these expenses and fully answer to the cultivator and again when either the profits of stock or the wages of labour or both have still further fallen land still poorer or still less favourably situated may be taken into cultivation and at every step it is clear that if the price of produce does not fall the rents of land will rise and the price of produce will not fall as long as the industry and ingenuity of the labouring classes assisted by the capitals of those not employed upon the land can find something to give in exchange to the cultivators and landlords which will stimulate them to continue undiminished their agricultural exertions and maintain their increasing excess of produce  in tracing more particularly the laws which govern the rise and fall of rents the main causes which diminish the expenses of cultivation or reduce the cost of the instruments of production compared with the price of produce require to be more specifically enumerated the principal of these seem to be four first such an accumulation of capital as will lower the profits of stock secondly such an increase of population as will lower the wages of labour thirdly such agricultural improvements or such increase of exertions as will diminish the number of labourers necessary to produce a given effect and fourthly such an increase in the price of agricultural produce from increased demand as without nominally lowering the expense of production will increase the difference between this expense and the price of produce  the operation of the three first causes in lowering the expenses of cultivation compared with the price of produce are quite obvious the fourth requires a few further observations  if a great and continued demand should arise among surrounding nations for the raw produce of a particular country the price of this produce would of course rise considerably and the expenses of cultivation rising only slowly and gradually to the same proportion the price of produce might for a long time keep so much ahead as to give a prodigious stimulus to improvement and encourage the employment of much capital in bringing fresh land under cultivation and rendering the old much more productive  nor would the effect be essentially different in a country which continued to feed its own people if instead of a demand for its raw produce there was the same increasing demand for its manufactures these manufactures if from such a demand the value of their amount in foreign countries was greatly to increase would bring back a great increase of value in return which increase of value could not fail to increase the value of the raw produce the demand for agricultural as well as manufactured produce would be augmented and a considerable stimulus though not perhaps to the same extent as in the last case would be given to every kind of improvement on the land  a similar effect would be produced by the introduction of new machinery and a more judicious division of labour in manufactures it almost always happens in this case not only that the quantity of manufactures is very greatly increased but that the value of the whole mass is augmented from the great extension of the demand for them occasioned by their cheapness we see in consequence that in all rich manufacturing and commercial countries the value of manufactured and commercial products bears a very high proportion to the raw products 10 whereas in comparatively poor countries without much internal trade and foreign commerce the value of their raw produce constitutes almost the whole of their wealth if we suppose the wages of labour so to rise with the rise of produce as to give the labourer the same command of the means of subsistence as before yet if he is able to purchase a greater quantity of other necessaries and conveniencies both foreign and domestic with the price of a given quantity of corn he may be equally well fed clothed and lodged and population may be equally encouraged although the wages of labour may not rise so high in proportion as the price of produce  and even when the price of labour does really rise in proportion to the price of produce which is a very rare case and can only happen when the demand for labour precedes or is at least quite contemporary with the demand for produce it is so impossible that all the other outgoings in which capital is expended should rise precisely in the same proportion and at the same time such as compositions for tithes parish rates taxes manure and the fixed capital accumulated under the former low prices that a period of some continuance can scarcely fail to occur when the difference between the price of produce and the cost of production is increased  in some of these cases the increase in the price of agricultural produce compared with the cost of the instruments of production appears from what has been said to be only temporary and in these instances it will often give a considerable stimulus to cultivation by an increase of agricultural profits without showing itself much in the shape of rent it hardly ever fails however to increase rent ultimately the increased capital which is employed in consequence of the opportunity of making great temporary profits can seldom if ever be entirely removed from the land at the expiration of the current leases and on the renewal of these leases the landlord feels the benefit of it in the increase of his rents  whenever then by the operation of the four causes above mentioned the difference between the price of produce and the cost of the instruments of production increases the rents of land will rise  it is however not necessary that all these four causes should operate at the same time it is only necessary that the difference here mentioned should increase if for instance the price of produce were to rise while the wages of labour and the price of the other branches of capital did not rise in proportion and at the same time improved modes of agriculture were coming into general use it is evident that this difference might be increased although the profits of agricultural stock were not only undiminished but were to rise decidedly higher  of the great additional quantity of capital employed upon the land in this country during the last twenty years by far the greater part is supposed to have been generated on the soil and not to have been brought from commerce or manufactures and it was unquestionably the high profits of agricultural stock occasioned by improvements in the modes of agriculture and by the constant rise of prices followed only slowly by a proportionate rise in the different branches of capital that afforded the means of so rapid and so advantageous an accumulation  in this case cultivation has been extended and rents have risen although one of the instruments of production capital has been dearer  in the same manner a fall of profits and improvements in agriculture or even one of them separately might raise rents notwithstanding a rise of wages  it may be laid down then as a general truth that rents naturally rise as the difference between the price of produce and the cost of the instruments of production increases  it is further evident that no fresh land can be taken into cultivation till rents have risen or would allow of a rise upon what is already cultivated  land of an inferior quality requires a great quantity of capital to make it yield a given produce and if the actual price of this produce be not such as fully to compensate the cost of production including the existing rate of profits the land must remain uncultivated it matters not whether this compensation is effected by an increase in the money price of raw produce without a proportionate increase in the money price of the instruments of production or by a decrease in the price of the instruments of production without a proportionate decrease in the price of produce what is absolutely necessary is a greater relative cheapness of the instruments of production to make up for the quantity of them required to obtain a given produce from poor land  but whenever by the operation of one or more of the causes before mentioned the instruments of production become cheaper and the difference between the price of produce and the expenses of cultivation increases rents naturally rise it follows therefore as a direct and necessary consequence that it can never answer to take fresh land of a poorer quality into cultivation till rents have risen or would allow of a rise on what is already cultivated  it is equally true that without the same tendency to a rise of rents occasioned by the operation of the same causes it cannot answer to lay out fresh capital in the improvement of old landat least upon the supposition that each farm is already furnished with as much capital as can be laid out to advantage according to the actual rate of profits  it is only necessary to state this proposition to make its truth appear it certainly may happen and i fear it happens frequently that farmers are not provided with all the capital which could be employed upon their farms at the actual rate of agricultural profits but supposing they are so provided it implies distinctly that more could not be applied without loss till by the operation of one or more of the causes above enumerated rents had tended to rise  it appears then that the power of extending cultivation and increasing produce both by the cultivation of fresh land and the improvement of the old depends entirely upon the existence of such prices compared with the expense of production as would raise rents in the actual state of cultivation  but though cultivation cannot be extended and the produce of the country increased but in such a state of things as would allow of a rise of rents yet it is of importance to remark that this rise of rents will be by no means in proportion to the extension of cultivation or the increase of produce every relative fall in the price of the instruments of production may allow of the employment of a considerable quantity of additional capital and when either new land is taken into cultivation or the old improved the increase of produce may be considerable though the increase of rents be trifling we see in consequence that in the progress of a country towards a high state of cultivation the quantity of capital employed upon the land and the quantity of produce yielded by it bears a constantly increasing proportion to the amount of rents unless counterbalanced by extraordinary improvements in the modes of cultivation 11  according to the returns lately made to the board of agriculture the average proportion which rent bears to the value of the whole produce seems not to exceed one fifth 12 whereas formerly when there was less capital employed and less value produced the proportion amounted to one fourth one third or even two fifths still however the numerical difference between the price of produce and the expenses of cultivation increases with the progress of improvement and though the landlord has a less share of the whole produce yet this less share from the very great increase of the produce yields a larger quantity and gives him a greater command of corn and labour if the produce of land be represented by the number six and the landlord has one fourth of it his share will be represented by one and a half if the produce of land be as ten and the landlord has one fifth of it his share will be represented by two in the latter case therefore though the proportion of the landlords share to the whole produce is greatly diminished his real rent independently of nominal price will be increased in the proportion of from three to four and in general in all cases of increasing produce if the landlords share of this produce do not diminish in the same proportion which though it often happens during the currency of leases rarely or never happens on the renewal of them the real rents of land must rise  we see then that a progressive rise of rents seems to be necessarily connected with the progressive cultivation of new land and the progressive improvement of the old and that this rise is the natural and necessary consequence of the operation of four causes which are the most certain indications of increasing prosperity and wealthnamely the accumulation of capital the increase of population improvements in agriculture and the high price of raw produce occasioned by the extension of our manufactures and commerce  on the other hand it will appear that a fall of rents is as necessarily connected with the throwing of inferior land out of cultivation and the continued deterioration of the land of a superior quality and that it is the natural and necessary consequence of causes which are the certain indications of poverty and decline namely diminished capital diminished population a bad system of cultivation and the low price of raw produce  if it be true that cultivation cannot be extended but under such a state of prices compared with the expenses of production as will allow of an increase of rents it follows naturally that under such a state of relative prices as will occasion a fall of rents cultivation must decline if the instruments of production become dearer compared with the price of produce it is a certain sign that they are relatively scarce and in all those cases where a large quantity of them is required as in the cultivation of poor land the means of procuring them will be deficient and the land will be thrown out of employment  it appeared that in the progress of cultivation and of increasing rents it was not necessary that all the instruments of production should fall in price at the same time and that the difference between the price of produce and the expense of cultivation might increase although either the profits of stock or the wages of labour might be higher instead of lower  in the same manner when the produce of a country is declining and rents are falling it is not necessary that all the instruments of production should be dearer in a declining or stationary country one most important instrument of production is always cheap namely labour but this cheapness of labour does not counterbalance the disadvantages arising from the dearness of capital a bad system of culture and above all a fall in the price of raw produce greater than in the price of the other branches of expenditure which in addition to labour are necessary to cultivation  it has appeared also that in the progress of cultivation and of increasing rents rent though greater in positive amount bears a less and lesser proportion to the quantity of capital employed upon the land and the quantity of produce derived from it according to the same principle when produce diminishes and rents fall though the amount of rent will always be less the proportion which it bears to capital and produce will always be greater and as in the former case the diminished proportion of rent was owing to the necessity of yearly taking fresh land of an inferior quality into cultivation and proceeding in the improvement of old land when it would return only the common profits of stock with little or no rent so in the latter case the high proportion of rent is owing to the impossibility of obtaining produce whenever a great expenditure is required and the necessity of employing the reduced capital of the country in the exclusive cultivation of its richest lands  in proportion therefore as the relative state of prices is such as to occasion a progressive fall of rents more and more lands will be gradually thrown out of cultivation the remainder will be worse cultivated and the diminution of produce will proceed still faster than the diminution of rents  if the doctrine here laid down respecting the laws which govern the rise and fall of rents be near the truth the doctrine which maintains that if the produce of agriculture were sold at such a price as to yield less net surplus agriculture would be equally productive to the general stock must be very far from the truth  with regard to my own conviction indeed i feel no sort of doubt that if under the impression that the high price of raw produce which occasions rent is as injurious to the consumer as it is advantageous to the landlord a rich and improved nation were determined by law to lower the price of produce till no surplus in the shape of rent anywhere remained it would inevitably throw not only all the poor land but all except the very best land out of cultivation and probably reduce its produce and population to less than one tenth of their former amount  from the preceding account of the progress of rent it follows that the actual state of the natural rent of land is necessary to the actual produce and that the price of produce in every progressive country must be just about equal to the cost of production on land of the poorest quality actually in use or to the cost of raising additional produce on old land which yields only the usual returns of agricultural stock with little or no rent  it is quite obvious that the price cannot be less or such land would not be cultivated nor such capital employed nor can it ever much exceed this price because the poor land progressively taken into cultivation yields at first little or no rent and because it will always answer to any farmer who can command capital to lay it out on his land if the additional produce resulting from it will fully repay the profits of his stock although it yields nothing to his landlord  it follows then that the price of raw produce in reference to the whole quantity raised is sold at the natural or necessary price that is at the price necessary to obtain the actual amount of produce although by far the largest part is sold at a price very much above that which is necessary to its production owing to this part being produced at less expense while its exchangeable value remains undiminished  the difference between the price of corn and the price of manufactures with regard to natural or necessary price is this that if the price of any manufacture were essentially depressed the whole manufacture would be entirely destroyed whereas if the price of corn were essentially depressed the quantity of it only would be diminished there would be some machinery in the country still capable of sending the commodity to market at the reduced price  the earth has been sometimes compared to a vast machine presented by nature to man for the production of food and raw materials but to make the resemblance more just as far as they admit of comparison we should consider the soil as a present to man of a great number of machines all susceptible of continued improvement by the application of capital to them but yet of very different original qualities and powers  this great inequality in the powers of the machinery employed in procuring raw produce forms one of the most remarkable features which distinguishes the machinery of the land from the machinery employed in manufactures  when a machine in manufactures is invented which will produce more finished work with less labour and capital than before if there be no patent or as soon as the patent is over a sufficient number of such machines may be made to supply the whole demand and to supersede entirely the use of all the old machinery the natural consequence is that the price is reduced to the price of production from the best machinery and if the price were to be depressed lower the whole of the commodity would be withdrawn from the market  the machines which produce corn and raw materials on the contrary are the gifts of nature not the works of man and we find by experience that these gifts have very different qualities and powers the most fertile lands of a country those which like the best machinery in manufactures yield the greatest products with the least labour and capital are never found sufficient to supply the effective demand of an increasing population the price of raw produce therefore naturally rises till it becomes sufficiently high to pay the cost of raising it with inferior machines and by a more expensive process and as there cannot be two prices for corn of the same quality all the other machines the working of which requires less capital compared with the produce must yield rents in proportion to their goodness  every extensive country may thus be considered as possessing a gradation of machines for the production of corn and raw materials including in this gradation not only all the various qualities of poor land of which every large territory has generally an abundance but the inferior machinery which may be said to be employed when good land is further and further forced for additional produce as the price of raw produce continues to rise these inferior machines are successively called into action and as the price of raw produce continues to fall they are successively thrown out of action the illustration here used serves to show at once the necessity of the actual price of corn to the actual produce and the different effect which would attend a great reduction in the price of any particular manufacture and a great reduction in the price of raw produce  i hope to be excused for dwelling a little and presenting to the reader in various forms the doctrine that corn in reference to the quantity actually produced is sold at its necessary price like manufactures because i consider it as a truth of the highest importance which has been entirely overlooked by the economists by adam smith and all those writers who have represented raw produce as selling always at a monopoly price  adam smith has very clearly explained in what manner the progress of wealth and improvement tends to raise the price of cattle poultry the materials of clothing and lodging the most useful minerals etc etc compared with corn but he has not entered into the explanation of the natural causes which tend to determine the price of corn he has left the reader indeed to conclude that he considers the price of corn as determined only by the state of the mines which at the time supply the circulating medium of the commercial world but this is a cause obviously inadequate to account for the actual differences in the price of grain observable in countries at no great distance from each other and at nearly the same distance from the mines  i entirely agree with him that it is of great use to inquire into the causes of high price as from the result of such inquiry it may turn out that the very circumstance of which we complain may be the necessary consequence and the most certain sign of increasing wealth and prosperity but of all inquiries of this kind none surely can be so important or so generally interesting as an inquiry into the causes which affect the price of corn and which occasion the differences in this price so observable in different countries  i have no hesitation in stating that independently of irregularities in the currency of a country 13 and other temporary and accidental circumstances the cause of the high comparative money price of corn is its high comparative real price or the greater quantity of capital and labour which must be employed to produce it and that the reason why the real price of corn is higher and continually rising in countries which are already rich and still advancing in prosperity and population is to be found in the necessity of resorting constantly to poorer landto machines which require a greater expenditure to work themand which consequently occasion each fresh addition to the raw produce of the country to be purchased at a greater costin short it is to be found in the important truth that corn in a progressive country is sold at the price necessary to yield the actual supply and that as this supply becomes more and more difficult the price rises in proportion 14  the price of corn as determined by these causes will of course be greatly modified by other circumstances by direct and indirect taxation by improvements in the modes of cultivation by the saving of labour on the land and particularly by the importations of foreign corn the latter cause indeed may do away in a considerable degree the usual effects of great wealth on the price of corn and this wealth will then show itself in a different form  let us suppose seven or eight large countries not very distant from each other and not very differently situated with regard to the mines let us suppose further that neither their soils nor their skill in agriculture are essentially unlike that their currencies are in a natural state their taxes nothing and that every trade is free except the trade in corn let us now suppose one of them very greatly to increase in capital and manufacturing skill above the rest and to become in consequence much more rich and populous i should say that this great comparative increase of riches could not possibly take place without a great comparative advance in the price of raw produce and that such advance of price would under the circumstances supposed be the natural sign and absolutely necessary consequence of the increased wealth and population of the country in question  let us now suppose the same countries to have the most perfect freedom of intercourse in corn and the expenses of freight etc to be quite inconsiderable and let us still suppose one of them to increase very greatly above the rest in manufacturing capital and skill in wealth and population i should then say that as the importation of corn would prevent any great difference in the price of raw produce it would prevent any great difference in the quantity of capital laid out upon the land and the quantity of corn obtained from it that consequently the great increase of wealth could not take place without a great dependence on the other nations for corn and that this dependence under the circumstances supposed would be the natural sign and absolutely necessary consequence of the increased wealth and population of the country in question  these i consider as the two alternatives necessarily belonging to a great comparative increase of wealth and the supposition here made will with proper restrictions apply to the state of europe  in europe the expenses attending the carriage of corn are often considerable they form a natural barrier to importation and even the country which habitually depends upon foreign corn must have the price of its raw produce considerably higher than the general level practically also the prices of raw produce in the different countries of europe will be variously modified by very different soils very different degrees of taxation and very different degrees of improvement in the science of agriculture heavy taxation and a poor soil may occasion a high comparative price of raw produce or a considerable dependence on other countries without great wealth and population while great improvements in agriculture and a good soil may keep the price of produce low and the country independent of foreign corn in spite of considerable wealth but the principles laid down are the general principles on the subject and in applying them to any particular case the particular circumstances of such case must always be taken into consideration  with regard to improvements in agriculture which in similar soils is the great cause which retards the advance of price compared with the advance of produce although they are sometimes very powerful they are rarely found sufficient to balance the necessity of applying to poorer land or inferior machines in this respect raw produce is essentially different from manufactures  the real price of manufactures the quantity of labour and capital necessary to produce a given quantity of them is almost constantly diminishing while the quantity of labour and capital necessary to procure the last addition that has been made to the raw produce of a rich and advancing country is almost constantly increasing we see in consequence that in spite of continued improvements in agriculture the money price of corn is ceteris paribus the highest in the richest countries while in spite of this high price of corn and consequent high price of labour the money price of manufactures still continues lower than in poorer countries  i cannot then agree with adam smith in thinking that the low value of gold and silver is no proof of the wealth and flourishing state of the country where it takes place nothing of course can be inferred from it taken absolutely except the abundance of the mines but taken relatively or in comparison with the state of other countries much may be inferred from it if we are to measure the value of the precious metals in different countries and at different periods in the same country by the price of corn and labour which appears to me to be the nearest practical approximation that can be adopted and in fact corn is the measure used by adam smith himself it appears to me to follow that in countries which have a frequent commercial intercourse with each other which are nearly at the same distance from the mines and are not essentially different in soil there is no more certain sign or more necessary consequence of superiority of wealth than the low value of the precious metals or the high price of raw produce 15  it is of importance to ascertain this point that we may not complain of one of the most certain proofs of the prosperous condition of a country  it is not of course meant to be asserted that the high price of raw produce is separately taken advantageous to the consumer but that it is the necessary concomitant of superior and increasing wealth and that one of them cannot be had without the other 16  with regard to the labouring classes of society whose interests as consumers may be supposed to be most nearly concerned it is a very shortsighted view of the subject which contemplates with alarm the high price of corn as certainly injurious to them the essentials to their well being are their own prudential habits and the increasing demand for labour and i do not scruple distinctly to affirm that under similar habits and a similar demand for labour the high price of corn when it has had time to produce its natural effects so far from being a disadvantage to them is a positive and unquestionable advantage to supply the same demand for labour the necessary price of production must be paid and they must be able to command the same quantities of the necessaries of life whether they are high or low in price 17 but if they are able to command the same quantity of necessaries and receive a money price for their labour proportioned to their advanced price there is no doubt that with regard to all the objects of convenience and comfort which do not rise in proportion to corn and there are many such consumed by the poor their condition will be most decidedly improved  the reader will observe in what manner i have guarded the proposition i am well aware and indeed have myself stated in another place that the price of provisions often rises without a proportionate rise of labour but this cannot possibly happen for any length of time if the demand for labour continues increasing at the same rate and the habits of the labourer are not altered either with regard to prudence or the quantity of work which he is disposed to perform  the peculiar evil to be apprehended is that the high money price of labour may diminish the demand for it and that it has this tendency will be readily allowed particularly as it tends to increase the prices of exportable commodities but repeated experience has shown us that such tendencies are continually counterbalanced and more than counterbalanced by other circumstances and we have witnessed in our own country a greater and more rapid extension of foreign commerce than perhaps was ever known under the apparent disadvantage of a very great increase in the price of corn and labour compared with the prices of surrounding countries  on the other hand instances everywhere abound of a very low money price of labour totally failing to produce an increasing demand for it and among the labouring classes of different countries none certainly are so wretched as those where the demand for labour and the population are stationary and yet the prices of provisions extremely low compared with manufactures and foreign commodities however low they may be it is certain that under such circumstances no more will fall to the share of the labourer than is necessary just to maintain the actual population and his condition will be depressed not only by the stationary demand for labour but by the additional evil of being able to command but a small portion of manufactures or foreign commodities with the little surplus which he may possess if for instance under a stationary population we suppose that in average families two thirds of the wages estimated in corn are spent in necessary provisions it will make a great difference in the condition of the poor whether the remaining one third will command few or many conveniencies and comforts and almost invariably the higher is the price of corn the more indulgences will a given surplus purchase  the high or low price of provisions therefore in any country is evidently a most uncertain criterion of the state of the poor in that country their condition obviously depends upon other more powerful causes and it is probably true that it is as frequently good or perhaps more frequently so in countries where corn is high than where it is low  at the same time it should be observed that the high price of corn occasioned by the difficulty of procuring it may be considered as the ultimate check to the indefinite progress of a country in wealth and population and although the actual progress of countries be subject to great variations in their rate of movement both from external and internal causes and it would be rash to say that a state which is well peopled and proceeding rather slowly at present may not proceed rapidly forty years hence yet it must be owned that the chances of a future rapid progress are diminished by the high prices of corn and labour compared with other countries  it is therefore of great importance that these prices should be increased as little as possible artificially that is by taxation but every tax which falls upon agricultural capital tends to check the application of such capital to the bringing of fresh land under cultivation and the improvement of the old it was shown in a former part of this inquiry that before such application of capital could take place the price of produce compared with the instruments of production must rise sufficiently to pay the farmer but if the increasing difficulties to be overcome are aggravated by taxation it is necessary that before the proposed improvements are undertaken the price should rise sufficiently not only to pay the farmer but also the government and every tax which falls on agricultural capital either prevents a proposed improvement or causes it to be purchased at a higher price  when new leases are let these taxes are generally thrown off upon the landlord the farmer so makes his bargain or ought so to make it as to leave himself after every expense has been paid the average profits of agricultural stock in the actual circumstances of the country whatever they may be and in whatever manner they may have been affected by taxes particularly by so general a one as the property tax the farmer therefore by paying a less rent to his landlord on the renewal of his lease is relieved from any peculiar pressure and may go on in the common routine of cultivation with the common profits but his encouragement to lay out fresh capital in improvements is by no means restored by his new bargain this encouragement must depend both with regard to the farmer and the landlord himself exclusively on the price of produce compared with the price of the instruments of production and if the price of these instruments have been raised by taxation no diminution of rent can give relief it is in fact a question in which rent is not concerned and with a view to progressive improvements it may be safely asserted that the total abolition of rents would be less effectual than the removal of taxes which fall upon agricultural capital  i believe it to be the prevailing opinion that the greatest expense of growing corn in this country is almost exclusively owing to the weight of taxation of the tendency of many of our taxes to increase the expenses of cultivation and the price of corn i feel no doubt but the reader will see from the course of argument pursued in this inquiry that i think a part of this price and perhaps no inconsiderable part arises from a cause which lies deeper and is in fact the necessary result of the great superiority of our wealth and population compared with the quality of our natural soil and the extent of our territory  this is a cause which can only be essentially mitigated by the habitual importation of foreign corn and a diminished cultivation of it at home the policy of such a system has been discussed in another place but of course every relief from taxation must tend under any system to make the price of corn less high and importation less necessary  in the progress of a country towards a high state of improvement the positive wealth of the landlord ought upon the principles which have been laid down gradually to increase although his relative condition and influence in society will probably rather diminish owing to the increasing number and wealth of those who live upon a still more important surplus 18 the profits of stock  the progressive fall with few exceptions in the value of the precious metals throughout europe the still greater fall which has occurred in the richest countries together with the increase of produce which has been obtained from the soil must all conduce to make the landlord expect an increase of rents on the renewal of his leases but in reletting his farms he is liable to fall into two errors which are almost equally prejudicial to his own interests and to those of his country  in the first place he may be induced by the immediate prospect of an exorbitant rent offered by farmers bidding against each other to let his land to a tenant without sufficient capital to cultivate it in the best way and make the necessary improvements upon it this is undoubtedly a most shortsighted policy the bad effects of which have been strongly noticed by the most intelligent land surveyors in the evidence lately brought before parliament and have been particularly remarkable in ireland where the imprudence of the landlords in this respect combined perhaps with some real difficulty of finding substantial tenants has aggravated the discontents of the country and thrown the most serious obstacles in the way of an improved system of cultivation the consequence of this error is the certain loss of all that future source of rent to the landlord and wealth to the country which arises from increase of produce  the second error to which the landlord is liable is that of mistaking a mere temporary rise of prices for a rise of sufficient duration to warrant an increase of rents it frequently happens that a scarcity of one or two years or an unusual demand arising from any other cause may raise the price of raw produce to a height at which it cannot be maintained and the farmers who take land under the influence of such prices will in the return of a more natural state of things probably break and leave their farms in a ruined and exhausted state these short periods of high price are of great importance in generating capital upon the land if the farmers are allowed to have the advantage of them but if they are grasped at prematurely by the landlord capital is destroyed instead of being accumulated and both the landlord and the country incur a loss instead of gaining a benefit  a similar caution is necessary in raising rents even when the rise of prices seems as if it would be permanent in the progress of prices and rents rent ought always to be a little behind not only to afford the means of ascertaining whether the rise be temporary or permanent but even in the latter case to give a little time for the accumulation of capital on the land of which the landholder is sure to feel the full benefit in the end  there is no just reason to believe that if the lands were to give the whole of their rents to their tenants corn would be more plentiful and cheaper if the view of the subject taken in the preceding inquiry be correct the last additions made to our home produce are sold at the cost of production and the same quantity could not be produced from our own soil at a less price even without rent the effect of transferring all rents to tenants would be merely the turning them into gentlemen and tempting them to cultivate their farms under the superintendence of careless and uninterested bailiffs instead of the vigilant eye of a master who is deterred from carelessness by the fear of ruin and stimulated to exertion by the hope of a competence the most numerous instances of successful industry and welldirected knowledge have been found among those who have paid a fair rent for their lands who have embarked the whole of their capital in their undertaking and who feel it their duty to watch over it with unceasing care and add to it whenever it is possible but when this laudable spirit prevails among a tenantry it is of the very utmost importance to the progress of riches and the permanent increase of rents that it should have the power as well as the will to accumulate and an interval of advancing prices not immediately followed by a proportionate rise of rents furnishes the most effective powers of this kind these intervals of advancing prices when not succeeded by retrograde movements most powerfully contribute to the progress of national wealth and practically i should say that when once a character of industry and economy has been established temporary high profits are a more frequent and powerful source of accumulation than either an increased spirit of saving or any other cause that can be named 19 it is the only cause which seems capable of accounting for the prodigious accumulation among individuals which must have taken place in this country during the last twenty years and which has left us with a greatly increased capital notwithstanding our vast annual destruction of stock for so long a period  among the temporary causes of high price which may sometimes mislead the landlord it is necessary to notice irregularities in the currency when they are likely to be of short duration they must be treated by the landlord in the same manner as years of unusual demand but when they continue so long as they have done in this country it is impossible for the landlord to do otherwise than proportion his rent accordingly and take the chance of being obliged to lessen it again on the return of the currency to its natural state  the present fall in the price of bullion and the improved state of our exchanges proves in my opinion that a much greater part of the difference between gold and paper was owing to commercial causes and a peculiar demand for bullion than was supposed by many persons but they by no means prove that the issue of paper did not allow of a higher rise of prices than could be permanently maintained already a retrograde movement not exclusively occasioned by the importations of corn has been sensibly felt and it must go somewhat further before we can return to payments in specie those who let their lands during the period of the greatest difference between notes and bullion must probably lower them whichever system may be adopted with regard to the trade in corn these retrograde movements are always unfortunate and high rents partly occasioned by causes of this kind greatly embarrass the regular march of prices and confound the calculations both of the farmer and landlord  with the cautions here noticed in letting farms the landlord may fairly look forward to a gradual and permanent increase of rents and in general not only to an increase proportioned to the rise in the price of produce but to a still further increase arising from an increase in the quantity of produce  if in taking rents which are equally fair for the landlord and tenant it is found that in successive lettings they do not rise rather more than in proportion to the price of produce it will generally be owing to heavy taxation  though it is by no means true as stated by the economists that all taxes fall on the net rents of the landlords yet it is certainly true that they are more frequently taxed both indirectly as well as directly and have less power of relieving themselves than any other order of the state and as they pay as they certainly do many of the taxes which fall on the capital of the farmer and the wages of the labourer as well as those directly imposed on themselves they must necessarily feel it in the diminution of that portion of the whole produce which under other circumstances would have fallen to their share but the degree in which the different classes of society are affected by taxes is in itself a copious subject belonging to the general principles of taxation and deserves a separate inquiry       footnotes  footnote 1 i cannot however agree with him in thinking that all land which yields food must necessarily yield rent the land which is successively taken into cultivation in improving countries may only pay profits and labour a fair profit on the stock employed including of course the payment of labour will always be a sufficient inducement to cultivate  footnote 2 vol ii p 124 of this work a new and much improved edition has lately been published which is highly worthy the attention of all those who take an interest in these subjects  footnote 3 vol i p 49  footnote 4 vol iv p 134  footnote 5 vol iii p 272  footnote 6 it is however certain that if either these materials be wanting or the skill and capital necessary to work them up be prevented from forming owing to the insecurity of property to any other cause the cultivators will soon slacken in their exertions and the motives to accumulate and to increase their produce will greatly diminish but in this case there will be a very slack demand for labour and whatever may be the nominal cheapness of provisions the labourer will not really be able to command such a portion of the necessaries of life including of course clothing lodging etc as will occasion an increase of population  footnote 7 i have supposed some check to the supply of the cotton machinery in this case if there was no check whatever the effects wold show themselves in excessive profits and excessive wages without an excess above the cost of production  footnote 8 vol iv p 35  footnote 9 the more general surplus here alluded to is meant to include the profits of the farmer as well as the rents of the landlord and therefore includes the whole fund for the support of those who are not directly employed upon the land profits are in reality a surplus as they are in no respect proportioned as intimated by the economists to the wants and necessities of the owners of capital but they take a different course in the progress of society from rents and it is necessary in general to keep them quite separate  footnote 10 according to the calculations of mr colquhoun the value of our trade foreign and domestic and of our manufactures exclusive of raw materials is nearly equal to the gross value derived from the land in no other large country probably is this the case p colquhoun treatise on the wealth power and resources of the british empire 2nd ed 1815 p 96 the whole annual produce is estimated at about 430 millions and the products of agriculture at about 216 millions  footnote 11 to the honour of scotch cultivators it should be observed that they have applied their capitals so very skilfully and economically that at the same time that they have prodigiously increased the produce they have increase the landlords proportion ot it the difference between the landlords share of the produce in scotland and in england is quite extraordinarymuch greater than can be accounted for either by the natural soil or the absence of tithes and poors rates see sir john sinclairs valuable an account of husbandry in scotland edinburgh not long since publishedworks replete with the most useful and interesting information on agricultural subjects  footnote 12 see evidence before the house of lords given in by arthur young p 66  footnote 13 in all our discussions we should endeavour as well as we can to separate that part of high price which arises from excess of currency from that part which is natural and arises from permanent causes in the whole course of this argument it is particularly necessary to do this  footnote 14 it will be observed that i have said in a progressive country that is in a country which requires yearly the employment of a greater capital on the land to support an increasing population if there were no question about fresh capital or an increase of people and all the land were good it would not then be true that corn must be sold at its necessary price the actual price might be diminished and if the rents of land were diminished in proportion the cultivation might go on as before and the same quantity be produced it very rarely happens however that all the lands of a country actually occupied are good and yield a good net rent and in all cases a fall of prices must destroy agricultural capital during the currency of leases and on their renewal there would not be the same power of production  footnote 15 this conclusion may appear to contradict the doctrine of the level of the precious metals and so it does if by level be meant level of value estimated in the usual way i consider the doctrine indeed as quite unsupported by facts and the comparison of the precious metals to water perfectly inaccurate the precious metals are always tending to a state of rest or such a state of things as to make their movement unnecessary but when this state of rest has been nearly attained and the exchanges of all countries are nearly at par the value of the precious metals in different countries estimated in corn and labour or the mass of commodities is very far indeed from being the same to be convinced of this it is only necessary to look at england france poland russia and india when the exchanges are at par that adam smith who proposes labour as the true measure of value at all times and in all places could look around him and yet say that the precious metals were always the highest in value in the richest countries has always appeared to me most unlike his usual attention to found his theories on facts  footnote 16 even upon the system of importation in the actual state and situation of the countries of europe higher prices must accompany superior and increasing wealth  footnote 17 we must not be so far deceived by the evidence before parliament relating to the want of connection between the prices of corn and of labour as to suppose that they are really independent of each other the price of the necessaries of life is in fact the cost of producing labour the supply cannot proceed if it be not paid and though there will always be a little latitude owing to some variations of industry and habits and the distance of time between the encouragement to population and the period of the results appearing in the markets yet it is a still greater error to suppose the price of labour unconnected with the price of corn than to suppose that the price of corn immediately and completely regulates it corn and labour rarely march quite abreast but there is an obvious limit beyond which they cannot be separated with regard to the unusual exertions made by the labouring classes in periods of dearness which produce the fall of wages noticed in the evidence they are most meritorious in the individuals and certainly favour the growth of capital but no man of humanity could wish to see them constant and unremitted they are most admirable as a temporary relief but if they were constantly in action effects of a similar kind would result from them as from the population of a country being pushed to the very extreme limits of its food there would be no resources in a scarcity i own i do not see with pleasure the great extension of the practice of task work to work really hard during twelve or fourteen hours in the day for any length of time is too much for a human being some intervals of ease are necessary to health and happiness and the occasional abuse of such intervals is no valid argument against their use  footnote 18 i have hinted before in a note that profits may without impropriety be called a surplus but whether surplus or not they are the most important source of wealth as they are beyond all question the main source of accumulation  footnote 19 adam smith notices the bad effects of high profits on the habits of the capitalist they may perhaps sometimes occasion extravagance but generally i should say that extravagant habits were a more frequent cause of a scarcity of capital and high profits than high profits of extravagant habits
