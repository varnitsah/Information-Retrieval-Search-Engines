12702806	my garden acquaintance   by james russell lowell    one of the most delightful books in my fathers library was whites natural history of selborne for me it has rather gained in charm with years i used to read it without knowing the secret of the pleasure i found in it but as i grow older i begin to detect some of the simple expedients of this natural magic open the book where you will it takes you out of doors in our broiling july weather one can walk out with this genially garrulous fellow of oriel and find refreshment instead of fatigue you have no trouble in keeping abreast of him as he ambles along on his hobbyhorse now pointing to a pretty view now stopping to watch the motions of a bird or an insect or to bag a specimen for the honorable daines barrington or mr pennant in simplicity of taste and natural refinement he reminds one of walton in tenderness toward what he would have called the brute creation of cowper i do not know whether his descriptions of scenery are good or not but they have made me familiar with his neighborhood since i first read him i have walked over some of his favorite haunts but i still see them through his eyes rather than by any recollection of actual and personal vision the book has also the delightfulness of absolute leisure mr white seems never to have had any harder work to do than to study the habits of his feathered fellowtownsfolk or to watch the ripening of his peaches on the wall his volumes are the journal of adam in paradise     annihilating all thats made     to a green thought in a green shade  it is positive rest only to look into that garden of his it is vastly better than to               see great diocletian walk    in the salonian gardens noble shade  for thither ambassadors intrude to bring with them the noises of rome while here the world has no entrance no rumor of the revolt of the american colonies seems to have reached him the natural term of an hogs life has more interest for him than that of an empire burgoyne may surrender and welcome of what consequence is that compared with the fact that we can explain the odd tumbling of rooks in the air by their turning over to scratch themselves with one claw all the couriers in europe spurring roweldeep make no stir in mr whites little chartreuse1 but the arrival of the housemartin a day earlier or later than last year is a piece of news worth sending express to all his correspondents  1 la grande chartreuse was the original carthusian monastery in france where the most austere privacy was maintained  another secret charm of this book is its inadvertent humor so much the more delicious because unsuspected by the author how pleasant is his innocent vanity in adding to the list of the british and still more of the selbornian fauna i believe he would gladly have consented to be eaten by a tiger or a crocodile if by that means the occasional presence within the parish limits of either of these anthropophagous brutes could have been established he brags of no fine society but is plainly a little elated by having considerable acquaintance with a tame brown owl most of us have known our share of owls but few can boast of intimacy with a feathered one the great events of mr whites life too have that disproportionate importance which is always humorous to think of his hands having actually been though worthy as neither willoughbys nor rays were to hold a stilted plover the charadrius himaniopus with no back toe and therefore liable in speculation to perpetual vacillations i wonder by the way if metaphysicians have no hind toes in 1770 he makes the acquaintance in sussex of an old family tortoise which had then been domesticated for thirty years it is clear that he fell in love with it at first sight we have no means of tracing the growth of his passion but in 1780 we find him eloping with its object in a postchaise the rattle and hurry of the journey so perfectly roused it that when i turned it out in a border it walked twice down to the bottom of my garden it reads like a court journal yesterday morning hrh the princess alice took an airing of half an hour on the terrace of windsor castle this tortoise might have been a member of the royal society if he could have condescended to so ignoble an ambition it had but just been discovered that a surface inclined at a certain angle with the plane of the horizon took more of the suns rays the tortoise had always known this though he unostentatiously made no parade of it and used accordingly to tilt himself up against the gardenwall in the autumn he seems to have been more of a philosopher than even mr white himself caring for nothing but to get under a cabbageleaf when it rained or the sun was too hot and to bury himself alive before frosta fourfooted diogenes who carried his tub on his back  there are moods in which this kind of history is infinitely refreshing these creatures whom we affect to look down upon as the drudges of instinct are members of a commonwealth whose constitution rests on immovable bases never any need of reconstruction there they never dream of settling it by vote that eight hours are equal to ten or that one creature is as clever as another and no more they do not use their poor wits in regulating gods clocks nor think they cannot go astray so long as they carry their guideboard about with thema delusion we often practise upon ourselves with our high and mighty reason that admirable fingerpost which points every way and always right it is good for us now and then to converse with a world like mr whites where man is the least important of animals but one who like me has always lived in the country and always on the same spot is drawn to his book by other occult sympathies do we not share his indignation at that stupid martin who had graduated his thermometer no lower than 4o above zero of fahrenheit so that in the coldest weather ever known the mercury basely absconded into the bulb and left us to see the victory slip through our fingers just as they were closing upon it no man i suspect ever lived long in the country without being bitten by these meteorological ambitions he likes to be hotter and colder to have been more deeply snowed up to have more trees and larger blow down than his neighbors with us descendants of the puritans especially these weathercompetitions supply the abnegated excitement of the racecourse men learn to value thermometers of the true imaginative temperament capable of prodigious elations and corresponding dejections the other day 5th july i marked 98o in the shade my high water mark higher by one degree than i had ever seen it before i happened to meet a neighbor as we mopped our brows at each other he told me that he had just cleared 100o and i went home a beaten man i had not felt the heat before save as a beautiful exaggeration of sunshine but now it oppressed me with the prosaic vulgarity of an oven what had been poetic intensity became all at once rhetorical hyperbole i might suspect his thermometer as indeed i did for we harvard men are apt to think ill of any graduation but our own but it was a poor consolation the fact remained that his herald mercury standing a tiptoe could look down on mine i seem to glimpse something of this familiar weakness in mr white he too has shared in these mercurial triumphs and defeats nor do i doubt that he had a true countrygentlemans interest in the weathercock that his first question on coming down of a morning was like barabass     into what quarter peers my halcyons bill  it is an innocent and healthful employment of the mind distracting one from too continual study of himself and leading him to dwell rather upon the indigestions of the elements than his own did the wind back round or go about with the sun is a rational question that bears not remotely on the making of hay and the prosperity of crops i have little doubt that the regulated observation of the vane in many different places and the interchange of results by telegraph would put the weather as it were in our power by betraying its ambushes before it is ready to give the assault at first sight nothing seems more drolly trivial than the lives of those whose single achievement is to record the wind and the temperature three times a day yet such men are doubtless sent into the world for this special end and perhaps there is no kind of accurate observation whatever its object that has not its final use and value for some one or other it is even to be hoped that the speculations of our newspaper editors and their myriad correspondence upon the signs of the political atmosphere may also fill their appointed place in a wellregulated universe if it be only that of supplying so many more jackolanterns to the future historian nay the observations on finance of an mc whose sole knowledge of the subject has been derived from a lifelong success in getting a living out of the public without paying any equivalent therefor will perhaps be of interest hereafter to some explorer of our cloaca maxima whenever it is cleansed  for many years i have been in the habit of noting down some of the leading events of my embowered solitude such as the coming of certain birds and the likea kind of memoires pour servir after the fashion of white rather than properly digested natural history i thought it not impossible that a few simple stories of my winged acquaintances might be found entertaining by persons of kindred taste  there is a common notion that animals are better meteorologists than men and i have little doubt that in immediate weatherwisdom they have the advantage of our sophisticated senses though i suspect a sailor or shepherd would be their match but i have seen nothing that leads me to believe their minds capable of erecting the horoscope of a whole season and letting us know beforehand whether the winter will be severe or the summer rainless i more than suspect that the clerk of the weather himself does not always know very long in advance whether he is to draw an order for hot or cold dry or moist and the musquash is scarce likely to be wiser i have noted but two days difference in the coming of the songsparrow between a very early and a very backward spring this very year i saw the linnets at work thatching just before a snowstorm which covered the ground several inches deep for a number of days they struck work and left us for a while no doubt in search of food birds frequently perish from sudden changes in our whimsical spring weather of which they had no foreboding more than thirty years ago a cherrytree then in full bloom near my window was covered with hummingbirds benumbed by a fall of mingled rain and snow which probably killed many of them it should seem that their coming was dated by the height of the sun which betrays them into unthrifty matrimony     so priketh hem nature in hir corages1  but their going is another matter the chimney swallows leave us early for example apparently so soon as their latest fledglings are firm enough of wing to attempt the long rowingmatch that is before them on the other hand the wildgeese probably do not leave the north till they are frozen out for i have heard their bugles sounding southward so late as the middle of december what may be called local migrations are doubtless dictated by the chances of food i have once been visited by large flights of crossbills and whenever the snow lies long and deep on the ground a flock of cedarbirds comes in midwinter to eat the berries on my hawthorns i have never been quite able to fathom the local or rather geographical partialities of birds never before this summer 1870 have the kingbirds handsomest of flycatchers built in my orchard though i always know where to find them within half a mile the rosebreasted grosbeak has been a familiar bird in brookline three miles away yet i never saw one here till last july when i found a female busy among my raspberries and surprisingly bold i hope she was prospecting with a view to settlement in our garden she seemed on the whole to think well of my fruit and i would gladly plant another bed if it would help to win over so delightful a neighbor  1 chaucers canterbury tales prologue line 11  the return of the robin is commonly announced by the newspapers like that of eminent or notorious people to a wateringplace as the first authentic notification of spring and such his appearance in the orchard and garden undoubtedly is but in spite of his name of migratory thrush he stays with us all winter and i have seen him when the thermometer marked 15 degrees below zero of fahrenheit armed impregnably within1 like emersons titmouse and as cheerful as he the robin has a bad reputation among people who do not value themselves less for being fond of cherries there is i admit a spice of vulgarity in him and his song is rather of the bloomfield sort too largely ballasted with prose his ethics are of the poor richard school and the main chance which calls forth all his energy is altogether of the belly he never has these fine intervals of lunacy into which his cousins the catbird and the mavis are apt to fall but for a that and twice as muckle s a that i would not exchange him for all the cherries that ever came out of asia minor with whatever faults he has not wholly forfeited that superiority which belongs to the children of nature he has a finer taste in fruit than could be distilled from many successive committees of the horticultural society and he eats with a relishing gulp not inferior to dr johnsons he feels and freely exercises his right of eminent domain his is the earliest mess of green peas his all the mulberries i had fancied mine but if he get also the lions share of the raspberries he is a great planter and sows those wild ones in the woods that solace the pedestrian and give a momentary calm even to the jaded victims of the white hills he keeps a strict eye over ones fruit and knows to a shade of purple when your grapes have cooked long enough in the sun during the severe drought a few years ago the robins wholly vanished from my garden i neither saw nor heard one for three weeks meanwhile a small foreign grapevine rather shy of bearing seemed to find the dusty air congenial and dreaming perhaps of its sweet argos across the sea decked itself with a score or so of fair bunches i watched them from day to day till they should have secreted sugar enough from the sunbeams and at last made up my mind that i would celebrate my vintage the next morning but the robins too had somehow kept note of them they must have sent out spies as did the jews into the promised land before i was stirring when i went with my basket at least a dozen of these winged vintagers bustled out from among the leaves and alighting on the nearest trees interchanged some shrill remarks about me of a derogatory nature they had fairly sacked the vine not wellingtons veterans made cleaner work of a spanish town not federals or confederates were ever more impartial in the confiscation of neutral chickens i was keeping my grapes a secret to surprise the fair fidele with but the robins made them a profounder secret to her than i had meant the tattered remnant of a single bunch was all my harvesthome how paltry it looked at the bottom of my basketas if a hummingbird had laid her egg in an eagles nest i could not help laughing and the robins seemed to join heartily in the merriment there was a native grapevine close by blue with its less refined abundance but my cunning thieves preferred the foreign flavor could i tax them with want of taste  1 for well the soul if stout within     can arm impregnably the skin                     the titmouse lines 75 76  the robins are not good solo singers but their chorus as like primitive fireworshippers they hail the return of light and warmth to the world is unrivalled there are a hundred singing like one they are noisy enough then and sing as poets should with no afterthought but when they come after cherries to the tree near my window they muffle their voices and their faint pip pip pop sounds far away at the bottom of the garden where they know i shall not suspect them of robbing the great blackwalnut of its bitterrinded store1 they are feathered pecksniffs to be sure but then how brightly their breasts that look rather shabby in the sunlight shine in a rainy day against the dark green of the fringetree after they have pinched and shaken all the life of an earthworm as italian cooks pound all the spirit out of a steak and then gulped him they stand up in honest selfconfidence expand their red waistcoats with the virtuous air of a lobby member and outface you with an eye that calmly challenges inquiry do i look like a bird that knows the flavor of raw vermin i throw myself upon a jury of my peers ask any robin if he ever ate anything less ascetic than the frugal berry of the juniper and he will answer that his vow forbids him can such an open bosom cover such depravity alas yes i have no doubt his breast was redder at that very moment with the blood of my raspberries on the whole he is a doubtful friend in the garden he makes his dessert of all kinds of berries and is not averse from early pears but when we remember how omnivorous he is eating his own weight in an incredibly short time and that nature seems exhaustless in her invention of new insects hostile to vegetation perhaps we may reckon that he does more good than harm for my own part i would rather have his cheerfulness and kind neighborhood than many berries  1 the screechowl whose cry despite his ill name is one o the sweetest sounds in nature softens his voice in the same way with the most beguiling mockery of distance jrl  for his cousin the catbird i have a still warmer regard  always a good singer he sometimes nearly equals the brown thrush and has the merit of keeping up his music later in the evening than any bird of my familiar acquaintance ever since i can remember a pair of them have built in a gigantic syringa near our front door and i have known the male to sing almost uninterruptedly during the evenings of early summer till twilight duskened into dark they differ greatly in vocal talent but all have a delightful way of crooning over and as it were rehearsing their song in an undertone which makes their nearness always unobtrusive though there is the most trustworthy witness to the imitative propensity of this bird i have only once during an intimacy of more than forty years heard him indulge it in that case the imitation was by no means so close as to deceive but a free reproduction of the notes of some other birds especially of the oriole as a kind of variation in his own song the catbird is as shy as the robin is vulgarly familiar only when his nest or his fledglings are approached does he become noisy and almost aggressive i have known him to station his young in a thick cornelbush on the edge of the raspberrybed after the fruit began to ripen and feed them there for a week or more in such cases he shows none of that conscious guilt which makes the robin contemptible on the contrary he will maintain his post in the thicket and sharply scold the intruder who ventures to steal his berries after all his claim is only for tithes while the robin will bag your entire crop if he get a chance  dr wattss statement that birds in their little nests agree like too many others intended to form the infant mind is very far from being true on the contrary the most peaceful relation of the different species to each other is that of armed neutrality they are very jealous of neighbors a few years ago i was much interested in the housebuilding of a pair of summer yellowbirds they had chosen a very pretty site near the top of a tall white lilac within easy eyeshot of a chamber window a very pleasant thing it was to see their little home growing with mutual help to watch their industrious skill interrupted only by little flirts and snatches of endearment frugally cut short by the commonsense of the tiny housewife they had brought their work nearly to an end and had already begun to line it with ferndown the gathering of which demanded more distant journeys and longer absences but alas the syringa immemorial manor of the catbirds was not more than twenty feet away and these giddy neighbors had as it appeared been all along jealously watchful though silent witnesses of what they deemed an intrusion of squatters no sooner were the pretty mates fairly gone for a new load of lining than     to their unguarded nest these weasel scots      came stealing1  silently they flew back and forth each giving a vengeful dab at the nest in passing they did not fallto and deliberately destroy it for they might have been caught at their mischief as it was whenever the yellowbirds came back their enemies were hidden in their own sightproof bush several times their unconscious victims repaired damages but at length after counsel taken together they gave it up perhaps like other unlettered folk they came to the conclusion that the devil was in it and yielded to the invisible persecution of witchcraft  1 shakespeare king henry v act i scene 2  the robins by constant attacks and annoyances have succeeded in driving off the bluejays who used to build in our pines their gay colors and quaint noisy ways making them welcome and amusing neighbors i once had the chance of doing a kindness to a household of them which they received with very friendly condescension i had had my eye for some time upon a nest and was puzzled by a constant fluttering of what seemed fullgrown wings in it whenever i drew nigh at last i climbed the tree in spite of angry protests from the old birds against my intrusion the mystery had a very simple solution in building the nest a long piece of packthread had been somewhat loosely woven in three of the young had contrived to entangle themselves in it and had become fullgrown without being able to launch themselves upon the air one was unharmed another had so tightly twisted the cord about its shank that one foot was curled up and seemed paralyzed the third in its struggles to escape had sawn through the flesh of the thigh and so much harmed itself that i thought it humane to put an end to its misery when i took out my knife to cut their hempen bonds the heads of the family seemed to divine my friendly intent suddenly ceasing their cries and threats they perched quietly within reach of my hand and watched me in my work of manumission this owing to the fluttering terror of the prisoners was an affair of some delicacy but ere long i was rewarded by seeing one of them fly away to a neighboring tree while the cripple making a parachute of his wings came lightly to the ground and hopped off as well as he could with one leg obsequiously waited on by his elders a week later i had the satisfaction of meeting him in the pinewalk in good spirits and already so far recovered as to be able to balance himself with the lame foot i have no doubt that in his old age he accounted for his lameness by some handsome story of a wound received at the famous battle of the pines when our tribe overcome by numbers was driven from its ancient campingground of late years the jays have visited us only at intervals and in winter their bright plumage set off by the snow and their cheerful cry are especially welcome they would have furnished aesop with a fable for the feathered crest in which they seem to take so much satisfaction is often their fatal snare country boys make a hole with their finger in the snowcrust just large enough to admit the jays head and hollowing it out somewhat beneath bait it with a few kernels of corn the crest slips easily into the trap but refuses to be pulled out again and he who came to feast remains a prey  twice have the crowblackbirds attempted a settlement in my pines and twice have the robins who claim a right of preemption so successfully played the part of borderruffians as to drive them awayto my great regret for they are the best substitute we have for rooks at shady hill1 now alas empty of its so longloved household they build by hundreds and nothing can be more cheery than their creaking clatter like a convention of oldfashioned tavernsigns as they gather at evening to debate in mass meeting their windy politics or to gossip at their tentdoors over the events of the day their port is grave and their stalk across the turf as martial as that of a secondrate ghost in hamlet they never meddled with my corn so far as i could discover  1 the home of the nortons in cambridge who were at the time of this paper in europe  for a few years i had crows but their nests are an irresistible bait for boys and their settlement was broken up they grew so wonted as to throw off a great part of their shyness and to tolerate my near approach one very hot day i stood for some time within twenty feet of a mother and three children who sat on an elm bough over my head gasping in the sultry air and holding their wings halfspread for coolness all birds during the pairing season become more or less sentimental and murmur soft nothings in a tone very unlike the grindingorgan repetition and loudness of their habitual song the crow is very comical as a lover and to hear him trying to soften his croak to the proper saint preux1 standard has something the effect of a mississippi boatman quoting tennyson yet there are few things to my ear more melodious than his caw of a clear winter morning as it drops to you filtered through five hundred fathoms of crisp blue air the hostility of all smaller birds makes the moral character of the row for all his deaconlike demeanor and garb somewhat questionable he could never sally forth without insult the golden robins especially would chase him as far as i could follow with my eye making him duck clumsily to avoid their importunate bills i do not believe however that he robbed any nests hereabouts for the refuse of the gasworks which in our freeandeasy community is allowed to poison the river supplied him with dead alewives in abundance i used to watch him making his periodical visits to the saltmarshes and coming back with a fish in his beak to his young savages who no doubt like it in that condition which makes it savory to the kanakas and other corvine races of men  1 see rousseaus la nouvelle heloise  orioles are in great plenty with me  i have seen seven males flashing about the garden at once a merry crew of them swing their hammocks from the pendulous boughs during one of these later years when the cankerworms stripped our elms as bare as winter these birds went to the trouble of rebuilding their unroofed nests and chose for the purpose trees which are safe from those swarming vandals such as the ash and the buttonwood one year a pair disturbed i suppose elsewhere built a second next in an elm within a few yards of the house my friend edward e hale told me once that the oriole rejected from his web all strands of brilliant color and i thought it a striking example of that instinct of concealment noticeable in many birds though it should seem in this instance that the nest was amply protected by its position from all marauders but owls and squirrels last year however i had the fullest proof that mr hale was mistaken a pair of orioles built on the lowest trailer of a weeping elm which hung within ten feet of our drawingroom window and so low that i could reach it from the ground the nest was wholly woven and felted with ravellings of woollen carpet in which scarlet predominated would the same thing have happened in the woods or did the nearness of a human dwelling perhaps give the birds a greater feeling of security they are very bold by the way in quest of cordage and i have often watched them stripping the fibrous bark from a honeysuckle growing over the very door but indeed all my birds look upon me as if i were a mere tenant at will and they were landlords with shame i confess it i have been bullied even by a hummingbird this spring as i was cleansing a peartree of its lichens one of these little zigzagging blurs came purring toward me couching his long bill like a lance his throat sparkling with angry fire to warn me off from a missouricurrant whose honey he was sipping and many a time he has driven me out of a flowerbed this summer by the way a pair of these winged emeralds fastened their mossy acorncup upon a bough of the same elm which the orioles had enlivened the year before we watched all their proceedings from the window through an operaglass and saw their two nestlings grow from black needles with a tuft of down at the lower end till they whirled away on their first short experimental flights they became strong of wing in a surprisingly short time and i never saw them or the male bird after though the female was regular as usual in her visits to our petunias and verbenas i do not think it ground enough for a generalization but in the many times when i watched the old birds feeding their young the mother always alighted while the father as uniformly remained upon the wing  the bobolinks are generally chance visitors tinkling through the garden in blossomingtime but this year owing to the long rains early in the season their favorite meadows were flooded and they were driven to the upland so i had a pair of them domiciled in my grass field the male used to perch in an appletree then in full bloom and while i stood perfectly still close by he would circle away quivering round the entire field of five acres with no break in his song and settle down again among the blooms to be hurried away almost immediately by a new rapture of music he had the volubility of an italian charlatan at a fair and like him appeared to be proclaiming the merits of some quack remedy opodeldocopodeldoctrydoctorlincolnsopodeldoc he seemed to repeat over and over again with a rapidity that would have distanced the deftesttongued figaro that ever rattled i remember count gurowski saying once with that easy superiority of knowledge about this country which is the monopoly of foreigners that we had no singingbirds well well mr hepworth dixon1 has found the typical america in oneida and salt lake city of course an intelligent european is the best judge of these matters the truth is there are more singingbirds in europe because there are fewer forests these songsters love the neighborhood of man because hawks and owls are rarer while their own food is more abundant most people seem to think the more trees the more birds even chateaubriand who first tried the primitiveforestcure and whose description of the wilderness in its imaginative effects is unmatched fancies the people of the air singing their hymns to him so far as my own observation goes the farther one penetrates the sombre solitudes of the woods the more seldom does he hear the voice of any singingbird in spite of chateaubriands minuteness of detail in spite of that marvellous reverberation of the decrepit tree falling of its own weight which he was the first to notice i cannot help doubting whether he made his way very deep into the wilderness at any rate in a letter to fontanes written in 1804 he speaks of mes chevaux paissant a quelque distance to be sure chateaubriand was at to mount the high horse and this may have been but an afterthought of the grand seigneur but certainly one would not make much headway on horseback toward the druid fastnesses of the primaeval pine  1 in his book of travels new america  the bobolinks build in considerable numbers in a meadow within a quarter of a mile of us a houseless land passes through the midst of their camp and in clear westerly weather at the right season one may hear a score of them singing at once when they are breeding if i chance to pass one of the male birds always accompanies me like a constable flitting from post to post of the railfence with a short note of reproof continually repeated till i am fairly out of the neighborhood then he will swing away into the air and run down the wind gurgling music without stint over the unheeding tussocks of meadowgrass and dark clumps of bulrushes that mark his domain  we have no bird whose song will match the nightingales in compass none whose note is so rich as that of the european blackbird but for mere rapture i have never heard the bobolinks rival but his operaseason is a short one the ground and tree sparrows are our most constant performers it is now late in august and one of the latter sings every day and all day long in the garden till within a fortnight a pair of indigobirds would keep up their lively duo for an hour together while i write i hear an oriole gay as in june and the plaintive maybe of the goldfinch tells me he is stealing my lettuceseeds i know not what the experience of others may have been but the only bird i have ever hard sing in the night has been the chipbird i should say he sang about as often during the darkness as cocks crow one can hardly help fancying that he sings in his dreams     father of light what sunnie seed     what glance of day hast thou confined      into this bird  to all the breed      this busie ray thou hast assigned      their magnetism works all night      and dreams of paradise and light  on second thought i remember to have heard the cuckoo strike the hours nearly all night with the regularity of a swiss clock  the dead limbs of our elms which i spare to that end bring us the flicker every summer and almost daily i hear his wild scream and laugh close at hand himself invisible he is a shy bird but a few days ago i had the satisfaction of studying him through the blinds as he sat on a tree within a few feet of me seen so near and at rest he makes good his claim to the title of pigeonwoodpecker lumberers have a notion that he is harmful to timber digging little holes through the bark to encourage the settlement of insects the regular rings of such perforations which one may see in almost any appleorchard seem to give some probability to this theory almost every season a solitary quail visits us and unseen among the currant bushes alls bob white bob white as if he were playing at hideandseek with that imaginary being a rarer visitant is the turtledove whose pleasant coo something like the muffled crow of a cock from a coop covered with snow i have sometimes heard and whom i once had the good luck to see close by me in the mulberrytree the wildpigeon once numerous i have not seen for many years1 of savage birds a henhawk now and then quarters himself upon us for a few days sitting sluggish in a tree after a surfeit of poultry one of them once offered me a near shot from my studywindow one drizzly day for several hours but it was sunday and i gave him the benefit of its gracious truce of god  1 they made their appearance again this summer 1870jrl  certain birds have disappeared from our neighborhood within my memory i remember when the whippoorwill could be heard in sweet auburn the nighthawk once common is now rare the brown thrush has moved farther up country for years i have not seen or heard any of the larger owls whose hooting was once of my boyish terrors the cliffswallow strange emigrant that eastward takes his way has come and gone again in my time the bankswallows wellnigh innumerable during my boyhood no longer frequent the crumbly cliff of the gravelpit by the river the barnswallows which once swarmed in our barn flashing through the dusty sunstreak of the mow have been gone these many years my father would lead me out to see them gather on the roof and take counsel before their yearly migration as mr white used to see them at selborne eheu fugaces thank fortune the swift still glues his nest and rolls his distant thunders night and day in the widethroated chimneys still sprinkles the evening air with his merry twittering the populous heronry in fresh pond meadows has wellnigh broken up but still a pair or two haunt the old home as the gypsies of ellangowan their ruined huts and every evening fly over us riverwards clearing their throats with a hoarse hawk as they go and in cloudy weather scarce higher than the tops of the chimneys sometimes i have known one to alight in one of our trees though for what purpose i never could divine kingfishers have sometimes puzzled me in the same way perched at high noon in a pine springing their watchmans rattle when they flitted away from my curiosity and seeming to shove their topheavy heads along as a man does a wheelbarrow  some birds have left us i suppose because the country is growing less wild i once found a summer ducks nest within a quarter of a mile of our house but such a trouvaille would be impossible now as kidds treasure and yet the mere taming of the neighborhood does not quite satisfy me as an explanation twenty years ago on my way to bathe in the river i saw every day a brace of woodcock on the miry edge of a spring within a few rods of a house and constantly visited by thirsty cows there was no growth of any kind to conceal them and yet these ordinarily shy birds were almost as indifferent to my passing as common poultry would have been since birdnesting has become scientific and dignified itself as oology that no doubt is partly to blame for some of our losses but some old friends are constant wilsons thrush comes every year to remind me of that most poetic or ornithologists he flits before me through the pinewalk like the very genius of solitude a pair of pewees have built immemorially on a jutting brick in the arched entrance to the icehouse always on the same brick and never more than a single pair though two broods of five each are raised there every summer how do they settle their claim to the homestead by what right of primogeniture once the children of a man employed about the place oologized the nest and the pewees left us for a year or two i felt towards those boys as the messmates of the ancient mariner1 did towards him after he had shot the albatross but the pewees came back at last and one of them is now on his wonted perch so near my window that i can hear the click of his bill as he snaps a fly on the wing with the unerring precision a stately trasteverina shows in the capture of her smaller deer the pewee is the first bird to pipe up in the morning and during the early summer he preludes his matutinal ejaculation of pewee with a slender whistle unheard at any other time he saddens with the season and as summer declines he changes his note to cheu pewee as if in lamentation had he been an italian bird ovid would have had a plaintive tale to tell about him he is so familiar as often to pursue a fly through the open window into my library  1 in coleridges poem of that name  there is something inexpressibly dear to me in these old friendships of a lifetime there is scarce a tree of mine but has had at some time or other a happy homestead among its boughs and to which i cannot say          many light hearts and wings    which now be head lodged in thy living bowers  my walk under the pines would lose half its summer charm were i to miss that shy anchorite the wilsons thrush nor hear in hayingtime the metallic ring of his song that justifies his rustic name of scythewhet i protect my game as jealously as an english squire if anybody had oologized a certain cuckoos nest i know of i have a pair in my garden every year it would have left me a sore place in my mind for weeks i love to bring these aborigines back to the mansuetude they showed to the early voyagers and before forgive the involuntary pun they had grown accustomed to man and knew his savage ways and they repay your kindness with a sweet familiarity too delicate ever to breed contempt i have made a penntreaty with them preferring that to the puritan way with the natives which converted them to a little hebraism and a great deal of medford rum if they will not come near enough to me as most of them will i bring them close with an operaglassa much better weapon than a gun i would not if i could convert them from their pretty pagan ways the only one i sometimes have savage doubts about is the red squirrel i think he oologizes i know he eats cherries we counted five of them at one time in a single tree the stones pattering down like the sparse hail that preludes a storm and that he gnaws off the small end of pears to get at the seeds he steals the corn from under the noses of my poultry but what would you have he will come down upon the limb of the tree i am lying under till he is within a yard of me he and his mate will scurry up and down the great blackwalnut for my diversion chattering like monkeys can i sign his deathwarrant who has tolerated me about his grounds so long not i let them steal and welcome i am sure i should had i had the same bringing up and the same temptation as for the birds i do not believe there is one of them but does more good than harm and of how many featherless bipeds can this be said
