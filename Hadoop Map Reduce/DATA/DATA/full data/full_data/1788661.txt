road stretched in a pale straight streak narrowing to a mere thread at the limit of visionthe only living thing in the wild darkness all was very still it had been raining the wet heather and the pines gave forth scent and little gusty shivers shook the dripping birch trees in the pools of sky between broken clouds a few stars shone and half of a thin moon was seen from time to time like the fragment of a silver horn held up there in an invisible hand waiting to be blown  hard to say when i first became aware that there was movement on the road little specks of darkness on it far away till its end was blackened out of sight and it seemed to shorten towards me whatever was coming darkened it as an invading army of ants will darken a streak of sunlight on sand strewn with pine needles slowly this shadow crept along till it had covered all but the last dip and rise and still it crept forward in that eerie way as yet too far off for sound  then began the voice of it in the dripping stillness a tramping of weary feet and i could tell that this advancing shadow was formed of men millions of them moving all at one speed very slowly as if regulated by the march of the most tired among them they had blotted out the road now from a few yards away to the horizon and suddenly in the dusk a face showed  its eyes were eager its lips parted as if each step was the first the marcher had ever taken and yet he was stumbling almost asleep from tiredness a young man he was with skin drawn tight over his heavy cheekbones and jaw under the platter of his helmet and burdened with all his soldiers load at first i saw his face alone in the darkness startlingly clear and then a very sea of helmeted faces with their sunken eyes shining and their lips parted watching them passheavy and dim and spectrelike in the darkness those eager deadbeat meni knew as never before how they had longed for this last march and in fancy seen the road and dreamed of the day when they would be trudging home their hearts seemed laid bare to me the sickening hours they had waited dreaming and longing in boots rusty with blood and the night was full of the loneliness and waste they had been through                                       morning at the edge of the town the road came arrowstraight to the first houses and their gardens past them and away to the streets in every window and at each gate children women men were looking down the road face after face was painted various by the sunlight homely with line and wrinkle curve and dimple pallid or ruddy but the look in the eyes of all these faces seemed the same i have waited so long it said i cannot wait any morei cannot their hands were clasped and by the writhing of those hands i knew how they had yearned and the madness of delight waiting to leap from themwives mothers fathers children the patient hopers against hope  far out on the road something darkened the sunlight they were coming     the sacred work   the angel of peace watching the slow folding back of this darkness will look on an earth of cripples the field of the world is strewn with halfliving men that loveliness which is the creation of the æsthetic human spirit that flowering of directed energy which we know as civilisation that manifold and mutual service which we call progressall stand mutilated and faltering as though on a pilgrimage to the dreamedof mecca water had failed and by the wayside countless muffled forms sat waiting for rain so will the long road of mankind look tomorrow  in every township and village of our countries men stricken by the war will dwell for the next halfcentury the figure of youth must go onefooted onearmed blind of an eye lesioned and stunned in the home where it once danced the half of a generation can never again step into the sunlight of full health and the priceless freedom of unharmed limbs  so comes the sacred work  can there be limit to the effort of gratitude niggardliness and delay in restoring all of life that can be given back is sin against the human spirit a smear on the face of honour  love of country which like some little secret lamp glows in every heart hardly to be seen of our eyes when the world is at peacelove of the old close things the sights sounds scents we have known from birth loyalty to our fathers deeds and our fathers hopes the clutch of motherlandthis love sent our soldiers and sailors forth to the long endurance to the doing of such deeds and the bearing of so great and evil pain as can never be told the countries for which they have dared and suffered have now to play their part  the conscience of today is burdened with a load wellnigh unbearable each hour of the sacred work unloads a little of this burden  to lift up the man who has been stricken on the battlefield restore him to the utmost of health and agility give him an adequate pension and reequip him with an occupation suited to the forces left himthat is a process which does not cease till the sufferer fronts the future keen hopeful and secure and such restoration is at least as much a matter of spirit as of body consider what it means to fall suddenly out of full vigour into the dark certainty that you can never have full strength again though you live on twenty forty sixty years the flag of your courage may well be down halfmast apathythat creeping nerve diseaseis soon your bedfellow and the companion of your walks a curtain has fallen before your vision your eyes no longer range the russian nichevothe whatdoesitmatter moodbesets you fate seems to say to you take the line of least resistance friendyou are done for but the sacred work says to fate retro satanas this our comrade is not your puppet he shall yet live as happy and as usefulif not as activea life as he ever lived before you shall not crush him we shall tend him from clearing station till his discharge better than wounded soldier has ever yet been tended in special hospitals orthopædic paraplegic phthisic neurasthenic we shall give him back functional ability solidity of nerve or lung the flesh torn away the lost sight the broken eardrum the destroyed nerve it is true we cannot give back but we shall so recreate and fortify the rest of him that he shall leave hospital ready for a new career then we shall teach him how to tread the road of it so that he fits again into the national life becomes once more a workman with pride in his work a stake in the country and the consciousness that handicapped though he be he runs the race level with his fellows and is by that so much the better man than they and beneath the feet of this new workman we shall put the firm plank of a pension  the sacred work fights the creeping dejections which lie in wait for each soul and body for the moment stricken and thrown it says to fate you shall not pass  and the greatest obstacle with which it meets is the very stoicism and nonchalance of the sufferer to the anglosaxon especially those precious qualities are dangerous that horse taken to the water will too seldom drink indifference to the future has a certain loveability but is hardly a virtue when it makes of its owner a weary drone eking out a pension with odd jobs the sacred work is vitally concerned to defeat this handtomouth philosophy side by side in man and especially in anglosaxon there live two creatures one of them lies on his back and smokes the other runs a race now one now the other seems to be the whole man the sacred work has for its end to keep the runner on his feet to proclaim the nobility of running a man will do for mankind or for his country what he will not do for himself but mankind marches on and countries live and grow and need our services in peace no less than in war drums do not beat the flags hang furled in time of peace but a quiet music is ever raising its call to service he who in war has flung himself without thought of self on the bayonet and braved a hail of bullets often does not hear that quiet music it is the business of the sacred work to quicken his ear to it of little use to man or nation would be the mere patchingup of bodies so that like a row of old gossips against a sunlit wall our disabled might sit and weary out their days if that were all we could do for them gratitude is proven fraudulent device bankrupt and the future of our countries must drag with a lame foot  to one who has watched rather from outside it seems that restoration worthy of that word will only come if the minds of all engaged in the sacred work are always fixed on this central truth body and spirit are inextricably conjoined to heal the one without the other is impossible if a mans mind courage and interest be enlisted in the cause of his own salvation healing goes on apace the sufferer is remade if not no mere surgical wonders no careful nursing will avail to make a man of him again therefore i would say from the moment he enters hospital look after his mind and his will give them food nourish them in subtle ways increase that nourishment as his strength increases give him interest in his future light a star for him to fix his eyes on so that when he steps out of hospital you shall not have to begin to train one who for months perhaps years has been living mindless and willless the life of a halfdead creature  that this is a hard task none who knows hospital life can doubt  that it needs special qualities and special effort quite other than the average range of hospital devotion is obvious but it saves time in the end and without it success is more than doubtful the crucial period is the time spent in hospital use that period to recreate not only body but mind and willpower and all shall come out right neglect to use it thus and the heart of many a sufferer and of many a wouldbe healer will break from sheer discouragement  the sacred work is not departmental it is one long organic process from the moment when a man is picked up from the field of battle to the moment when he is restored to the ranks of full civil life our eyes must not be fixed merely on this stressful present but on the world as it will be ten years hence i see that world gazing back like a repentant drunkard at his own debauch with a sort of horrified amazement and disgust i see it impatient of any reminiscence of this hurricane hastening desperately to recover what it enjoyed before life was wrecked and pillaged by these blasts of death hearts which now swell with pity and gratitude when our maimed soldiers pass the streets will from sheer familiarity and through natural shrinking from reminder be dried to a stony indifference let the dead past bury its dead is a saying terribly true and perhaps essential to the preservation of mankind the world of ten years hence will shrug its shoulders if it sees maimed and useless men crawling the streets of its day like winter flies on a windowpane  it is for the sacred work to see that there shall be no winter flies a niche of usefulness and selfrespect exists for every man however handicapped but that niche must be found for him to carry the process of restoration to a point short of this is to leave the cathedral without spire  of the men and women who have this work in hand i have seen enoughin france and in my own country at leastto know their worth and the selfless idealism which animates them their devotion courage tenacity and technical ability are beyond question or praise i would only fear that in the hard struggle they experience to carry each days work to its end to perfect their own particular jobs all so important and so difficult vision of the whole fabric they are helping to raise must often be obscured and i would venture to say only by looking upon each separate disabled soldier as the complete fabric can you possibly keep that vision before your eyes only by revivifying in each separate disabled soldier the will to live can you save him from the fate of merely continuing to exist  there are wounded men many whose spirit is such that they will march in front of any effort made for their recovery i well remember one of thesea frenchmannearly paralysed in both legs all day long he would work at his macramé and each morning after treatment would demand to try and stand i can see his straining efforts now his eyes like the eyes of a spirit i can hear his daily words il me semble que jai un peu plus de force dans mes jambes ce matin monsieur though i fear he never had men of such indomitable initiative though not rare are but a fraction the great majority have rather the happygolucky soul for them it is only too easy to postpone selfhelp till sheer necessity drives or till some one in whom they believe inspires them the work of reequipping these with initiative with a new interest in life with work which they can do is one of infinite difficulty and complexity nevertheless it must be done  the great publics of our countries do not yet i think see that they too have their part in the sacred work so far they only seem to feel heres a wounded hero lets take him to the movies and give him tea instead of choking him with cheap kindness each member of the public should seek to reinspire the disabled man with the feeling that he is no more out of the main stream of life than they are themselves and each according to his or her private chances should help him to find that special niche which he can best most cheerfully and most usefully fill in the long future  the more we drown the disabled in tea and lip gratitude the more we unsteel his soul and the harder we make it for him to win through when in the years to come the wells of our tea and gratitude have dried up we can do a much more real and helpful thing i fear that there will soon be no one of us who has not some personal friend disabled let us regard that man as if he were ourselves let us treat him as one who demands a full place in the ranks of working life and try to find it for him  in such ways alone will come a new freemasonry to rebuild this ruined temple of our day the ground is rubbled with stonesfallen and still falling each must be replaced freshly shaped cemented and mortised in that the whole may once more stand firm and fair in good time to a clearer sky than we are fortunate enough to look on our temple shall rise again the birds shall not long build in its broken walls nor lichens moss it the winds shall not long play through these now jagged windows nor the rain drift in nor moonlight fill it with ghosts and shadows to the glory of man we will stanchion and raise and roof it anew  each comrade who for his motherland has for the moment lost his future is a miniature of that shattered temple  to restore him and with him the future of our countries that is the sacred work     the balance sheet of the soldierworkman   let the reader take what follows with more than a grain of salt no one can foretellsurely not this writerwith anything approaching certainty what will be the final effect of this war on the soldierworkman one can but marshal some of the more obvious and general liabilities and assets and try to strike a balance the whole thing is in flux millions are going into the crucible at every temperature and who shall say at all precisely what will come out or what conditions the product issuing will meet with though they obviously cannot be the same as before the war for in considering this question one must run into the account on either side not only the various effects of the war on the soldierworkman but the altered influences his life will encounter in the future so far as one can foresee and this is all navigation in uncharted waters  talking with and observing french soldiers during the winter of 19161917 and often putting to them this very question how is the war going to affect the soldierworkman i noticed that their answers followed very much the trend of class and politics an adjutant sergeant or devout catholic considered that men would be improved gain selfcommand and respect for law and order under prolonged discipline and daily sacrifice a freethinker of the educated class or a private of socialistic tendencies on the other hand would insist that the strain must make men restless irritable more eager for their rights less tolerant of control each imagined that the war would further the chances of the future as they dreamed of it if i had talked with capitaliststhere are none among french soldiersthey would doubtless have insisted that afterwar conditions were going to be easier just as the sanssous maintained that they were going to be harder and provocative of revolution in a word the wish was father to the thought  having observed this so strongly the writer of these speculations says to himself let me at all events try to eliminate any bias and see the whole thing as should an umpireone of those pure beings in white coats purged of all the prejudices passions and predilections of mankind let me have no temperament for the time being for i have to set downnot what would be the effect on me if i were in their place or what would happen to the future if i could have my way but what would happen all the same if i were not alive only from an impersonal point of view if there be such a thing am i going to get even approximately at the truth  impersonally then one notes the credit facts and probabilities towards the futures greater wellbeing and those on the debit side of retrogression from the state of wellbeing such as it was which prevailed when war was declared  first what will be the physical effect of the war on the soldierworkman military training openair life and plentiful food are of such obvious physical advantage in the vast majority of cases as to need no pointing out and how much improvement was wanted is patent to any one who has a remnant left of the old greek worship of the body it has made one almost despair of industrialised england to see the great australians pass in the streets of london we english cannot afford to neglect the body any longer we are becoming i am much afraid a warped stunted intensely plain people on that point i refuse to speak with diffidence for it is my business to know something about beauty and in our masters and pastors i see no sign of knowledge and little inkling of concern since there is no public opinion to drive them forward to respect beauty onehalf of us regard good looks as dangerous and savouring of immorality the other half look upon them as swank or at least superfluous any interest manifested in such a subject is confined to a few women and a handful of artists let any one who has an eye for looks take the trouble to observe the people who pass in the streets of any of our big towns he will count perhaps one in fivenot beautifulbut with some pretensions to being not absolutely plain and one can say this without fear of hurting any feelings for all will think themselves exceptions frivolity apart there is a dismal lack of good looks and good physique in our population and it will be all to the good to have had this physical training if that training had stopped short of the fighting line it would be physically entirely beneficial as it is one has unfortunately to set against its advantagesleaving out wounds and mutilation altogethera considerable number of overstrained hearts and nerves not amounting to actual disablement and a great deal of developed rheumatism  peace will send back to their work very many men better set up and hardier but many also obviously or secretly weakened hardly any can go back as they were yet while training will but have brought out strength which was always latent and which unless relapse be guarded against must rapidly decline cases of strain and rheumatism will for the most part be permanent and such as would not have taken place under peace conditions then there is the matter of venereal disease which the conditions of military life are carefully fosteringno negligible factor on the debit side the health of many hundreds must be written off on that score to credit again must be placed increased personal cleanliness much greater handiness and resource in the small ways of life and an even more complete endurance and contempt of illness than already characterised the british workman if that be possible on the whole i think that physically the scales will balance pretty evenly  next what will be the effect of the war on the mental powers of the soldierworkman unlike the french sixty per cent of whose army are men working on the land our army must contain at least ninety per cent of town workers whose minds in time of peace are kept rather more active than those of workers on the land by the ceaseless friction and small decisions of town life to gauge the result of two to five years military life on the minds of these town workers is a complicated and stubborn problem here we have the exact converse of the physical case if the army life of the soldierworkman stopped short of service at the front one might say at once that the effect on his mind would be far more disastrous than it is the opportunity for initiative and decision the mental stir of camp and depôt life is nil compared with that of service in the fighting line and for one month at the front a man spends perhaps five at the rear military life on its negative side is more or less a suspension of the usual channels of mental activity by barrack and camp life the normal civilian intellect is as it were marooned on that desert island it finds no doubt certain new and very definite forms of activity but any one who has watched old soldiers must have been struck by the arrested look which is stamped on most of themby a kind of remoteness of concentrated emptiness as of men who by the conditions of their lives have long been prevented from thinking of anything outside a ring fence two to five years service will not be long enough to set the old soldiers stamp on a mind but one can see the process beginning and it will be quite long enough to encourage laziness in minds already disposed to lying fallow far be it from this pen to libel the english but a feverish mental activity has never been their vice intellect especially in what is known as the workingclass is leisurely it does not require to be encouraged to take its ease some one has asked me can the ordinary worker think less in the army than when he wasnt in the army in other words did he ever think at all the british worker is of course deceptive he does not look as if he were thinking whence exactly does he get his stolidityfrom climate selfconsciousness or his competitive spirit all the same thought does go on in him shrewd and nearthebone lifemade rather than bookmade thought its range is limited by its vocabulary it starts from different premises reaches different conclusions from those of the pundit and so is liable to seem to the latter nonexistent but let a worker and an educated man sit opposite each other in a railway carriage without exchanging a word as is the fashion with the english and which of their two silent judgments on the other will be superior i am not sure but i rather think the workers it will have a kind of deadly realism in camp and depôt life the mind standingatease from many civilian frictions and needs for decision however petty and shaken away from civilian ruts will do a good deal of thinking of a sort be widened and probably revalue many thingsespecially when its owner goes abroad and sees fresh types fresh manners and the world but actual physical exertion and the inertia which follows it bulk large in military service and many who never thought at all before they became soldiers will think still less after i may be cynical but it seems to me that the chief stimulus to thought in the ordinary mind is money the getting and the spending thereof that what we call politics those social interests which form at least half the staple of the ordinary workers thought are made up of concern as to the wherewithal to live in the army money is a fixed quantity which demands no thought neither in the getting nor the spending and the constant mental activity which in normal life circles round money of necessity dries up  but against this indefinite general rusting of mind machinery in the soldierworkmans life away from the fighting line certain definite considerations must be set many soldiers will form a habit of readingin the new armies the demand for books is great some in sheer boredom will have begun an allround cultivation of their minds others again will be chafing continually against this prolonged holdingup of their habitual mental trafficand when a man chafes he does not exactly rust so that while the naturally lazy will have been made more lazy the naturally eager may be made very eager  the matter of age too is not unimportant a soldier of twenty twentyfive even up to thirty probably seldom feels that the mode of life from which he has been taken is set and permanent he may be destined to do that work all his days but the knowledge of this has not so far bitten him he is not yet in the swing and current of his career and feels no great sense of dislocation but a man of thirtyfive or forty taken from an occupation which has got grip on him feels that his life has had a slice carved out of it he may realise the necessity better than the younger man take his duty more seriously but must have a sensation as if his springs were let down flat the knowledge that he has to resume his occupation again in real middle age with all the steam escaped must be profoundly discouraging therefore i think his mental activity will suffer more than that of the younger man the recuperative powers of youth are so great that very many of our younger soldiers will unrust quickly and at a bound regain all the activity lost besides a very great many of the younger men will not go back to the old job but older men though they will go back to what they were doing before more readily than their juniors will go back with diminished hope and energy and a sort of fatalism at forty even at thirtyfive every year begins to seem important and several years will have been wrenched out of their working lives just perhaps when they were beginning to make good  turning to the spells of service at the frontthere will be no rusting therethe novelty of sensation the demand for initiative and adaptability are too great a soldier said to me my two years in depôt and camp were absolutely deadening that eight weeks at the front before i was knocked over were the best eight weeks i ever had spells at the front must wipe out all or nearly all the rust but against them must be set the deadening spells of hospital which too often follow the deadening spells of training which have gone before and the more considerable though not very permanent factorthat laziness and dislocation left on the minds of many who have been much in the firing line as the same young soldier put it i cant concentrate now as i could on a bit of workit takes me longer all the same where i used to chuck it when i found it hard i set my teeth now in other words less mental but more moral grip  on the whole then so far as mental effect goes i believe the balance must come out on the debit side  and now what will be the spiritual effect of the war on the soldierworkman and by spiritual i mean the effect of his new life and emotional experience neither on his intellect nor exactly on his soulfor very few men have anything so rarefiedbut on his disposition and character  has any one the right to discuss this who has not fought it is with the greatest diffidence that i hazard any view on the other hand the effects are so various and so intensely individual that perhaps only such a one has a chance of forming a general judgment unbiassed by personal experience and his own temperament what thousands of strange and poignant feelings must pass through even the least impressionable soldier who runs the gamut of this wars experience and there will not be too many of our soldierworkmen returning to civil life without having had at least a taste of everything the embryo guardsman who sticks his bayonet into a sack be he never so unimaginative with each jab of that bayonet pictures dimly the body of a hun and gets used to the sensation of spitting it on every long march there comes a time that may last hours when the recruit feels done up and yet has to go on sticking it never a day passes all through his service without some moment when he would give his soul to be out of it all and back in some little elysium of the past but he has to grit his teeth and try to forget hardly a man who when he first comes under fire has not a struggle with himself which amounts to a spiritual victory not many who do not arrive at a dont care state of mind that is almost equal to a spiritual defeat no soldier who does not rub shoulders during his service with countless comrades strange to him and get a wider understanding and a fuller tolerance not a soul in the trenches one would think who is not caught up into a mood of comradeship and selfsuppression which amounts almost to exaltation not one but has to fight through moods almost reaching extinction of the very love of life and shall all thisand the many hard disappointments and the long yearning for home and those he loves and the chafing against continual restraints and the wellingup of secret satisfaction in the bit done the knowledge that fate is not beating cannot beat him and the sight of death all round and the looking into deaths eyesstaring those eyes down and the long bearing of pain and the pity for his comrades bearing painshall all this pass his nature by without marking it for life when all is over and the soldierworkman back in civil life will his character be enlarged or shrunken the nature of a man is never really changed no more than a leopards skin it is but developed or dwarfed the influences of the war will have as many little forms as there are soldiers and to attempt precision of summary is clearly vain it is something of a truism to suggest that the war will ennoble and make more serious those who before the war took a noble and serious view of life and that on those who took life callously it will have a callousing effect the problem is rather to discover what effect if any will be made on that medium material which was neither definitely serious nor obviously callous and for this we must go to consideration of main national characteristics it isfor one thingvery much the nature of the briton to look on life as a game with victory or defeat at the end of it and to feel it impossible that he can be defeated he is not so much concerned to live as to win this life match he is combative from one minute to the next reacts instantly against any attempt to down him the war for him is a round in this great personal match of his with fate and he is completely caught up in the idea of winning it he is spared that double consciousness of the french soldier who wants to live who goes on indeed superbly fighting pour la france out of love for his country but all the time cannot help saying to himself what a fool i amwhat sort of life is this i have heard it said by one who ought to know if any one can that the british soldier hardly seems to have a sense of patriotism but goes through it all as a sort of private scrap in which he does not mean to be beaten and out of loyalty to his regiment his team so to speak this is partly true but the briton is very deep and there are feelings at the bottom of his well which never see the light if the british soldier were fighting on a line which ran from lowestoft through york to sunderland he might show very different symptoms still at bottom he would always i think feel the business to be first in the nature of a contest with a force which was trying to down him personally in this contest he is being stretched and steeledthat is hardened and confirmedin the very quality of stubborn combativeness which was already his first characteristic  take another main feature of the national characterthe briton is ironic well the war is deepening his irony it must for it is a monstrously ironic business  someespecially those who wish tobelieve in a religious revival among the soldiers theres an authentic story of two convalescent soldiers describing a battle the first finished thus i tell you it makes you think of god the seconda thoughtful typeended with a pause and then these words who could believe in god after that like all else in human life it depends on temperament the war will speed up belief in some and disbelief in others but on the whole comic courage shakes no hands with orthodoxy  the religious movement which i think is going on is of a subtler and a deeper sort altogether men are discovering that human beings are finer than they had supposed a young man said to me well i dont know about religion but i know that my opinion of human nature is about fifty per cent better than it was that conclusion has been arrived at by countless thousands it is a great factorseeing that the belief of the future will be belief in the god within and a frank agnosticism concerning the great why of things religion will become the exaltation of selfrespect of what we call the divine in man the kingdom of god is within you that belief old as the hills and reincarnated by tolstoi years ago has come into its own in the war for it has been clearly proved to be the real faith of modern man underneath all verbal attempts to assert the contrary thisthe white side of waris an extraordinarily heartening phenomenon and if it sent every formal creed in the world packing there would still be a gain to religion  another main characteristic of the briton especially of the working briton is improvidencehe likes unconsciously to live from hand to mouth careless of the morrow the war is deepening that characteristic tooit must for who could endure if he fretted over what was going to happen to him with death so in the wind  thus the average soldierworkman will return from the war confirmed and deepened in at least three main national characteristics his combative hardihood his ironic humour and his improvidence i think he will have more of what is called character whether for good or evil depends i take it on what we connote by those terms and in what context we use them i may look on character as an asset but i can well imagine politicians and trades union leaders regarding it with profound suspicion anyway he will not be the lamb that he was not even before the war he will be a restive fellow knowing his own mind better and possibly his real interest less well he will play less for safety since safety will have become to him a civilian sort of thing rather contemptible he will have at once a more interesting and a less reliable character from the social and political point of view  and what about his humanity can he go through all this hell of slaughter and violence untouched in his gentler instincts there will bethere must besome brutalisation but old soldiers are not usually inhumaneon the contrary they are often very gentle beings i distrust the influence of the war on those who merely write and read about it i think editors journalists old gentlemen and women will be brutalised in larger numbers than our soldiers an intelligent french soldier said to me of his own countrymen after six months of civil life you wont know they ever had to clean up trenches and that sort of thing if this is true of the frenchman it will be more true of the less impressionable briton if i must sum up at all on what for want of a better word i have called the spiritual count i can only say that there will be a distinct increase of character and leave it to the reader to decide whether that falls on the debit or the credit side  on the whole then an increase of character a slight loss of mental activity and neither physical gain nor loss to speak of  we have now to consider the rather deadly matter of demobilisation one hears the suggestion that not more than 30000 men shall be disbanded per week this means two years at least conceive millions of men whose sense of sacrifice has been stretched to the full for a definite object which has been gainedconceive them held in a weary and as it seems to them unnecessary state of suspense kept back from all they long for years after the reality of their service has departed if this does not undermine them i do not know what will demobilisationthey saymust be cautious no man should be released till a place in the industrial machine is ready waiting for him so in a counsel of perfection speak the wise who have not been deprived of home life civil liberty and what not for a dismal length of two three and perhaps four years no demobilisation should be as swift as possible and risks be run to make it swift the soldierworkman who goes back to civil life within two or three months after peace is signed goes back with a glow still in his heart but he who returns with a rankling sense of unmerited unintelligible delaymost prudently of course ordainedgoes back with cold feet and a sullen or revolting spirit what men will stand under the shadow of a great danger from a sense of imminent duty they will furiously chafe at when that danger and sense of duty are no more the duty will then be to their families and to themselves there is no getting away from this and the country will be well advised not to be too coldly cautious every one of course must wish to ease to the utmost the unprecedented economic and industrial confusion which the signing of peace will bring but it will be better to risk a good deal of momentary unemployment and discontent rather than neglect the human factor and keep men back long months in a service of which they will be deadly sick how sick they will be may perhaps be guessed at from the words of a certain soldier after the war youll have to have conscription you wont get a man to go into the army without what is there to prevent the government from beginning now to take stock of the demands of industry from having a great land settlement scheme cut and dried and devising means for the swiftest possible demobilisation the moment peace is signed the process of reabsorption into civil life should begin at once and go on without interruption as swiftly as the actual difficulties of transport permit they of themselves will hold up demobilisation quite long enough the soldierworkman will recognise and bear with the necessary physical delays but he will not tolerate for a moment any others for his socalled benefita  and what sort of civil life will it be which awaits the soldierworkman i suppose if anything is certain a plenitude nay a plethora of work is assured for some time after the war capital has piled up in hands which will control a vast amount of improved and convertible machinery purchasing power has piled up in the shape of savings out of the increased national income granted that income will at once begin to drop all round shrinking perhaps fast to below the prewar figures still at first there must be a rolling river of demand and the wherewithal to satisfy it for years no one has built houses or had their houses done up no one has bought furniture clothes or a thousand other articles which they propose buying the moment the war stops railways and rolling stock roads housing public works of all sorts private motor cars and pleasure requirements of every kind have been let down and starved huge quantities of shipping must be replaced vast renovations of destroyed country must be undertaken numberless repairs to damaged property the tremendous process of converting or reconverting machinery to civil uses must be put through state schemes to deal with the land housing and other problems will be in full blast a fierce industrial competition will commence and above all we must positively grow our own food in the future besides all this we shall have lost at least a million workers through death disablement and emigration indeed unless we have some really attractive land scheme ready we may lose a million by emigration alone in a word the demand for labour at the moment will be overwhelming and the vital question only one of readjustment in numberless directions women boys and older men have replaced the soldierworkman hundreds of thousands of soldiers especially among the first three million have been guaranteed reinstatement hundreds of thousands of substitutes will therefore be thrown out of work with the exception of the skilled men who have had to be retained in their places all through and the men who step back into places kept for them the whole working population will have to be refitted with jobs the question of womens labour will not be grave at first because there will be work for all and more than all but the jigsaw puzzle which industry will have to put together will try the nerves and temper of the whole community in the french army the peasant soldier is jealous and sore because he has had to bear the chief burden of the fighting while the mechanic has to a great extent been kept for munition making transport and essential civil industry with us it is if anything the other way in the french army too the feeling runs high against the embusqué the man whooften unjustlyis supposed to have avoided service i do not know to what extent the same feeling prevails in our army but there is certainly an element of it which will not make for content or quietude  another burning question after the war will be wages we are assured they are going to keep up well we shall see certain special rates will of course come down at once and if in general wages keep up it will not i think be for very long still times will be good at first for employers and employed at firstand then  some thinkers insist that the war has to an appreciable extent been financed out of savings which would otherwise have been spent on luxury but the amount thus saved can easily be exaggeratedthe luxurious class is not really large and against their saving must be set the spending by the working classes out of increased wages on what in peace years were not necessities of their existence in other words the luxurious or investing class has cut off its peacetime fripperies saved and lent to the government the government has paid the bulk of this money to the working class who have spent most of it in what to them would be fripperies in time of peace it may be it is all to the good that luxurious tastes should be clipped from the wealthy and a higher standard of living secured to the workers but this is rather a matter of distribution and social health than of economics in relation to the financing of the war  there are those who argue that because the general productive effort of the country during the war has been speeded up to half as much again as that of normal times by tapping womens labour by longer hours and general improvement in machinery and industrial ideas the war will not result in any great economic loss and that we may with care and effort avoid the coming of bad times after the first boom the fact remains and anybody can test it for himself that there is a growing shortage of practically everything exceptthey saycheap jewellery and pianos i am no economist but that does seem to indicate that this extra production has not greatly compensated for the enormous application of labour and material resources to the quickwasting ends of war instead of to the slowwasting ends of civil life in other words a vast amount of productive energy and material is being shot away now this i suppose would not matter in fact might be beneficial to trade by increasing demand if the purchasing power of the public remained what it was before the war but in all the great countries of the world even america the peoples will be faced with taxation which will soak up anything from onefifth to onethird of their incomes and even allowing for a large swelling of those incomes from war savings so that a great deal of what the state takes with one hand she will return to the investing public with the other the diminution of purchasing power is bound to make itself increasingly felt when the reconversion of machinery to civil ends has been completed the immediate arrears of demand supplied shipping and rollingstock replaced houses built repairs made good and so forth this slow shrinkage of purchasing power in every country will go hand in hand with shrinkage of demand decline of trade and wages and unemployment in a slow process till they culminate in what one fears may be the worst times we have ever known whether those times will set in one two or even six years after the war is of course the question a certain school of thought insists that this tremendous taxation after the war and the consequent impoverishment of enterprise and industry can be avoided or at all events greatly relieved by national schemes for the development of the empires latent resources in other words that the state should even borrow more money to avoid high taxation and pay the interests on existing loans should acquire native lands and swiftly develop mineral rights and other potentialities i hope there may be something in this but i am a little afraid that the wish is father to the thought and that the proposition contains an element akin to the attempt to lift oneself up by the hair of ones own head for i notice that many of its disciples are recruited from those who in old days were opposed to the state development of anything on the ground that individual energy in free competition was a still greater driving power  however we may wriggle in our skins and juggle with the chances of the future i suspect that we shall have to pay the piper we have without doubt during the war been living to a great extent on our capital our national income has gone up out of capital from twentytwo hundred to about three thousand six hundred millions and will rapidly shrink to an appropriate figure wealth may i admit recover much more quickly than deductions from the past would lead us to expect under the wars pressure secrets have been discovered machinery improved mens energies and knowledge brightened and toned up the prime minister not long ago said if you insist on going back to prewar conditions then god help this country a wise warning if the country could be got to pull together in an effort to cope with peace as strenuous as our effort to cope with the war has been one would not view the economic future with disquietude but one is bound to point out that if the war has proved anything it has proved that the british people require a maximum of danger dangled in front of their very noses before they can be roused to any serious effort and that danger in time of peace has not the posterlike quality of danger in time of war it does not hit men in the eye it does not still differences of opinion and party struggles by its scarlet insistence i hope for but frankly do not see the coming of an united national effort demanding extra energy extra organising skill extra patience and extra selfsacrifice at a time when the whole nation will feel that it has earned a rest and when the lid has once more been taken off the political cauldron i fancy dismally that a people and a press who have become so used to combat and excitement will demand and seek further combat and excitement and will take out this itch amongst themselves in a fashion even more strenuous than before the war i am not here concerned to try to cheer or depress for some immediate and excellent result as we have all got into the habit of doing during the war but to try to conjure truth out of the darkness of the future the vast reconstructive process which ought to be and perhaps is beginning now will i think go ahead with vigour while the war is on and for some little time after but i fear it will then split into pro and con seesaw and come to something of a standstill  these so sketchily set down are a few of the probable itemscredit and debitin the industrial situation which will await the soldierworkman emerging from the war a situation agitated crosscurrented bewildering but busy and by no means economically tight at first slowly becoming less bewildering gradually growing less and less busy till it reaches ultimately a bad era of unemployment and social struggle the soldierworkman will go back i believe to two or three years at least of good wages and plentiful work but when after that the pinch begins to come it will encounter the quicker more resentful blood of men who in the constant facing of great danger have left behind them all fear of consequences of men who in the survival of one great dislocation to their lives have lost the dread of other dislocations the war will have implanted a curious deep restlessness in the great majority of soldier souls can the workmen of the future possibly be as patient and lawabiding as they were before the war in the face of what seems to them injustice i dont think so the enemy will again be fatethis time in the form of capital trying to down them and the victory they were conscious of gaining over fate in the war will have strengthened and quickened their fibre to another fight and another conquest the seeds of revolution are supposed to lie in war they lie there because war generally brings in the long run economic stress but also because of the recklessness or charactercall it what you willwhich the habitual facing of danger develops the selfcontrol and selfrespect which military service under war conditions will have brought to the soldierworkman will be an added force in civil life but it is a fallacy i think to suppose as some do that it will be a force on the side of established order it is all a question of allegiance and the allegiance of the workman in time of peace is not rendered to the state but to himself and his own class to the service of that class and the defence of its rights this new force will be given in measuring the possibilities of revolution the question of class rides paramount many hold that the war is breaking down social barriers and establishing comradeship through hardship and danger shared for the moment this is true but whether that new comradeship will stand any great pressure of economic stress after direct regimental relationship between officer and man has ceased and the war is becoming just a painful memory is to me very doubtful but suppose that to some extent it does stand we have still the fact that the control of industry and capital even as long as ten years after the war will be mainly in the hands of men who have not fought of business men spared from service either by age or by their too precious commercial skill towards these the soldierworkman will have no tender feelings no sense of comradeship on the contraryfor somewhere back of the mind of every workman there is even during his countrys danger a certain doubt whether all war is not somehow hatched by the aristocrats and plutocrats of one side or both other feelings obscure this instinct during the struggle but it is never quite lost and will spring up again the more confirmed for its repression that we can avoid a straitened and serious time a few years hence i believe impossible straitened times dismally divide the classes the warinvestments of the working class may ease things a little but warsavings will not affect the outlook of the soldierworkman for he will have no warsavings except his life and it is from him that revolution or disorder will come if it come at all  must it come i think most certainly unless between now and then means be found of persuading capital and labour that their interests and their troubles are identical and of overcoming secrecy and suspicion between them there are many signs already that capital and labour are becoming alive to this necessity but to talk of unity is an amiable distraction in which we all indulge these days to find a method by which that talk may be translated into fact within a few years is perhaps more difficult one does not change human nature and unless the interests of capital and labour are in reality made one true cooperation established and factory conditions transformed on the lines of the welfare systemno talk of unity will prevent capitalist and working man from claiming what seem to them their rights the labour world is now and for some time to come will be at sixes and sevens in matters of leadership and responsibility and this just when sagacious leadership and loyal following will be most needed the soldierworkman was already restive under leadership before the war returned to civil life he will be far more restive yet without leadership what hope is there of cooperation with capital what chance of finding a golden mean of agreement but even if the problems of leadership are solved and councils of capitalists and labour leaders established whose decisions will be followedone thing is still certain no halfmeasures will do no seeming cordialities with mental reservations no simulated generosity which spills out on the first test nothing but genuine friendliness and desire to pull together those hard business heads which distrust all sentiment as if it were a poison are the most shortsighted heads in the world there is a human factor in this affair as both sides will find to their cost if they neglect it extremists must be sent to coventry caste feeling dropped on the one hand and suspicion dropped on the other managers directors and labour leaders all must learn that they are not simply trustees for their shareholders or for labour but trustees of a national interest which embraces them allor worse will come of it  but i am not presumptuous enough to try to teach these cooks how to make their broth neither would it come within the scope of these speculations which conclude thus the soldierworkman physically unchanged mentally a little weakened but more characterful and restive will step out through a demobilisationheaven send it be swift even at some riskinto an industrial world confused and busy as a beehive which will hum and throb and flourish for two or three years and then slowly chill and thin away into may be the winter ghost of itself or at best an autumn hive there unless he be convinced not by words but facts that his employer is standing side by side with him in true comradeship facing the deluge he will be quick to rise and with his newlyfound selfconfidence take things into his own hands whether if he does he will make those things better for himself would be another inquiry altogether  1917  a since these words were written one hears of demobilization schemes ready to the last buttons let us hope the buttons wont come offj g     the childrens jewel fund   the mere male novelist who takes pen to write on infants awaits the polished comment he knows nothing of the subjectrubbish pure rubbish one must run that risk  in the report of the national baby week it is writtenis it worth while to destroy our best manhood now unless we can ensure that there will be happy healthy citizens to carry on the empire in the future i confess to approaching this subject from the point of view of the infant citizen rather than of the empire and i have wondered sometimes if it is worth while to save the babies seeing the conditions they often have to face as grown men and women but that after all would be to throw up the sponge which is not the part of a briton it is written alsoafter the war a very large increase in the birthrate may be looked for for a year or two perhaps but the real aftereffect of the war will be to decrease the birthrate in every european country or i am much mistaken no food for cannon and no extra burdens will be the cry and little wonder this however does not affect the question of children actually born or on their way if not quantity we can at all events have quality  i also read an account of the things to be done to keep baby alive which filled me with wonder how any of us old babies managed to survive and i am afraid that unless we grow up healthy we are not worth the trouble the fact is the whole business of babies is an activity to be engaged in with some regard to the baby or we commit a monstrous injustice and drag the hands of the worlds clock backwards  how do things stand each year in this country about 100000 babies die before they have come into the world and out of the 800000 born about 90000 die many mothers become permanently damaged in health by evil birth conditions many children grow up mentally or physically defective one in four of the children in our elementary schools are not in a condition to benefit properly by their schooling what sublime waste ten in a hundred of them suffer from malnutrition thirty in the hundred have defective eyes eighty in the hundred need dental treatment twenty odd in the hundred have enlarged tonsils or adenoids many perhaps most of these deaths and defects are due to the avoidable ignorance illhealth mitigable poverty and other handicaps which dog poor mothers before and after a babys birth one doesnt know which to pity mostthe mothers or the babies fortunately to help the one is to help the other in passing i would like to record two sentiments my strong impression that we ought to follow the example of america and establish mothers pensions and my strong hope that those who visit the sins of the fathers upon illegitimate children will receive increasingly the contempt they deserve from every decentminded citizen  on the general question of improving the health of mothers and babies i would remind readers that there is no great country where effort is half so much needed as here we are nearly twice as town and slum ridden as any other people have grown to be further from nature and more feckless about food we have damper air to breathe and less sun to disinfect us in new zealand with a climate somewhat similar to ours the infant mortality rate has as a result of a widespread educational campaign been reduced within the last few years to 50 per 1000 from 110 per 1000 a few years ago it is perhaps too sanguine to expect that we so much more townridden can do as well here but we ought to be able to make a vast improvement we have begun to since 1904 when this matter was first seriously taken in hand our infant mortality rate has declined from 145 per 1000 to 91 per 1000 in 1916 this reduction has been mainly due to the institution of infant welfare centres and wholetime health visitors of centres there are now nearly 1200 we want 5000 more of visitors there are now hardly 1500 we want i am told 2000 more it is estimated that the yearly crop of babies 700000 if those of the welltodo be excepted can be provided with infant welfare centres and wholetime health visitors by expenditure at the rate of £1 a head per year the government which is benevolently disposed towards the movement gives half of the annual expenditure the other half falls on the municipalities but these 5000 new infant welfare centres and these extra 2000 health visitors must be started by voluntary effort and subscription once started the government and the municipalities will have to keep them up but unless we start them the babies will go on dying or growing up diseased the object of the jewel fund therefore is to secure the necessary money to get the work into train  what are these infant welfare centres and have they really all this magic they are places where mothers to be or in being can come for instruction and help in all that concerns birth and the care of their babies and children up to school age prevention is better than cure is the motto of these centres i went to one of the largest in london it has about 600 entries in the year there were perhaps 40 babies and children and perhaps 30 mothers there about 20 of these mothers were learning sewing or knitting five of them were sitting round a nurse who was bathing a threeweeksold baby the young mother who can wash a baby to the taste and benefit of the baby by the light of nature must clearly be something of a phenomenon in a room downstairs were certain little stoics whose health was poor they were brought there daily to be watched one was an airraid baby the thinnest little critter ever seen an ashen bit of a thing through which the wind could blow very silent and asking why with its eyes they showed me a mother who had just lost her first baby the centre was rescuing it from a paupers funeral i can see her now coming in and sitting on the edge of a chair the sudden puckering of her driedup little face the tears rolling down i shall always remember the tone of her voiceits my baby her husband is doing time and want of food and knowledge while she was carrying it caused the babys death several mothers from her street come to the centre but keeping herself to herself she never heard of it till too late in a hundred little ways these centres give help and instruction they and the health visitors who go along with them are doing a great work but there are many districts all over the country where there are no centres to come to no help and instruction to be got however desperately wanted verily this land of ours still goes like rachel mourning for her children disease hunger deformity and death still hound our babes and most of that hounding is avoidable we must and shall revolt against the evil lot which preventible ignorance ill health and poverty bring on hundreds of thousands of children  it is time we had more pride what right have we to the word civilised till we give mothers and children a proper chance this is but the alpha of decency the first step of progress we are beginning to realise that but even now to make a full effort and make it at oncewe have to beg for jewels  whats a jewel beside a babys life whats a toy to the health and happy future of these helpless little folk  you who wear jewels with few exceptions are or will be mothersyou ought to know to help your own children you would strip yourselves but the test is the giving for children not ones own beneath all flaws fatuities and failings this i solemnly believe is the country of the greathearted i believe that the women of our race before all women have a sense of others they will not fail the test  into the twilight of the world are launched each year these myriads of tiny ships under a sky of cloud and stars they grope out to the great waters and the great windslittle sloops of life on whose voyaging the future hangs they go forth blind feeling their way mothers and you who will be mothers and you who have missed motherhood give them their chance bless them with a gemlight their lanterns with your jewels  1917     france 19161917  an impression   it was past eleven and the packet had been steady some time when we went on deck and found her moving slowly in bright moonlight up the haven towards the houses of le havre a night approach to a city by water has the quality of otherworldness i remember the same sensation twice before coming in to san francisco from the east by the steamferry and stealing into abingdononthames in a rowingboat le havre lay reaching up towards the heights still and fair a little mysterious with many lights which no one seemed using it was cold but the air already had a different texture drier lighter than the air we had left and ones heart felt light and a little excited in the moonlight the piledup shuttered houses had colouring like that of flowers at nightpale subtle motheropearl we moved slowly up beside the quay heard the first french voices saw the first french faces and went down again to sleep  in the military bureau at the station with what friendly politeness they exchanged our hospital passes for the necessary forms but it took two officials ten minutes of hard writing and one thought is victory possible with all these forms it is so throughout francetoo many forms too many people to fill them up as if france could not trust herself without recording in spidery handwriting exactly where she is for nobody to look at afterwards but france could trust herself a pity  our only fellowtraveller was not a soldier but had that indefinable look of connection with the war wrapped round almost everyone in france a wide land we passed fallow under the november sky houses hidden among the square normandy courtyards of tall trees not many people in the fields  paris is paris was and ever shall be paris is not france if the germans had taken paris they would have occupied the bodily heart the centre of her circulatory system but the spirit of france their heavy hands would not have clutched for it never dwelt there paris is hard and hurried france is not paris loves pleasure france loves life paris is a brilliant stranger in her own land and yet a lot of true frenchmen and frenchwomen live there and many little plots of real french life are cultivated  at the gare de lyon poilus are taking trains for the south this is our first real sight of them in their tired glory they look weary and dusty and strong every face has character no face looks empty or as if its thought were being done by others their laughter is not vulgar or thick alongside their faces the english face looks stupid the english body angular andneat they are loaded with queer burdens bread and bottles bulge their pockets their bluegrey is prettier than khaki their round helmets are becoming our tommies even to our own eyes seem uniformed but hardly two out of all this crowd are dressed alike the french soldier luxuriates in extremes he can go to his death in white gloves and dandyismhe can glory in unshavenness and patches the words in extremis seem dear to the french soldier and con amore he passes from one extreme to the other one of them stands gazing up at the board which gives the hours of starting and the destinations of the trains his tired face is charming and has a look that i cannot describelost as it were to all surroundings a welshman or a highlander but no pure englishman could look like that  our carriage has four french officers they talk neither to us nor to each other they sleep sitting well back hardly moving all night one of them snores a little but with a certain politeness we leave them in the early morning and get down into the windy station at valence in prewar days romance began there when one journeyed a lovely word and the gate of the south soon after valence one used to wake and draw aside a corner of the curtain and look at the land in the first level sunlight a strange land of plains and far yellowish hills a land with a dry shivering wind over it and puffs of pink almond blossom but now valence was dark for it was november and raining in the waitingroom were three tired soldiers trying to sleep and one sitting up awake shyly glad to share our cakes and journals then on through the wet morning by the little branch line into dauphiné two officers again and a civilian in our carriage are talking in low voices of the war or in higher voices of lodgings at valence one is a commandant with a handsome paternal old face broader than the english face a little more in love with life and a little more cynical about it with more depth of colouring in eyes and cheeks and hair the tone of their voices talking of the war is grave and secret les anglais ne lâcheront pas are the only words i plainly hear the younger officer says and how would you punish the commandants answer is inaudible but by the twinkling of his eyes one knows it to be human and sagacious the train winds on in the windy wet through foothills and then young mountains following up a swiftflowing river the chief trees are bare lombardy poplars the chief little town is gathered round a sharp spur with bare towers on its top the colour everywhere is a brownishgrey  we have arrived a tall strong young soldier all white teeth and smiles hurries our luggage out a car hurries us up in the rainy wind through the little town down again across the river up a long avenue of pines and we are at our hospital  round the long table at their dinnerhour what a variety of type among the men and yet a likeness a sort of quickness and sensibility common to them all a few are a little méfiant of these newcomers with the méfiance of individual character not of class distrustfulness nor of that defensive expressionless we cultivate in england the french soldier has a touch of the child in himif we leave out the parisians a child who knows more than you do perhaps a child who has lived many lives before this life a wise child who jumps to your moods and shows you his sore fingers readily when he feels that you want to see them he has none of the perverse and grudging attitude towards his own ailments that we english foster he is perhaps a little inclined to pet them treating them with an odd mixture of stoic gaiety and gloomy indulgence it is like all the rest of him he feels everything so much quicker than we dohe is so much more impressionable the variety of type is more marked physically than in our country here is a tall savoyard cavalryman with a maimed hand and a fair moustache brushed up at the ends big and strong with grey eyes and a sort of sage selfreliance only twentysix but might be forty here is a real latin who was buried by an explosion at verdun handsome with dark hair and a round head and colour in his cheeks an ironical critic of everything a socialist a mocker a fine strong fellow with a clear brain who attracts women here are two peasants from the central south both with bad sciatica slower in look with a mournful rather monkeyish expression in their eyes as if puzzled by their sufferings here is a true frenchman a territorial from roanne riddled with rheumatism quick and gay and suffering touchy and affectionate not tall brownfaced browneyed rather fair with clean jaw and features and eyes with a soul in them looking a little up fortyeightthe oldest of them allthey call him grandpère and here is a printer from lyon with shellshock mediumcoloured short and roundish and neat full of humanity and high standards and domestic affection and so polite with eyes a little like a dogs and here another with shellshock and browngreen eyes from the invaded countries méfiant truly this one but with a heart when you get at it neat and brooding quick as a cat nervous and wanting his own way but they are all so varied if there are qualities common to all they are impressionability and capacity for affection this is not the impression left on one by a crowd of englishmen behind the politeness and civilised bearing of the french i used to think there was a little of the tiger in a sense perhaps there is but that is not the foundation of their characterfar from it underneath the tiger again there is a man civilised for centuries most certainly the politeness of the french is no surface quality it is a polish welling up from a naturally affectionate heart a naturally quick apprehension of the moods and feelings of others it is the outcome of a culture so old that underneath all differences it binds together all those types and strains of bloodthe savoyard and the southerner the latin of the centre the man from the north the breton the gascon the basque the auvergnat even to some extent the norman and the parisianin a sort of warm and bonedeep kinship they have all as it were sat for centuries under a wall with the afternoon sun warming them through and through as i so often saw the old town gossips sitting of an afternoon the sun of france has made them alike a light and happy sun not too southern but just southern enough  and the women of france if the men are bound in that mysterious kinship how much more so are the women what is it in the frenchwoman which makes her so utterly unique a daughter in one of anatole frances books says to her mother tu es pour les bijoux je suis pour les dessous the frenchwoman spiritually is pour les dessous there is in her a kind of inherited conservative clever dainty capability no matter where you go in france or in what classcountry or townyou find it she cannot waste she cannot spoil she makes and showsthe best of everything if i were asked for a concrete illustration of selfrespect i should saythe frenchwoman it is a particular kind of selfrespect no doubt very much limited to this world and perhaps beginning to be a little frayed we have some frenchwomen at the hospital the servants who keep us in running orderthe dear cook whom we love not only for her baked meats proud of her soldier son once a professor now a sergeant and she a woman of property with two houses in the little town patient kind very stubborn about her dishes which have in them the essential juices and savours which characterise all things really french she has great sweetness and selfcontainment in her small wrinkled yellowish face always quietly polite and grave she bubbles deliciously at any joke and gives affection sagaciously to those who merit a jewel who must be doing something pour la france and we have madame jeanne camille mother of two daughters and one son too young to be a soldier it was her eldest daughter who wanted to come and scrub in the hospital but was refused because she was too pretty and her mother came instead a woman who did not need to come and nearly fifty but strong as the french are strong with good red blood deep colouring hair still black and handsome straight features what a worker a lover of talk too and of a joke when she has time and claire of a languissante temperament as she says but who would know it eighteen with a figure abundant as that of a woman of forty but just beginning to fine down holding herself as french girls learn to hold themselves so young and with the pretty eyes of a southern nymph clearbrown and understanding and a little bit woodwild not selfconsciouslike the english girl at that agefond of work and play with what is called a good head on her and a warm heart a real woman of france  then there is the farmeress at the home farm which gives the hospital its milk a splendid greyeyed creature doing the work of her husband who is at the front with a little girl and boy rounder and rosier than anything you ever saw and a small oneeyed brotherinlaw who drinks my god he drinks any day you go into the town to do hospital commissions you may see the hospital donkeycart with the charming grey donkey outside the café de lunivers or what not and know that charles is within he beguiles our poilus and they take little beguiling wine is too plentiful in france the sun in the wines of france quickens and cheers the blood in the veins of france but the gift of wine is abused one may see a poster which sayswith what truth i know notthat drink has cost france more than the francoprussian war french drunkenness is not so sottish as our beerandwhiskeyfuddled variety but it is not pleasant to see and mars a fair land  what a fair land i never before grasped the charm of french colouring the pinkishyellow of the pantiled roofs the lavendergrey or dim green of the shutters the selfrespecting shapes and flatness of the houses unworried by wriggling ornamentation or lines coming up in order that they may go down again the universal plane trees with their variegated trunks and dancing lightnessnothing more charming than plane trees in winter their delicate twigs and little brown balls shaking against the clear pale skies and in summer nothing more green and beautiful than their sunflecked shade each country has its special genius of colouringbest displayed in winter to characterise such genius by a word or two is hopeless but one might say the genius of spain is brown of ireland green of england chalky bluegreen of egypt shimmering sandstone for france amethystine feebly expresses the sensation the blend is subtle stimulating rarefiedat all events in the centre and south walk into an english village however beautifuland many are very beautifulyou will not get the peculiar sharp spiritual sensation which will come on you entering some little french village or townthe sensation one has looking at a picture by francesca the blue woodsmoke the pinkish tiles the grey shutters the greybrown plane trees the pale blue sky the yellowish houses and above all the clean forms and the clear air i shall never forget one late afternoon rushing home in the car from some commission the setting sun had just broken through after a misty day the mountains were illumined with purple and rosemadder and snowtipped against the blue sky a wonderful wistaria blue drifted smokelike about the valley and the tall treespoplars and cypressesstood like spires no wonder the french are spirituel a word so different from our spiritual for that they are not preeminently citizens of this worldeven the pious french this is why on the whole they make a better fist of social life than we do we misty islanders only halfalive because we set such store by our unrealised moralities not one englishman in ten now really believes that he is going to live again but his disbelief has not yet reconciled him to making the best of this life or laid ghosts of the beliefs he has outworn clear air and sun but not so much as to paralyse action have made in france clearer eyes clearer brains and touched souls with a sane cynicism the french do not despise and neglect the means to ends they face sexual realities they know that to live well they must eat well to eat well must cook well to cook well must cleanly and cleverly cultivate their soil may france be warned in time by our dismal fate may she never lose her love of the land nor let industrialism absorb her peasantry and the lure of wealth and the cheap glamour of the towns draw her into their uncharmed circles we english have rattled deep into a paradise of machines chimneys cinemas and halfpenny papers have bartered our heritage of health dignity and looks for wealth and badly distributed wealth at that france was trembling on the verge of the same precipice when the war came with its death and wind of restlessness the war bids fair to tip her over let her hold back with all her might her two dangers are drink and the lure of the big towns no race can preserve sanity and refinement which really gives way to these she will not fare even as well as we have if she yields our fibre is coarser and more resistant than hers nor had we ever so much grace to lose it is by grace and selfrespect that france had her preeminence let these wither as wither they must in the grip of a sordid and drinksoothed industrialism and her star will burn out the life of the peasant is hard peasants are soon wrinkled and weathered they are not angels narrow and overprovident suspicious and given to drink they still have their roots and being in the realities of life close to nature and keep a sort of simple dignity and health which great towns destroy let france take care of her peasants and her country will take care of itself  talking to our poilus we remarked that they have not a good word to throw to their députésno faith in them about french politicians i know nothing but their shoes are unenviable and will become too tight for them after the war the poilu has no faith at all now if he ever had save faith in his country so engrained that he lets the lifeloving blood of him be spilled out to the last drop cursing himself and everything for his heroic folly  we had a young spaniard of the foreign legion in our hospital who had been to cambridge and had the outside eyes on all things french in his view je men foutism has a hold of the french army strange if it had not clear quick brains cannot stand fates making ninepins of mankind year after year like this fortunately for france the love of her sons has never been forced it has grown like grass and simple wild herbs in the heart alongside the liberty to criticise and blame the poilu cares for nothing no not he but he is himself a little unconscious bit of france and for oneself one always cares stateforced patriotism made this wara fevergerm which swells the head and causes blindness a state which teaches patriotism in its schools is going mad let no such state be trusted they who after the war would have england and france copy the example of the statedrilled country which opened these floodgates of death and teach mad provincialism under the nickname of patriotism to their children are driving nails into the coffins of their countries je men foutism is a natural product of three years of war and better by far than the docile despair to which so many german soldiers have been reduced we were in lyon when the russian revolution and the german retreat from bapaume were reported the town and railway station were full of soldiers no enthusiasm no stir of any kind only the usual tired stoicism and one thought of what the poilu can be like of our christmas dinnertable at the hospital under the green hanging wreaths and the rosy chinese lanterns the hum the chatter the laughter of free and easy souls in their red hospital jackets the french are so easily so incorrigibly gay the dreary grinding pressure of this war seems horribly cruel applied to such a people and the heroism with which they have borne its untold miseries is sublime in our little remote town out therea town which had been roman in its time and still had bits of roman walls and roman archesevery family had its fathers brothers sons dead fighting in prison or in hospital the mothers were wonderful one old couple in a ferblanterie shop who had lost their eldest son and whose other son was at the front used to try hard not to talk about the war but sure enough they would come to it at last each time we saw them and in a minute the mother would be crying and a silent tear would roll down the old fathers face then he would point to the map and say but look where they are the boches can we stop its impossible we must go on till weve thrown them out it is dreadful but what would you have ah our sonhe was so promising and the mother weeping over the tintacks would make the neatest little parcel of them murmuring out of her tears il faut que ça finisse mais la franceil ne faut pas que la francenos chers fils auraient été tués pour rien poor souls i remember another couple up on the hillside the old wife dignified as a duchessif duchesses are dignifiedwanting us so badly to come in and sit down that she might the better talk to us of her sons one dead and one wounded and two still at the front and the youngest not yet old enough and while we stood there up came the father an old farmer with that youngest son he had not quite the spirit of the old lady nor her serenity he thought that men in these days were no better than des bêtes féroces and in truth his philosophyof an old tiller of the soilwas as superior to that of emperors and diplomats as his life is superior to theirs not very far from that little farm is the spot of all others in that mountain country which most stirs the æsthetic and the speculative strains within one lovely and remote all by itself at the foot of a mountain in a circle of the hills an old monastery stands now used as a farm with one rose window like a spiders web spun delicate in stone tracery there the old monks had gone to get away from the struggles of the main valley and the surges of the fighting men there even now were traces of their peaceful life the fishponds and the tillage still kept in cultivation if they had lived in these days they would have been at the war fighting or bearing stretchers like the priests of france of whom eleven thousand i am tolduntruthfully i hopeare dead so the world goes forwardthe kingdom of heaven comes  we were in the town the day that the 1918 class received their preliminary summons sad were the mothers watching their boys parading the streets rosetted and singing to show that they had passed and were ready to be food for cannon not one of those boys i dare say in his heart wanted to go they have seen too many of their brethren return warworn missed too many who will never come back but they were no less gay about it than those recruits we saw in the spring of 1913 at argelès in the pyrenees singing along and shouting on the day of their enrolment  there were other reminders to us and to the little town of the bloodred line drawn across the map of france we had in our hospital men from the invaded countries without news of wives and families mured up behind that iron veil once in a way a tiny word would get through to them and anxiety would lift a little from their hearts for a day or two they would smile one we had paralysed in the legs who would sit doing macramé work and playing chess all day long every relative he hadwife father mother sistersall were in the power of the german as brave a nature as one could see in a years march touchingly grateful touchingly cheerful but with the saddest eyes i ever saw there was one little reminder in the town whom we could never help going in to look at whenever we passed the shop whose people had given her refuge a little girl of eight with the most charming grave pale little greyeyed face there she would sit playing with her doll watching the customers that little refugee at all events was beloved and happy only i think she thought we would kidnap her one daywe stared at her so hard she had the quality which gives to certain faces the fascination belonging to rare works of art  with all this poignant bereavement and longsuffering amongst them it would be odd indeed if the gay and critical french nature did not rebel and seek some outlet in apathy or bitter criticism the miracle is that they go on and on holding fast easily depressed and as easily lifted up again grumble they must and will but their hearts are not really down to the pitch of their voices their love of country which with them is love of selfthe deepest of all kinds of patriotismis too absolute these two virtues or vices as you pleasecritical faculty and amour propre or vanity if you prefer itare in perpetual encounter the french are at once not at all proud of themselves and very proud they destroy all things french themselves included with their brains and tongues and exalt the same with their hearts and by their actions to the reserved english mind always on the defensive they seem to give themselves away continually but he who understands sees it to be all part of that perpetual interplay of opposites which makes up the french character and secures for it in effect a curious vibrating equilibrium intensely alive is the chief impression one has of the french they balance between head and heart at top speed in a sort of electric and eternal seesaw it is this perpetual quick change which gives them it seems to me their special grip on actuality they never fly into the cloudregions of theories and dreams their heads have not time before their hearts have intervened their hearts not time before their heads cry hold they apprehend both worlds but with such rapid alternation that they surrender to neither consider how clever and comparatively warm is that cold thing religion in france i remember so well the old curé of our little town coming up to lunch his interest in the cooking in the practical matters of our life and in wider affairs too his enjoyment of his coffee and cigarette and the curious suddenness with which something seemed to come over himone could hear his heart saying o my people here am i wasting my time i must run to you i saw him in the courtyard talking to one of our poilus not about his soul but about his body stroking his shoulder softly and calling him mon cher fils dear old man even religion here does not pretend to more than it can achievehelp and consolation to the bewildered and the suffering it uses forms smiling a little at them  the secret of french culture lies in this vibrating balance from quick marriage of mind and heart reason and sense in the french nature all the clear created forms of french life arise forms recognised as forms with definite utility attached controlled expression is the result of action and reaction controlled expression is the essence of culture because it alone makes a sufficiently clear appeal in a world which is itself the result of the innumerable interplay of complementary or dual laws and forces french culture is near to the real heart of things because it has a sort of quick sanity which never loses its way or when it does very rapidly recovers the middle of the road it has the two capital defects of its virtues it is too fond of forms and too mistrustful the french nature is sane and cynical well its natural the french lie just halfway between north and south their blood is too mingled for enthusiasm and their culture too old  i never realised how old france was till we went to arles in our crowded train poilus were packed standing in the corridors one very weary invited by a high and kindly colonel into our carriage chatted in his tired voice of how wonderfully the women kept the work going on the farms when we get a fortnights leave he said all goes well we can do the heavy things the women cannot and the land is made clean it wants that fortnight now and then mon colonel there is work on farms that women cannot do and the colonel vehemently nodded his thin face we alighted in the dark among southern forms and voices and the little hotel omnibus became enmeshed at once in old high very narrow italianseeming streets it was sunday next day sunny with a clear blue sky in the square before our hotel a simple crowd round the statue of mistral chattered or listened to a girl singing excruciating songs a crowd as oldlooking as in italy or spain aged as things only are in the south we walked up to the arena quite a recent development in the life of arles they say that marvellous roman building here cut down there built up by saracen hands for a thousand years or more before the romans came arles flourished and was civilised what had we mushroom islanders before the romans came what had barbaric prussia not even the romans to look forward to the agelong life of the south stands for much in modern france correcting the cruder blood which has poured in these last fifteen hundred years as one blends wine of very old stock with newer brands so has france been blended and mellowed a strange cosmic feeling one had on the top of the great building in that town older than rome itself of the continuity of human life and the futility of human conceit the provincial vanity of modern states looked pitiful in the clear air above that vast stony proof of age  in many ways the war has brought us up all standing on the edge of an abyss when it is over shall we go galloping over the edge or reining back sit awhile in our saddles looking for a better track we were all on the highway to a hell of material expansion and vulgarity of cheap immediate profit and momentary sensation north and south in our different ways all rattling into barbarity shall we find our way again into a finer air where selfrespect not profit rules and rare things and durable are made once more  from arles we journeyed to marseilles to see how the first cosmopolitan town in the world fared in wartime here was an amazing spectacle of swarming life if france has reason to feel the war most of all the great countries marseilles must surely feel it less than any other great town she flourishes in a perfect riot of movement and colour here all the tribes are met save those of central europefrenchman serb spaniard algerian greek arab khabyle russian indian italian englishman scotsman jew and nubian rub shoulders in the thronged streets the miles of docks are crammed with ships food of all sorts abounds in the bright dry light all is gay and busy the most æsthetic and perhaps most humiliating sight that a westerner could see we came on there two arab spahis walking down the main street in their long robe uniforms white and red and their white linen bonnets bound with a dark fur and canting slightly backwards over six feet high they moved unhurrying smoking their cigarettes turning their necks slowly from side to side like camels of the desert their brown thin bearded faces wore neither scorn nor interest only a superb selfcontainment but beside them every other specimen of the human race seemed cheap and negligible god knows of what they were thinkingas little probably as the smoke they blew through their chiselled nostrilsbut their beauty and grace were unsurpassable and visioning our western and northern towns and the little white worried abortions they breed one felt downcast and abashed  marseilles swarmed with soldiers lyon valence arles even the smallest cities swarmed with soldiers and this at the moment when the allied offensive was just beginning if france be nearing the end of her manpower as some assert she conceals it so that one would think she was at the beginning  from marseilles we went to lyon i have heard that town described as lamentably plain but compared with manchester or sheffield it is as heaven to hell between its two wide rolling rivers under a line of heights it has somewhat the aspect of an enormous commercialised florence perhaps in foggy weather it may be dreary but the sky was blue and the sun shone a huge foire was just opening and every street bustled in a dignified manner  the english have always had a vague idea that france is an immoral country to the eye of a mere visitor france is the most moral of the four great powersfrance russia england germany has the strongest family life and the most seemly streets young men and maidens are never seen walking or lying about halfembraced as in puritanical england fire is not played withopenly at least the slowfly amorousness of the british working classes evidently does not suit the quicker blood of france there is just enough of the south in the french to keep demonstration of affection away from daylight a certain school of french novelist with highcoloured tales of parisian life is responsible for his countrys reputation whatever the frenchman about town may be he seems by no means typical of the many millions of frenchmen who are not about town and if frenchwomen as i have heard frenchmen say are légères they are the best mothers in the world and their lightness is not vulgarly obtruded they say many domestic tragedies will be played at the conclusion of the war if so they will not be played in france alone and compared with the tragedies of fidelity played all these dreadful years they will be as black rabbits to brown for numbers for the truth on morality in france we must go back i suspect to that general conclusion about the french characterthe swift passage from head to heart and back again which prohibiting extremes of puritanism and of licence preserves a sort of balance  from this war france will emerge changed though less changed very likely than any other country a certain selfsufficiency that was very marked about french life will have sloughed away i expect an opening of the doors a toleration of other tastes and standards a softening of the too narrow definiteness of french opinion  even paris has opened her heart a little since the war and the heart of paris is close hard impatient of strangers we noticed in our hospital that whenever we had a parisian he introduced a different atmosphere and led us a quiet or noisy dance we had one whose name was aimé whose skin was like a babys who talked softly and fast with little grunts and before he left was quite the leading personality we had another a redhaired young one when he was away on leave we hardly knew the hospital it was so orderly the sons of paris are a breed apart just as our cockneys are i do not pretend to fathom them they have the texture and resilience of an indiarubber ball and the women of paris heaven forfend that i should say i know them they are a sealed book still even parisians are less intolerant than in prewar days of us dull english perceiving in us perhaps a certain unexpected usefulness and à propos one hears it said that in the regions of our british armies certain natives believe we have come to stay what an intensely comic notion and what a lurid light it throws on history on the mistrust engendered between nations on the cynicism which human conduct has forced deep into human hearts no if a british government could be imagined behaving in such a way the british population would leave england become french citizens and help to turn out the damned intruders  but we did not encounter anywhere that comic belief in all this land of france chockful of those odd creatures english men and women we found only a wonderful and touching welcome not once during those long months of winter was an unfriendly word spoken in our hearing not once were we treated with anything but true politeness and cordiality poilus and peasants porters and officials ladies doctors servants shopfolk were always considerate always friendly always desirous that we should feel at home the very dogs gave us welcome a little black halfpomeranian came uninvited and made his home with us in our hospital we called him aristide but on our walks with him we were liable to meet a posse of children who would exclaim pompom voilà pompom and lead him away before night fell he would be with us again with a bit of string or ribbon bitten through dangling from his collar his children bored him terribly we left him in trust to our poilus on that sad afternoon when goodbye must be said all those friendly hands shaken for the last time and the friendly faces left through the little town the car bore us away along the valley between the poplar trees with the first flush of spring on their twigs and the magpies flighting across the road to the riverbank  the heart of france is deep within her breast she wears it not upon her sleeve but france opened her heart for once and let us see the gold  and so we came forth from france of a rainy day leaving half our hearts behind us  1917     englishman and russian   it has been my conviction for many years that the russian and the englishman are as it were the complementary halves of a man what the russian lacks the englishman has what the englishman lacks that has the russian the works of gogol turgenev dostoievsky tolstoi tchekovthe amazing direct and truthful revelations of these mastershas let me i think into some secrets of the russian soul so that the russians i have met seem rather clearer to me than men and women of other foreign countries for their construing i have been given what schoolboys call a crib only a fool pretends to knowledgethe heart of another is surely a dark forest but the heart of a russian seems to me a forest less dark than many partly because the qualities and defects of a russian impact so sharply on the perceptions of an englishman but partly because those great russian novelists in whom i have delighted possess before all other gifts so deep a talent for the revelation of truth in following out this apposition of the russian and the englishman one may well start with that little matter of truth the englishman has what i would call a passion for the forms of truth his word is his bondnearly always he will not tell a lienot often honesty in his idiom is the best policy but he has little or no regard for the spirit of truth quite unconsciously he revels in selfdeception and flies from knowledge of anything which will injure his intention to make good as americans say he is before all things a competitive soul who seeks to win rather than to understand or to live and to win or shall we say to maintain to oneself the illusion of winning one must carefully avoid seeing too much the russian is light hearted about the forms of truth but revels in selfknowledge and frank selfdeclaration enjoys unbottoming the abysses of his thoughts and feelings however gloomy in russia time and space have no exact importance living counts for more than dominating life emotion is not castrated feelings are openly indulged in in russia there are the extremes of cynicism and of faith of intellectual subtlety and simplicity truth has quite another significance manners are different what we know as good form is a meaningless shibboleth the russian rushes at life drinks the cup to the dregs then frankly admits that it has dregs and puts up with the disillusionment the englishman holds the cup gingerly and sips determined to make it last his time not to disturb the dregs and to die without having reached the bottom  these are the two poles of that instinctive intention to get out of life all there is in itwhich is ever the unconscious philosophy guiding mankind to the russian it is vital to realise at all costs the fulness of sensation and reach the limits of comprehension to the englishman it is vital to preserve illusion and go on defeating death until death so unexpectedly defeats him  what this wide distinction comes from i know not unless from the difference of our climates and geographical circumstances russians are the children of vast plains and forests dry air and extremes of heat and cold the english of the sea small uneven hedgerowed landscapes mist and mean temperatures by an ironical paradox we english have achieved a real liberty of speech and action even now denied to russians who naturally far surpass us in desire to turn things inside out and see of what they are made the political arrangements of a country are based on temperament and a political freedom which suits us an old people predisposed to a practical and cautious view of life is proving difficult if not impossible for russians a young people who spend themselves so freely but what russia will become politically speaking he would be rash who prophesied  i suppose what russians most notice and perhaps envy in us is practical common sense our acquired instinct for what is attainable and for the best and least elaborate means of attaining it what we ought to envy in russians is a sort of unworldlinessnot the feeling that this world is the preliminary of another nothing so commercial but the natural disposition to live each moment without afterthought emotionally lack of emotional abandonment is our great deficiency whether we can ever learn to have more is very doubtful but our imaginative writings at all events have of late been profoundly modified by the russian novel that current in literature far more potent than any of those traced out in georg brandes monumental study russian writers have brought to imaginative literature a directness in the presentation of vision a lack of selfconsciousness strange to all western countries and particularly strange to us english who of all people are the most selfconscious this quality of russian writers is evidently racial for even in the most artful of themturgenevit is as apparent as in the least sophisticated it is part no doubt of their natural power of flinging themselves deep into the sea of experience and sensation of their selfforgetfulness in a passionate search for truth  in such living russian writers as i have read in kuprin gorky and others i still see and welcome this peculiar quality of rendering life throughbut not veiled bythe authors temperament so that the effect is almost as if no ink were used when one says that the russian novel has already profoundly modified our literature one does not mean that we have now nearly triumphed over the need for ink or that our temperaments have become russian but that some of us have become infected with the wish to see and record the truth and obliterate that competitive moralising which from time immemorial has been the characteristic bane of english art in other words the russian passion for understanding has tempered a little the english passion for winning what we admire and look for in russian literature is its truth and its profound and comprehending tolerance i am credibly informed that what russians admire and look for in our literature is its quality of no nonsense and its assertive vigour in a word they are attracted by that in it which is new to them i venture to hope that they will not become infected by us in this matter that nothing will dim in their writers spiritual and intellectual honesty of vision or tinge them with selfconsciousness it is still for us to borrow from russian literary art and learn if we can to sink ourselves in life and reproduce it without obtrusion of our points of view except in that subtle way which gives to each creative work its essential individuality our boisterousness in art is too selfconscious to be real and our restraint is only a superficial legacy from puritanism  restraint in life and conduct is another matter altogether there russians can learn from us who are pastmasters in control of our feelings in all matters of conduct indeed we are as it were much older than the russians we were more like them one imagines in the days of elizabeth  either similarity or great dissimilarity is generally needful for mutual liking our soldiers appear to get on very well with russians but only exceptional natures in either country could expect to understand each other thoroughly the two peoples are as the halves of a whole different as chalk from cheese can supplement intermingle but never replace each other both in so different ways are very vital types of mankind very deep sunk in their own atmospheres and natures very insulated against all that is not russian or is not english deeply unchangeable and impermeable it is almost impossible to deanglicise an englishman as difficult to derussianise a russian  1916     american and briton   on the mutual understanding of each other by britons and americans the future happiness of nations depends more than on any other world cause  i have never held a wholehearted brief for the british character there is a lot of good in it but much which is repellent it has a kind of deliberate unattractiveness setting out on its journey with the words take me or leave me one may respect a person of this sort but it is difficult either to know or to like him i am told that an american officer said recently to a british staff officer in a friendly voice so were going to clean up brother boche together and the british staff officer replied really no wonder americans sometimes say ive got no use for those fellows  the world is consecrate to strangeness and discovery and the attitude of mind concreted in that really seems unforgivable till one remembers that it is manner rather than matter which divides the hearts of american and briton  in a huge still halfdeveloped country where every kind of national type and habit comes to run a new thread into the rich tapestry of american life and thought people must find it almost impossible to conceive the life of a little old island where traditions persist generation after generation without anything to break them up where blood remains undoctored by new strains demeanour becomes crystallised for lack of contrasts and manner gets set like a plaster mask the english manner of today of what are called the classes is the growth of only a century or so there was probably nothing at all like it in the days of elizabeth or even of charles ii the english manner was still racy when the inhabitants of virginia as we are told sent over to ask that there might be despatched to them some hierarchical assistance for the good of their souls and were answered dn your souls grow tobacco the english manner of today could not even have come into its own when that epitaph of a lady quoted somewhere by gilbert murray was written bland passionate and deeply religious she was second cousin to the earl of leitrim of such are the kingdom of heaven about that gravestone motto was a certain lack of the selfconsciousness which is now the foremost characteristic of the english manner  but this british selfconsciousness is no mere fluffy gaucherie it is our special form of what germans would call kultur behind every manifestation of thought or emotion the briton retains control of self and is thinking thats all ill let them see even thats all ill let myself feel this stoicism is good in its refusal to be foundered bad in that it fosters a narrow outlook starves emotion spontaneity and frank sympathy destroys grace and what one may describe roughly as the lovable side of personality the english hardly ever say just what comes into their heads what we call good form the unwritten law which governs certain classes of the briton savours of the dull and glacial but there lurks within it a core of virtue it has grown up like callous shell round two fine idealssuppression of the ego lest it trample on the corns of other people and exaltation of the maxim deeds before words good form like any other religion starts well with some ethical truth but soon gets commonised and petrified till we can hardly trace its origin and watch with surprise its denial and contradiction of the root idea  without doubt good form had become a kind of disease in england a french friend told me how he witnessed in a swiss hotel the meeting between an englishwoman and her son whom she had not seen for two years she was greatly affectedby the fact that he had not brought a dinnerjacket the best manners are no manners or at all events no mannerisms but many britons who have even attained to this perfect purity are yet not free from the paralytic effects of good form are still selfconscious in the depths of their souls and never do or say a thing without trying not to show what they are feeling all this guarantees a certain decency in life but in intimate intercourse with people of other nations who have not this particular cult of suppression we english disappoint and jar and often irritate nations have their differing forms of snobbery at one time the english all wanted to be second cousins to the earl of leitrim like that lady bland and passionate nowadays it is not so simple the earl of leitrim has become etherealised we no longer care how a fellow is born so long as he behaves as the earl of leitrim would have never makes himself conspicuous or ridiculous never shows too much what hes really feeling never talks of what hes going to do and always plays the game the cult is centred in our public schools and universities  at a very typical and honoured old public school the writer of this essay passed on the whole a happy time but what a curious life educationally speaking we lived rather like young spartans and were not encouraged to think imagine or see anything that we learned in relation to life at large its very difficult to teach boys because their chief object in life is not to be taught anything but i should say we were crammed not taught at all living as we did the herdlife of boys with little or no intrusion from our elders and they men who had been brought up in the same way as ourselves we were debarred from any real interest in philosophy history art literature and music or any advancing notions in social life or politics i speak of the generality not of the few black swans among us we were reactionaries almost to a boy i remember one summer term gladstone came down to speak to us and we repaired to the speech room with white collars and dark hearts muttering what we would do to that grand old man if we could have our way but he contrived to charm us after all till we cheered him vociferously in that queer life we had all sorts of unwritten rules of suppression you must turn up your trousers must not go out with your umbrella rolled your hat must be worn tilted forward you must not walk more than twoabreast till you reached a certain form nor be enthusiastic about anything except such a supreme matter as a drive over the pavilion at cricket or a run the whole length of the ground at football you must not talk about yourself or your home people and for any punishment you must assume complete indifference  i dwell on these trivialities because every year thousands of british boys enter these mills which grind exceeding small and because these boys constitute in after life the great majority of the official military academic professional and a considerable proportion of the business classes of great britain they become the englishmen who say really and they are for the most part the englishmen who travel and reach america the great defence i have always heard put up for our public schools is that they form character as oatmeal is supposed to form bone in the bodies of scotsmen so our public schools are supposed to form good sound moral fibre in british boys and there is much in this plea the life does make boys enduring selfreliant goodtempered and honourable but it most carefully endeavours to destroy all original sin of individuality spontaneity and engaging freakishness it implants moreover in the great majority of those who have lived it the mental attitude of that swell who when asked where he went for his hats replied blanks of course is there another fellows  to know all is to excuse allto know all about the bringingup of english public school boys makes one excuse much the atmosphere and tradition of those places is extraordinarily strong and persists through all modern changes thirtyseven years have gone since i was a new boy but crossexamining a young nephew who left not long ago i found almost precisely the same features and conditions the war which has changed so much of our social life will have some but no very great effect on this particular institution the boys still go there from the same kind of homes and preparatory schools and come under the same kind of masters and the traditional unemotionalism the cult of a dry and narrow stoicism is rather fortified than diminished by the times we live in  our universities on the other hand are now mere ghosts of their old selves at a certain old college in oxford last term they had only two english students in the chapel under the joshua reynolds window through which the sun was shining hung a long roll of honour a hundred names and more in the college garden an openair hospital was ranged under the old city wall where we used to climb and go wandering in the early summer mornings after some allnight spree down on the river the empty college barges lay void of life from the top of one of them an aged custodian broke into words ah oxfordll never be the same again in my time why whos to teach em rowin when we do get undergrads again whos to teach em all the old ones gone killed wounded and that no rowinll never be the same againnot in my time that was the tragedy of the war for him our universities will recover faster than he thinks and resume the care of our particular kultur and cap the products of our public schools with the oxford accent and the oxford manner  an acute critic tells me that americans reading such deprecatory words as these by an englishman about his countrys institutions would say that this is precisely an instance of what an american means by the oxford manner americans whose attitude towards their own country is that of a lover to his lady or a child to its mother cannothe saysunderstand how englishmen can be critical of their own country and yet love her well the englishmans attitude to his country is that of a man to himself and the way he runs her down is but a part of that special english bonedeep selfconsciousness englishmen the writer amongst them love their country as much as the french love france and the americans america but she is so much a part of them that to speak well of her is like speaking well of themselves which they have been brought up to regard as bad form when americans hear englishmen speaking critically of their own country let them note it for a sign of complete identification with that country rather than of detachment from it but on the whole it must be admitted that english universities have a broadening influence on the material which comes to them so set and narrow they do a little to discover for their children that there are many points of view and much which needs an open mind in this world they have not precisely a democratic influence but taken by themselves they would not be inimical to democracy and when the war is over they will surely be still broader in philosophy and teaching heaven forbid that we should see vanish all that is old and has as it were the virginiacreeper the wistaria bloom of age upon it there is a beauty in age and a health in tradition ill dispensed with what is hateful in age is its lack of understanding and of sympathy in a wordits intolerance let us hope this wind of change may sweep out and sweeten the old places of our country sweep away the cobwebs and the dust our narrow ways of thought our mannikinisms but those who hate intolerance dare not be intolerant with the foibles of age we should rather see them as comic and gently laugh them out i pretend to no proper knowledge of the american people but though amongst them there are doubtless pockets of fierce prejudice i have on the whole the impression of a wide and tolerant spirit to that spirit one would appeal when it comes to passing judgment on the educated briton he may be selfsufficient but he has grit and at bottom grit is what americans appreciate more than anything if the motto of the old oxford college manners makyth man were true one would often be sorry for the briton but his manners do not make him they mar him his goods are all absent from the shop window he is not a man of the world in the wider meaning of that expression and there is of course a particularly noxious type of travelling briton who does his best unconsciously to deflower his country wherever he goes selfish coarsefibred loudvoicedthe sort which thanks god he is a britoni suppose because nobody else will do it for him  we live in times when patriotism is exalted above all other virtues because there happen to lie before the patriotic tremendous chances for the display of courage and selfsacrifice patriotism ever has that advantage as the world is now constituted but patriotism and provincialism are sisters under the skin and they who can only see bloom on the plumage of their own kind who prefer the bad points of their countrymen to the good points of foreigners merely write themselves down blind of an eye and panderers to herd feeling america is advantaged in this matter she lives so far away from other nations that she might well be excused for thinking herself the only people in the world but in the many strains of blood which go to make up america there is as yet a natural corrective to the narrower kind of patriotism america has vast spaces and many varieties of type and climate and life to her is still a great adventure americans have their own form of selfabsorption but seem free as yet from the special competitive selfcentrement which has been forced on britons through long centuries by countless continental rivalries and wars insularity was driven into the very bones of our people by the generationlong wars of napoleon a distinguished french writer andré chevrillon whose bookb may be commended to any one who wishes to understand british peculiarities used these words in a recent letter you english are so strange to us french you are so utterly different from any other people in the world yes we are a lonely race deep in our hearts i think we feel that only the american people could ever really understand us and being extraordinarily selfconscious perverse and proud we do our best to hide from americans that we have any such feeling it would distress the average briton to confess that he wanted to be understood had anything so natural as a craving for fellowship or for being liked we are a weird people though we seem so commonplace in looking at photographs of british types among photographs of other european nationalities one is struck by something which is in no other of those racesexactly as if we had an extra skin as if the british animal had been tamed longer than the rest and so he has his political social legal life was fixed long before that of any other western country he was old though not mouldering before the mayflower touched american shores and brought there avatars grave and civilised as ever founded nation there is something touching and terrifying about our character about the depth at which it keeps its real yearnings about the perversity with which it disguises them and its inability to show its feelings we are deep down under all our lazy mentality the most combative and competitive race in the world with the exception perhaps of the american this is at once a spiritual link with america and yet one of the great barriers to friendship between the two peoples we are not sure whether we are better men than americans whether we are really better than french germans russians italians chinese or any other race is of course more than a question but those peoples are all so different from us that we are bound i suppose secretly to consider ourselves superior but between americans and ourselves under all differences there is some mysterious deep kinship which causes us to doubt and makes us irritable as if we were continually being tickled by that question now am i really a better man than he exactly what proportion of american blood at this time of day is british i know not but enough to make us definitely cousinsalways an awkward relationship we see in americans a sort of image of ourselves feel near enough yet far enough to criticise and carp at the points of difference it is as though a man went out and encountered in the street what he thought for the moment was himself and wounded in his amour propre instantly began to disparage the appearance of that fellow probably community of language rather than of blood accounts for our sense of kinship for a common means of expression cannot but mould thought and feeling into some kind of unity one can hardly overrate the intimacy which a common literature brings the lives of great americans washington and franklin lincoln and lee and grant are unsealed for us just as to americans are the lives of marlborough and nelson pitt and gladstone and gordon longfellow and whittier and whitman can be read by the british child as simply as burns and shelley and keats emerson and william james are no more difficult to us than darwin and spencer to americans without an effort we rejoice in hawthorne and mark twain henry james and howells as americans can in dickens and thackeray meredith and thomas hardy and more than all americans own with ourselves all literature in the english tongue before the mayflower sailed chaucer and spenser and shakespeare raleigh ben jonson and the authors of the english bible version are their spiritual ancestors as much as ever they are ours the tie of language is allpowerfulfor language is the food formative of minds a volume could be written on the formation of character by literary humour alone the american and briton especially the british townsman have a kind of bonedeep defiance of fate a readiness for anything which may turn up a dry wry smile under the blackest sky and an individual way of looking at things which nothing can shake americans and britons both we must and will think for ourselves and know why we do a thing before we do it we have that ingrained respect for the individual conscience which is at the bottom of all free institutions some years before the war an intelligent and cultivated austrian who had lived long in england was asked for his opinion of the british in many ways he said i think you are inferior to us but one great thing i have noticed about you which we have not you think and act and speak for yourselves if he had passed those years in america instead of in england he must needs have pronounced the same judgment of americans free speech of course like every form of freedom goes in danger of its life in wartime the other day in russia an englishman came on a street meeting shortly after the first revolution had begun an extremist was addressing the gathering and telling them that they were fools to go on fighting that they ought to refuse and go home and so forth the crowd grew angry and some soldiers were for making a rush at him but the chairman a big burly peasant stopped them with these words brothers you know that our country is now a country of free speech we must listen to this man we must let him say anything he will but brothers when hes finished well bash his head in  i cannot assert that either britons or americans are incapable in times like these of a similar interpretation of free speech things have been done in our country and will be done in america which should make us blush but so strong is the free instinct in both countries that some vestiges of it will survive even this war for democracy is a sham unless it means the preservation and development of this instinct of thinking for oneself throughout a people government of the people by the people for the people means nothing unless individuals keep their consciences unfettered and think freely accustom people to be noseled and spoonfed and democracy is a mere pretence the measure of democracy is the measure of the freedom and sense of individual responsibility in its humblest citizens and democracyi say it with solemnityhas yet to prove itself  a scientist dr spurrell in a recent book man and his forerunners diagnoses the growth of civilisations somewhat as follows a civilisation begins with the enslavement by some hardy race of a tame race living a tame life in more congenial natural surroundings it is built up on slavery and attains its maximum vitality in conditions little removed therefrom then as individual freedom gradually grows disorganisation sets in and the civilisation slowly dissolves away in anarchy dr spurrell does not dogmatise about our present civilisation but suggests that it will probably follow the civilisations of the past into dissolution i am not convinced of that because of certain factors new to the history of man recent discoveries are unifying the world such old isolated swoops of race on race are not now possible in our great industrial states it is true a new form of slavery has arisen but not of man by man rather of man by machines moreover all past civilisations have been more or less southern and subject to the sapping influence of the sun modern civilisation is essentially northern the individualism however which according to dr spurrell dissolved the empires of the past exists already in a marked degree in every modern state and the problem before us is to discover how democracy and liberty of the subject can be made into enduring props rather than dissolvents it is the problem of making democracy genuine and certainly if that cannot be achieved and perpetuated there is nothing to prevent democracy drifting into anarchism and dissolving modern states till they are the prey of pouncing dictators or of states not so far gone in dissolution what for instance will happen to russia if she does not succeed in making her democracy genuine a russia which remains anarchic must very quickly become the prey of her neighbours on west and east  ever since the substantial introduction of democracy nearly a century and a half ago with the american war of independence western civilisation has been living on two planes or levelsthe autocratic plane with which is bound up the idea of nationalism and the democratic to which has become conjoined the idea of internationalism not only little wars but great wars such as this come because of inequality in growth dissimilarity of political institutions between states because this state or that is basing its life on different principles from its neighbours the decentralisation delays critical temper and importance of home affairs prevalent in democratic countries make them at once slower weaker less apt to strike and less prepared to strike than countries where bureaucratic brains subject to no real popular check devise world policies which can be thrust prepared to the last button on the world at a moments notice the free and critical spirit in america france and britain has kept our democracies comparatively unprepared for anything save their own affairs  we fall into glib usage of words like democracy and make fetiches of them without due understanding democracy is inferior to autocracy from the aggressively national point of view it is not necessarily superior to autocracy as a guarantee of general wellbeing it may even turn out to be inferior unless we can improve it but democracy is the rising tide it may be dammed or delayed but cannot be stopped it seems to be a law in human nature that where in any corporate society the idea of selfgovernment sets foot it refuses to take that foot up again state after state copying the american example has adopted the democratic principle the worlds face is that way set and civilisation is now so of a pattern that the western world may be looked on as one state and the process of change therein from autocracy to democracy regarded as though it were taking place in a single oldtime country such as greece or rome if throughout western civilisation we can secure the single democratic principle of government its single level of state morality in thought and action we shall be well on our way to unanimity throughout the world for even in china and japan the democratic virus is at work it is my belief that only in a world thus uniform and freed from the danger of pounce by autocracies have states any chance to develop the individual conscience to a point which shall make democracy proof against anarchy and themselves proof against dissolution and only in such a world can a league of nations to enforce peace succeed  but even if we do secure a single plane for western civilisation and ultimately for the world there will be but slow and difficult progress in the lot of mankind and unless we secure it there will be only a march backwards  for this advance to a uniform civilisation the solidarity of the englishspeaking races is vital without that there will be no bottom on which to build  the ancestors of the american people sought a new country because they had in them a reverence for the individual conscience they came from britain the first large state in the christian era to build up the idea of political freedom the instincts and ideals of our two races have ever been the same that great and lovable people the french with their clear thought and expression and their quick blood have expressed those ideals more vividly than either of us but the phlegmatic and the dry tenacity of our english and american temperaments has ever made our countries the most settled and safe homes of the individual conscience and of its childrendemocracy freedom and internationalism whatever their faultsand their offences cry aloud to such poor heaven as remains of chivalry and mercythe germans are in many ways a great race but they possess two qualities dangerous to the individual conscienceunquestioning obedience and exaltation when they embrace the democratic idea they may surpass us all in its logical development but the individual conscience will still not be at ease with them we must look to our two countries to guarantee its strength and activity and if we englishspeaking races quarrel and become disunited civilisation will split up again and go its way to ruin we are the ballast of the new order  i do not believe in formal alliances or in grouping nations to exclude and keep down other nations friendships between countries should have the only true reality of common sentiment and be animated by desire for the general welfare of mankind we need no formal bonds but we have a sacred charge in common to let no petty matters differences of manner or divergencies of material interest destroy our spiritual agreement our pasts our geographical positions our temperaments make us beyond all other races the hope and trustees of mankinds advance along the only line now opendemocratic internationalism it is childish to claim for americans or britons virtues beyond those of other nations or to believe in the superiority of one national culture to another they are different that is all it is by accident that we find ourselves in this position of guardianship to the main line of human development no need to pat ourselves on the back about it but we are at a great and critical moment in the worlds historyhow critical none of us alive will ever realise the civilisation slowly built since the fall of rome has either to break up and dissolve into jagged and isolated fragments through a century of wars or unified and reanimated by a single idea to move forward on one plane and attain greater height and breadth  under the pressure of this war there is beneath the lipservice we pay to democracy a disposition to lose faith in it because of its undoubted weakness and inconvenience in a struggle with states autocratically governed there is even a sort of secret reaction to autocracy on those lines there is no way out of a future of bitter rivalries chicanery and wars and the probable total failure of our civilisation the only cure which i can see lies in democratising the whole world and removing the present weaknesses and shams of democracy by education of the individual conscience in every country goodbye to that chance if americans and britons fall foul of each other refuse to pool their thoughts and hopes and to keep the general welfare of mankind in view they have got to stand together not in aggressive and jealous policies but in defence and championship of the selfhelpful selfgoverning live and let live philosophy of life  the house of the future is always dark there are few cornerstones to be discerned in the temple of our fate but of these few one is the brotherhood and bond of the englishspeaking races not for narrow purposes but that mankind may yet see faith and goodwill enshrined yet breathe a sweeter air and know a life where beauty passes with the sun on her wings  we want in the lives of men a song of honour as in ralph hodgsons poem      the song of men all sorts and kinds     as many tempers moods and minds       as leaves are on a tree     as many faiths and castes and creeds     as many human bloods and breeds       as in the world may be  in the making of that song the englishspeaking races will assuredly unite what made this world we know not the principle of life is inscrutable and will for ever be but we know that earth is yet on the upgrade of existence the mountaintop of mans life not reached that many centuries of growth are yet in front of us before nature begins to chill this planet till it swims at last another moon in space in the climb to that mountaintop of a happy life for mankind our two great nations are as guides who go before roped together in perilous ascent on their nerve loyalty and wisdom the adventure now hangs what american or british knife will sever the rope  he who ever gives a thought to the life of man at large to his miseries and disappointments to the waste and cruelty of existence will remember that if american or briton fail himself or fail the other there can but be for us both and for all other peoples a hideous slip a swift and fearful fall into an abyss whence all shall be to begin over again  we shall not failneither ourselves nor each other our comradeship will endure  1917  b england and the war hodder  stoughton     angloamerican drama and its futurec   there is a maxim particularly suitable to those who follow any art dont talk about what you do and yet once in a way one must clear the mind and put into words what lies at the back of endeavour  what then is lying at the back of any growth or development there may have been of late in drama  in my belief simply an outcrop of sincerityof fidelity to mood to impression to self a man here and there has turned up who has imagined something true to what he has really seen and felt and has projected it across the footlights in such a way as to make other people feel it this is all that has happened lately on our stage and if it be growth it will not be growth in quantity since there is nothing like sincerity for closing the doors of theatres for just consider what sincerity excludes all care for balance at the authors bankeven when there is no balance all habit of consulting the expression on the publics face all confectioning of french plays all the convenient practice of adding up your plots on the principle that two and two make five these it excludes it includes nothing because it pays nothing because it will make a sensation no situations faked no characters falsified no fireworks only something imagined and put down in a passion of sincerity what plays you may say are left well that was the development in our drama before this war began the war arrested it as it arrested every movement of the day in civil life but whether in war or peace the principles which underlie art remain the same and are always worth consideration  sincerity in the theatre and commercial success are not necessarily but they are generally opposed it is more or less a happy accident when they coincide this grim truth cannot be blinked not till the heavens fall will the majority of the public demand sincerity and all that they who care for sincerity can hope for is that the supply of sincere drama will gradually increase the demand for itgradually lessen the majority which has no use for that disturbing quality the burden of this struggle is on the shoulders of the dramatists it is useless and unworthy for them to complain that the public will not stand sincerity that they cannot get sincere plays acted and so forth if they have not the backbone to produce what they feel they ought to produce without regard to what the public wants then goodbye to progress of any kind if they are of the crew who cannot see any good in a fight unless they know it is going to end in victory if they expect the millennium with every springthey will advance nothing their job is to set their teeth do their work in their own way without thinking much about result and not at all about reward except from their own consciences those who want sincerity will always be the few but they may well be more numerous than now and to increase their number is worth a struggle that struggle was the muchsneeredat muchtalkedof socalled new movement in our british drama  now it was the fashion to dub this new drama the serious drama the label was unfortunate and not particularly true if rabelais or robert burns appeared again in mortal form and took to writing plays they would be new dramatists with a vengeanceas new as ever ibsen was and assuredly they would be sincere but could they well be called serious can we call synge or st john hankin or shaw or barrie serious hardly yet they are all of this new movement in their very different ways because they are sincere the word serious in fact has too narrow a significance and admits a deal of pompous stuff which is not sincere while the word sincere certainly does not characterise all that is popularly included under the term new drama it as certainly does characterise if taken in its true sense of fidelity to self all that is really new in it and excludes no mood no temperament no form of expression which can pass the test of ringing true look for example at the work of those two whom we could so ill sparesynge and st john hankin they were as far apart as dramatists well could be except that each had found a special mediumthe one a kind of lyric satire the other a neat individual sort of comedywhich seemed exactly to express his spirit both forms were in a sense artificial but both were quite sincere for through them each of these two dramatists so utterly dissimilar shaped forth the essence of his broodings and visions of life with all their flavour and individual limitations and that is all one means byall one asks ofsincerity  then why make such a fuss about it  because it is rare and an implicit quality of any true work of art realistic or romantic  art is not art unless it is made out of an artists genuine feeling and vision not out of what he has been told he ought to feel and see for art exists not to confirm people in their tastes and prejudices not to show them what they have seen before but to present them with a new vision of life and if drama be an art which the great public denies daily but a few of us still believe it must reasonably be expected to present life as each dramatist sees it and not to express things because they pander to popular prejudice or are sensational or because they pay  if you want further evidence that the new dramatic movement is marked out by its struggle for sincerity and by that alone examine a little the various halfovert oppositions with which it meets  why is the commercial manager against it  because it is quite naturally his business to cater for the great public and as before said the majority of the public does not never will want sincerity it is too disturbing the commercial manager will answer the great public does not dislike sincerity it only dislikes dullness well dullness is not an absolute but a very relative terma term likely to have a different meaning for a man who knows something about life and art from that which it has for a man who knows less and one may remark that if the great publics standard of what is really amusing is the true one it is queer that the plays which tickle the great public hardly ever last a decade while the plays which do not tickle them occasionally last for centuries the dullest plays one might say roughly are those which last the longest witness euripides  why are so many actormanagers against the new drama  because their hearts are quite naturally set on such insincere distortions of values as are necessary to a constant succession of big parts for themselves sincerity does not necessarily exclude heroic characters but it does exclude those mock heroics which actormanagers have been known to prefernot to real heroics perhaps but to simple and sound studies of character  why is the censorship against it  because censorship is quite naturally the guardian of the ordinary prejudices of sentiment and taste and quaintly innocent of knowledge that in any art fidelity of treatment is essential to a theme indeed i am sure that this peculiar office would regard it as fantastic for a poor devil of an artist to want to be faithful or sincere the demand would appear pedantic and extravagant  some say that the critics are against the new drama that is not in the main true the inclination of most critics is to welcome anything with a flavour of its own it would be odd indeed if it were not sothey get so much of the other food they are in general friends to sincerity but the trouble with the critic is rather the fixed idea he has to print his opinion of an authors work while other men have only to think it and when it comes to receiving a fresh impression of the same author his already recorded words are liable to act on him rather as the eyes of a snake act on a rabbit indeed it must be very awkward when you have definitely labelled an author this or that to find from his next piece of work that he is the other as well the critic who can make blank his soul of all that he has said before may indeed existin paradise  why is the greater public against the new drama  by the greater public i in no sense mean the public who dont keep motor carsthe greater public comes from the westend as much as ever it comes from the eastend its opposition to the new drama is neither covert doubtful nor conscious of itself the greater public is like an aged friend of mine who if you put into his hands anything but sherlock holmes or the waverley novels says oh that dreadful book his taste is excellent only he does feel that an operation should be performed on all dramatists and novelists by which they should be rendered incapable of producing anything but what my aged friend is used to the greater public in fact is either a too welldined organism which wishes to digest its dinner or a too hardworked organism longing for a pleasant dream i sympathise with the greater public  a friend once said to me champagne has killed the drama it was half a truth champagne is an excellent thing and must not be disturbed plays should not have anything in them which can excite the mind they should be of a quality to just remove the fumes by eleven oclock and make ready the organism for those suppers which were eaten before the war another friend once said to me it is the rush and hurry and strenuousness of modern life which is scotching the drama again it was half a truth why should not the hardworked man have his pleasant dream his detective story his good laugh the pity is that sincere drama would often provide as agreeable dreams for the hardworked man as some of those reveries in which he now indulges if only he would try it once or twice that is the troubleto get him to give it a chance  the greater public will by preference take the lowest article in art offered to it an awkward remark and unfortunately true but if a better article be substituted the greater public very soon enjoys it every bit as much as the article replaced and so onup to a point which we need not fear we shall ever reach not that sincere dramatists are consciously trying to supply the public with a better article a man could not write anything sincere with the elevation of the public as incentive if he tried he would be as lost as ever were the pharisees making broad their phylacteries he can only express himself sincerely by not considering the public at all people often say that this is cant but it really isnt there does exist a type of mind which cannot express itself in accordance with what it imagines is required can only express itself for itself and take the usually unpleasant consequences this is indeed but an elementary truth which since the beginning of the world has lain at the bottom of all real artistic achievement it is not cant to say that the only things vital in drama as in every art are achieved when the maker has fixed his soul on the making of a thing which shall seem fine to himself it is the only standard all the otherssuccess money even the pleasure and benefit of other peoplelead to confusion in the artists spirit and to the making of dust castles to please your best self is the only way of being sincere most weavers of drama of course are perfectly sincere when they start out to ply their shuttles but how many persevere in that mood to the end of their plays in defiance of outside consideration heresays one to himselfit will be too strong meat there it will not be sufficiently convincing this natural length will be too short that end too appalling in such and such a shape i shall never get my play taken i must write that part up and tone this character down and when it is all done effectively falselywhat is there a prodigious run perhaps butthe grave of all which makes the life of an artist worth the living well well we who believe this will never get too many others to believe it those heavens will not fall theatre doors will remain open the heavy diners will digest and the overdriven man will dream and yet with each sincere thing madeeven if only fit for reposing within a drawerits maker is stronger and will some day perhaps make that which need not lie covered away but reach out from him to other men  it is a wide wordsincerity a midsummer nights dream is no less sincere than hamlet the mikado as faithful to its mood of satiric frolicking as ibsens ghosts to its mood of moral horror sincerity bars out no themes it only demands that the dramatists moods and visions should be intense enough to keep him absorbed that he should have something to say so engrossing to himself that he has no need to stray here and there and gather purple plums to eke out what was intended to be an apple tart here is the heart of the matter you cannot get sincere drama out of those who do not see and feel with sufficient fervour and you cannot get good sincere drama out of those who will not hoe their rows to the very end there is no faking and no scamping to the good in art you may turn out the machinemade article very natty but for the real handmade thing you must have toiled in the sweat of your brow in britain it is a little difficult to persuade people that the writing of plays and novels is work to many it remains one of those inventions of a certain potentate for idle hands to do to some persons in high life and addicted to field sports it is still a species of licensed buffoonery to be regulated by a sort of circusmaster with a whip in one hand and a gingerbread nut in the other by the truly simple soul it is thus summed up work why e sits writin all day to some both green and young it shines as a vocation entirely glorious and exhilarating if one may humbly believe the evidence of his own senses it is not any of these but a patient calling glamorous now and then but with fifty minutes of hard labour and yearning to every ten of satisfaction not a pursuit maybe which one would change but then what man with a profession flies to others that he knows not of  novelists it is true even if they have not been taken too seriously by the people of these islands have for a long time past respected themselves but the calling of a dramatist till quite of late has been but an invertebrate and spiritless concern pruned and prismed by the censor exploited by the actor dragooned and slashed by the manager ignored by the public who never even bothered to inquire the names of those who supplied it with digestivesit was a slaves job thanks to a little sincerity it is not now a slaves job and will not again i think become one  from time to time in that vehicle of improvisation that modern fairy taleour daily paperwe read words such as these what has become of the boasted renascence of our stage or so much for all the trumpeting about the new drama when we come across such words we remember that it is only natural for journals to say today the opposite of what they said yesterday for they have to suit all tastes and preserve a decent equilibrium  there is a new safeguard of the selfrespecting dramatist which no amount of improvising for or against will explain away plays are now not merely acted they are published and read and will be read more and more this does not mean as some say that they are being written for the studythey were never being written more deliberately more carefully for the stage it does mean that they are tending more and more to comply with fidelity to theme fidelity to self and therefore are more and more able to bear the scrutiny of cold daylight and for the first time perhaps since the days of shakespeare there are dramatists in this country not a few faithful to themselves  now all this is not merely fortuitous for however abhorrent such a notion may be to those yet wedded to victorian ideals we were even before the war undoubtedly passing through great changes in our philosophy of life just as a plant keeps on conforming to its environment so our beliefs and ideals are conforming to our new social conditions and discoveries there is in the air a revolt against prejudice and a feeling that things must be retested the spirit which dwelling in pleasant places would never retest anything is now looked on askance even on our stage we are not enamoured of it it is not the artists business be he dramatist or other to preach admitted his business is to portray but portray truly he cannot if he has any of that glib doctrinaire spirit devoid of the insight which comes from instinctive sympathy he must look at life not at a mirage of life compounded of authority tradition comfort habit the sincere artist by the very nature of him is bound to be curious and perceptive with an instinctive craving to identify himself with the experience of others this is his value whether he express it in comedy epic satire or tragedy sincerity distrusts tradition authority comfort habit cannot breathe the air of prejudice and cannot stand the cruelties which arise from it so it comes about that the new dramas spirit is essentially inevitably human andhumane essentially distasteful to many professing followers of the great humanitarian who if they were but sincere would see that they secretly abhor his teachings and in practice continually invert them  it is a fine age we live inthis age of a developing social conscience and worthy of a fine and great art but though no art is fine unless it has sincerity no amount of sincere intention will serve unless the expression of it be wellnigh perfect an author is judged not by intention but by achievement and criticism is innately inclined to remark first on the peccadillo points of a person a poem or a play if there be a scar on the forehead a few false quantities or weak endings if there is an absence in the third act of some one who appeared in the firstit is always much simpler to complain of this than to feel or describe the essence of the whole but this very pettiness in our criticism is fortunately a sort of safeguard the french writer buffon said bien écrire cest tout car bien écrire cest bien sentir bien penser et bien dire  let the artist then by all means make his work impeccable clothe his ideas feelings visions in just such garments as can withstand the winds of criticism he himself must be his cruellest critic before cutting his cloth let him very carefully determine the precise thickness shape and colour best suited to the condition of his temperature for there are still playwrights who working in the full blast of an affaire between a poet and the wife of a stockbroker will murmur to themselves now for a little lyricism and drop into it or when the strong silent stockbroker has brought his wife once more to heel now for the moral and gives it us or when things are getting a little too intense now for humour and variety and bring in the curate this kind of tartan kilt is very pleasant on its native heath of london buthardly the garment of good writing good writing is only the perfect clothing of moodthe just right form shakespeares form you will say was extraordinarily loose wide plastic but then his spirit was ever changing its mooda true chameleon and as to the form of mr shawwho was once compared with shakespearewhy there is none and yet what form could so perfectly express mr shaws glorious crusade against stupidity his wonderfully sincere and lifelong mood of sticking pins into a pig  we are told ad nauseam that the stage has laws of its own to which all dramatists must bow quite true the stage has the highly technical laws of its physical conditions which cannot be neglected but even when they are all properly attended to it is only behind the elbow of one who feels strongly and tries to express sincerely that right expression stands the imaginative mood coming who knows when staying none too long is a mistress who deserves and certainly expects fidelity true to her while she is there do not when she is not there insult her by looking in every face and thinking it will serve these are laws of sincerity which not even a pastmaster in the laws of the stage can afford to neglect anything is better than resorting to moral sentiments and solutions because they are current coin or to decoration because it is the thing andas to humour though nothing is more precious than the genuine topsyturvy feeling nothing is more pitifully unhumorous than the draggedin epigram or dismal knockabout which has no connection with the persons or philosophy of the play  i suppose it is easy to think oneself sincere it is certainly difficult to be that same imagine the smile and the blue pencil of the spirit of sincerity if we could appoint him censor i would not lift my pen against that censorship though he excisedas perhaps he mightthe half of my work sometimes one has a glimpse of his ironic face and his swift fingers busy with those darkening pages once i dreamed about him it was while a certain commission was sitting on the british censorship which still so admirably guards insincerity and he was giving evidence before them this i remember was what he said  you wish to learn of me what is sincerity look into yourselves for what lies deepest within you each living thing varies from every other living thing and never twice are there quite the same set of premises from which to draw conclusion give up asking of any but yourselves for the whereabouts of truth and if some one says that he can tell you where it is dont believe him he might as well lay a trail of sand and think it will stay there for ever he stopped and i could see him looking to judge what impression he had made upon the commission but those gentlemen behaved as if they had not heard him the spirit of sincerity coughed by jove gentlemen he said its clear you dont care what impression you make on me evidently it is for me to learn sincerity from you  there was once a gentleman lately appointed to assist in the control of the exuberance of plays who stated in public print that there had been no plays of any value written since 1885 entirely denying that this new drama was any better than the old drama cut to the pattern of scribe and sardou certainly novelty is not necessarily improvement comparison must be left to history but it is just as well to remember that we are not born connoisseurs of plays without trying the new we shall not know if it is better than the old to appreciate even drama at its true value a man must be educated just a little when i first went to the national gallery in london i was struck dumb with love of landseers stags and a greuze damsel with her cheek glued to her own shoulder and became voluble from admiration of the large turner and the large claude hung together in that perpetual prizefight at a second visit i discovered sir joshuas countess of albemarle and old cromes mousehold heath and did not care quite so much for landseers stags and again and again i went and each time saw a little differently a little clearer until at last my time was spent before titians bacchus and ariadne botticellis portrait of a young man the francescas da messinas little crucifixion the uccello battle picture that great test of education the velasquez  admiral hogarths five servants and the immortal death of procris admiration for stags and maidenswhere was it  this analogy of pictures does not pretend that our new drama is as far in front of the old as the death of procris is in front of landseers stags alas no it merely suggests that taste is encouraged by an open mind and is a matter of gradual education  to every man his sincere opinion but before we form opinions let us all walk a little through our national gallery of drama with inquiring eye and open mind to see and know for ourselves for to know a man cannot begin too young cannot leave off too old and always he must have a mind which feels it will never know enough in this way alone he will perhaps know something before he dies  and even if he require of the drama only buffoonery or a digestive for his dinner why not be able to discern good buffoonery from bad and the pure digestive from the drug  one is i suppose prejudiced in favour of this new drama of sincerity of these poor productions of the last fifteen years or so it may be indeed that many of them will perish and fade away but they are at all events the expression of the sincere moods of men who ask no more than to serve an art which heaven knows has need of a little serving                                       so much for the principles underlying the advance of the drama but what about the chances of drama itself under the new conditions which will obtain when the war ends  for the moment our world is still convulsed and art of every kind trails a lame foot before a public whose eyes are fixed on the vast and bloody stage of the war when the last curtain falls and rises again on the scenery of peace shall we have to revalue everything surely not the fundamental truths these reflections on the spirit which underlie all true effort in dramatic art may stand much as they were framed now five years ago fidelity to mood to impression to self will remain what it wasthe very kernel of good dramatic art whether that fidelity will find a more or less favourable environment remains the interesting speculation when we come to afterwar conditions a sharp distinction will have to be drawn between the chances of sincere drama in america and britain it is my strong impression that sincere dramatists in america are going to have an easier time than they had before the war but that with us they are going to have a harder my reasons are threefold the first and chief reason is economic however much america may now have to spend with her late arrival vaster resources and incomparably greater recuperative power she will feel the economic strain but little in comparison with britain britain not at once but certainly within five years of the wars close will find that she has very much less money to spend on pleasure now under present conditions of education when the average man has little to spend on pleasure he spends it first in gratifying his coarser tastes and the average briton is going to spend his little on having his broad laughs and his crude thrills by the time he has gratified that side of himself he will have no money left those artists in britain who respect æsthetic truths and practise sincerity will lose even the little support they ever had from the great public there they will have to rely entirely on that small public which always wanted truth and beauty and will want it even more passionately after the war but that little public will be poorer also and i think not more numerous than it was the british public is going to be split more definitely into two campsa very big and a very little camp what this will mean to the drama of sincerity only those who have watched its struggle in the past will be able to understand the trouble in britainand i daresay in every countryis that the percentage of people who take art of any kind seriously is ludicrously small and our impoverishment will surely make that percentage smaller by cutting off the recruiting which was always going on from the ranks of the great public how long it will take britain to recover even prewar conditions i do not venture to suggest but i am pretty certain that there is no chance for a drama of truth and beauty there for many years to come unless we can get it endowed in such a substantial way as shall tide it oversaythe next two decades what we require is a london theatre undeviatingly devoted to the production of nothing but the real thing which will go its own way year in year out quite without regard to the great public and we shall never get it unless we can find some benevolent publicspirited person or persons who will place it in a position of absolute security if we could secure this endowment that theatre would become in a very few years the most fashionable if not the most popular in london and even the great public would go to it nor need such a theatre be expensiveas theatres gofor it is to the mind and not to the eye that it must appeal a sufficient audience is there ready what is lacking is the point of focus a singlehearted and coherent devotion to the best and the means to pursue that ideal without extravagance but without halting alas in england though people will endow or back almost anything else they will not endow or back an art theatre  so much for the economic difficulty in britain what about america the same cleavage obtains in public taste of course but numbers are so much larger wealth will be so much greater the spirit is so much more inquiring the divisions so much less fast set that i do not anticipate for america any block on the line there will still be plenty of money to indulge every taste  art and especially perhaps dramatic art which of all is most dependent on a favourable economic condition will gravitate towards america which may well become in the next ten years not only the mother but the fostermother of the best anglosaxon drama  my next reason for thinking that sincerity in art will have a better chance with americans than in britain in the coming years is psychological they are so young a nation we are so old worldquakes to them are such an adventure to us a nerveracking if not a healthshattering event they will take this war in their stride we have had to climb laboriously over it they will be left buoyant we with the rest of europe are bound to lie for long years after in the trough of disillusionment the national mood with them will be more than ever that of inquiry and exploit with us unless i make a mistake after a spurt of hedonisma going on the spreethere will be lassitude every european country has been overtried in this hideous struggle and nature with her principle of balance is bound to take redress for americans the war nationally speaking will have been but a bracing of the muscles and nerves a clearing of the skin and eyes such a mental and moral condition will promote in them a deeper philosophy and a more resolute facing of truth  and that brings me to my third reason the american outlook will be permanently enlarged by this tremendous experience materially and spiritually she will have been forced to witness and partake of the life thought culture and troubles of the old world she will have unconsciously assimilated much been diverted from the beer and skittles of her isolated development in a great new country americans will find themselves suddenly grown up not till a man is grown up does he see and feel things deeply enough to venture into the dark well of sincerity  america is an eager nation she has always been in a hurry if i had to point out the capital defect in the attractive temperament of the american people i should say it was a passion for short cuts that has been in my indifferent judgment the very natural the inevitable weakness in americas spiritual development the material possibilities the opportunities for growth and change the vast spaces the climate the continual influxions of new blood and new habits the endless shifts of life and environment all these factors have been against that deep brooding over things that close and long scrutiny into the deeper springs of life out of which the sincerest and most lasting forms of art emerge nearly all the conditions of american existence during the last fifty years have been against the settled life and atmosphere which influence men to the recreation in art form of that which has sunk deep into their souls those who have seen the paintings of the italian artist segantini will understand what i mean there have been many painters of mountains but none whom i know of save he who has reproduced the very spirit of those great snowy spaces he spent his life among them till they soaked into his nerves into the very blood of him all else he gave up to see and feel them so that he might reproduce them in his art or let me take an instance from america that enchanting work of art tom sawyer and huckleberry finn by the great mark twain what reproduction of atmosphere and life what scent of the river and oldtime country life it gives off how the author must have been soaked in it to have produced those books  the whole tendency of our age has been away from handmade goods away from the sort of life which produced the great art of the past that is too big a subject to treat of here but certainly a sort of feverish impatience has possessed us all america not least it may be said that this will be increased by the war i think the opposite hard spiritual experience and contact with the old world will deepen the american character and cool its fevers and americans will be more thorough less impatient will give themselves to art and to the sort of life which fosters art more than they have ever yet given themselves great artists like whistler and henry james will no longer seek their quiet environments in europe i believe that this war will be for america the beginning of a great art age i hope so with all my heart for art will need a kind home and a new lease of life  a certain humble and yet patient and enduring belief in himself and his own vision is necessary to the artist i think that americans have only just begun to believe in themselves as artists but that this belief is now destined to grow quickly america has a tremendous atmosphere of her own a wonderful life a wonderful country but so far she has been skating over its surface the time has come when she will strike down think less in terms of material success and machinemade perfections the time has come when she will brood and interpret more and more the underlying truths and body forth an art which shall be a spiritual guide shed light and show the meaning of her multiple existence it will reveal dark things but also those quiet heights to which mans spirit turns for rest and faith in this bewildering maze of a world and to this art about to comeart inevitably moves slowlyinto its own to american drama poetry fiction music painting sculpturesincerity an unswerving fidelity to self alone will bring the dignity worthy of a great and free people  19131917  c the first part of this paper was published in the hibbert journal in 1910     speculationsd   when we survey the world around the wondrous things which there aboundespecially the developments of these last yearsthere must come to some of us a doubt whether this civilisation of ours is to have a future mr lowes dickenson in an able book the choice before us has outlined the alternate paths which the world may tread after the warnational militarism or international pacifism he has pointed out with force the terrible dangers on the first of these two paths the ruinous strain and ultimate destruction which a journey down it will inflict on every nation but holding a brief for international pacifism he was not in that book at all events concerned to point out the dangers which beset peace when in the words of president wilson we have made the world safe for democracy it will be high time to set about making it safe against civilisation itself  the first thing naturally is to ensure a good long spell of peace if we do not we need not trouble ourselves for a moment over the future of civilisationthere will be none but a long spell of peace is probable for though human nature is never uniform and never as one man shall we get salvation sheer exhaustion and disgust with its present bedfellowssuffering sacrifice and sudden deathwill almost surely force the world into international quietude for the first time in history organised justice such as for many centuries has ruled the relations between individuals may begin to rule those between states and free us from menace of war for a period which may be almost indefinitely prolonged to perpetuate this great change in the life of nations is very much an affair of getting men used to that change of setting up a tribunal which they can see and pin their faith to which works and proves its utility which they would miss if it were dissolved states are proverbially cynical but if an international court of justice backed by international force made good in the settlement of two or three serious disputes allayed two or three crises it would with each success gain prestige be firmer and more difficult to uproot till it might at last become as much a matter of course in the eyes of the cynical states as our law courts are in the eyes of our enlightened selves  making then the large but by no means hopeless assumption that such a change may come how is our present civilisation going to pan out  in samuel butlers imagined country erewhon the inhabitants had broken up all machinery abandoned the use of money and lived in a strange elysium of health and beauty i often wonder how without something of the sort modern man is to be prevented from falling into the trombone he blows so loudly from being destroyed by the very machines he has devised for his benefit the problem before modern man is clearly that of becoming master instead of slave of his own civilisation the history of the last hundred and fifty years especially in england is surely one long story of ceaseless banquet and acute indigestion certain roman emperors are popularly supposed to have taken drastic measures during their feasts to regain their appetites we have not their slim wisdom we do not mind going on eating when we have had too much  i do not question the intentions of civilisationthey are most honourable to be clean warm well nourished healthy decently leisured and free to move quickly about the world are certainly pure benefits and these are presumably the prime objects of our toil and ingenuity the ideals to be served by the discovery of steam electricity modern industrial machinery telephony flying if we attained those ideals and stopped therewell and good alas the amazing mechanical conquests of the age have crowded one on another so fast that we have never had time to digest their effects each as it came we hailed as an incalculable benefit to mankind and so it was or would have been if we had not the appetites of cormorants and the digestive powers of elderly gentlemen our civilisation reminds one of the corpse in the mark twain story which at its own funeral got up and rode with the driver it is watching itself being buried we discover and scatter discovery broadcast among a society uninstructed in the proper use of it consider the townridden parasitic condition of great britainthe country which cannot feed itself if we are beaten in this war it will be because we have let our industrial system run away with us because we became so sunk in machines and moneygetting that we forgot our selfrespect no selfrespecting nation would have let its foodgrowing capacity and its country life down to the extent that we have if we are beatenwhich god forbidwe shall deserve our fate and why did our industrial system get such a mad grip on us because we did not master the riot of our inventions and discoveries remember the spinning jennywhence came the whole system of lancashire cotton factories which drained a countryside of peasants and caused a deterioration of physique from which as yet there has been no recovery here was an invention which was to effect a tremendous saving of labour and be of sweeping benefit to mankind exploited without knowledge scruple or humanity it also caused untold misery and grievous national harm read mark and learn mr and mrs hammonds book the town labourer the spinning jenny and similar inventions have been the forces which have dotted beautiful counties of england with the blackest and most illlooking towns in the world have changed the proportion of country to towndwellers from about 3 as against 2 in 1761 to 2 as against 7 in 1911 have strangled our powers to feed ourselves and so made us a temptation to our enemies and a danger to the whole world we have made money by it our standard of wealth has gone up i remember having a long talk with a very old shepherd on the south downs whose youth and early married life were lived on eight shillings a week and he was no exception nowadays our agricultural wage averages over thirty shillings though it buys but little more than the eight still the standard of wealth has superficially advanced if that be any satisfaction but have health beauty happiness among the great bulk of the population  consider the mastery of the air to what use has it been put so far to practically none save the destruction of life about five years before the war some of us in england tried to initiate an international movement to ban the use of flying for military purposes the effort was entirely abortive the fact is man never goes in front of events always insists on disastrously buying his experience and i am inclined to think we shall continue to advance backwards unless we intern our inventors till we have learned to run the inventions of the last century instead of letting them run us counsels of perfection however are never pursued but what can we do we can try to ban certain outside dangers internationally such as submarines and aircraft in war and inside we might establish a board of scientific control to ensure that no inventions are exploited under conditions obviously harmful  suppose for instance that the spinning jenny had come before such a board one imagines they might have said if you want to use this peculiar novelty you must first satisfy us that your employees are going to work under conditions favourable to healthin other words the factory acts town planning and no child labour from the start or when rubber was first introduced you are bringing in this new and we dare say quite useful article we shall however first send out and see the conditions under which you obtain it having seen they would have added you will alter those conditions and treat your native labour humanely or we will ban your use of this article to the grief and anger of those periwigpated persons who write to the papers about grandmotherly legislation and sickly sentimentalism  seriously the history of modern civilisation shows that while we can only trust individualism to make discoveries we cannot at all trust it to apply discovery without some sort of state check in the interests of health beauty and happiness officialdom is on all our nerves but this is a very vital matter and the suggestion of a board of scientific control is not so fantastic as it seems certain results of inventions and discoveries cannot of course be foreseen but able and impartial brains could foresee a good many and save mankind from the most rampant results of raw and unconsidered exploitation the public is a child and the child who suddenly discovers that there is such a thing as candy if left alone can only be relied on to make itself sick  let us stray for a frivolous moment into the realms of art since the word art is claimed for what we know as the film this discovery went as it pleased for a few years in the hands of inventors and commercial agents in these few years such a raging taste for cowboy crime and chaplin films has been developed that a commission which has just been sitting on the matter finds that the public will not put up with more than a ten per cent proportion of educational film in the course of an evenings entertainment now the film as a means of transcribing actual life is admittedly of absorbing interest and great educational value but owing to this false start we cannot get it swallowed in more than extremely small doses as a food and stimulant while it is being gulped down to the dregs as a drug or irritant of the films claim to the word art i am frankly sceptical my mind is openand when one says that one generally means it is shut but art is long the cromagnon men of europe decorated the walls of their caves quite beautifully some say twentyfive some say seventy thousand years ago so it may well require a generation to tell us what is art and what is not among the new experiments continually being made still the film is a restless thing and i cannot think of any form of art as hitherto we have understood the word to which that description could be applied unless it be those wagner operas which i have disliked not merely since the war began but from childhood up during the filming of the play justice i attended at rehearsal to see mr gerald du maurier play the cell scene since in that scene there is not a word spoken in the play itself there is no difference in kind between the appeal of play or film but the live rehearsal for the filming was at least twice as affecting as the dead result of that rehearsal on the screen the film of course is in its first youth but i see no signs as yet that it will ever overcome the handicap of its physical conditions and attain the real emotionalising powers of art the film sweeps up into itself of course a far wider surface of life in a far shorter space of time but the medium is flat has no blood in it and experience tells one that no amount of surface and quantity in art ever make up for lack of depth and quality who would not cheerfully give the albert memorial for a little figure by donatello since however the film takes the line of least resistance and makes a rapid lazy superficial appeal it may very well oust the drama and to my thinking of course that will be all to the bad and intensely characteristic of machinemade civilisation whose motto seems to be down with shakespeare and euripidesup with the movies the film is a very good illustration of the whole tendency of modern life under the toorapid development of machines roughly speaking we seem to be turning up yearly more and more ground to less and less depth we are getting to know life as superficially as the egyptian interpreter knew language who as we read in the manchester guardian when the authorities complained that he was overstaying his leave wrote back my absence is impossible some one has removed my wife my god i am annoyed  there is an expressionhighbrowmaybe complimentary in origin but become in some sort a term of contempt a doubter of our general divinity is labelled highbrow at once and his doubts drop like water off the publics back any one who questions our triumphant progress is tabooed for a pedant that will not alter the fact i fear that we are growing feverish rushed and complicated and have multiplied conveniences to such an extent that we do nothing with them but scrape the surface of life we were rattling into a new species of barbarism when the war came and unless we take a pull shall continue to rattle after it is over the underlying cause in every country is the increase of herdlife based on machines moneygetting and the dread of being dull every one knows how fearfully strong that dread is but to be capable of being dull is in itself a disease  and most of modern life seems to be a process of creating disease then finding a remedy which in its turn creates another disease demanding fresh remedy and so on we pride ourselves for example on scientific sanitation well what is scientific sanitation if not one huge palliative of evils which have arisen from herdlife enabling herdlife to be intensified so that we shall presently need even more scientific sanitation the old shepherd on the south downs had never come in contact with it yet he was very old very healthy hardy and contented he had a sort of simple dignity too that we have most of us lost the true elixirs vitæfor there be two i thinkare openair life and a proud pleasure in ones work we have evolved a mode of existence in which it is comparatively rare to find these two conjoined in old countries such as britain the evils of herdlife are at present vastly more acute than in a new country such as america on the other hand the further one is from hell the faster one drives towards it and machines are beginning to run along with america even more violently than with europe  when our tanks first appeared they were described as snouting monsters creeping at their own sweet will i confess that this is how my inflamed eye sees all our modern machinesmonsters running on their own dragging us along and very often squashing us  we are i believe awakening to the dangers of this gadarening this rushing down the high cliff into the sea possessed and pursued by the devils ofmachinery but if any man would see how little alarmed he really islet him ask himself how much of his present mode of existence he is prepared to alter altering the modes of other people is delightful one would have great hope of the future if we had nothing before us but that the medieval irishman in froude indicted for burning down the cathedral at armagh together with the archbishop defended himself thus as for the cathedral tis true i burned it but indeed an i wouldnt have only they told me himself was inside we are all ready to alter our opponents if not to burn them but even if we were as ardent reformers as that irishman we could hardly force men to live in the open or take a proud pleasure in their work or enjoy beauty or not concentrate themselves on making money no amount of legislation will make us lilies of the field or birds of the air or prevent us from worshipping false gods or neglecting to reform ourselves  i once wrote the unpopular sentence democracy at present offers the spectacle of a man running down a road followed at a more and more respectful distance by his own soul i am a democrat or i should never have dared for democracy substitute modern civilisation which prides itself on redress after the event agility in getting out of the holes into which it has snouted and eagerness to snout into fresh ones it foresees nothing and avoids less it is purely empirical if one may use such a highbrow word  politics are popularly supposed to govern the direction and statesmen to be the guardian angels of civilisation it seems to me that they have little or no power over its growth they are of it and move with it their concern is rather with the body than with the mind or soul of a nation one needs not to be an engineer to know that to pull a man up a wall one must be higher than he that to raise general taste one must have better taste than that of those whose taste he is raising  now to my indifferent mind education in the large sensenot politics at allis the only agent really capable of improving the trend of civilisation the only lever we can use believing this i think it a thousand pities that neither britain nor america nor so far as i know any other country has as yet evolved machinery through which there might be elected a supreme director or say a little board of three directors of the nations spirit an educational president as it were with power over the nations spirit analogous to that which americas elected political president has over americas body our minister of education is as a rule an ordinary member of the government an ordinary man of affairsthough at the moment an angel happens to have strayed in why cannot education be regarded like religion in the past as something sacred not merely a department of political administration ought we not for this most vital business of education to be ever on the watch for the highest mind and the finest spirit of the day to guide us to secure the appointment of such a man or triumvirate by democratic means would need a special sifting process of election which could never be too close and careful one might use for the purpose the actual body of teachers in the country to elect delegates to select a jury to choose finally the flower of the national flock it would be worth any amount of trouble to ensure that we always had the best man or men and when we had them we should give them a mandate as real and substantial as america now gives to her political president we should intend them not for mere lay administrators and continuers of custom but for true fountainheads and initiators of higher ideals of conduct learning manners and taste nor stint them of the means necessary to carry those ideals into effect hitherto the supposed direction of idealsin practice almost nonehas been left to religion but religion as a motive force is at once too personal too lacking in unanimity and too specialised to control the educational needs of a modern state religion as i understand it is essentially emotional and individual when it becomes practical and worldly it strays outside its true province and loses beneficence education as i want to see it would take over the control of social ethics and learning but make no attempt to usurp the emotional functions of religion let me give you an example those elixirs vitæopenair life and a proud pleasure in ones workimagine those two principles drummed into the heads and hearts of all the little scholars of the age by men and women who had been taught to believe them the truth would this not gradually have an incalculable effect on the trend of our civilisation would it not tend to create a demand for a simple and sane life help to get us back to the land produce reluctance to work at jobs in which no one can feel pride and pleasure and so diminish the power of machines and of commercial exploitation but teachers could only be inspired with such ideals by master spirits and my plea is that we should give ourselves the chance of electing and making use of such master spirits we all know from everyday life and business that the real the only problem is to get the best men to run the show when we get them the show runs well when we dont there is nothing left but to pay the devil the chief defect of modern civilisation based on democracy is the difficulty of getting best men quickly enough unless democracygovernment by the peoplemakes of itself aristocracygovernment by the best peopleit is running steadily to seed democracy to be sound must utilise not only the ablest men of affairs but the aristocracy of spirit the really vital concern of such an elected head of education himself the best man of all would be the discovery and employment of other best men best heads of schools and colleges whose chief concern in turn would be the discovery and employment of best subordinates the better the teacher the better the ideals quite obviously the only hope of raising ideals is to raise the standard of those who teach from top to toe of the educational machine what we want in short is a sort of endless bandthrowing up the finest spirit of the day till he forms a head or apex whence virtue runs swiftly down again into the people who elected him this is the principle as it seems to me of the universe itself whose symbol is neither circle nor spire but circle and spire mysteriously combined  america has given us an example of this in her political system perhaps she will now oblige in her educational i confess that i look very eagerly and watchfully towards america in many ways after the war she will be more emphatically than ever in material things the most important and powerful nation of the earth we british have a legitimate and somewhat breathless interest in the use she will make of her strength and in the course of her national life for this will greatly influence the course of our own but power for real light and leading in america will depend not so much on her material wealth or her armed force as on what the attitude towards life and the ideals of her citizens are going to be americans have a certain eagerness for knowledge they have also for all their absorption in success the aspiring eye they do want the good thing they dont always know it when they see it but they want it these qualities in combination with material strength give america her chance yet if she does not set her face against gadarening we are all bound for downhill if she goes in for spreadeagleism if her aspirations are towards quantity not quality we shall all go on being commonised if she should get that purseandpowerproud fever which comes from national success we are all bound for another world flareup the burden of proving that democracy can be real and yet live up to an ideal of health and beauty will be on americas shoulders and on ours what are we and americans going to make of our inner life of our individual habits of thought what are we going to reverence and what despise do we mean to lead in spirit and in truth not in mere money and guns britain is an old country still in her prime i hope but america is as yet on the threshold is she to step out into the sight of the world as a great leader that is for america the long decision to be worked out not so much in her senate and her congress as in her homes and schools on america after the war the destiny of civilisation may hang for the next century if she mislays indeed if she does not improve the power of selfcriticismthat special dry american humour which the great lincoln hadshe might soon develop the intolerant provincialism which has so often been the bane of the earth and the undoing of nations if she gets swelledhead the world will get coldfeet above all if she does not solve the problems of town life of capital and labour of the distribution of wealth of national health and attain to a mastery over inventions and machineryshe is in for a cycle of mere anarchy disruption and dictatorships into which we shall all follow the motto noblesse oblige applies as much to democracy as ever it did to the oldtime aristocrat it applies with terrific vividness to america ancestry and nature have bestowed on her great gifts behind her stand conscience enterprise independence and abilitysuch were the companions of the first americans and are the comrades of american citizens to this day she has abounding energy an unequalled spirit of discovery a vast territory not half developed and great natural beauty i remember sitting on a bench overlooking the grand canyon of arizona the sun was shining into it and a snowstorm was whirling down there all that most marvellous work of nature was flooded to the brim with rose and tawnygold with white and winedark shadows the colossal carvings as of huge rockgods and sacrificial altars and great beasts along its sides were made living by the very mystery of light and darkness on that violent day of springi remember sitting there and an old gentleman passing close behind leaning towards me and saying in a sly gentle voice how are you going to tell it to the folks at home america has so much that one despairs of telling to the folks at home so much grand beauty to be to her an inspiration and uplift towards high and free thought and vision great poems of nature she has wrought in the large to make of her and keep her a noble people in our beloved britainall told not half the size of texasthere is a quiet beauty of a sort which america has not i walked not long ago from worthing to the little village of steyning in the south downs it was such a day as one too seldom gets in england when the sun was dipping and there came on the cool chalky hills the smile of late afternoon and across a smooth valley on the rim of the down one saw a tiny group of trees one little building and a stack against the clearblue pale skyit was like a glimpse of heaven so utterly pure in line and colour so removed and touching the tale of loveliness in our land is varied and unending but it is not in the grand manner america has the grand manner in her scenery and in her blood for over there all are the children of adventure and daring every single white man an emigrant himself or a descendant of one who had the pluck to emigrate she has already had pastmasters in dignity but she has still to reach as a nation the grand manner in achievement she knows her own dangers and failings her qualities and powers but she cannot realise the intense concern and interest deep down behind our provoking stolidities with which we of the old country watch her feeling that what she does reacts on us above all nations and will ever react more and more underneath surface differences and irritations we englishspeaking peoples are fast bound together may it not be in misery and iron if america walks upright so shall we if she goes bowed under the weight of machines money and materialism we too shall creep our ways we run a long race we nations a generation is but a day but in a day a man may leave the track and never again recover it  democracies must not be content to leave the ideals of health and beauty to artists and a leisured class that is the way into a treeless waterless desert it has struck me forcibly that we englishspeaking democracies are all right underneath and all wrong on the surface our hearts are sound but our skin is in a deplorable condition our taste take it all round is dreadful for a petty illustration ragtime music judging by its popularity one would think it must be a splendid discovery yet it suggests little or nothing but the comic lovemaking of two darkies we ride it to death but its jigging jogging jumpy jingle refuses to die on us and americas young and ours grow up in the tradition of its soulforsaken sounds take another tiny illustration the new dancing developed from cakewalk to foxtrot by way of tango precisely the same spiritual origin and not exactly in the grand manner to one who like myself loves and believes in dancing take the snappy side of journalism in san francisco a few years ago the press snapped a certain writer and his wife in their hotel and next day there appeared a photograph of two intensely wretchedlooking beings stricken by limelight under the headline blank and wife enjoy freedom and gaiety in the air another writer told me that as he set foot on a car leaving a great city a young lady grabbed him by the coattail and cried say mr asterisk what are your views on a future life not in the grand manner all this but if you like a sign of vitality and interest a mere excrescence but are not these excrescences symptoms of a fever lying within our modern civilisation a febrility which is going to make achievement of great ends and great work more difficult we britons as a breed are admittedly stolid we err as much on that score as americans on the score of restlessness yet we are both subject to these excrescences there is something terribly infectious about vulgarity and taste is on the downgrade following the tendencies of herdlife it is not a process to be proud of  enough of jeremiads there is a bright side to our civilisation  this modern febrility does not seem able to attack the real inner man if there is a lamentable increase of vulgarity superficiality and restlessness in our epoch there is also an inspiring development of certain qualities those who were watching human nature before the war were pretty well aware of how under the surface unselfishness ironic stoicism and a warm humanity were growing these are the great town virtues the fine flowers of herdlife a big price is being paid for them but they are almost beyond price the war has revealed them in full bloom revealed them not produced them who in the future with this amazing show before him will dare to talk about the need for war to preserve courage and unselfishness from the first shot these wonders of endurance bravery and sacrifice were shown by the untrained citizens of countries nearly fifty years deep in peace never i suppose in the worlds history has there been so marvellous a display in war of the bedrock virtues the soundness at core of the modern man has had one long triumphant demonstration out of a million instances take that little story of a mr lindsay superintendent of a pumping station at some oilwells in mesopotamia a valve in the oilpipe had split and a fountain of oil was being thrown up on all sides while thirty yards off and nothing between the furnaces were in full blast to prevent a terrible conflagration and great loss of life and to save the wells it was necessary to shut off those furnaces that meant dashing through the oilstream and arriving saturated at the flames the superintendent did not hesitate a moment and was burnt to death such deeds as this men and women have been doing all through the war  when you come to think this modern man is a very new and marvellous creature without quite realising it we have evolved a fresh species of stoic even more stoical i suspect than were the old stoics modern man has cut loose from leadingstrings he stands on his own feet his religion is to take what comes without flinching or complaint as part of the days work which an unknowable god providence creative principle or whatever it shall be called has appointed observation tells me that modern man at large far from inclining towards the new personal elderbrotherly god of mr wells has turned his face the other way he confronts life and death alone by courage and kindness modern man exists warmed by the glow of the great human fellowship he has rediscovered the old greek saying god is the helping of man by man has found out in his unselfconscious way that if he does not help himself and help his fellows he cannot reach that inner peace which satisfies to do his bit and to be kind it is by that creed rather than by any mysticism that he finds the salvation of his soul his religion is to be a commonorgarden hero without thinking anything of it for of a truth this is the age of conduct  after all does not the only real spiritual warmth not tinged by pharisaism egotism or cowardice come from the feeling of doing your work well and helping others is not all the rest embroidery luxury pastime pleasant sound and incense modern man take him in the large does not believe in salvation to beat of drum or that by leaning up against another person however idolised and mystical he can gain support he is a realist with too romantic a sense perhaps of the mystery which surrounds existence to pry into it and like modern civilisation itself he is the creature of west and north of atmospheres climates manners of life which foster neither inertia reverence nor mystic meditation essentially man of action in ideal action he finds his only true comfort and no attempts to discover for him new gods and symbols will divert him from the path made for him by the whole trend of his existence i am sure that padres at the front see that the men whose souls they have gone out to tend are living the highest form of religion that in their comic courage unselfish humanity their endurance without whimper of things worse than death they have gone beyond all pulpitanddeathbed teaching and who are these men just the early manhood of the race just modern man as he was before the war began and will be when the war is over  this modern world of which we english and americans are perhaps the truest types stands revealed from beneath its froth frippery and vulgar excrescences sound at corea world whose implicit motto is the good of all humanity but the herdlife which is its characteristic brings many evils has many dangers and to preserve a sane mind in a healthy body is the riddle before us somehow we must free ourselves from the driving domination of machines and moneygetting not only for our own sakes but for that of all mankind  and there is another thing of the most solemn importance we englishspeaking nations are by chance as it were the ballast of the future it is absolutely necessary that we should remain united the comradeship we now feel must and surely shall abide for unless we work together and in no selfish or exclusive spiritgoodbye to civilisation it will vanish like the dew off grass the betterment not only of the british nations and america but of all mankind is and must be our object  when from all our hearts this great weight is lifted when no longer in those fields death sweeps his scythe and our ears at last are free from the rustling thereofthen will come the test of magnanimity in all countries will modern man rise to the ordering of a sane a free a generous life each of us loves his own country best be it a little land or the greatest on earth but jealousy is the dark thing the creeping poison where there is true greatness let us acclaim it where there is true worth let us prize itas if it were our own  this earth is made too subtly of too multiple warp and woof for prophecy when he surveys the world around the wondrous things which there abound the prophet closes foolish lips besides as the historian tells us writers have that undeterminateness of spirit which commonly makes literary men of no use in the world so i for one prophesy not still we do know this all englishspeaking peoples will go to the adventure of peace with something of big purpose and spirit in their hearts with something of free outlook the world is wide and nature bountiful enough for all if we keep sane minds the earth is fair and meant to be enjoyed if we keep sane bodies who dare affront this world of beauty with mean views there is no darkness but what the ape in us still makes and in spite of all his monkeytricks modern man is at heart further from the ape than man has yet been  to do our jobs really well and to be brotherly to seek health and ensue beauty if in britain and america in all the englishspeaking nations we can put that simple faith into real and thorough practice what may not this century yet bring forth shall man the highest product of creation be content to pass his little day in a house like unto bedlam  when the present great task in which we have joined hands is ended when once more from the shuttered madhouse the figure of peace steps forth and stands in the sun and we may go our ways again in the beauty and wonder of a new morninglet it be with this vow in our hearts no more of madnessin war in peace  191718  d a paper read on march 21st 1918     the land 1917   i  if once more through ingenuity courage and good luck we find the submarine menace well in hand and go to sleep againif we reach the end of the war without having experienced any sharp starvation and go our ways to trade to eat and forgetwhat then it is about twenty years since the first submarine could navigateand about seventeen since flying became practicable there are a good many years yet before the world and numberless developments in front of these new accomplishments hundreds of miles are going to be what tens are now thousands of machines will take the place of hundreds  we have ceased to live on an island in any save a technically geographical sense and the sooner we make up our minds to the fact the better if in the future we act as we have in the pastrather the habit of this countryi can imagine that in fifteen years time or so we shall be well enough prepared against war of the same magnitude and nature as this war and that the country which attacks us will launch an assault against defences as many years out of date  i can imagine a war starting and wellnigh ending at once by a quiet and simultaneous sinking from under water and from the air of most british ships in port or at sea i can imagine little standardised submarines surreptitiously prepared by the thousand and tens of thousands of the enemy population equipped with flying machines instructed in flying as part of their ordinary civil life and ready to serve their country at a moments notice by taking a little flight and dropping a little charge of an explosive many times more destructive than any in use now the agility of submarines and flying machines will grow almost indefinitely and even if we carry our commerce under the sea instead of on the surface we shall not be guaranteed against attack by air the air menace is in fact infinitely greater than that from under water i can imagine all shipping in port the houses of parliament the bank of england most commercial buildings of importance and every national granary wrecked or fired in a single night on a declaration of war springing out of the blue the only things i cannot imagine wrecked or fired are the british character and the good soil of britain  these are sinister suggestions but there is really no end to what might now be done to us by any country which deliberately set its own interests and safety above all considerations of international right especially if such country were moved to the soul by longing for revenge and believed success certain after this worldtragedy let us hope nations may have a little sense less of that ghastly provincialism whence this war sprang that no nation may teach in its schools that it is gods own people entitled to hack through without consideration of others that professors may be no longer blind to all sense of proportion emperors things of the past diplomacy open and responsible a real court of nations at work military chiefs unable to stampede a situation journalists obliged to sign their names and held accountable for inflammatory writings let us hope and let us by every means endeavour to bring about this better state of the world but there is many a slip between cup and lip there is also such a thing as hatred and to rely blindly on a peace which at the best must take a long time to prove its reality is to put our heads again under our wings once bit twice shy we shall make a better world the quicker if we try realism for a little  britains situation is now absurdly weak without and within and its weakness is due to one main causethe fact that we do not grow our own food to get the better of submarines in this war will make no difference to our future situation a little peaceful study and development of submarines and aircraft will antiquate our present antidotes you cannot chain air and the deeps to war uses and think you have done with their devilish possibilities a score of years afterwards because for the moment the submarine menace or the air menace is well in hand  at the end of the war i suppose the channel tunnel will be made and quite time too but even that will not help us we get no food from europe and never shall again not even by linking ourselves to europe can we place ourselves in security from europe faith may remove mountains but it will not remove britain to the centre of the atlantic here we shall remain every year nearer and more accessible to secret and deadly attack  the next war if there be onewhich man forbidmay be fought without the use of a single big ship or a single infantryman it may begin instead of ending by being a war of starvation it may start as it were where it leaves off this time and the only way of making even reasonably safe is to grow our own food if for years to come we have to supplement by state granaries they must be placed underground not even there will they be too secure unless we grow our own food after this war we shall be the only great country which does not and a constant temptation to any foe to be selfsufficing will be the first precaution taken by our present enemies in order that blockade may no longer be a weapon in our hands so far as their necessary food is concerned  whatever arrangements the world makes after the war to control the conduct of nations in the future the internal activities of those nations will remain unfettered capable of deadly shaping and plausible disguise in the hands of able and damnable schemers  the submarine menace of the present is merely awkward and no doubt surmountableit is nothing to the submarinecumair menace of peace time a few years hence it will be impossible to guard against surprise under the new conditions if we do not grow our own food we could be knocked out of time in the first round  but besides the danger from overseas we have an inland danger to our future just as formidablethe desertion of our countryside and the townblight which is its corollary  despair seizes on one reading that we should cope with the danger of the future by new cottages better instruction to farmers better kinds of manure and seed encouragement to cooperative societies a cheerful spirit and the storage of two to three years supply of grain excellent and necessary in their small waysthey are a mere stone to the bread we need  in that programme and the speech which put it forward i see insufficient grasp of the outer peril and hardly any of the gradual destruction with which our overwhelming town life threatens us not one allusion to the physical and moral welfare of our race except this that boys should be in touch with country life and country tastes is of first importance and that their elementary education should be given in terms of country things is also of enormous importance that is all and it shows how far we have got from reality and how difficult it will be to get back for the speaker was once minister for agriculture  our justifications for not continuing to feed ourselves were pursuit of wealth command of the sea island position whatever happens in this war we have lost the last two in all but a superficial sense let us see whether the first is sufficient justification for perseverance in a mode of life which has brought us to an ugly pass  our wonderful industrialism began about 1766 and changed us from exporting between the years 1732 and 1766 11250000 quarters of wheat to importing 7500000 quarters between the years 1767 and 1801 in one hundred and fifty years it has brought us to the state of importing more than threequarters of our wheat and more than half our total food whereas in 1688 figures of gregory and davenant about fourfifths of the population of england was rural in 1911 only about twoninths was rural this transformation has given us great wealth extremely illdistributed plastered our country with scores of busy populous and hideous towns given us a merchant fleet which before the war had a gross tonnage of over 20000000 or not far short of half the worlds shipping it has or had fixed in us the genteel habit of eating very doubtfully nutritious white bread made of the huskless flour of wheat reduced the acreage of arable land in the united kingdom from its already insufficient maximum of 23000000 acres to its 1914 figure of 19000000 acres made england all but its towns look very like a pleasure garden and driven two shibboleths deep into our minds all for wealth and hands off the food of the people  all these good results have had certain complementary disadvantages some of which we have just seen some of which have long been seen  of these last let me first take a small sentimental disadvantage we have become more parasitic by far than any other nation to eat we have to buy with our manufactures an overwhelming proportion of our vital foods the blood in our veins is sucked from foreign bodies in return for the clothing we give themnot a very selfrespecting thought we have a green and fertile country and round it a prolific sea our country if we will can produce with its seas all the food we need to eat we know that quite well but we elect to be nourished on foreign stuff because we are a practical people and prefer shekels to sentiment we do not mind being parasitic taking no interest nationally in the growth of food we take no interest nationally in the cooking of it the two accomplishments subtly hang together pride in the food capacity the corn and wine and oil of their country has made the cooking of the french the most appetising and nourishing in the world the french do cook we open tins the french preserve the juices of their homegrown food we have no juices to preserve the life of our poorer classes is miserably stunted of essential salts and savours they throw away skins refuse husks make no soups prefer pickle to genuine flavour but homegrown produce really is more nourishing than tinned and pickled and frozen foods if we honestly feed ourselves we shall not again demand the old genteel flavourless white bread without husk or body in it we shall eat wholemeal bread and take to that salutary substance oatmeal which if i mistake not has much to say in making the scots the tallest and boniest race in europe  now for a far more poignant disadvantage we have become tied up in teeming congeries to which we have grown so used that we are no longer able to see the blight they have brought on us our great industrial towns sixty odd in england alone with a population of 15000000 to 16000000 are our glory our pride and the main source of our wealth they are the growth roughly speaking of five generations they began at a time when social science was unknown spread and grew in unchecked riot of individual moneymaking till they are the nightmare of social reformers and the despair of all lovers of beauty they have mastered us so utterly morally and physically that we regard them and their results as matter of course they are public opinion so that for the battle against townblight there is no driving force they paralyse the imaginations of our politicians because their voting power is so enormous their commercial interests are so huge and the food necessities of their populations seem so paramount  i once bewailed the physique of our towns to one of our most cultivated and prominent conservative statesmen he did not agree he thought that probably physique was on the upgrade this commonly held belief is based on statistics of longevity and sanitation but the same superior sanitation and science applied to a rural population would have lengthened the lives of a much finer and betterlooking stock here are some figures out of 1650 passersby women and men observed in perhaps the best district of londonst jamess park trafalgar square westminster bridge and piccadillyin may of this year only 310 had any pretensions to not being very plain or definitely uglynot one in five and out of that 310 only eleven had what might be called real beauty out of 120 british soldiers observed round charing cross sixtyjust onehalfpassed the same standard but out of seventytwo australian soldiers fiftyfour or threequarters passed and several had real beauty out of 120 men women and children taken at random in a remote country village five miles from any town and eleven miles from any town of 10000 inhabitants ninetyor just threequarters alsopass this same standard of looks it is significant that the average here is the same as the average among australian soldiers who though of british stock come from a country as yet unaffected by town life you ask of course what standard is this a standard which covers just the very rudiments of proportion and comeliness people in small country towns i admit have little or no more beauty than people in large towns this is curious but may be due to too much inbreeding  the first counter to conclusions drawn from such figures is obviously the english are an ugly people i said that to a learned and æsthetic friend when i came back from france last spring he started and then remarked oh well not as ugly as the french anyway a great error much plainer if you take the bulk and not the pick of the population in both countries it may not be fair to attribute french superiority in looks entirely to the facts that they grow nearly all their own food and cook it well and had in 1906 foursevenths of their population in the country as against our own twoninths in 1911 because there is the considerable matter of climate but when you get so high a proportion of comeliness in remote country districts in england it is fair to assume that climate does not account for anything like all the difference i do not believe that the english are naturally an ugly people the best english type is perhaps the handsomest in the world the physique and looks of the richer classes are as notoriously better than those of the poorer classes as the physique and looks of the remote country are superior to those of crowded towns where conditions are free from cramp poor air poor food and herdlife english physique quite holds its own with that of other nations  we do not realise the great deterioration of our stock the squashedin stunted disproportionate commonised look of the bulk of our people because as we take our walks abroad we note only faces and figures which strike us as goodlooking the rest pass unremarked ugliness has become a matter of course there is no reason save town life why this should be so but what does it matter if we have become ugly we work well make money and have lots of moral qualities a fair inside is better than a fair outside i do think that we are in many ways a very wonderful people and our townsfolk not the least wonderful but that is all the more reason for trying to preserve our physique  granted that an expressive face with interest in life stamped on it is better than chocolate box or barbers block good looks that agility and strength are better than symmetry without agility and strength the trouble is that there is no interest stamped on so many of our faces no agility or strength in so many of our limbs if there were those faces and limbs would pass my standard the old greek cult of the body was not to be despised i defy even the most rigid puritans to prove that a satisfactory moral condition can go on within an exterior which exhibits no signs of a live able and serene existence by living on its nerves overworking its body starving its normal aspirations for fresh air good food sunlight and a modicum of solitude a country can get a great deal out of itself a terrific lot of wealth in three or four generations but it is living on its capital physically speaking this is precisely what we show every sign of doing and partly what i mean by townblight   ii  the impression i get in our big towns is most peculiarconsidering that we are a free people the faces and forms have a look of being possessed to express my meaning exactly is difficult there is a dulled and driven look and yet a general expression of keep smilingare we downhearted no it is as if people were all being forced along by a huge invisible hand at the back of their necks whose pressure they resent yet are trying to make the best of because they cannot tell whence it comes to understand you must watch the grip from its very beginnings the small children who swarm in the little grey playground streets of our big towns pass their years in utter abandonment they roll and play and chatter in conditions of amazing unrestraint and devilmaycaredom in the midst of amazing dirt and ugliness the younger they are as a rule the chubbier and prettier they are gradually you can see herdlife getting hold of them the impact of ugly sights and sounds commonising the essential grace and individuality of their little features on the lack of any standard or restraint any real glimpse of nature any knowledge of a future worth striving for or indeed of any future at all they thrive forward into that handtomouth mood from which they are mostly destined never to emerge quick and scattery as monkeys and never alone they become at a rakes progress little fragments of the herd on poor food poor air and habits of least resistance they wilt and grow distorted acquiring withal the sort of pathetic hardihood which a dartmoor pony will draw out of moor life in a frozen winter all round them by day by night stretches the huge grey grimy waste of streets factory walls chimneys murky canals chapels publichouses hoardings posters butchers shopsa waste where nothing beautiful exists save a pretty cat or pigeon a blue sky perhaps and a few trees and open spaces the children of the class above too of the small shoppeople the artisansdo they escape not really the same herdlife and the same sights and sounds pursue them from birth they also are soon divested of the grace and free look which you see in country children walking to and from school or roaming the hedges whether true slum children or from streets a little better off quickly they all pass out of youth into the iron drive of commerce and manufacture into the clang and clatter the swish and whirr of wheels the strange dragging sawlike hubbub of industry or the clicking and pigeonholes of commerce perch on a devils seesaw from monotonous work to cheap sensation and back considering the conditions it is wonderful that they stand it as well as they do and i should be the last to deny that they possess remarkable qualities but the modern industrial english town is a sort of inferno where people dwell with a marvellous philosophy what would you have they have never seen any way out of it and this perhaps would not be so pitiful if for each bondservant of our towntyranny there was in store a prizesome portion of that national wealth in pursuit of which the tyrant drives us if each worker had before him the chance of emergence at say fifty but lord god for five that emerge ninetyandfive stay bound less free and wealthy at the end of the chapter than they were at the beginning and the quaint thing isthey know it know that they will spend their lives in smoky noisy crowded drudgery and in crowded drudgery die wealth goes to wealth and all they can hope for is a few extra shillings a week with a corresponding rise in prices they know it but it does not disturb them for they were born of the towns have never glimpsed at other possibilities imprisoned in town life from birth they contentedly perpetuate the species of a folk with an ebbing future yes ebbing for if it be not why is there now so much conscious effort to arrest the decay of town workers nerves and sinews why do we bother to impede a process which is denied if there be no townblight on us why a million indications of uneasiness and a thousand little fights against the march of a degeneration so natural vast and methodical that it brings them all to naught our physique is slowly rotting and that is the plain truth of it  but it does not stop with deteriorated physique students of faces in the remoter country are struck by the absence of what for want of a better word we may call vulgarity that insidious defacement is seen to be a thing of towns and not at all a matter of class the simplest country cottager shepherd fisherman has as much often a deal more dignity than numbers of our upper classes who in spite of the desire to keep themselves unspotted are still from the nature of their existence touched by the herdlife of modern times for vulgarity is the natural product of herdlife an amalgam of secondhand thought cheap and rapid sensation defensive and offensive selfconsciousness gradually plastered over the faces manners voices whole beings of those whose elbows are too tightly squeezed to their sides by the pressure of their fellows whose natures are cut off from nature whose senses are rendered imitative by the too insistent impact of certain sights and sounds without doubt the rapid increase of townlife is responsible for our acknowledged vulgarity the same process is going on in america and in northern germany but we unfortunately had the lead and seem to be doing our best to keep it cheap newspapers on the sensational tipandrun system perpetual shows of some kind or other work in association every kind of thing in association at a speed too great for individual digestion and in the presence of every device for removing the need for individual thought the thronged streets the football match with its crowd emotions beyond all the cinemaa compendium of all these other influencesmake townlife a veritable forcingpit of vulgarity we are all so deeply in it that we do not see the process going on or if we admit it hasten to add but what does it mattertheres no harm in vulgarity besides its inevitable you cant set the tide back obviously the vulgarity of townlife cannot be exorcised by act of parliament there is not indeed the faintest chance that parliament will recognise such a side to the question at all since there is naturally no public opinion on this matter  everybody must recognise and admire certain qualities specially fostered by townlife the extraordinary patience cheerful courage philosophic irony and unselfishness of our townspeoplequalities which in this war both at the front and at home have been of the greatest value they are worth much of the price paid but in this life all is a question of balance and my contention is not so much that townlife in itself is bad as that we have pushed it to a point of excess terribly dangerous to our physique to our dignity and to our sense of beauty must our future have no serene and simple quality not even a spice of the influence of nature with her air her trees her fields and wide skies say what you like it is elbowroom for limbs and mind and lungs which keeps the countryman free from that dulled and driven look and gives him individuality i know all about the dullness and monotony of rural life bad housing and the rest of it all true enough but the cure is not exodus it is improvement in rurallife conditions more cooperation better cottages a fuller freer social life what we in england now want more than anything is airfor lungs and mind we have overdone herdlife we are dimly conscious of this feel vaguely that there is something rattling and wrong about our progress for we have had many little spasmodic movements back to the land these last few years but what do they amount to whereas in 1901 the proportion of town to country population in england and wales was 3 10371 in 1911 it was 3 17201 very distinctly greater at this crabs march we shall be some time getting back to the land our effort so far has been something like our revival of morris dancing very pleasant and æsthetic but without real economic basis or strength to stand up against the lure of the towns and how queer ironical and pitiful is that lure when you consider that in towns onethird of the population are just on or a little below the line of bare subsistence that the great majority of town workers have hopelessly monotonous work stuffy housing poor air and little leisure but there it isthe charm of the lightedup unknown of company and the streets at night the countryman goes to the town in search of adventure honestlydoes he really find it he thinks he is going to improve his prospects and his mind his prospects seldom brighten he sharpens his mind only to lose it and acquire instead that of the herd  to compete with this lure of the towns there must first be national consciousness of its danger then coherent national effort to fight it we must destroy the shibboleth all for wealth and rewrite it all for healththe only wealth worth having wealth is not an end surely then to what is it the means if not to health once we admit that in spite of our wealth our national health is going downhill through townblight we assert the failure of our countrys ideals and life and if having got into a vicious state of congested town existence we refuse to make an effort to get out again because it is necessary to hold our own commercially and feed the people cheaply we are in effect saying we certainly are going to hell but lookhow successfully i suggest rather that we try to pull ourselves up again out of the pit of destruction even if to do so involves us in a certain amount of monetary loss and inconvenience yielding to no one in desire that the people should be well nay better fed i decline utterly to accept the doctrine that there is no way of doing this compatible with an increased country population and the growth of our own food in national matters where there is a general and not a mere party will there is a way and the way is not to be recoiled from because the first years of the change may necessitate governmental regulation many people hold that our salvation will come through education education on right lines underlies everything of course but unless education includes the growth of our own food and return to the land in substantial measure education cannot save us  it may be natural to want to go to hell it is certainly easy we have gone so far in that direction that we cannot hope to be haloed in our time for good or evil the great towns are here and we can but mitigate the indicated policy of mitigation is fivefold  1 such solid economic basis to the growth of our food as will give us again national security more arable land than we have ever had and on it a full complement of wellpaid workers with better cottages and a livened village life  2 a vast number of small holdings statecreated with cooperative working  3 a wide beltsystem of garden allotments round every town industrial or not  4 drastic improvements in housing feeding and sanitation in the towns themselves  5 education that shall raise not only the standard of knowledge but the standard of taste in town and country  all these ideals are already well in the public eyeon paper but they are incoherently viewed and urged they do not as yet form a national creed until welded and supported by all parties in the state they will not have driving power enough to counteract the terrific momentum with which towns are drawing us down into the pit one section pins its faith to town improvement another to the development of small holdings a third to cottage building a fourth to education a fifth to support of the price of wheat a sixth to the destruction of landlords comprehensive vision of the danger is still lacking and comprehensive grasp of the means to fight against it  we are by a long way the most townridden country in the world our towns by a long way the smokiest and worst built with the most inbred town populations we have practically come to an end of our countrystock reserves unless we are prepared to say this is a desirable state of things let the inbreeding of town stocks go onwe shall evolve in time a new type immune to town life a little ratty fellow all nerves and assurance much better than any country clodwhich by the way is exactly what some of us do say unless we mean as a nation to adopt this view and rattle on lightheartedly careless of menace from without and within assuring ourselves that health and beauty freedom and independence as hitherto understood have always been misnomers and that nothing whatever matters so long as we are richunless all this we must give check to the present state of things restore a decent balance between town and country stock grow our own food and establish a permanent tendency away from towns  all this fearfully unorthodox and provocative of sneers andgoodness knowsi do not enjoy saying it but needs must when the devil drives it may be foolish to rave against the past and those factors and conditions which have put us so utterly in bond to townsespecially since this past and these towns have brought us such great wealth and so dominating a position in the world it cannot be foolish now that we have the wealth and the position to resolve with all our might to free ourselves from bondage to be masters not servants of our fate to get back to firm ground and make health and safety what they ever should bethe true keystones of our policy   iii  in the midst of a war like this the first efforts of any government have to be directed to immediate ends but under the pressure of the war the government has a unique chance to initiate the comprehensive farreaching policy which alone can save us foundations to safety will only be laid if our representatives can be induced now to see this question of the land as the question of the future no matter what happens in the war to see that whatever success we attain we cannot remove the two real dangers of the future sudden strangulation through swift attack by air and under seaunless we grow our own food and slow strangulation by townlifeunless we restore the land our imaginations are stirred the driving force is here swift action possible and certain extraordinary opportunities are open which presently must close again  on demobilisation we have the chance of our lives to put men on the land because this is still a party question to be sagaciously debated up hill and down dale three or four years hence we shall very likely grasp the mere shadow and miss the substance of that opportunity if the government had a mandate full steam ahead we could add at the end of the war perhaps a million men potentially four million people to our foodgrowing country population as it is we may add thereto a few thousands lose half a million to the colonies and discourage the restpatting our own backs the while to put men on the land we must have the land ready in terms of earth not of paper and have it in the right places within easy reach of town or village things can be done just now we know for instance that in a few months half a million allotmentgardens have been created in urban areas and more progress made with small holdings than in previous years i repeat we have a chance which will not recur to scotch the food danger and to restore a healthier balance between town and country stocks shall we be pennywise and lose this chance for the luxury of free and full discussion of a controversial matter at a time when mens minds are not full of the countrys danger this is the countrys dangerthere is no other and this is the moment for full and free discussion of it for full and free action too who doubts that a government which brought this question of the land in its widest aspects to the touchstone of full debate at once would get its mandate would get the power it wantednot to gerrymander but to build  consider the corn production bill i will quote mr prothero national security is not an impracticable dream it is within our reach within the course of a few years and it involves no great dislocation of other industries note that for all practical purposes if we could grow at home here 82 per cent of all the food that we require for five years we should be safe and that amount of independence of seaborne supplies we can secure and secure within a few years we could obtain that result if we could add 8000000 acres of arable land to our existing areathat is to say if we increased it from 19000000 acres to 27000000 acres if you once got that extension of your arable area the nation would be safe from the nightmare of a submarine menace and the number of additional men who would be required on the land would be something about a quarter of a million note that the present bill is much less ambitious it is and it is introduced by one who knows and dreads as much as any of us the dangerous and unballasted condition into which we have drifted introduced with as it were apology as if he feared that unambitious though it be it will startle the nerves of parliament on a question so vast and vital you are bound to startle by any little measure nothing but an heroic measure would arouse debate on a scale adequate to reach and stir the depths of our national condition and wake us all politicians and public to appreciate the fact that our whole future is in this matter and that it must be tackled  if we are not capable now of grasping the vital nature of this issue we assuredly never shall be only five generations have brought us to the parasitic townridden condition we are in the rate of progress in deterioration will increase rapidly with each coming generation we have as it were turned sevenninths of our population out into poor paddocks to breed promiscuously among themselves we have the chance to make our english and welsh figures read twentyfour millions of towndwellers to twelve of country instead of as now twentyeight millions to eight consider what that would mean to the breeding of the next generation in such extra millions of country stock our national hope lies what we should never dream of permitting with our domestic animals we are not only permitting but encouraging among ourselves we are doing all we can to perpetuate and increase poor stock stock without either quality or bone rundown and illshaped and just as the progress in the stock danger is accelerated with each generation so does the danger from outside increase with every year which sees flying and submarining improve and our food capacity standing still  the great argument against a united effort to regain our ballast is we must not take away too many from our vital industries why even the minister of agriculture who really knows and dreads the danger almost apologises for taking two hundred and fifty thousand from those vital industries to carry out not his immediate but his ideal programme vital industries ah vital to britains destruction within the next few generations unless we mend our ways the great impediment is the force of things as they are the huge vested interests the iron network of vast enterprises frightened of losing profit if we pass this moment when men of every class and occupation even those who most thrive on our townridden state are a little frightened if we let slip this chance for a real reversalcan we hope that anything considerable will be done with the dice loaded as they are the scales weighted so hopelessly in favour of the towns representatives of sevenninths will always see that representatives of twoninths do not outvote them this is a crude way of putting it but it serves because after all an elector is only a little bundle of the immediate needs of his locality and mode of life outside of which he cannot see and which he does not want prejudiced he is not a fool like me looking into the future and his representatives have got to serve him the only chance in a question so huge vital and long as this is that greatly distrusted agentpanic legislation when panic makes men for a brief space open their eyes and see truth then it is valuable before our eyes close again and see nothing but the darkness of the daily struggle for existence let us take advantage and lay foundations which will be difficult at least to overturn  what has been done so far and what more can be done a bounty on corn has been introduced i suppose nobody certainly not its promoter is enamoured of this but it does not seem to have occurred to every one that you cannot eat nuts without breaking their shells or get out of evil courses without a transition period of extreme annoyance to yourself bounty is in many quarters looked on as a piece of petting to an interest already pampered wellwhile we look on the land as an interest in competition with other interests and not as the vital interest of the country underlying every other so long shall we continue to be in the soup the land needs fostering and again fostering because the whole vicious tendency of the countrys life has brought farming to its present pass and farmers to their attitude of mistrust doctrinaire objections are now ridiculous an economic basis must be reestablished or we may as well cry kamerad at once and hold up our hands to fate the greater the arable acreage in this country the less will be the necessity for a bounty on corn unlike most stimulants it is one which gradually stimulates away the need for it with every year and every million acres broken up not only will the need for bounty diminish but the present mistrustful breed of farmer will be a step nearer to extinction shrewd naturally conservative and somewhat intolerant of anything so dreamy as a national point of view they will not live for ever the upgrowing farmer will not be like them and about the time the need for bounty is vanishing the new farmer will be in possession but in the meantime land must be broken up until 8000000 acres at least are conquered and bounty is the only lever it will not be lever enough without constant urging in mr protheros history of english farming occur these words a norfolk farmer migrated to devonshire in 1780 where he drilled and hoed his roots though his crops were far superior to those of other farmers in the district yet at the close of the century no neighbour had followed his example  but even the breakup of 8000000 acres though it may make us safe for food will only increase our country population by 250000 labourers and their families a million soulsa mere beginning towards the satisfaction of our need we want in operation before demobilisation begins a great national plan for the creation of good small holdings run on cooperative lines and to this end why should not the suggestion of tithe redemption thrown out by mr prothero on pages 399 and 400 of english farming past and present be adopted the annual value of tithes is about £5000000 their extinction should provide the government with about 2500000 acres enough at one stroke to put three or four hundred thousand soldiers on the land the titheholders would get their money landlords would not be prejudiced the government by virtue of judicious choice and discretionary compulsion would obtain the sort of land it wanted and the land would be for ever free of a teasing and vexatious charge the cost to the government would be £100000000 perhaps more on the best security it could have present conditions i quote from the book are favourable to such a transaction the price of land enables owners to extinguish the rent charge by the surrender of a reasonable acreage and the low price of consols enables investors to obtain a larger interest for their money for those not familiar with this notion the process in brief is this the government pays the titheholder the capitalised value of his tithe and takes over from the landlord as much land as produces in net annual rent the amount of the titherent charge leaving the rest of his land tithefree for ever there are doubtless difficulties and objections but so there must be to any comprehensive plan for obtaining an amount of land at all adequate time is of desperate importance in this matter it is already dangerously late but if the government would turnto now with a will the situation could still be saved and this unique chance for restocking our countryside would not be thrown away  i alluded to the formation within a few months of half a million gardenallotmentsplots of ground averaging about ten poles each taken under the defence of the realm act from building and other land in urban areas and given to cultivators under a guarantee for the growth of vegetables this most valuable effort for which the board of agriculture deserves the thanks of all is surely capable of very great extension every town no matter how quickly it may be developing is always surrounded by a belt of dubious landnot quite town and not quite country when town development mops up plots in cultivation a hole can be let out in an elastic belt which is capable of almost indefinite expansion but this most useful and healthgiving work has only been possible under powers which will cease when the immediate danger to the state has passed if a movement which greatly augments our homegrown food supply and can give quiet healthy openair interesting work for several hours a week to perhaps a million out of our congested town populationsif such a movement be allowed to collapse at the coming of peace it will be nothing less than criminal i plead here that the real danger to the state will not pass but rather begin with the signing of peace that the powers to acquire and grant these gardenallotments should be continued and every effort made to foster and extend the movement considering that whatever we do to recolonise our land we must still have in this country a dangerously huge town population this kitchengarden movement can be of incalculable value in combating townblight in securing just that air to lungs and mind and just that spice of earth reality which all towndwellers need so much  extension of arable land by at least 8000000 acres creation of hundreds of thousands of small holdings by tithe redemption or another scheme still in the blue increase and perpetuation of gardenallotmentsbesides all these we want of course agricultural schools and facilities for training cooperatively organised finance transport and marketing of produce for without schooling and cooperation no system of small holding on a large scale can possibly succeed we now have the labourers minimum wage which i think will want increasing but we want good rural housing on an economically sound basis an enlivened village life and all that can be done to give the worker on the land a feeling that he can rise the sense that he is not a mere herd at the beck and call of what has been dubbed the tyranny of the countryside the land gives work which is varied alive and interesting beyond all town industries save those perhaps of art and the highlyskilled crafts and professions if we can once get landlife back on to a wide and solid basis it should hold its own  dare any say that this whole vast question of the land with its throbbing importance yeaseeing that demobilisations do not come every yearits desperately immediate importance is not fit matter for instant debate and action dare any say that we ought to relegate it to that limbo after the war in grim reality it takes precedence of every other question it is infinitely more vital to our safety and our health than consideration of our future commercial arrangements in our present parliamentpractically if not sentimentally speakingall shades of opinion are as well represented as they are likely to be in future parliamentseven the interests of our women and our soldiers to put off the good day when this question is threshed out is to crane at an imagined hedge  let us know now at what we are aiming let us admit and record in the black and white of legislation that we intend to trim our course once more for the port of health and safety if this britain of ours is going to pin her whole future to a blind pursuit of wealth without considering whether that wealth is making us all healthier and happier many of us like sancho would rather retire at once and be made governors of islands for who can want part or lot on a ship which goes yawing with every sail set into the dark without rudder compass or lighted star  i for one want a britain who refuses to take the mere immediate line of least resistance who knows and sets her course and that a worthy one so do we all i believe at heartonly the current is so mighty and strong and we are so used to it  by the parasitic and townridden condition we are in now and in which without great and immediate effort we are likely to remain we degrade our patriotism that we should have to tremble lest we be starved is a miserable a humiliating thought to have had so little pride and independence of spirit as to have come to this to have been such gobblers at wealthwho dare defend it we have made our bed let us now refuse to lie thereon better the floor than this dingy feather couch of suffocation  our country is dear to us and many are dying for her there can be no consecration of their memory so deep or so true as this regeneration of the land  1917     the land 1918   i  introductory  can one assume that the pinch of this war is really bringing home to us the vital need of growing our own food henceforth i do not think so is there any serious shame felt at our parasitic condition none are we in earnest about the resettlement of the land not yet  all our history shows us to be a practical people with short views tiens une montagne never was a better summing up of british character than those words of the french cartoonist during the boer war beneath his picture of a certain british general of those days riding at a hand gallop till his head was butting a cliff without seeing a hands breadth before our noses we have built our empire our towns our law we are born empiricists and must have our faces ground by hard facts before we attempt to wriggle past them we have thriven so far but the ruin of england is likely to be the work of practical men who burn the house down to roast the pig because they cannot see beyond the next meal visions are airy but i propose to see visions for a moment and britain as she might be in 1948  i see our towns not indeed diminished from their present size but no larger much cleaner and surrounded by wide belts of garden allotments wherein town workers spend many of their leisure hours i see in great britain fifty millions instead of fortyone but the town population only thirtytwo millions as now and the rural population eighteen millions instead of the present nine i see the land farmed in three ways very large farms growing corn and milk meat and wool or sugar beet small farms cooperatively run growing everything and large groups of cooperative small holdings growing vegetables fruit pigs poultry and dairy produce to some extent there are no game laws to speak of and certainly no large areas of ground cut to waste for private whims i see very decent cottages everywhere with large plots of ground at economic rents and decently waged people paying them no tithes but a band of extinguished titheholders happy with their compensation the main waterways of the country seem joined by wide canals and along these canals factories are spread out on the garden city plan with allotments for the factory workers along better roads run long chains of small holdings so that the cooperated holders have no difficulty in marketing their produce i see motor transport tractor ploughs improved farm machinery forestry properly looked after and foreshores reclaimed each village owning its recreation hall with stage and cinema attached and publichouses run only on the principle of no commission on the drink sold every school teaching the truth that happiness and health not mere money and learning are the prizes of life and the objects of education and for ever impressing on the scholars that life in the open air and pleasure in their work are the two chief secrets of health and happiness in every district a model farm radiates scientific knowledge of the art of husbandry bringing instruction to each individual farmer and leaving him no excuse for ignorance the land produces what it ought not as now feeding with each hundred acres only fifty persons while a german hundred acres not nearly so favoured by nature feeds seventyfive every little girl has been taught to cook farmers are no longer fearful of bankruptcy as in the years from 1875 to 1897 but hold their own with all comers proud of their industry the spine and marrow of a country which respects itself once more there seems no longer jealousy or division between town and country and statesmen by tacit consent leave the land free from party politics i see taller and stronger men and women rosier and happier children a race no longer narrow squashed and disproportionate no longer smokedried and nerveracked with the driven dontcare look of a townridden land and surely the words old england are spoken by all voices with a new affection as of a land no longer sucking its sustenance from other lands but sound and sweet the worthy heart once more of a great commonwealth of countries  all this i seem to see if certain things are done now and persevered in hereafter but let none think that we can restore selfrespect and the landspirit to this country under the mere momentary pressure of our presentday need such a transformation cannot come unless we are genuinely ashamed that britain should be a sponge unless we truly wish to make her again sound metal ringing true instead of a splayfooted creature dependent for vital nourishment on oversea suppliesa cockshy for every foe  we are practically secured by nature yet have thrown security to the winds because we cannot feed ourselves we have as good a climate and soil as any in the world not indeed for pleasure but for health and food and yet i am sure we are rotting physically faster than any other people  let the nation put that reflection in its pipe and smoke it day by day for only so shall we emerge from a bad dream and seize again on our birthright  let us dream a little of what we might become let us not crawl on with our stomachs to the ground and not an ounce of vision in our heads for fear lest we be called visionaries and let us rid our minds of one or two noxious superstitions it is not true that country life need mean dull and cloddish life it has in the past because agriculture as been neglected for the false glamour of the towns and village life left to seed down there is no real reason why the villager should not have all he needs of social life and sane amusement village life only wants organising it is not true that country folk must be worse fed and worse plenished than town folk this has only been so sometimes because a starved industry which was losing hope has paid starvation wages it is not true that our soil and climate are of indifferent value for the growth of wheat the contrary is the case the fact which has been lost sight of in the past twenty years must be insisted on nowadays that england is naturally one of the best if not the very best wheatgrowing country in the world its climate and soil are almost ideal for the production of the heaviest crops professor r h biffen the view of leading german agriculturists is that their soils and climate are distinctly inferior to those of britain mr t h middleton assistant secretary to the board of agriculture  we have many mouths in this country but no real excuse for not growing the wherewithal to feed them  to break the chains of our lethargy and superstitions let us keep before us a thought and a visionthe thought that since the air is mastered and there are pathways under the sea we the proudest people in the world will exist henceforth by mere merciful accident until we grow our own food and the vision of ourselves as a finer race in body and mind than we have ever yet been and then let us be practical by all means for in the practical measures of the present spurred on by that thought inspired by that vision alone lies the hope and safety of the future  what are those measures   ii  wheat  the measure which underlies all else is the ploughing up of permanent grassthe reconversion of land which was once arable the addition to arable of land which has never been arable so as to secure the only possible basis of successthe wheat basis  i have before me a report on the breaking up of grass land in fiftyfive counties for the winter of 19161917 which shows four successes for every failure the report says it has been argued during the past few months that it is hopeless to attempt to plough out old grass land in the expectation of adding to the nations food the experience of 1917 does not support this contention it shows not only that the successes far outnumber the failures but that the latter are to some extent preventable  the governments 1918 tillage programme for england and wales was to increase as compared with 1916 1 the area under corn by 2600000 acres 2 the area under potatoes and mangolds by 400000 acres 3 the arable land by 2000000 acres i have it on the best authority that the government hopes to better this in the forthcoming harvest that shows what our farmers can do with their backs to the wall it sometimes happens in this world that we act virtuously without in any way believing that virtue is its own reward most of our farmers are hoeing their rows in this crisis in the full belief that they are serving the country to the hurt of their own interests they will not i imagine realise that they are laying the foundations of a future prosperity beyond their happiest dreams until the crisis is long past all the more credit to them for a great effort they by no means grasp at present the fact that with every acre they add to arable with each additional acre of wheat they increase their own importance and stability and set the snowball of permanent prosperity in their industry rolling anew pasture was a policy adopted by men who felt defeat in their bones saw bankruptcy round every corner those who best know seem agreed that after the war the price of wheat will not come down with a run the world shortage of food and shipping will be very great and the new worlds surplus will be small let our farmers take their courage in their hands play a bold game and back their own horse for the next four or five seasons and they will if supported by the country be in a position once more to defy competition let them have faith and go for the gloves and they will end by living without fear of the new worlds there is a tide in the affairs of men this is the british farmers tide which taken at the flood leads on to fortune but only if the british farmer intends that britain shall feed herself only if he farms the land of britain so that acre by acre it yields the maximum of food a hundred acres under potatoes feeds 420 persons a hundred acres under wheat feeds 200 persons a hundred acres of grass feeds fifteen persons it requires no expert to see that the last is the losing horse for increase of arable means also increase of winter food and in the long run increase not decrease of live stock in denmark 1912 arable was to permanent grass as about 4 to 5 in the united kingdom it was only as about 5 to 7 yet in denmark there were five cattle to every eight acres of grass and in the united kingdom only four cattle to every nine acres  let me quote professor biffen on the prospects of wheat in the united states the amount exported tends to fall the results are so marked that we find american agricultural experts seriously considering the possibility of the united states having to become a wheat importing country in order to feed the rapidly growing population when she does that wheat will come from canada and there are several other facts which lead one to question the statement so frequently made that canada will shortly be the empires granary he thinks that the argentine which trebles her population every forty years is an uncertain source that russia where the population also increases with extreme rapidity is still more uncertain that neither india nor australia are dependable fields of supply the worlds crop continues to increase slowly and concurrently the number of wheat consumers increases prices have tended to rise of late years a fact which may indicate that the worlds consumption is increasing faster than its rate of production there are now no vast areas of land comparable with those of north and south america awaiting the pioneer wheat growers and consequently there is no likelihood of any repetition of the overproduction characteristic of the period of 18741894  if as there is every reason to hope the problem of breeding satisfactory strong wheats for this country has been solved then their cultivation should add about £1 to the value of the produce of every acre of wheat in the country  at a rough estimate the careful use of artificials might increase the average yield of the acre from four quarters up to five  england is one of the best if not the very best wheatgrowing country in the world  that shortly is the wheat position for this country in the view of our most brilliant practical expert i commend it to the notice of those who are fainthearted about the future of wheat in britain  with these prospects and possibilities before him and a fair price for wheat guaranteed him is the british farmer going to let down the land to grass again when the war is over the fair price for wheat will be the point on which his decision will turn when things have settled down after the war the fair price will be that at which the average farmer can profitably grow wheat and such a price must be maintainedby bounty if necessary it never can be too often urged on politicians and electorate that they who thwart a policy which makes wheatgrowing firm and profitable are knocking nails in the coffin of their country we are no longer and never shall again be an island the air is henceforth as simple an avenue of approach as piccadilly is to leicester square if we are ever attacked there will be no time to get our second wind unless we can feed ourselves and since we are constitutionally liable to be caught napping we shall infallibly be brought to the german heel next time if we are not selfsupporting but if we are there will be no next time an attempt on us will not be worth the cost further we are running to seed physically from too much townlife and the failure of country stocks we shall never stem that rot unless we reestablish agriculture on a large scale to do that in the view of nearly all who have thought this matter out we must found our farming on wheat grow fourfifths instead of onefifth of our supply and all else will follow  in england and wales 11246106 acres were arable land in 1917 and 15835375 permanent grass land to reverse these figures at least is the condition of security perhaps even of existence in the present and the only guarantee of a decent and safe future   iii  holdings  one expert pins faith to large farms another to small holdings how agreeable to think that both are right we cannot afford to neglect any type of holding all must be developed and supported for all serve vital purposes for instance the great development of small holdings in germany is mainly responsible for the plentiful supply of labour on the land there until measures can be devised for greatly increasing the area under holdings of less than 100 acres in britain we are not likely to breed and maintain in the country a sufficient number of that class of worker which will be required if we are greatly to extend our arable land mr t h middleton assistant secretary to the board of agriculture but i am not going into the pros and cons of the holdings question i desire rather to point out here that a moment is approaching which will never come again for the resettling of the land  a rough census taken in 1916 among our soldiers gave the astounding figure of 750000 desirous of going on the land that figure will shrink to a mere skeleton unless on demobilisation the government is ready with a comprehensive plan the men fall roughly into two classes those who were already on the land those who were not the first will want to go back to their own districts but not to the cottages and wages they had before the war for them it is essential to provide new cottages with larger gardens otherwise they will go to the dominions to america or to the towns a fresh census should be taken and kept up to date the wants of each man noted and a definite attempt made now to earmark sites and material for building to provide the garden plots and plan the best and prettiest type of cottage for lack of labour and material no substantial progress can be made with housing while the war is on but if a man can see his cottage and his ground ready in the air he will wait if he cannot he will be off and we shall have lost him wages are not to fall again below twentyfive shillings and will probably stay at a considerably higher level the cottage and the garden ground for these men will be the determining factor and that garden ground should be at least an acre a larger class by far will be men who were not on the land but having tasted openair life think they wish to continue it a fresh census of this class and their wants should be taken also it will subdivide them into men who want the life of independent medium and small holders with from 100 to 20 acres of land and men who with 5 or 10 acres of their own are willing to supplement their living by seasonal work on the large farms for all a cutanddried scheme providing land and homes is absolutely essential if they cannot be assured of having these within a few months of their return to civil life they will go either to the dominions or back to the towns one of them i am told thus forecasts their future wants when were free we shall have a big spree in the town we shall then take the first job that comes along if its an indoor job we shant be able to stick it and shall want to get on the land i am pretty sure hes wrong he will want his spree of course but if he is allowed to go back to a town job he is not at all likely to leave it again men so soon get used to things and the towns have a fierce grip for this second class no less than the first it is vital to have the land ready and the cottages estimated for i think men of both these classes when free should be set at once to the building of their own homes and the preparation of their land i think huts ought to be ready for them and their wives till their homes are habitable a man who takes a hand in the building of his house and the first work on his new holding is far less likely to abandon his idea of settling on the land than a man who is simply dumped into a readymade concern that is human nature let him begin at the beginning and while his house is going up be assisted and instructed frankly i am afraid that in the difficulty of fixing on an ideal scheme and ideal ways of working it we shall forget that the moment of demobilisation is unique any scheme however rough and ready which will fix men or their intention of settling on the land in britain at the moment of demobilisation will be worth a hundred betterlaid plans which have waited for perfection till that one precious moment is overpast while doctors quarrel or lay their heads together the patient dies  the government i understand have adopted a scheme by which they can secure land if they have not ascertained from these men what land they will want and secured that land by the time the men are ready that scheme will be of little use to them  the government i gather have decided on a huge scheme for urban and rural housing about that i have this to say the rural housing ought to take precedence of the urban not because it is more intrinsically necessary but because if the moment of demobilisation is let slip for want of rural cottages we shall lose our very life blood our future safety perhaps our existence as a nation we must seize on this one precious chance of restoring the land and guaranteeing our future the towns can wait a little for their housing the country cannot it is a sort of test question for our leaders in every party surely they will rise to the vital necessity of grasping this chance if when the danger of starvation has been staring us hourly in the face for years on end and we have for once men in hundreds of thousands waiting and hoping to be settled on the land to give us the safety of the futureif in such circumstances we cannot agree to make the most of that chance it will show such lack of vision that i really feel we may as well throw up the sponge if jealousy by towns of country can so blind public opinion to our danger and our chance so that no precedence can be given to rural needs well then frankly we are not fit to live as a nation  i am told that germany has seen to this matter she does not mean to be starved in the future she intends to keep the backbone of her country sound she who already grew 80 per cent of her food will grow it all she who already appreciated the dangers of a rampant industrialism will take no further risks with the physique of her population we who did not grow onehalf of our food and whose riotous industrialism has made far greater inroads on our physique we who though we have not yet suffered the privations of germany have been in far more real dangerwe shall talk about it say how grave the situation is how profoundly we are impressed by the need to feed ourselvesand we shall act i am very much afraid too late  there are times when the proverb act in haste and repent at leisure should be written unless you act in haste you will repent at leisure this is such a time we can take of course the right steps or the wrong steps to settle our soldiers on the land but no wrong step we can take will be so utterly wrong as to let the moment of demobilisation slip we have a good and zealous minister of agriculture we have good men alive to the necessity working on this job if we miss the chance it will be because interests purblind selfish and perverse and a lethargic public opinion do not back them because we want to talk it out because trade and industry think themselves of superior importance to the land henceforth trade and industry are of secondary importance in this country there is only one thing of absolutely vital importance and that is agriculture   iv  instruction  i who have lived most of my time on a farm for many years in daily contact with farmer and labourer do really appreciate what variety and depth of knowledge is wanted for good farming it is a lesson to the armchair reformer to watch a farmer walking across the home meadow whence he can see a good way over his land one can feel the slow wisdom working in his head a halt a look this way and that a whistle the call of some instruction so vernacular that only a native could understand the contemplation of sheep beasts sky crops always something being noted and shrewd deductions made therefrom it is a great art and like all art to be learned only with the sweat of the brow and a long minute attention to innumerable details you cannot play at farming and you cannot mug it up one understands the contempt of the farmer born and bred for the bookskilled gentleman who tries to instruct his grandmother in the sucking of eggs the farmers knowledge acquired through years of dumb wrestling with nature in his own particular corner is his strength andhis weakness vision of the land at large of its potentialities and its needs is almost of necessity excluded the practical farmers of our generation might well be likened unto sailingship seamen in an age when it has suddenly become needful to carry commerce by steam they are pupils of the stern taskmaster bankruptcy the children of the years from 18741897 when the nation had turned its thumb down on british farmers and left them to fight unaided against extinction they have been brought up to carry on against contrary winds and save themselves as best they could well they have done it and now they are being asked to reverse their processes in the interests of a country which left them in the lurch naturally they are not yet persuaded that the country will not leave them in the lurch again  instruction of the british farmer begins with the fortification of his will by confidence when you ask him to plough up grass land to revise the rotation of his crops to grow wheat to use new brands of corn to plough with tractors and to cooperate you are asking a man deeply and deservedly cynical about your intentions and your knowledge he has seen wheat fail all his life he has seen grass succeed grass has saved him and now he is asked to turn his back on it little wonder that he curses you for a meddling fool prove it he saysand you cannot you could if you had it in your power to show him that your guarantee of a fair price for wheat was good as the bank thus the first item of instruction to the farmer consists in the definite alteration of public opinion towards the land by adoption of the sine quâ non that in future we will feed ourselves the majority of our farmers do not think their interests are being served by the present revolution of farming patriotic fear for the country and dread of doranot quite the same thingare driving them on besides it is the townsmen of britain not the farmers who are in danger of starvation not merely now but henceforth for evermore until we feed ourselves if starvation really knocked at our doors the only houses it would not enter would be the houses of those who grow food the farmers in germany are all right they would be all right here the townsmen of this country were entirely responsible for our present condition and the very least they can do is to support their own salvation but while with one corner of their mouths the towns are now shouting grow food feed us please with the other they are still inclined to add you pampered industry alas we cannot have it both ways  the second point i want to make about instruction is the importance of youth in america where they contemplate a labour shortage of 2000000 men on their farms they are using boys from sixteen to twentyone when their military age begins can we not do the same here most of our boys from fifteen to eighteen are now on other work but the work they are doing could surely be done by girls or women if we could put even a couple of hundred thousand boys of that age on the land it would be the solution of our present agricultural labour shortage and the very best thing that could happen for the future of farming the boys would learn at first hand they would learn slowly and thoroughly and many of them would stay on the land they might be given specialised schooling in agriculture the most important schooling we can give our rising generation while all of them would gain physically by employing women on the land where we can employ boys of from fifteen to eighteen we are blindalleying women will not stay on the land in any numbers few will wish that they should boys will and every one would wish that they may  the third point i want to make concerns the model farm if we are to have resettlement on any large scale and base our farming on crops in future the accessibility of the best practical advice is an absolute essential  till reformed education begins to take effect the advice and aid of model farmers should be available in every district some recognised diploma might with advantage be given to farmers for outstanding merit and enterprise no instruction provided from our advisory agricultural councils or colleges can have as much prestige and use in any district as the advice of the leading farmer who had been crowned as a successful expert it is ever well in this country to take advantage of the competitive spirit which lies deep in the bones of our race to give the best farmers a position and prestige to which other farmers can aspire would speed up effort everywhere we want more competition in actual husbandry and less competition in matters of purchase and sale and that brings us to the vital question of cooperation   v  cooperation small holdings  the most important economic question for all nations in the past has been and in the future will be the question of a sufficient food supply independent of imports  it is doubtful whether the replacement of german agriculture on a sound basis in the last ten years is to be ascribed in a greater measure to technical advance in agricultural methods or to the development of the cooperative system perhaps it would be right to say that for the large farms it is due to the first and for the smaller farms three quarters of the arable land in germany to the second for it is only through cooperation that the advantages of farming on a large scale are made possible for smaller farmers the more important of those advantages are the regulated purchase of all raw materials and halffinished products artificial manures feeding stuffs seeds etc better prices for products facilities for making use in moderation of personal credit at a cheap rate of interest together with the possibility of saving and putting aside small sums of interest all these advantages of the large farmer have been placed within the reach of the small farmers by local cooperative societies for buying selling and farming cooperatively as well as by saving and other banks all connected to central associations and central cooperative societies  over two million small farmers are organised in germany on cooperative linese  nearly two million small farmers cooperated in germany and herehow many the registrar returns the numbers for 1916 at 1427 small holders  in the view of all authorities cooperation is essential for the success of small farmers and small holders but it needs no brilliant intellect nor any sweep of the imagination to see a truth plainer than the nose on a mans face  there is some reason to hope says mr middleton that after the war agriculturalists will show a greater disposition to cooperate but we cannot expect cooperation to do as much for british agriculture as it has done for the germans who so readily join societies and support cooperative efforts  so much the worse for us  the agricultural organisation society the officially recognised agency for fostering the cooperative principle has recently formed an agricultural wholesale society with a large subscribed capital for the purchase of all farming requirements and the marketing of produce to be at the disposal of all cooperated farmers small holders and allotment holders whose societies are affiliated to the agricultural organisation society this is a step of infinite promise the drawing together of these three classes of workers on the land is in itself a matter of great importance one of the chief complaints of small holders in the past has been that large holders regard them askance the same perhaps applies to the attitude of the small holder to the allotment holder that is all bad men and women on the land should be one big family with interests and sympathies in common and a neighbourly feeling  a leaflet of the agricultural organisation society thus describes a certain cooperative small holdings society with seventeen members renting ninety acres it owns a team of horses cart horsehoe plough ridger harrow cambridge roller marker and hires other implements as required it insures buys and sells cooperatively this year for patriotic reasons wheat and potatoes form the chief crop with sufficient oats barley beans and mangolds to feed the horses and the pigs of which there are many the society last year marketed more fat pigs than the rest of the village and adjoining farms put together  the land on the whole is undoubtedly better cultivated and cropped and supports a far larger head of population per acre than the neighbouring large farms even allowing that the first statement may be disputed the last is beyond dispute and is the important thing to bear in mind about small holdings from the national point of view for every extra man and woman on the land is a credit item in the bank book of the nations future  in addition says the leaflet there is a friendly spirit prevalent among the members who are always willing to help each other and at harvest time combine to gather in the crops  with more land not only some but all the members of this little society could support themselves entirely on their holdings the members value their independence and freedom but recognise the value of combined action and new ideas  now this is exactly what we want for instance these members have found out that the profit on potatoes when homegrown farmyard manure alone was used was only 14s 6d per acre and that a suitable combination of artificial manures gave a profit of £14 12s 6d an acre with double the yield mutual help and the spread of knowledge more men and women on the landthis is the value of the agricultural cooperative movement whose importance to this country it is impossible to overestimate  from letters of small holders i take the following remarks  of course its absolutely necessary that the prospective small holder should have a thorough knowledge of farming  in regard to implements you need as many of some sorts on a small holding as you do on a large farm a small man cant afford to buy all so he has to work at a disadvantage then as to seeds why not buy them wholesale and sell them to the small holder also manures and many other things which the small holder has to pay through the nose for  men with no actual knowledge of land work would rarely succeed whatever financial backing they might receive  about here small holdings are usually let to men who have been tradesmen or pitmen and they of course cannot be expected to make the most of them  when you restrict a farmer to 50 acres he ought to be provided with ample and proper buildings for every kind of stock he wishes to keep  these few remarks which might be supplemented ad libitum illustrate the difficulties and dangers which beset any large scheme of land settlement by our returning soldiers and others such a scheme is bound to fail unless it is based most firmly on cooperation for without that the two absolute essentialsknowledge with the benefit of practical advice and help and assistance by way of cooperative finance and cooperativelyowned implements will be lacking  set the returning soldier down on the land to work it on his own and whatever his goodwill you present the countryside with failure place at his back pooled labour monetary help and knowledge and above all the spirit of mutual aid and you may and i believe will triumph over difficulties which are admittedly very great   vi  cooperation allotments  the growth of allotment gardens is a striking feature of our agricultural development under stimulus of the war they say a million and a half allotment gardens are now being worked on that is no doubt a papery figure nor is it so much the number as what is being done on them that matters romance may have brought up the ninefifteen but it will not bring up potatoes still these new allotments without doubt add very greatly to our food supply give hosts of our town population healthy work in the open air and revive in them that earth instinct which was in danger of being utterly lost the spade is a grand corrective of nerve strain and the more town and factory workers take up allotment gardens the better for each individual and for us all as a race  they say nearly all the ground available round our towns has already been utilised but dora in her wild career may yet wring out another hundred thousand acres i wish her well in this particular activity and the government she serves with such devotion will betray her if when dora is in her graveconsummation devoutly to be wishedher work on allotment gardens is not continued there is always a ring of land round a town like a halo round the moon as the towns girth increases so should that halo and even in time of peace larger and larger not less and less should grow the number of town dwellers raising vegetables fruit and flowers resting their nerves and expanding lungs and muscles with healthy outdoor work  in no direction is the cooperative principle more adaptable or more useful than in the matter of allotment associations  there are now allotment associations in many parts of the country one at winchester has over 1000 tenant members and round the great manufacturing towns many others have been formed  to illustrate the advantages of such cooperation let me quote a little from the hon secretary of the urmston allotments association near manchester though the urmston men had foremost in their mind the aim of producing payable crops  they determined that their allotments should be convenient and comfortable to work and pleasing to look upon it is a delusion often found among novices that ordinary ground takes a long time to get into decent order and is an expensive business but enlightened and energetic men working together can do wonderful things they did them at urmston the ground was only broken up in march 1916 but in the same season splendid crops of peas potatoes and other vegetables were raised by the holders the majority of whom had little or no previous experience of gardening so as to deal with the main needs of the members cooperatively in the most effective manner a trading committee was appointed to advise and make contracts manure lime salt and artificial manures have been ordered collectively and seeds and other gardening requisites arranged for at liberal discounts  besides all this the association has fought the potato wart disease had its soil analyzed educated its members through literature and lectures made roads and fences looked after the appearance of its plots and encouraged flowergrowing finally a neighbourly feeling of friendly emulation has grown up among its members and this is their conclusion the advantages of cooperation are not confined to economy in time and money for the common interest that binds all members to seek the success of the association also provides the means of developing and utilising the individual talents of the members for communal and national purposes  they speak indeed like a book and every word is truewhich is not always the same thing  the agricultural organization society gives every assistance in forming these associations and the more there are of them the greater will be the output of food the strength and knowledge of the individual plotholder the stability of his tenure and the advantage of the nation  mistrust and reserve between workers on the land be they large farmers small farmers or plotholders is the result of combining husbandry with the habits and qualities of the salesman if a mans business is to get the better of his neighbours on market days it will be his pleasure to doubt them on all other days  the cooperative system by conducting purchase and sale impersonally removes half the reason and excuse for curmudgeonery besides securing better prices both at sale and purchase to the disgust of the cynic moral and material advantage here go hand in hand throughout agriculture cooperation will do more than anything else to restore spirit and economy to an industry which had long become dejected suspicious and wasteful and it will help to remove jealousy and distrust between townsmen and countrymen the allotment holder if encouraged and given fixity of tenure or at all events the power of getting fresh ground if he must give up what he hasa vital matterwill become the necessary link between town and country with mind open to the influence of both the more he is brought into working contact with the small holder and the large farmer the better he will appreciate his own importance to the country and ensure theirs but this contact can only be established through some central body and by use of a wholesale society for trading and other purposes such as has just been set up for all classes of cooperated agriculturalists  addressing a recent meeting of its members the chairman of the agricultural organisation society mr leslie scott spoke thuswe have to cover the country with cooperative societies and we have got to get all the farmers in if we can carry out any such scheme as this which will rope in all the farmers of the country what a magnificent position we shall be in you will have your great trading organisation with its central wholesale society you will have your organisation side with the agricultural organisation society at the centre you will be able to use that side for all the ancillary purposes connected with farming and do a great deal in the way of expert assistance and through your electing the board of governors of the agricultural organisation society with the provincial branch committees you will have what is in effect a central parliament in london you will be able to put before the country both locally and here in london the views of the farming community and those views will get from government departments an attention which the farming industry in the past has failed to get you will command a power in the country  and in a letter to mr scott read at the same meeting the present minister of agriculture had this to say about cooperation  farming is a business in which as in every other industry union is strength every farmer should belong to a cooperative society small societies like small farmers must in their turn cooperate the word farmers is intended to include all those who cultivate the land in this sense allotment holders are farmers and i trust that the union of all cultivators of the land in this sense will help to bridge the gap between town and country  that townsman and countryman should feel their interests to be at bottom the same goes to the root of any land revival   vii  valedictory  there are many who contend that the nation will never again allow its rural industry to be neglected and discouraged as it was in the past that the war has taught a lesson which will not soon be forgotten this view of the national temperament is considered by others to be too confident it is the firm conviction of this school that the consumer will speedily return to his old habit of indifference to national stability in the matter of food and that parliament acting at his bidding will manifest equal apathy  these words taken from a leader in the times of february 11th 1918 bring me back to the starting point of these ragged reflections there will be no permanent stablishing of our agriculture no lasting advance towards safety and health if we have not vision and a fixed ideal the ruts of the past were deep and our habit is to walk along without looking to left or right a liberalism worthy of the word should lift its head and see new paths the liberalism of the past bent on the improvement of the people and the growth of goodwill between nations forgot in that absorption to take in the whole truth fixing its eyes on measures which should redeem the evils of the day it did not see that those evils were growing faster than all possible remedy because we had forgotten that a great community bountifully blessed by nature has no business to exist parasitically on the earth produce of other communities and because our position under pure free trade and pure industrialism was making us a tempting bait for aggression and retarding the very goodwill between nations which it desired so earnestly  the human animal perishes if not fed we have gone so far with our happygolucky scheme of existence that it has become necessary to remind ourselves of that so long as we had money we thought we could continue to exist not so henceforth till we feed ourselves again we live on sufferance and dangle before all eyes the apple of discord a selfsupporting britain free from this carking fear would become once more a liberalising power a britain fed from overseas can only be an imperialistic junker armed to the teeth jealous and doubtful of each move by any foreigner prizing quantity not quality indifferent about the condition of his heart such a britain dare not be liberal if it will  the greatest obstacle to a true league of nations with the exception of the condition of russia will be the condition of britain till she can feed herself  i believe in the principle of free trade because it forces man to put his best leg foremost but all is a question of degree in this world it is no use starting a donkey in the derby and bawling in its ear a fair field and no favour especially if all your money is on the donkey all our money is henceforth on our agriculture till we have brought it into its own and that can only be done at present with the help of bounty  the other day a canadian free trader said it all depends on what sort of peace we secure if we have a crushing victory i see no reason why britain should not go on importing her food  fallacypolitically and biologically the worst thing that could happen to us after the war would be a sense of perfect security in which to continue to neglect our agriculture and increase our towns does any man think that a momentary exhaustion of our enemy is going to prevent that huge and vigorous nation from becoming strong again does he believe that we can trust a league of nationsa noble project for which we must all workto prevent war till we have seen it successful for at least a generation does he consider that our national physique will stand another fifty years of rampant industrialism without fresh country stocks to breed from does he suppose that the use of the air and the underparts of the sea is more than just beginning  politically our independence in the matter of food is essential to good will between the nations biologically more country life is essential to british health the improvement of town and factory conditions may do something to arrest degeneration but in my firm conviction it cannot hope to do enough in a land where towns have been allowed to absorb sevenninths of the population andsuch crowded grimy towns  even from the economic point of view it will be far cheaper to restore the countryside and reestablish agriculture on a paying basis than to demolish and rebuild our towns till they become health resorts and behind it all there is this are we satisfied with the trend of our modern civilisation are we easy in our consciences have not machines and the demands of industry run away with our sense of proportion grant for a moment that this age marks the highest water so far of british advance are we content with that highwater mark in health happiness taste beauty we are surely far from the ideal i do not say that restoration of the land will work a miracle but i do say that nothing we can do will benefit us so potently as the redress of balance between town and country life  we are at the parting of the ways the war has brought us realisation and opportunity we can close our eyes again and drift or we can move forward under the star of a new ideal the principle which alone preserves the sanity of nations is the principle of balance not even the most enraged defender of our present condition will dare maintain that we have followed out that principle the scales are loaded in favour of the towns till they almost touch earth unless our eyes are cleared to see that unless our will is moved to set it right we shall bump the ground before another two decades have slipped away and in the mud shall stay an invitation to any trampling heel  i have tried to indicate general measures and considerations vital to the resettlement of the land conscious that some of my readers will have forgotten more than i know and that what could be said would fill volumes but the thought which of all others i have wished to convey is this without vision we perish without apprehension of danger and ardour for salvation in the great body of this people there is no hope of anything save a momentary spurt which will die away and leave us plodding down the hill there are two essentials the farmerand that means every cultivator of the landmust have faith in the vital importance of his work and in the possibility of success the townsman must see and believe that the future of the country and with it his own prosperity is involved in the revival of our agriculture and bound up with our independence of oversea supply without that vision and belief in the townsman the farmer will never regain faith and without that faith of the farmer agriculture will not revive  statesmen may contrive reformers plan farmers struggle on but if there be not conviction in the body politic it will be no use  resettlement of the land and independence of outside food supply is the only hope of welfare and safety for this country fervently believing that i have set down these poor words  1918  e from an essay by the president of the german agricultural council quoted by mr t h middleton of the board of agriculture in his report on the recent development of german agriculture     grotesques  Κυνηδόν   i  the angel Æthereal on his official visit to the earth in 1947 paused between the bank and the stock exchange to smoke a cigarette and scrutinise the passersby  how they swarm he said and with what seeming energyin such an atmosphere of what can they be made  of money sir replied his dragoman in the past the present or the future stocks are booming the barometer of joy stands very high nothing like it has been known for thirty years not indeed since the days of the great skirmish  there is then a connection between joy and money remarked the angel letting smoke dribble through his chiselled nostrils  such is the common belief though to prove it might take time i will however endeavour to do this if you desire it sir  i certainly do said the angel for a less joyouslooking crowd i have seldom seen between every pair of brows there is a furrow and no one whistles  you do not understand returned his dragoman nor indeed is it surprising for it is not so much the money as the thought that some day you need no longer make it which causes joy  if that day is coming to all asked the angel why do they not look joyful  it is not so simple as that sir to the majority of these persons that day will never come and many of them know itthese are called clerks to some amongst the others even it will not comethese will be called bankrupts to the rest it will come and they will live at wimblehurst and other islands of the blessed when they have become so accustomed to making money that to cease making it will be equivalent to boredom if not torture or when they are so old that they can but spend it in trying to modify the disabilities of age  what price joy then said the angel raising his eyebrows for that i fancy is the expression you use  i perceive sir answered his dragoman that you have not yet regained your understanding of the human being and especially of the breed which inhabits this country illusion is what we are after without our illusions we might just as well be angels or frenchmen who pursue at all events to some extent the sordid reality known as le plaisir or enjoyment of life in pursuit of illusion we go on making money and furrows in our brows for the process is wearing i speak of course of the bourgeoisie or patriotic classes for the practice of the laborious is different though their illusions are the same  how asked the angel briefly  why sir both hold the illusion that they will one day be joyful through the possession of money but whereas the patriotic expect to make it through the labour of the laborious the laborious expect to make it through the labour of the patriotic  ha ha said the angel  angels may laugh replied his dragoman but it is a matter to make men weep  you know your own business best said the angel i suppose  ah sir if we did how pleasant it would be it is frequently my fate to study the countenances and figures of the population and i find the joy which the pursuit of illusion brings them is insufficient to counteract the confined monotonous and worried character of their lives  they are certainly very plain said the angel  they are sighed his dragoman and getting plainer every day take for instance that one and he pointed to a gentleman going up the steps mark how he is built the top of his grizzled head is narrow the bottom of it broad his body is short and thick and square his legs even thicker and his feet turn out too much the general effect is almost pyramidal again take this one and he indicated a gentleman coming down the steps you could thread his legs and body through a needles eye but his head would defy you mark his boiled eyes his flashing spectacles and the absence of all hair disproportion sir has become endemic  can this not be corrected asked the angel  to correct a thing answered his dragoman you must first be aware of it and these are not no more than they are aware that it is disproportionate to spend six days out of every seven in a countinghouse or factory man sir is the creature of habit and when his habits are bad man is worse  i have a headache said the angel the noise is more deafening than it was when i was here in 1910  yes sir since then we have had the great skirmish an event which furiously intensified moneymaking we like every other people have ever since been obliged to cultivate the art of getting five out of twoandtwo the progress of civilisation has been considerably speeded up thereby and everything but man has benefited even horses for they are no longer overloaded and overdriven up tower hill or any other  how is that asked the angel if the pressure of work is greater  because they are extinct said his dragoman entirely superseded by electric and air traction as you see  you appear to be inimical to money the angel interjected with a penetrating look tell me would you really rather own one shilling than five and sixpence  sir replied his dragoman you are putting the candidate before the caucus as the saying is for money is nothing but the power to purchase what one wants you should rather be inquiring what i want  well what do you said the angel  to my thinking answered his dragoman instead of endeavouring to increase money when we found ourselves so very bankrupt we should have endeavoured to decrease our wants the path of real progress sir is the simplification of life and desire till we have dispensed even with trousers and wear a single clean garment reaching to the knees till we are content with exercising our own limbs on the solid earth the eating of simple food we have grown ourselves the hearing of our own voices and tunes on oaten straws the feel on our faces of the sun and rain and wind the scent of the fields and woods the homely roof and the comely wife unspoiled by heels pearls and powder the domestic animals at play wild birds singing and children brought up to colder water than their fathers it should have been our business to pursue health till we no longer needed the interior of the chemists shop the opticians store the hairdressers the corsetmakers the thousand and one emporiums which patch and prink us promoting our fancies and disguising the ravages which modern life makes in our figures our ambition should have been to need so little that with our present scientific knowledge we should have been able to produce it very easily and quickly and have had abundant leisure and sound nerves and bodies wherewith to enjoy nature art and the domestic affections the tragedy of man sir is his senseless and insatiate curiosity and greed together with his incurable habit of neglecting the present for the sake of a future which will never come  you speak like a book said the angel  i wish i did retorted his dragoman for no book i am able to procure enjoins us to stop this riot and betake ourselves to the pleasurable simplicity which alone can save us  you would be bored stiff in a week said the angel  we should sir replied his dragoman because from our schooldays we are brought up to be acquisitive competitive and restless consider the baby in the perambulator absorbed in contemplating the heavens and sucking its own thumb existence sir should be like that  a beautiful metaphor said the angel  as it is we do but skip upon the hearse of life  you would appear to be of those whose motto is try never to leave things as you find them observed the angel  ah sir responded his dragoman with a sad smile the part of a dragoman is rather ever to try and find things where he leaves them  talking of that said the angel dreamily when i was here in 1910 i bought some marconis for the rise what are they at now  i cannot tell you replied his dragoman in a deprecating voice but this i will say inventors are not only the benefactors but the curses of mankind and will be so long as we do not find a way of adapting their discoveries to our very limited digestive powers the chronic dyspepsia of our civilisation due to the attempt to swallow every pabulum which ingenuity puts before it is so violent that i sometimes wonder whether we shall survive until your visit in 1984  ah said the angel pricking his ears you really think there is a chance  i do indeed his dragoman answered gloomily life is now one long telephone calland whats it all about a tour in darkness a rattling of wheels under a sky of smoke a neverending game of poker  confess said the angel that you have eaten something which has not agreed with you  it is so answered his dragoman i have eaten of modernity the damndest dish that was ever set to lips look at those fellows he went on busy as ants from nine oclock in the morning to seven in the evening and look at their wives  ah yes said the angel cheerily let us look at their wives and with three strokes of his wings he passed to oxford street  look at them repeated his dragoman busy as ants from ten oclock in the morning to five in the evening  plain is not the word for them said the angel sadly what are they after running in and out of these shopholes  illusion sir the romance of business there the romance of commerce here they have got into these habits and as you know it is so much easier to get in than to get out would you like to see one of their homes  no no said the angel starting back and coming into contact with a ladys hat why do they have them so large he asked with a certain irritation  in order that they may have them small next season replied his dragoman the future sir the future the cycle of beauty and eternal hope and incidentally the good of trade grasp that phrase and you will have no need for further inquiry and probably no inclination  one could get american sweets in here i guess said the angel entering   ii  and where would you wish to go today sir asked his dragoman of the angel who was moving his head from side to side like a dromedary in the haymarket  i should like the angel answered to go into the country  the country returned his dragoman doubtfully you will find very little to see there  natheless said the angel spreading his wings  these gasped his dragoman after a few breathless minutes are the chilternsthey will serve any part of the country is now the same shall we descend  alighting on what seemed to be a common he removed the cloud moisture from his brow and shading his eyes with his hand stood peering into the distance on every side as i thought he said there has been no movement since i brought the prime here in 1944 we shall have some difficulty in getting lunch  a wonderfully peaceful spot said the angel  true said his dragoman we might fly sixty miles in any direction and not see a house in repair  let us said the angel they flew a hundred and alighted again  same here said his dragoman this is leicestershire note the rolling landscape of wild pastures  i am getting hungry said the angel let us fly again  i have told you sir remarked his dragoman while they were flying that we shall have the greatest difficulty in finding any inhabited dwelling in the country had we not better alight at blackton or bradleeds  no said the angel i have come for a day in the fresh air  would bilberries serve asked his dragoman for i see a man gathering them  the angel closed his wings and they dropped on to a moor close to an aged man  my worthy wight said the angel we are hungry would you give us some of your bilberries  wot oh ejaculated the ancient party never eard yer comin been flyin by wireless ave yer got an observer i see he added jerking his grizzled chin at the dragoman strike me its the good old dyes o the gryte skirmish over agyne  is this asked the angel whose mouth was already black with bilberries the dialect of rural england  i will interrogate him sir said his dragoman for in truth i am at a loss to account for the presence of a man in the country he took the old person by his last button and led him a little apart returning to the angel who had finished the bilberries he whispered  it is as i thought this is the sole survivor of the soldiers settled on the land at the conclusion of the great skirmish he lives on berries and birds who have died a natural death  i fail to understand answered the angel where is all the rural population where the mansions of the great the thriving farmer the contented peasant the labourer about to have his minimum wage the old the merrie england of 1910  that responded his dragoman somewhat dramatically extending his hand towards the old man that is the rural population and he a cockney hardened in the great skirmish or he could never have stayed the course  what said the angel is no food grown in all this land  not a cabbage replied his dragoman not a mustard and cressoutside the towns that is  i perceive said the angel that i have lost touch with much that is of interest give me i pray a brief sketch of the agricultural movement  why sir replied his dragoman the agricultural movement in this country since the days of the great skirmish when all were talking of resettling the land may be summed up in two words town expansion in order to make this clear to you however i must remind you of the political currents of the past thirty years you will not recollect that during the great skirmish beneath the seeming absence of politics there were germinating the parties of the future a secret but resolute intention was forming in all minds to immolate those who had played any part in politics before and during the important worldtragedy which was then being enacted especially such as continued to hold portfolios or persisted in asking questions in the house of commons as it was then called it was not that people held them to be responsible but nerves required soothing and there is no anodyne as you know sir equal to human sacrifice the politician was as one may sayoff no sooner of course was peace declared than the first real general election was held and it was with a certain chagrin that the old parties found themselves in the soup the parties which had been forming beneath the surface swept the country one called itself the patriotic and was called by its opponents the prussian party the other called itself the laborious and was called by its opponents the loafing party their representatives were nearly all new men in the first flush of peace with which the human mind ever associates plenty they came out on such an even keel that no government could pass anything at all since however it was imperative to find the interest on a national debt of £8000000000 a further election was needed this time though the word peace remained the word plenty had already vanished and the laborious party which having much less to tax felt that it could tax more freely found itself in an overwhelming majority you will be curious to hear sir of what elements this party was composed its solid bulk were the returned soldiers and the other manual workers of the country but to this main body there was added a rump of pundits men of excellent intentions brains and principles such as in old days had been known as radicals and advanced liberals these had joined out of despair feeling that otherwise their very existence was jeopardised to this collocationand to one or two other circumstances as you will presently see sirthe doom of the land must be traced now the laborious party apart from its rump on which it would or could not sitwe shall never know nowhad views about the resettlement of the land not far divergent from those held by the patriotic party and they proceeded to put a scheme into operation which for perhaps a year seemed to have a prospect of success many returned soldiers were established in favourable localities and there was even a disposition to place the country on a selfsufficing basis in regard to food but they had not been in power eighteen months when their rumpwhich as i have told you contained nearly all their principleshad a severe attack of these free tradewhich say what you will follows the line of least resistance and is based on the good of tradewas they perceived endangered and they began to agitate against bonuses on corn and preferential treatment of a pampered industry the bonus on corn was in consequence rescinded in 1924 and in lieu thereof the system of small holdings was extendedon paper at the same time the somewhat stunning taxation which had been placed upon the wealthy began to cause the breakup of landed estates as the general bankruptcy and exhaustion of europe became more and more apparent the notion of danger from future war began to seem increasingly remote and the good of trade became again the one object before every british eye food from overseas was cheapening once more the inevitable occurred country mansions became a drug in the market farmers farmed at a loss small holders went bust daily and emigrated agricultural labourers sought the towns in 1926 the laborious party who had carried the taxation of their opponents to a pitch beyond the power of human endurance got what the racy call the knock and the four years which followed witnessed the bitterest internecine struggle within the memory of every journalist in the course of this strife emigration increased and the land emptied rapidly the final victory of the laborious party in 1930 saw them still propelled by their rump committed among other things to a pure town policy they have never been out of power since the result you see food is now entirely brought from overseas largely by submarine and air service in tabloid form and expanded to its original proportions on arrival by an ingenious process discovered by a german the country is now used only as a subject for sentimental poets and to fly over or by lovers on bicycles at weekends  mon dieu said the angel thoughtfully to me indeed it seems that this must have been a case of oh what a surprise  you are not mistaken sir replied his dragoman people still open their mouths over this consummation it is preeminently an instance of what will happen sometimes when you are not looking even to the english who have been most fortunate in this respect for you must remember that all parties even the pundits have always declared that rural life and all that dont you know is most necessary and have ever asserted that they were fostering it to the utmost but they forgot to remember that our circumstances traditions education and vested interests so favoured town life and the good of trade that it required a real and unparliamentary effort not to take that line of least resistance in fact we have here a very good example of what i told you the other day was our most striking characteristicnever knowing where we are till after the event but what with fog and principles how can you expect we should better be a little town blighter with no constitution and high political principles than your mere healthy country product of a pampered industry but you have not yet seen the other side of the moon  to what do you refer asked the angel  why sir to the glorious expansion of the towns to this i shall introduce you tomorrow if such is your pleasure  is london then not a town asked the angel playfully  london cried his dragoman a mere pleasure village to which real town shall i take you liverchester  anywhere said the angel where i can get a good dinner sosaying he paid the rural population with a smile and spread his wings   iii  the night is yet young said the angel Æthereal on leaving the white heart hostel at liverchester and i have had perhaps too much to eat let us walk and see the town  as you will sir replied his dragoman there is no difference between night and day now that they are using the tides for the provision of electric power  the angel took a note of the fact what do they manufacture here he asked  the entire town returned his dragoman which now extends from the old liverpool to the old manchester as indeed its name implies is occupied with expanding the tabloids of food which are landed in its port from the new worlds this and the town of brister reaching from the old bristol to the old gloucester have had the monopoly of food expansion for the united kingdom since 1940  by what means precisely asked the angel  congenial environment and bacteriology responded his dragoman they walked for some time in silence flying a little now and then in the dirtier streets before the angel spoke again  it is curious he said but i perceive no difference between this town and those i remember on my visit in 1910 save that the streets are better lighted which is not an unmixed joy for they are dirty and full of people whose faces do not please me  ah sir replied his dragoman it is too much to expect that the wonderful darkness which prevailed at the time of the great skirmish could endure then indeed one could indulge the hope that the houses were all built by wren and the people all clean and beautiful there is no poetry now  no said the angel sniffing but there is atmosphere and it is not agreeable  mankind when herded together will smell answered his dragoman you cannot avoid it what with old clothes patchouli petrol fried fish and the fag those five essentials of human life the atmosphere of turner and corot are as nothing  but do you not run your towns to please yourselves said the angel  oh no sir the resistance would be dreadful they run us you see they are so very big and have such prestige besides he added even if we dared we should not know how for though some great and good man once brought us planetrees we english are above getting the best out of life and its conditions and despise light frenchified taste notice the principle which governs this twentymile residential stretch it was intended to be light but how earnest it has all turned out you can tell at a glance that these dwellings belong to the species house and yet are individual houses just as a man belongs to the species man and yet as they say has a soul of his own this principle was introduced off the avenue road a few years before the great skirmish and is now universal any person who lives in a house identical with another house is not known has anything heavier and more conscientious ever been seen  does this principle also apply to the houses of the workingman inquired the angel  hush sir returned his dragoman looking round him nervously a dangerous word the laborious dwell in palaces built after the design of an architect called jerry with communal kitchens and baths  do they use them asked the angel with some interest  not as yet indeed replied his dragoman but i believe they are thinking of it as you know sir it takes time to introduce a custom thirty years is but as yesterday  the japanese wash daily mused the angel  not a christian nation replied his dragoman nor have they the dirt to contend with which is conspicuous here let us do justice to the discouragement which dogs the ablutions of such as know they will soon be dirty again it was confidently supposed at the time of the great skirmish which introduced military discipline and so entirely abolished caste that the habit of washing would at last become endemic throughout the whole population judge how surprised were we of that day when the facts turned out otherwise instead of the laborious washing more the patriotic washed less it may have been the higher price of soap or merely that human life was not very highly regarded at the time we cannot tell but not until military discipline disappeared and caste was restored which happened the moment peace returned did the survivors of the patriotic begin to wash immoderately again leaving the laborious to preserve a level more suited to democracy  talking of levels said the angel is the populace increasing in stature  oh no indeed responded his dragoman the latest statistics give a diminution of one inch and a half during the past generation  and in longevity asked the angel  as to that babies and old people are now communally treated and all those diseases which are curable by lymph are well in hand  do people then not die  oh yes sir about as often as before there are new complaints which redress the balance  and what are those  a group of diseases called for convenience scienticitis some think they come from the present food system others from the accumulation of lymphs in the body others again regard them as the result of dwelling on the subjecta kind of hypnotisation by death a fourth school hold them traceable to town air while a fifth consider them a mere manifestation of jealousy on the part of nature they date one may say with confidence from the time of the great skirmish when mens minds were turned with some anxiety to the question of statistics and babies were at a premium  is the population then much larger  you mean smaller sir do you not not perhaps so much smaller as you might expect but it is still nicely down you see the patriotic party including even those pontificals whose private practice most discouraged all that sort of thing began at once to urge propagation but their propaganda was as one may say brainspun and at once bumped uppardon the colloquialismagainst the economic situation the existing babies it is true were saved the trouble was rather that the babies began not to exist the same of course obtained in every european country with the exception of what was still in a manner of speaking russia and if that country had but retained its homogeneity it would soon by sheer numbers have swamped the rest of europe fortunately perhaps it did not remain homogeneous an incurable reluctance to make food for cannon and impose further burdens on selves already weighted to the ground by taxes developed in the peoples of each central and western land and in the years from 1920 to 1930 the downward curve was so alarming in great britain that if the patriotic party could only have kept office long enough at a time they would no doubt have enforced conception at the point of the bayonet luckily or unluckily according to taste they did not and it was left for more natural causes to produce the inevitable reaction which began to set in after 1930 when the population of the united kingdom had been reduced to some twentyfive millions about that time commerce revived the question of the land had been settled by its unconscious abandonment and people began to see before them again the possibility of supporting families the ingrained disposition of men and women to own pets together with the good of trade began once more to have its way and the population rose rapidly a renewed joy in life and the assurance of not having to pay the piper caused the slums as they used to be called to swarm once more and filled the communal crèches and had it not been for the fact that any one with physical strength or love of fresh air promptly emigrated to the sister nations on attaining the age of eighteen we might now sir be witnessing an overcrowding equal to that of the times before the great skirmish the movement is receiving an added impetus with the approach of the greater skirmish between the teutons and mongolians for it is expected that trade will boom and much wealth accrue to those countries which are privileged to look on with equanimity at this great new drama as the editors are already calling it  in all this said the angel Æthereal i perceive something rather sordid  sir replied his dragoman earnestly your remark is characteristic of the sky where people are not made of flesh and blood pay i believe no taxes and have no experience of the devastating consequences of war i recollect so well when i was a young man before the great skirmish began and even when it had been going on several years how glibly the leaders of opinion talked of human progress and how blind they were to the fact that it has a certain connection with environment you must remember that ever since that large and as some still think rather tragic occurrence environment has been very dicky and utopia not unrelated to thin air it has been perceived time and again that the leaders of public opinion are not always confirmed by events the new world which was so sapiently prophesied by rhetoricians is now nigh thirty years old and for my part i confess to surprise that it is not worse than it actually is i am moralising i fear however for these suburban buildings grievously encourage the philosophic habit rather let us barge along and see the laborious at their labours which are never interrupted now by the mere accident of night  the angel increased his speed till they alighted amid a forest of tall chimneys whose sirens were singing like a watch of nightingales  there is a shift on said the dragoman stand here sir we shall see them passing in and out  the laborious were not hurrying and went by uttering the words cheer oh so long and wot abaht it  the angel contemplated them for a time before he said it comes back to me now how they used to talk when they were doing up my flat on my visit in 1910  give me i pray an imitation said his dragoman  the angel struck the attitude of one painting a door william he said rendering those voices of the past what money are you obtaining  not half alfred  if that is so indeed william should you not rather leave your tools and obtain better money i myself am doing this  not half alfred  round the corner i can obtain more money by working for fewer hours in my opinion there is no use in working for less money when you can obtain more how much does henry obtain  not half alfred  what i am now obtaining is in my opinion no use at all  not half alfred  here the angel paused and let his hand move for one second in a masterly exhibition of activity  it is doubtful sir said his dragoman whether you would be permitted to dilute your conversation with so much labour in these days the rules are very strict  are there then still trades unions asked the angel  no indeed replied his dragoman but there are committees that habit which grew up at the time of the great skirmish has flourished ever since statistics reveal the fact that there are practically no adults in the country between the ages of nineteen and fifty who are not sitting on committees at the time of the great skirmish all committees were nominally active they are now both active and passive in every industry enterprise or walk of life a small active committee directs and a large passive committee formed of everybody else resists that direction and it is safe to say that the passive committees are active and the active committees passive in this way no inordinate amount of work is done indeed if the tongue and the electric button had not usurped practically all the functions of the human hand the state would have some difficulty in getting its boots blacked but a hapoth of visualisation is worth three lectures at ten shillings the stall so enter sir and see for yourself  saying this he pushed open the door  in a shed which extended beyond the illimitable range of the angels eye machinery and tongues were engaged in a contest which filled the ozone with an incomparable hum men and women in profusion were leaning against walls or the pillars on which the great roof was supported assiduously pressing buttons the scent of expanding food revived the angels appetite  i shall require supper he said dreamily  by all means sir replied his dragoman after workplay it will afford you an opportunity to witness modern pleasures in our great industrial centres but what a blessing is electric power he added consider these lilies of the town they toil not neither do they spin  yet solomon in all his glory chipped in the angel eagerly had not their appearance you bet  indeed they are an insouciant crowd mused his dragoman how tinkling is their laughter the habit dates from the days of the great skirmish when nothing but laughter would meet the case  tell me said the angel are the english satisfied at last with their industrial conditions and generally with their mode of life in these expanded towns  satisfied oh dear no sir but you know what it is they are obliged to wait for each fresh development before they can see what they have to counteract and since that great creative force the good of trade is always a little stronger than the forces of criticism and reform each development carries them a little further on the road to  hell how hungry i am again exclaimed the angel let us sup   iv  laughter said the angel Æthereal applying his wineglass to his nose has ever distinguished mankind from all other animals with the exception of the dog and the power of laughing at nothing distinguishes man even from that quadruped  i would go further sir returned his dragoman and say that the power of laughing at that which should make him sick distinguishes the englishman from all other varieties of man except the negro kindly observe he rose and taking the angel by the waist foxtrotted him among the little tables  see he said indicating the other suppertakers with a circular movement of his beard they are consumed with laughter the habit of foxtrotting in the intervals of eating has been known ever since it was introduced by americans a generation ago at the beginning of the great skirmish when that important people had as yet nothing else to do but it still causes laughter in this country a distressing custom he wheezed as they resumed their seats for not only does it disturb the oyster but it compels one to think lightly of the human species not that one requires much compulsion he added now that musichall cinema and restaurant are conjoined what a happy idea that was of berlins and how excellent for business kindly glance for a momentbut not moreat the lefthand stage  the angel turned his eyes towards a cinematograph film which was being displayed he contemplated it for the moment without speaking  i do not comprehend he said at last why the person with the arrested moustaches is hitting so many people with that sack of flour  to cause amusement sir replied his dragoman look at the laughing faces around you  but it is not funny said the angel  no indeed returned his dragoman be so good as to carry your eyes now to the stage on the right but not for long what do you see  i see a very rednosed man beating a very whitenosed man about the body  it is a real scream is it not  no said the angel drily does nothing else ever happen on these stages  nothing stay revues happen  what are revues asked the angel  criticisms of life sir as it would be seen by persons inebriated on various intoxicants  they should be joyous  they are accounted so his dragoman replied but for my part i prefer to criticise life for myself especially when i am drunk  are there no plays no operas asked the angel from behind his glass  not in the old and proper sense of these words they disappeared towards the end of the great skirmish  what food for the mind is there then asked the angel adding an oyster to his collection  none in public sir for it is well recognised and has been ever since those days that laughter alone promotes business and removes the thought of death you cannot recall as i can sir the continual stream which used to issue from theatres musichalls and picturepalaces in the days of the great skirmish nor the joviality of the strand and the more expensive restaurants i have often thought he added with a touch of philosophy what a height of civilisation we must have reached to go jesting as we did to the great unknown  is that really what the english did at the time of the great skirmish asked the angel  it is replied his dragoman solemnly  then they are a very fine people and i can put up with much about them which seems to me distressing  ah sir though being an englishman i am sometimes inclined to disparage the english i am yet convinced that you could not fly a weeks journey and come across another race with such a peculiar nobility or such an unconquerable soul if you will forgive my using a word whose meaning is much disputed may i tempt you with a clam he added more lightly we now have them from americain fair preservation and very nasty they are in my opinion  the angel took a clam  my lord he said after a moment of deglutition  quite so replied his dragoman but kindly glance at the righthand stage again there is a revue on now what do you see  the angel made two holes with his forefingers and thumbs and putting them to his eyes bent a little forward  tut tut he said i see some attractive young females with very few clothes on walking up and down in front of what seem to me indeed to be two grownup men in collars and jackets as of little boys what precise criticism of life is this conveying  his dragoman answered in reproachful accents  do you not feel sir from your own sensations how marvellously this informs one of the secret passions of mankind is there not in it a striking revelation of the natural tendencies of the male population remark how the whole audience including your august self is leaning forward and looking through their thumbholes  the angel sat back hurriedly  true he said i was carried away but that is not the criticism of life which art demands if it had been the audience myself included would have been sitting back with their lips curled dry instead of watering  for all that replied his dragoman it is the best we can give you anything which induces the detached mood of which you spoke has been banned from the stage since the days of the great skirmish it is so very bad for business  pity said the angel imperceptibly edging forward the mission of art is to elevate  it is plain sir said his dragoman that you have lost touch with the world as it is the mission of artnow truly democraticis to levelin principle up in practice down do not forget sir that the english have ever regarded æstheticism as unmanly and grace as immoral when to that basic principle you add the principle of serving the taste of the majority you have perfect conditions for a sure and gradual decrescendo  does taste then no longer exist asked the angel  it is not wholly as yet extinct but lingers in the communal kitchens and canteens as introduced by the young mens christian association in the days of the great skirmish while there is appetite there is hope nor is it wholly discouraging that taste should now centre in the stomach for is not that the real centre of mans activity who dare affirm that from so universal a foundation the fair structure of æstheticism shall not be rebuilt the eye accustomed to the look of dainty dishes and pleasant cookery may once more demand the architecture of wren the sculpture of rodin the paintings ofdear mewhom why sir even before the days of the great skirmish when you were last on earth we had already begun to put the future of æstheticism on a more real basis and were converting the concerthalls of london into hotels few at the time saw the farreaching significance of that movement or realised that æstheticism was to be levelled down to the stomach in order that it might be levelled up again to the head on true democratic principles  but what said the angel with one of his preternatural flashes of acumen what if on the other hand taste should continue to sink and lose even its present hold on the stomach if all else has gone why should not the beauty of the kitchen go  that indeed sighed his dragoman placing his hand on his heart is a thought which often gives me a sinking sensation two liqueur brandies he murmured to the waiter but the stout heart refuses to despair besides advertisements show decided traces of æsthetic advance all the great painters poets and fiction writers are working on them the movement had its origin in the propaganda demanded by the great skirmish you will not recollect the war poetry of that period the patriotic films the death cartoons and other remarkable achievements we have just as great talents now though their object has not perhaps the religious singleness of those stirring times not a food corset or collar which has not its artist working for it toothbrushes nutcrackers babies bathsthe whole caboodle of manufactureare now set to music such themes are considered subliminal if not sublime no sir i will not despair it is only at moments when i have dined poorly that the horizon seems dark listenthey have turned on the kalophone for you must know that all music now is beautifully made by machineso much easier for every one  the angel raised his head and into his eyes came the glow associated with celestial strains  the tune he said is familiar to me  yes sir answered his dragoman for it is the messiah in ragtime no time is wasted you notice all even pleasure is intensively cultivated on the lines of least resistance thanks to the feverishness engendered in us by the great skirmish when no one knew if he would have another chance and to the subsequent need for fostering industry but whether we really enjoy ourselves is perhaps a question to answer which you must examine the english character  that i refuse to do said the angel  and you are wise sir for it is a puzzler and many have cracked their heads over it but have we not been here long enough we can pursue our researches into the higher realms of art tomorrow  a beam from the angels lustrous eyes fell on a lady at the next table yes perhaps we had better go he sighed   v  and so it is through the fields of true art that we shall walk this morning said the angel Æthereal  such as they are in this year of peace 1947 responded his dragoman arresting him before a statue for the development of this hobby has been peculiar since you were here in 1910 when the childlike and contortionist movement was just beginning to take hold of the british  whom does this represent asked the angel  a celebrated publicist recently deceased at a great age you see him unfolded by this work of multiform genius in every aspect known to art religion nature and the population from his knees downwards he is clearly devoted to nature and is portrayed as about to enter his bath from his waist to his knees he is devoted to religionmark the complete disappearance of the human aspect from his neck to his waist he is devoted to public affairs observe the tweed coat the watch chain and other signs of practical sobriety but the head is after all the crown of the human being and is devoted to art this is why you cannot make out that it is a head note its pyramidal severity its cunning little ears its boxbuilt watertightal structure the hair you note to be in flames here we have the touch of beautythe burning shrub in the whole you will observe that aversion from natural form and the single point of view characteristic of all twentiethcentury æsthetics the whole thing is a very great masterpiece of childlike contortionism to do things as irresponsibly as children and contortionistswhat a happy discovery of the line of least resistance in art that was mark by the way this exquisite touch about the left hand  it appears to be deformed said the angel going a step nearer  look closer still returned his dragoman and you will see that it is holding a novel of the great russian upside down ever since that simple master who so happily blended the childlike with the contortionist became known in this country they have been trying to go him one better in letters in painting in sculpture and in music refusing to admit that he was the last cry and until they have beaten him this movement simply cannot cease it may therefore go on for ever for he was the limit that hand symbolises the whole movement  how said the angel  why sir somersault is its mainspring did you never observe the great russians method prepare your characters to do one thing and make them very swiftly do the opposite thus did that terrific novelist demonstrate his overmastering range of vision and knowledge of the depths of human nature since his characters never varied this routine in the course of some eight thousand pages people have lightly said that he repeated himself but what of that consider what perfect dissociation he thereby attained between character and action what nebulosity of fact what a truly childlike and mystic mixup of all human values hitherto known and here sir at the risk of tickling you i must whisper the dragoman made a trumpet of his hand fiction can only be written by those who have exceptionally little knowledge of ordinary human nature and great fiction only by such as have none at all  how is that said the angel somewhat disconcerted  surprise sir is the very kernel of all effects in art and in real life people will act as their characters and temperaments determine that they shall this dreadful and unmalleable trait would have upset all the great mystic masters from generation to generation if they had only noticed it but did they fortunately not these greater men naturally put into their books the greater confusion and flux in which their extraordinary selves exist the nature they portray is not human but super or subterhuman which you will who would have it otherwise  not i said the angel for i confess to a liking for what is called the tuppence coloured but russians are not as other men are they  they are not said his dragoman but the trouble is sir that since the british discovered him every character in our greater fiction has a russian soul though living in cornwall or the midlands in a british body under a scottish or english name  very piquant said the angel turning from the masterpiece before him are there no undraped statues to be seen  in no recognisable form for not being educated to the detached contemplation which still prevailed to a limited extent even as late as the days of the great skirmish the populace can no longer be trusted with such works of art they are liable to rush at them for embrace or demolition as their temperaments may dictate  the greeks are dead then said the angel  as doornails sir they regarded life as a thing to be enjoyeda vice you will not have noticed in the british the greeks were an outdoor people who lived in the sun and the fresh air and had none of the niceness bred by the life of our towns we have long been renowned for our delicacy about the body nor has the tendency been decreased by constituting watch committees of young persons in every borough these are now the arbiters of art and nothing unsuitable to the child of seven passes their censorship  how careful said the angel  the result has been wonderful remarked his dragoman wonderful he repeated dreamily i suppose there is more smouldering sexual desire and disease in this country than in any other  was that the intention asked the angel  oh no sir that is but the natural effect of so remarkably pure a surface all is within instead of without nature has now wholly disappeared the process was sped up by the great skirmish for since then we have had little leisure and income to spare on the gratification of anything but laughter this and the uncoguid have made our artsurface glare in the eyes of the nations thin and spotless as if made of tin  the angel raised his eyebrows i had hoped for better things he said  you must not suppose sir pursued his dragoman that there is not plenty of the undraped so long as it is vulgar as you saw just now upon the stage for that is good business the line is only drawn at the dangerpoint of art which is always very bad business in this country yet even in real life the undraped has to be grotesque to be admitted the one fatal quality is natural beauty the laugh sir the laugheven the most hideous and vulgar laughis such a disinfectant i should however say in justice to our literary men that they have not altogether succumbed to the demand for cachinnations a school which first drew breath before the great skirmish began has perfected itself till now we have whole tomes where hardly a sentence would be intelligible to any save the initiate this enables them to defy the watch committees with other philistines we have writers who mysteriously preach the realisation of self by never considering anybody else of purity through experience of exotic vice of courage through habitual cowardice and of kindness through prussian behaviour they are generally young we have others whose fiction consists of autobiography interspersed with philosophic and political fluencies these may be of any age from eighty odd to the bitter thirties we have also the copious and chatty novelist and transcribers of the life of the laborious whom the laborious never read above all we have the great patriotic school who put the national motto first and write purely what is good for trade in fact we have every sort as in the old days  it would appear said the angel that the arts have stood somewhat still  except for a more external purity and a higher internal corruption replied his dragoman  are artists still noted for their jealousies asked the angel  they are sir for that is inherent in the artistic temperament which is extremely touchy about fame  and do they still get angry when those gentlementhe  critics his dragoman suggested they get angry sir but critics are usually anonymous and from excellent reasons for not only are the passions of an angry artist very high but the knowledge of an angry critic is not infrequently very low especially of art it is kinder to save life where possible  for my part said the angel i have little regard for human life and consider that many persons would be better buried  that may be his dragoman retorted with some irritation errare est humanum but i for one would rather be a dead human being any day than a live angel for i think they are more charitable  well said the angel genially you have the prejudice of your kind have you an artist about the place to show me i do not recollect any at madame tussauds  they have taken to declining that honour we could see one in real life if we went to cornwall  why cornwall  i cannot tell you sir there is something in the air which affects their passions  i am hungry and would rather go to the savoy said the angel walking on  you are in luck whispered his dragoman when they had seated themselves at a table covered with prawns for at the next on your left is our most famous exponent of the mosaic school of novelism  then here goes replied the angel and turning to his neighbour he asked pleasantly how do you do sir what is your income  the gentleman addressed looked up from his prawn and replied wearily ask my agent he may conceivably possess the knowledge you require  answer me this at all events said the angel with more dignity if possible how do you write your books for it must be wonderful to summon around you every day the creatures of your imagination do you wait for afflatus  no said the author erno ier he added weightily sit down every morning  the angel rolled his eyes and turning to his dragoman said in a wellbred whisper he sits down every morning my lord how good for trade   vi  a glass of sherry dry and ham sandwich stale can be obtained here sir said the dragoman and for dessert the scent of parchment and bananas we will then attend court 45 where i shall show you how fundamentally our legal procedure has changed in the generation that has elapsed since the days of the great skirmish  can it really be that the law has changed i had thought it immutable said the angel causing his teeth to meet with difficulty what will be the nature of the suit to which we shall listen  i have thought it best sir to select a divorce case lest you should sleep overcome by the ozone and eloquence in these places  ah said the angel i am ready  the court was crowded and they took their seats with difficulty and a lady sitting on the angels left wing  the public will frequent this class of case whispered his dragoman how different when you were here in 1910  the angel collected himself tell me he murmured which of the greyhaired ones is the judge  he in the bagwig sir returned his dragoman and that little lot is the jury he added indicating twelve gentlemen seated in two rows  what is their private life asked the angel  no better than it should be perhaps responded his dragoman facetiously but no one can tell that from their words and manner as you will presently see these are special ones he added and pay income tax so that their judgment in matters of morality is of considerable value  they have wise faces said the angel which is the prosecutor  no no his dragoman answered vividly this is a civil case that is the plaintiff with a little mourning about her eyes and a touch of red about her lips in the black hat with the aigrette the pearls and the fashionably sober clothes  i see her said the angel an attractive woman will she win  we do not call it winning sir for this as you must know is a sad matter and implies the breakingup of a home she will most unwillingly receive a decree at least i think so he added though whether it will stand the scrutiny of the kings proctor we may wonder a little from her appearance  kings proctor said the angel what is that  a celestial diehard sir paid to join together again those whom man have put asunder  i do not follow said the angel fretfully  i perceive whispered his dragoman that i must make clear to you the spirit which animates our justice in these matters you know of course that the intention of our law is ever to penalise the wrongdoer it therefore requires the innocent party like that lady there to be exceptionally innocent not only before she secures her divorce but for six months afterwards  oh said the angel and where is the guilty party  probably in the south of france returned his dragoman with the new partner of his affections they have a place in the sun this one a place in the law courts  dear me said the angel does she prefer that  there are ladies his dragoman replied who find it a pleasure to appear no matter where so long as people can see them in a pretty hat but the great majority would rather sink into the earth than do this thing  the face of this one is most agreeable to me i should not wish her to sink said the angel warmly  agreeable or not resumed his dragoman they have to bring their hearts for inspection by the public if they wish to become free from the party who has done them wrong this is necessary for the penalisation of the wrongdoer  and how will he be penalised asked the angel naïvely  by receiving his freedom returned his dragoman together with the power to enjoy himself with his new partner in the sun until in due course he is able to marry her  this is mysterious to me murmured the angel is not the boot on the wrong leg  oh sir the law would not make a mistake like that you are bringing a single mind to the consideration of this matter but that will never do this lady is a true and muchwronged wife that islet us hope soto whom our law has given its protection and remedy but she is also in its eyes somewhat reprehensible for desiring to avail herself of that protection and remedy for though the law is now purely the affair of the state and has nothing to do with the appointed it still secretly believes in the religious maxim once married always married and feels that however much a married person is neglected or illtreated she should not desire to be free  she said the angel does a man never desire to be free  oh yes sir and not infrequently  does your law then not consider him reprehensible in that desire  in theory perhaps but there is a subtle distinction for sir as you observe from the countenances before you the law is administered entirely by males and males cannot but believe in the divine right of males to have a better time than females and though they do not say so they naturally feel that a husband wronged by a wife is more injured than a wife wronged by a husband  there is much in that said the angel but tell me how the oracle is workedfor it may come in handy  you allude sir to the necessary procedure i will make this clear there are two kinds of cases what i may call the ok and what i may call the rig now in the ok it is only necessary for the plaintiff if it be a woman to receive a black eye from her husband and to pay detectives to find out that he has been too closely in the company of another if it be a man he need not receive a black eye from his wife and has merely to pay the detectives to obtain the same necessary information  why this difference between the sexes asked the angel  because answered his dragoman woman is the weaker sex things are therefore harder for her  but said the angel the english have a reputation for chivalry  they have sir  well began the angel  when these conditions are complied with interrupted his dragoman a suit for divorce may be brought which may or may not be defended now the rig which is always brought by the wife is not so simple for it must be subdivided into two sections ye straight rig and ye crooked rig ye straight rig is where the wife cannot induce her husband to remain with her and discovering from him that he has been in the close company of another wishes to be free of him she therefore tells the court that she wishes him to come back to her and the court will tell him to go back whereon if he obey the fat is sometimes in the fire if however he obeys not which is the more probable she may after a short delay bring a suit adducing the evidence she has obtained and receive a decree this may be the case before you or on the other hand it may not and will then be what is called ye crooked rig if that is so these two persons having found that they cannot live in conjugal friendliness have laid their heads together for the last time and arranged to part the procedure will now be the same as in ye straight rig but the wife must take the greatest care to lead the court to suppose that she really wishes her husband to come back for if she does not it is collusion the more ardent her desire to part from him the more care she must take to pretend the opposite but this sort of case is after all the simplest for both parties are in complete accord in desiring to be free of each other so neither does anything to retard that end which is soon obtained  about that evidence said the angel what must the man do  he will require to go to an hotel with a lady friend replied his dragoman once will be enough and provided they are called in the morning there is no real necessity for anything else  hm said the angel this indeed seems to me to be all around about the bush could there not be some simple method which would not necessitate the perversion of the truth  ah no responded his dragoman you forget what i told you sir however unhappy people may be together our law grudges their separation it requires them therefore to be immoral or to lie or both before they can part  curious said the angel  you must understand sir that when a man says he will take a woman and a woman says she will take a man for the rest of their natural existence they are assumed to know all about each other though not permitted of course by the laws of morality to know anything of real importance since it is almost impossible from a modest acquaintanceship to make sure whether they will continue to desire each others company after a completed knowledge they are naturally disposed to go it blind if i may be pardoned the expression and will take each other for ever on the smallest provocations for the human being sir makes nothing of the words for ever when it sees immediate happiness before it you can well understand therefore how necessary it is to make it very hard for them to get untied again  i should dislike living with a wife if i were tired of her said the angel  sir returned his dragoman confidentially in that sentiment you would have with you the whole male population and i believe the whole of the female population would feel the same if they were tired of you as the husband  that said the angel with a quiet smile  ah yes sir but does not this convince you of the necessity to force people who are tired of each other to go on living together  no said the angel with appalling frankness  well his dragoman replied soberly i must admit that some have thought our marriage laws should be in a museum for they are unique and though a source of amusement to the public and emolument to the profession they pass the comprehension of men and angels who have not the key of the mystery  what key asked the angel  i will give it you sir said his dragoman the english have a genius for taking the shadow of a thing for its substance so long they say as our marriages our virtue our honesty and happiness seem to be they are so long therefore as we do not dissolve a marriage it remains virtuous honest and happy though the parties to it may be unfaithful untruthful and in misery it would be regarded as awful sir for marriage to depend on mutual liking we english cannot bear the thought of defeat to dissolve an unhappy marriage is to recognise defeat by life and we would rather that other people lived in wretchedness all their days than admit that members of our race had come up against something too hard to overcome the english do not care about making the best out of this life in reality so long as they can do it in appearance  then they believe in a future life  they did to some considerable extent up to the eighties of the last century and their laws and customs were no doubt settled in accordance therewith and have not yet had time to adapt themselves we are a somewhat slowmoving people always a generation or two behind our real beliefs  they have lost their belief then  it is difficult to arrive at figures sir on such a question but it has been estimated that perhaps one in ten adults now has some semblance of what may be called active belief in a future existence  and the rest are prepared to let their lives be arranged in accordance with the belief of that tenth asked the angel surprised tell me do they think their matrimonial differences will be adjusted over there or what  as to that all is cloudy and certain matters would be difficult to adjust without bigamy for general opinion and the law permit the remarriage of persons whose first has gone before  how about children said the angel for that is no inconsiderable item i imagine  yes sir they are a difficulty but here again my key will fit so long as the marriage seems real it does not matter that the children know it isnt and suffer from the disharmony of their parents  i think said the angel acutely there must be some more earthly reason for the condition of your marriage laws than those you give me its all a matter of property at bottom i suspect  sir said his dragoman seemingly much struck i should not be surprised if you were right there is little interest in divorce where no money is involved and our poor are considered able to do without it but i will never admit that this is the reason for the state of our divorce laws no no i am an englishman  well said the angel we are wandering does this judge believe what they are now saying to him  it is impossible to inform you for judges are very deep and know all that is to be known on these matters but of this you may be certain if anything is fishy to the average apprehension he will not suffer it to pass his nose  where is the average apprehension asked the angel  there sir said his dragoman pointing to the jury with his chin noted for their common sense  and these others with grey heads who are calling each other friend though they appear to be inimical  little can be hid from them returned his dragoman but this case though defended as to certain matters of money is not disputed in regard to the divorce itself moreover they are bound by professional etiquette to serve their clients through thin and thick  cease said the angel i wish to hear this evidence and so does the lady on my left wing  his dragoman smiled in his beard and made no answer  tell me remarked the angel when he had listened does this woman get anything for saying she called them in the morning  fie sir responded his dragoman only her expenses to the court and back though indeed it is possible that after she had called them she got half a sovereign from the defendant to impress the matter on her mind seeing that she calls many people every day  the whole matter said the angel with a frown appears to be in the nature of a game nor are the details as savoury as i expected  it would be otherwise if the case were defended sir returned his dragoman then too you would have had an opportunity of understanding the capacity of the human mind for seeing the same incident to be both black and white but it would take much of your valuable time and the court would be so crowded that you would have a lady sitting on your right wing also and possibly on your knee for as you observe ladies are particularly attached to these dramas of real life  if my wife were a wrong one said the angel i suppose that according to your law i could not sew her up in a sack and place it in the water  we are not now in the days of the great skirmish replied his dragoman somewhat coldly at that time any soldier who found his wife unfaithful as we call it could shoot her with impunity and receive the plaudits and possibly a presentation from the populace though he himself may not have been impeccable while awaya masterly method of securing a divorce but as i told you our procedure has changed since then and even soldiers now have to go to work in this roundabout fashion  can he not shoot the paramour asked the angel  not even that answered his dragoman so soft and degenerate are the days though if he can invent for the paramour a german name he will still receive but a nominal sentence our law is renowned for never being swayed by sentimental reasons i well recollect a case in the days of the great skirmish when a jury found contrary to the plainest facts sooner than allow that reputation for impartiality to be tarnished  ah said the angel absently what is happening now  the jury are considering their verdict the conclusion is however foregone for they are not retiring the plaintiff is now using her smelling salts  she is a fine woman said the angel emphatically  hush sir the judge might hear you  what if he does asked the angel in surprise  he would then eject you for contempt of court  does he not think her a fine woman too  for the love of justice sir be silent entreated his dragoman this concerns the happiness of three if not of five lives look she is lifting her veil she is going to use her handkerchief  i cannot bear to see a woman cry said the angel trying to rise please take this lady off my left wing  kindly sit tight murmured his dragoman to the lady leaning across behind the angels back listen sir he added to the angel the jury are satisfied that what is necessary has taken place all is well she will get her decree  hurrah said the angel in a loud voice  if that noise is repeated i will have the court cleared  i am going to repeat it said the angel firmly she is beautiful  his dragoman placed a hand respectfully over the angels mouth oh sir he said soothingly do not spoil this charming moment hark he is giving her a decree nisi with costs tomorrow it will be in all the papers for it helps to sell them see she is withdrawing we can now go and he disengaged the angels wing  the angel rose quickly and made his way towards the door i am going to walk out with her he announced joyously  i beseech you said his dragoman hurrying beside him remember the kings proctor where is your chivalry for he has none sirnot a little bit  bring him to me i will give it him said the angel kissing the tips of his fingers to the plaintiff who was vanishing in the gloom of the fresh air   vii  in the strangers room of the strangers club the usual solitude was reigning when the angel Æthereal entered  you will be quiet here said his dragoman drawing up two leather chairs to the hearth and comfortable he added as the angel crossed his legs after our recent experience i thought it better to bring you where your mind would be composed since we have to consider so important a subject as morality there is no place indeed where we could be so completely sheltered from life or so free to evolve from our inner consciousness the momentous conclusions of the armchair moralist when you have had your sneeze he added glancing at the angel who was taking snuff i shall make known to you the conclusions i have formed in the course of a chequered career  before you do that said the angel it would perhaps be as well to limit the sphere of our inquiry  as to that remarked his dragoman i shall confine my information to the morals of the english since the opening of the great skirmish in 1914 just a short generation of three and thirty years ago and you will find my theme readily falls sir into the two main compartments of public and private morality when i have finished you can ask me any questions  proceed said the angel letting his eyelids droop  public morality his dragoman began is either superlative comparative positive or negative and superlative morality is found of course only in the newspapers it is the special prerogative of leaderwriters its note remote and unchallengeable was well struck by almost every organ at the commencement of the great skirmish and may be summed up in a single solemn phrase we will sacrifice on the altar of duty the last life and the last dollarexcept the last life and dollar of the last leaderwriter for as all must see that one had to be preserved to ensure and comment on the consummation of the sacrifice what loftier morality can be conceived and it has ever been a grief to the multitude that the lives of those patriots and benefactors of their species should through modesty have been unrevealed to such as pant to copy them here and there the lineaments of a tiptopper were discernible beneath the disguise of custom but what fair existences were screened i may tell you at once sir that the state was so much struck at the time of the great skirmish by this doctrine of the utter sacrifice of others that it almost immediately adopted the idea and has struggled to retain it ever since indeed only the unaccountable reluctance of others to be utterly sacrificed has ensured their perpetuity  in 1910 said the angel i happened to notice that the prussians had already perfected that system yet it was against the prussians that this country fought  that is so returned his dragoman there were many who drew attention to the fact and at the conclusion of the great skirmish the reaction was such that for a long moment even the leaderwriters wavered in their selfless doctrines nor could continuity be secured till the laborious party came solidly to the saddle in 1930 since then the principle has been firm but the practice has been firmer and public morality has never been altogether superlative let us pass to comparative public morality in the days of the great skirmish this was practised by those with names who told others what to do this large and capable body included all the preachers publicists and politicians of the day and in many cases there is even evidence that they would have been willing to practise what they preached if their age had not been so venerable or their directive power so invaluable  invaluable murmured the angel has that word a negative signification  not in all cases said his dragoman with a smile there were men whom it would have been difficult to replace though not many and those perhaps the least comparatively moral in this category too were undoubtedly the persons known as conchies  from conch a shell asked the angel  not precisely returned his dragoman and yet you have hit it sir for into their shells they certainly withdrew refusing to have anything to do with this wicked world sufficient unto them was the voice within they were not well treated by an unfeeling populace  this is interesting to me said the angel to what did they object  to war replied his dragoman what is it to us they said that there should be barbarians like these prussians who override the laws of justice and humanitywords sir very much in vogue in those days how can it affect our principles if these rude foreigners have not our views and are prepared by cutting off the food supplies of this island to starve us into submission to their rule rather than turn a deaf ear to the voice within we are prepared for general starvation whether we are prepared for the starvation of our individual selves we cannot of course say until we experience it but we hope for the best and believe that we shall go through with it to death in the undesired company of all who do not agree with us and it is certain sir that some of them were capable of this for there is as you know a type of man who will die rather than admit that his views are too extreme to keep himself and his fellowmen alive  how entertaining said the angel do such persons still exist  oh yes replied the dragoman and always will nor is it in my opinion altogether to the disadvantage of mankind for they afford a salutary warning to the human species not to isolate itself in fancy from the realities of existence and extinguish human life before its time has come we shall now consider the positively moral at the time of the great skirmish these were such as took no sugar in their tea and invested all they had in war stock at five per cent without waiting for what were called premium bonds to be issued they were a large and healthy group more immediately concerned with commerce than the war but the largest body of all were the negatively moral these were they who did what they crudely called their bit which i may tell you sir was often very bitter i myself was a ships steward at the time and frequently swallowed much salt water owing to the submarines but i was not to be deterred and would sign on again when it had been pumped out of me our morality was purely negative if not actually low we acted as it were from instinct and often wondered at the sublime sacrifices which were being made by our betters most of us were killed or injured in one way or another but a blind and obstinate mania for not giving in possessed us we were a simple lot the dragoman paused and fixed his eyes on the empty hearth i will not disguise from you he added that we were fedup nearly all the time and yetwe couldnt stop odd was it not  i wish i had been with you said the angel forto use that word without which you english seem unable to express anythingyou were heroes  sir said his dragoman you flatter us by such encomium we were i fear dismally lacking in commercial spirit just men and women in the street having neither time nor inclination to examine our conduct and motives nor to question or direct the conduct of others purely negative beings with perhaps a touch of human courage and human kindliness in us all this however is a tale of long ago you can now ask me any questions sir before i pass to private morality  you alluded to courage and kindliness said the angel how do these qualities now stand  the quality of courage responded his dragoman received a setback in mens estimation at the time of the great skirmish from which it has never properly recovered for physical courage was then for the first time perceived to be most excessively common it is indeed probably a mere attribute of the bony chin especially prevalent in the englishspeaking races as to moral courage it was so hunted down that it is still somewhat in hiding of kindliness there are as you know two sorts that which people manifest towards their own belongings and that which they do not as a rule manifest towards every one else  since we attended the divorce court remarked the angel with deliberation i have been thinking and i fancy no one can be really kind unless they have had matrimonial trouble preferably in conflict with the law  a new thought to me observed his dragoman attentively and yet you may be right for there is nothing like being morally outcast to make you feel the intolerance of others but that brings us to private morality  quite said the angel with relief i forgot to ask you this morning how the ancient custom of marriage was now regarded in the large  not indeed as a sacrament replied his dragoman such a view was becoming rare already at the time of the great skirmish yet the notion might have been preserved but for the opposition of the pontifical of those days to the reform of the divorce laws when principle opposes common sense too long a landslide follows  of what nature then is marriage now  purely a civil or uncivil contract as the case may be the holy state of judicial separation too has long been unknown  ah said the angel that was the custom by which the man became a monk and the lady a nun was it not  in theory sir replied his dragoman but in practice not a little bit as you may well suppose the pontifical however and the women old and otherwise who supported them had but small experience of life to go on and honestly believed that they were punishing those stillmarried but erring persons who were thus separated these on the contrary almost invariably assumed that they were justified in free companionships nor were they particular to avoid promiscuity so it ever is sir when the great laws of nature are violated in deference to the higher doctrine  are children still born out of wedlock asked the angel  yes said his dragoman but no longer considered responsible for the past conduct of their parents  society then is more humane  well sir we shall not see the millennium in that respect for some years to come zoos are still permitted and i read only yesterday a letter from a scottish gentleman pouring scorn on the humane proposal that prisoners should be allowed to see their wives once a month without bars or the presence of a third party precisely as if we still lived in the days of the great skirmish can you tell me why it is that such letters are always written by scotsmen  is it a riddle asked the angel  it is indeed sir  then it bores me speaking generally are you satisfied with current virtue now that it is a state matter as you informed me yesterday  to tell you the truth sir i do not judge my neighbours sufficient unto myself is the vice thereof but one thing i observe the less virtuous people assume themselves to be the more virtuous they commonly are where the limelight is not the flower blooms have you not frequently noticed that they who day by day cheerfully endure most unpleasant things while helping their neighbours at the expense of their own time and goods are often rendered lyrical by receiving a sovereign from some one who would never miss it and are ready to enthrone him in their hearts as a king of men the truest virtue sir must be sought among the lowly sugar and snow may be seen on the top but for the salt of the earth one must look to the bottom  i believe you said the angel it is probably harder for a man in the limelight to enter virtue than for the virtuous to enter the limelight ha ha is the good old custom of buying honour still preserved  no sir honour is now only given to such as make themselves too noisy to be endured and saddles the recipient with an obligation to preserve public silence for a period not exceeding three years that maximum sentence is given for a dukedom it is reckoned that few can survive so fearful a term  concerning the morality of this new custom said the angel i feel doubtful it savours of surrender to the bully and the braggart does it not  rather to the bore sir not necessarily the same thing but whether men be decorated for making themselves useful or troublesome the result in either case is to secure a comparative inertia which has ever been the desideratum for you must surely be aware sir how a mans dignity weighs him down  are women also rewarded in this way  yes and very often for although their dignity is already ample their tongues are long and they have little shame and no nerves in the matter of public speaking  and what price their virtue asked the angel  there is some change since the days of the great skirmish responded his dragoman they do not now so readily sell it except for a wedding ring and many marry for love women indeed are often deplorably lacking in commercial spirit and though they now mix in commerce have not yet been able to adapt themselves some men even go so far as to think that their participation in active life is not good for trade and keeps the country back  they are a curious sex said the angel i like them but they make too much fuss about babies  ah sir there is the great flaw the mother instinctso heedless and uncommercial they seem to love the things just for their own sakes  yes said the angel theres no future in it give me a cigar   viii  what then is the present position of the good asked the angel Æthereal taking wing from watchester cathedrome towards the city tabernacle  there are a number of discordant views sir his dragoman whiffled through his nose in the rushing air which is no more novel in this year of peace 1947 than it was when you were here in 1910 on the far right are certain extremists who believe it to be what it wasomnipotent but suffering the presence of the bad for no reason which has yet been ascertained omnipresent though presumably absent where the bad is present mysterious though perfectly revealed terrible though loving eternal though limited by a beginning and an end they are not numerous but all stallholders and chiefly characterised by an almost perfect intolerance of those whose views do not coincide with their own nor will they suffer for a moment any examination into the nature of the good which they hold to be established for all time in the form i have stated by persons who have long been dead they are as you may imagine somewhat out of touch with science such as it is and are regarded by the community at large rather with curiosity than anything else  the type is well known in the sky said the angel tell me do they torture those who do not agree with them  not materially responded his dragoman such a custom was extinct even before the days of the great skirmish though what would have happened if the patriotic or prussian party had been able to keep power for any length of time we cannot tell as it is the torture they apply is purely spiritual and consists in looking down their noses at all who have not their belief and calling them erratics but it would be a mistake to underrate their power for human nature loves the pontifical and there are those who will follow to the death any one who looks down his nose and says i know moreover sir consider how unsettling a question the good is when you come to think about it and how unfatiguing the faith which precludes all such speculation  that is so said the angel thoughtfully  the right centre continued his dragoman is occupied by the small yet noisy fifth party these are they who play the cornet and tambourine big drum and concertina descendants of the old prophet and survivors of those who following a younger prophet joined them at the time of the great skirmish in a form ever modifying with scientific discovery they hold that the good is a superman bodiless yet bodily with a beginning but without an end it is an attractive faith enabling them to say to nature je men fiche de tout cela my big brother will look after me pom one may call it anthropomorphia for it seems especially soothing to strong personalities every man to his creed as they say and i would never wish to throw cold water on such as seek to find the good by closing one eye instead of two as is done by the extremists on the right  you are tolerant said the angel  sir said his dragoman as one gets older one perceives more and more how impossible it is for man not to regard himself as the cause of the universe and for certain individual men not to believe themselves the centre of the cause for such to start a new belief is a biological necessity and should by no means be discouraged it is a safetyvalvethe form of passion which the fires of youth take in men after the age of fifty as one may judge by the case of the prophet tolstoy and other great ones but to resume in the centre of course are situated the enormous majority of the community whose view is that they have no view of what the good is  none repeated the angel Æthereal somewhat struck  not the faintest answered his dragoman these are the only true mystics for what is a mystic if not one with an impenetrable belief in the mystery of his own existence this group embraces the great bulk of the laborious it is true that many of them will repeat what is told them of the good as if it were their own view without compunction but this is no more than the majority of persons have done from the beginning of time  quite admitted the angel i have observed that phenomenon in the course of my travels we will not waste words on them  ah sir retorted his dragoman there is more wisdom in these persons than you imagine for consider what would be the fate of their brains if they attempted to think for themselves moreover as you know all definite views about the good are very wearing and it is better so this great majority thinks to let sleeping dogs lie than to have them barking in its head but i will tell you something the dragoman added these innumerable persons have a secret belief of their own old as the greeks that good fellowship is all that matters and in my opinion taking the good in its limited sense it is an admirable creed  oh cut on said the angel  my mistake sir said his dragoman on the left centre are grouped that increasing section whose view is that since everything is very bad the good is ultimate extinctionpeace perfect peace as the poet says you will recollect the old tag to be or not to be these are they who have answered that question in the negative pessimists masquerading to an unsuspecting public as optimists they are no doubt descendants of such as used to be called theosophians a sect which presupposed everything and then desired to be annihilated or again of the christian scientites who simply could not bear things as they were so set themselves to think they were not with some limited amount of success if i remember rightly i recall to mind the case of a lady who lost her virtue and recovered it by dint of remembering that she had no body  curious said the angel i should like to question her let me have her address after the lecture does the theory of reincarnation still obtain  i do not wonder sir that you are interested in the point for believers in that doctrine are compelled by the old and awkward rule that two and two make four to draw on other spheres for the reincarnation of their spirits  i do not follow said the angel  it is simple however answered his dragoman for at one time on earth as is admitted there was no life the first incarnation thereforean amœba we used to be toldenclosed a spirit possibly from above it may indeed have been yours sir again at some time on this earth as is admitted there will again be no life the last spirit will therefore flit to an incarnation possibly below and again sir who knows it may be yours  i cannot jest on such a subject said the angel with a sneeze  no offence murmured his dragoman the last group on the far left to which indeed i myself am not altogether unaffiliated is composed of a small number of extremists who hold that the good is things as they arepardon the inevitable flaw in grammar they consider that what is now has always been and will always be that things do but swell and contract and swell again and so on for ever and ever and that since they could not swell if they did not contract since without the black there could not be the white nor pleasure without pain nor virtue without vice nor criminals without judges even contraction or the black or pain or vice or judges are not the bad but only negatives and that all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds they are voltairean optimists masquerading to an unsuspecting population as pessimists eternal variation is their motto  i gather said the angel that these think there is no purpose in existence  rather sir that existence is the purpose for if you consider any other conception of purpose implies fulfilment or an end which they do not admit just as they do not admit a beginning  how logical said the angel it makes me dizzy you have renounced the idea of climbing then  not so responded his dragoman we climb to the top of the pole slide imperceptibly down and begin over again but since we never really know whether we are climbing or sliding this does not depress us  to believe that this goes on for ever is futile said the angel  so we are told replied his dragoman without emotion we think however that the truth is with us in spite of jesting pilate  it is not for me said the angel with dignity to argue with my dragoman  no sir for it is always necessary to beware of the open mind i myself find it very difficult to believe the same thing every day and the fact is that whatever you believe will probably not alter the truth which may be said to have a certain mysterious immutability considering the number of efforts men have made to change it from time to time we are now however just above the city tabernacle and if you will close your wings we shall penetrate it through the claptrapdoor which enables its preachers now and then to ascend to higher spheres  stay said the angel let me float a minute while i suck a peppermint for the audiences in these places often have colds and with that delicious aroma clinging to them they made their entry through a strait gate in the roof and took their seats in the front row below a tall prophet in eyeglasses who was discoursing on the stars the angel slept heavily  you have lost a good thing sir said his dragoman reproachfully when they left the tabernacle  in my opinion the angel playfully responded i won a better for i went nap what can a mortal know about the stars  believe me answered his dragoman the subject is not more abstruse than is generally chosen  if he had taken religion i should have listened with pleasure said the angel  oh sir but in these days such a subject is unknown in a place of worship religion is now exclusively a state affair the change began with discipline and the education bill in 1918 and has gradually crystallised ever since it is true that individual extremists on the right make continual endeavours to encroach on the functions of the state but they preach to empty houses  and the deity said the angel you have not once mentioned him it has struck me as curious  belief in the deity responded his dragoman perished shortly after the great skirmish during which there was too active and varied an effort to revive it action as you know sir always brings reaction and it must be said that the spiritual propaganda of those days was so grossly tinged with the commercial spirit that it came under the head of profiteering and earned for itself a certain abhorrence for no sooner had the fears and griefs brought by the great skirmish faded from mens spirits than they perceived that their new impetus towards the deity had been directed purely by the longing for protection solace comfort and reward and not by any real desire for the good in itself it was this truth together with the appropriation of the word by emperors and the expansion of our towns a process ever destructive of traditions which brought about extinction of belief in his existence  it was a large order said the angel  it was more a change of nomenclature replied his dragoman the ruling motive for belief in the good is still the hope of getting something out of itthe commercial spirit is innate  ah said the angel absently can we have another lunch now i could do with a slice of beef  an admirable idea sir replied his dragoman we will have it in the white city   ix  what in your opinion is the nature of happiness asked the angel Æthereal as he finished his second bottle of bass in the grounds of the white city the dragoman regarded his angel with one eye  the question is not simple sir though often made the subject of symposiums in the more intellectual journals even now in the middle of the twentieth century some still hold that it is a byproduct of fresh air and good liquor the old and merrie england indubitably procured it from those elements some again imagine it to follow from high thinking and low living while no mean number believe that it depends on women  their absence or their presence asked the angel with interest  some this and others that but for my part it is not altogether the outcome of these causes  is this now a happy land  sir returned his dragoman all things earthly are comparative  get on with it said the angel  i will comply responded his dragoman reproachfully if you will permit me first to draw your third cork and let me say in passing that even your present happiness is comparative or possibly superlative as you will know when you have finished this last bottle it may or may not be greater we shall see  we shall said the angel resolutely  you ask me whether this land is happy but must we not first decide what happiness is and how difficult this will be you shall soon discover for example in the early days of the great skirmish happiness was reputed nonexistent every family was plunged into anxiety or mourning and though this to my own knowledge was not the case such as were not pretended to be yet strange as it may appear the shrewd observer of those days was unable to remark any indication of added gloom certain creature comforts no doubt were scarce but there was no lack of spiritual comfort which high minds have ever associated with happiness nor do i here allude to liquor what then was the nature of this spiritual comfort you will certainly be asking i will tell you and in seven words people forgot themselves and remembered other people until those days it had never been realised what a lot of medical men could be spared from the civil population what a number of clergymen lawyers stockbrokers artists writers politicians and other persons whose work in life is to cause people to think about themselves never would be missed invalids knitted socks and forgot to be unwell old gentlemen read the papers and forgot to talk about their food people travelled in trains and forgot not to fall into conversation with each other merchants became special constables and forgot to differ about property the house of lords remembered its dignity and forgot its impudence the house of commons almost forgot to chatter the case of the working man was the most striking of allhe forgot he was the working man the very dogs forgot themselves though that to be sure was no novelty as the irish writer demonstrated in his terrific outburst on my doorstep but time went on and hens in their turn forgot to lay ships to return to port cows to give enough milk and governments to look ahead till the first flush of selfforgetfulness which had dyed peoples cheeks  died on them put in the angel with a quiet smile  you take my meaning sir said his dragoman though i should not have worded it so happily but certainly the return to self began and people used to think this war is not so bloody as i thought for i am getting better money than i ever did and the longer it lasts the more i shall get and for the sake of this i am prepared to endure much the saying beef and beer for soon you must put up the shutters became the motto of all classes if i am to be shot drowned bombed ruined or starved tomorrow they said i had better eat drink marry and buy jewelry today and so they did in spite of the dreadful efforts of one bishop and two gentlemen who presided over the important question of food they did not it is true relax their manual efforts to accomplish the defeat of their enemies or win the war as it was somewhat loosely called but they no longer worked with their spirits which with a few exceptions went to sleep for sir the spirit like the body demands regular repose and in my opinion is usually the first of the two to snore before the great skirmish came at last to its appointed end the snoring from spirits in this country might have been heard in the moon people thought of little but money revenge and what they could get to eat though the word sacrifice was so accustomed to their lips that they could no more get it off them than the other forms of lipsalve increasingly in vogue they became very merry and the question i would raise is this by which of these two standards shall we assess the word happiness were these people happy when they mourned and thought not of self or when they merried and thought of self all the time  by the first standard replied the angel with kindling eyes happiness is undoubtedly nobility  not so fast sir replied his dragoman for i have frequently met with nobility in distress and indeed the more exalted and refined the mind the unhappier is frequently the owner thereof for to him are visible a thousand cruelties and mean injustices which lower natures do not perceive  hold exclaimed the angel this is blasphemy against olympus the spectator and other highbrows  sir replied his dragoman gravely i am not one of those who accept gilded doctrines without examination i read in the book of life rather than in the million tomes written by men to get away from their own unhappiness  i perceive said the angel with a shrewd glance that you have something up your sleeve shake it out  my conclusion is this sir returned his dragoman well pleased man is only happy when he is living at a certain pressure of life to the square inch in other words when he is so absorbed in what he is doing making saying thinking or dreaming that he has lost selfconsciousness if there be upon him any illsuch as toothache or moody meditationso poignant as to prevent him losing himself in the interest of the moment then he is not happy nor must he merely think himself absorbed but actually be so as are two lovers sitting under one umbrella or he who is just making a couplet rhyme  would you say then insinuated the angel that a man is happy when he meets a mad bull in a narrow lane for there will surely be much pressure of life to the square inch  it does not follow responded his dragoman for at such moments one is prone to stand apart pitying himself and reflecting on the unevenness of fortune but if he collects himself and meets the occasion with spirit he will enjoy it until while sailing over the hedge he has leisure to reflect once more it is clear to me he proceeded that the fruit of the tree of knowledge in the old fable was not as has hitherto been supposed by a puritanical people the mere knowledge of sex but symbolised rather general selfconsciousness for i have little doubt that adam and eve sat together under one umbrella long before they discovered they had no clothes on not until they became selfconscious about things at large did they become unhappy  love is commonly reputed by some and power by others to be the keys of happiness said the angel regardless of his grammar  duds broke in his dragoman for love and power are only two of the various paths to absorption or unconsciousness of self mere methods by which men of differing natures succeed in losing their selfconsciousness for he who like saint francis loves all creation has no time to be conscious of loving himself and he who rattles the sword and rules like bill kaser has no time to be conscious that he is not ruling himself i do not deny that such men may be happy but not because of the love or the power no it is because they are loving or ruling with such intensity that they forget themselves in doing it  there is much in what you say said the angel thoughtfully how do you apply it to the times and land in which you live  sir his dragoman responded the englishman never has been and is not now by any means so unhappy as he looks for where you see a furrow in the brow or a mouth a little open it portends absorption rather than thoughtfulnessunless indeed it means adenoidsand is the mark of a naturally selfforgetful nature nor should you suppose that poverty and dirt which abound as you see even under the sway of the laborious is necessarily deterrent to the power of living in the moment it may even be a symptom of that habit the unhappy are more frequently the clean and leisured especially in times of peace when they have little to do save sit under mulberry trees invest money pay their taxes wash fly and think about themselves nevertheless many of the laborious also live at halfcock and cannot be said to have lost consciousness of self  then democracy is not synonymous with happiness asked the angel  dear sir replied his dragoman i know they said so at the time of the great skirmish but they said so much that one little one like that hardly counted i will let you into a secret we have not yet achieved democracy either here or anywhere else the old american saying about it is all very well but since not one man in ten has any real opinion of his own on any subject on which he votes he cannot with the best will in the world put it on record not until he learns to have and record his own real opinion will he truly govern himself for himself which is as you know the test of true democracy  i am getting fuddled said the angel what is it you want to make you happy  his dragoman sat up if i am right he purred in my view that happiness is absorption our problem is to direct mens minds to absorption in right and pleasant things an american making a corner in wheat is absorbed and no doubt happy yet he is an enemy of mankind for his activity is destructive we should seek to give our minds to creation to activities good for others as well as for ourselves to simplicity pride in work and forgetfulness of self in every walk of life we should do things for the sheer pleasure of doing them and not for what they may or may not be going to bring us in and be taught always to give our whole minds to it in this way only will the edge of our appetite for existence remain as keen as a razor which is stropped every morning by one who knows how on the negative side we should be brought up to be kind to be clean to be moderate and to love good music exercise and fresh air  that sounds a bit of all right said the angel what measures are being taken in these directions  it has been my habit sir to study the education acts of my country ever since that which was passed at the time of the great skirmish but with the exception of exercise i have not as yet been able to find any direct allusion to these matters nor is this surprising when you consider that education is popularly supposed to be not for the acquisition of happiness but for the good of trade or the promotion of acute selfconsciousness through what we know as culture if by any chance there should arise a president of education so enlightened as to share my views it would be impossible for him to mention the fact for fear of being sent to colney hatch  in that case asked the angel you do not believe in the progress of your country  sir his dragoman replied earnestly you have seen this land for yourself and have heard from me some account of its growth from the days when you were last on earth shortly before the great skirmish it will not have escaped your eagle eye that this considerable event has had some influence in accelerating the course of its progression and you will have noticed how notwithstanding the most strenuous intentions at the close of that tragedy we have yielded to circumstance and in every direction followed the line of least resistance  i have a certain sympathy with that said the angel with a yawn it is so much easier  so we have found and our country has got along perhaps as well as one could have expected considering what it has had to contend with pressure of debt primrose paths pelf party patrioprussianism the people pundits puritans proctors property philosophers the pontifical and progress i will not disguise from you however that we are far from perfection and it may be that on your next visit thirtyseven years hence we shall be further for however it may be with angels sir with men things do not stand still and as i have tried to make clear to you in order to advance in body and spirit it is necessary to be masters of your environment and discoveries instead of letting them be masters of you wealthy again we may be healthy and happy we are not as yet  i have finished my beer said the angel Æthereal with finality and am ready to rise you have nothing to drink let me give you a testimonial instead pulling a quill from his wing he dipped it in the mustard and wrote a dry dogno good for trade on his dragomans white hat i shall now leave the earth he added  i am pleased to hear it said his dragoman for i fancy that the longer you stay the more vulgar you will become i have noticed it growing on you sir just as it does on us  the angel smiled meet me by sunlight alone he said under the lefthand lion in trafalgar square at this hour of this day in 1984 remember me to the waiter will you so long and without pausing for a reply he spread his wings and soared away  lhomme moyen sensuel sic itur ad astra murmured
