16968965	found at blazing star   by bret harte    the rain had only ceased with the gray streaks of morning at blazing star and the settlement awoke to a moral sense of cleanliness and the finding of forgotten knives tin cups and smaller camp utensils where the heavy showers had washed away the debris and dust heaps before the cabin doors indeed it was recorded in blazing star that a fortunate early riser had once picked up on the highway a solid chunk of gold quartz which the rain had freed from its incumbering soil and washed into immediate and glittering popularity possibly this may have been the reason why early risers in that locality during the rainy season adopted a thoughtful habit of body and seldom lifted their eyes to the rifted or indiaink washed skies above them  cass beard had risen early that morning but not with a view to discovery a leak in his cabin roofquite consistent with his careless improvident habitshad roused him at 4 a m with a flooded bunk and wet blankets the chips from his wood pile refused to kindle a fire to dry his bedclothes and he had recourse to a more provident neighbors to supply the deficiency this was nearly opposite mr cassius crossed the highway and stopped suddenly something glittered in the nearest red pool before him gold surely but wonderful to relate not an irregular shapeless fragment of crude ore fresh from natures crucible but a bit of jewelers handicraft in the form of a plain gold ring looking at it more attentively he saw that it bore the inscription may to cass  like most of his fellow goldseekers cass was superstitious cass his own name he tried the ring it fitted his little finger closely it was evidently a womans ring he looked up and down the highway no one was yet stirring little pools of water in the red road were beginning to glitter and grow rosy from the farflushing east but there was no trace of the owner of the shining waif he knew that there was no woman in camp and among his few comrades in the settlement he remembered to have seen none wearing an ornament like that again the coincidence of the inscription to his rather peculiar nickname would have been a perennial source of playful comment in a camp that made no allowance for sentimental memories he slipped the glittering little hoop into his pocket and thoughtfully returned to his cabin  two hours later when the long straggling procession which every morning wended its way to blazing star gulchthe seat of mining operations in the settlementbegan to move cass saw fit to interrogate his fellows ye didnt none on ye happen to drop anything round yer last night he asked cautiously  i dropped a pocketbook containing government bonds and some other securities with between fifty and sixty thousand dollars responded peter drummond carelessly but no matter if any man will return a few autograph letters from foreign potentates that happened to be in itof no value to anybody but the ownerhe can keep the money thars nothin mean about me he concluded languidly  this statement bearing every evidence of the grossest mendacity was lightly passed over and the men walked on with the deepest gravity  but hev you cass presently asked of another  i lost my pile to jack hamlin at drawpoker over at wingdam last night returned the other pensively but i dont calkilate to find it lying round loose  forced at last by this kind of irony into more detailed explanation cass confided to them his discovery and produced his treasure the result was a dozen vague surmisesonly one of which seemed to be popular and to suit the dyspeptic despondency of the partya despondency born of hastily masticated fried pork and flapjacks the ring was believed to have been dropped by some passing road agent laden with guilty spoil  ef i was you said drummond gloomily i wouldnt flourish that yer ring around much afore folks ive seen better men nor you strung up a tree by vigilantes for having even less than that in their possession  and i wouldnt say much about bein up so dd early this morning added an even more pessimistic comrade it might look bad before a jury  with this the men sadly dispersed leaving the innocent cass with the ring in his hand and a general impression on his mind that he was already an object of suspicion to his comradesan impression it is hardly necessary to say they fully intended should be left to rankle in his guileless bosom  notwithstanding casss first hopeful superstition the ring did not seem to bring him nor the camp any luck daily the clean up brought the same scant rewards to their labors and deepened the sardonic gravity of blazing star but if cass found no material result from his treasure it stimulated his lazy imagination and albeit a dangerous and seductive stimulant at least lifted him out of the monotonous grooves of his halfcareless halfslovenly but always selfcontented camp life heeding the wise caution of his comrades he took the habit of wearing the ring only at night wrapped in his blanket he stealthily slipped the golden circlet over his little finger and as he averred slept all the better for it whether it ever evoked any warmer dream or vision during those calm cold virginlike spring nights when even the moon and the greater planets retreated into the icy blue steellike firmament i cannot say enough that this superstition began to be colored a little by fancy and his fatalism somewhat mitigated by hope dreams of this kind did not tend to promote his efficiency in the communistic labors of the camp and brought him a selfisolation that however gratifying at first soon debarred him the benefits of that hard practical wisdom which underlaid the grumbling of his fellow workers  im doggoned said one commentator ef i dont believe that cass is looney over that yer ring he found wears it on a string under his shirt  meantime the seasons did not wait the discovery of the secret the red pools in blazing star highway were soon dried up in the fervent june sun and riotous night wind of those altitudes the ephemeral grasses that had quickly supplanted these pools and the chocolatecolored mud were as quickly parched and withered the footprints of spring became vague and indefinite and were finally lost in the impalpable dust of the summer highway  in one of his long aimless excursions cass had penetrated a thick undergrowth of buckeye and hazel and found himself quite unexpectedly upon the high road to red chiefs crossing cass knew by the lurid cloud of dust that hid the distance that the up coach had passed he had already reached that stage of superstition when the most trivial occurrence seemed to point in some way to an elucidation of the mystery of his treasure his eyes had mechanically fallen to the ground again as if he half expected to find in some other waif a hint or corroboration of his imaginings thus abstracted the figure of a young girl on horseback in the road directly before the bushes he emerged from appeared to have sprung directly from the ground  oh come here please do quick  cass stared and then moved hesitatingly toward her  i heard some one coming through the bushes and i waited she went on come quick its something too awful for anything  in spite of this appalling introduction cass could not but notice that the voice although hurried and excited was by no means agitated or frightened that the eyes which looked into his sparkled with a certain kind of pleased curiosity  it was just here she went on vivaciously just here that i went into the bush and cut a switch for my mareandleading him along at a brisk trot by her sidejust here look see this is what i found  it was scarcely thirty feet from the road the only object that met casss eye was a mans stiff tall hat lying emptily and vacantly in the grass it was new shiny and of modish shape but it was so incongruous so perkily smart and yet so feeble and helpless lying there so ghastly ludicrous in its very appropriateness and incapacity to adjust itself to the surrounding landscape that it affected him with something more than a sense of its grotesqueness and he could only stare at it blankly  but youre not looking the right way the girl went on sharply look there  cass followed the direction of her whip at last what might have seemed a coat thrown carelessly on the ground met his eye but presently he became aware of a white rigid aimlesslyclinched hand protruding from the flaccid sleeve mingled with it in some absurd way and half hidden by the grass lay what might have been a pair of castoff trousers but for two rigid boots that pointed in opposite angles to the sky it was a dead man so palpably dead that life seemed to have taken flight from his very clothes so impotent feeble and degraded by them that the naked subject of a dissecting table would have been less insulting to humanity the head had fallen back and was partly hidden in a gopher burrow but the white upturned face and closed eyes had less of helpless death in them than those wretched enwrappings indeed one limp hand that lay across the swollen abdomen lent itself to the grotesquely hideous suggestion of a gentleman sleeping off the excesses of a hearty dinner  aint he horrid continued the girl but what killed him  struggling between a certain fascination at the girls coldblooded curiosity and horror of the murdered man cass hesitatingly lifted the helpless head a bluish hole above the right temple and a few brown paintlike spots on the forehead shirt cellar and matted hair proved the only record  turn him over again said the girl impatiently as cass was about to relinquish his burden may be youll find another wound  but cass was dimly remembering certain formalities that in older civilizations attend the discovery of dead bodies and postponed a present inquest  perhaps youd better ride on miss afore you get summoned as a witness ill give warning at red chiefs crossing and send the coroner down here  let me go with you she said earnestly it would be such fun i dont mind being a witness or she added without heeding casss look of astonishment ill wait here till you come back  but you see miss it wouldnt seem right began cass  but i found him first interrupted the girl with a pout  staggered by this preemptive right sacred to all miners cass stopped  who is the coroner she asked  joe hornsby  the tall lame man who was half eaten by a grizzly  yes  well look now ill ride on and bring him back in half an hour there  but miss  oh dont mind me i never saw anything of this kind before and i want to see it all  do you know hornsby asked cass unconsciously a trifle irritated  no but ill bring him she wheeled her horse into the road  in the presence of this living energy cass quite forgot the helpless dead have you been long in these parts miss he asked  about two weeks she answered shortly goodby just now look around for the pistol or anything else you can find although i have been over the whole ground twice already  a little puff of dust as the horse sprang into the road a muffled shuffle struggle then the regular beat of hoofs and she was gone  after five minutes had passed cass regretted that he had not accompanied her waiting in such a spot was an irksome task not that there was anything in the scene itself to awaken gloomy imaginings the bright truthful californian sunshine scoffed at any illusion of creeping shadows or waving branches once in the rising wind the empty hat rolled overbut only in a ludicrous drunken way a search for any further sign or token had proved futile and cass grew impatient he began to hate himself for having stayed he would have fled but for shame nor was his good humor restored when at the close of a weary half hour two galloping figures emerged from the dusty horizonhornsby and the young girl  his vague annoyance increased as he fancied that both seemed to ignore him the coroner barely acknowledging his presence with a nod assisted by the young girl whose energy and enthusiasm evidently delighted him hornsby raised the body for a more careful examination the dead mans pockets were carefully searched a few coins a silver pencil knife and tobaccobox were all they found it gave no clew to his identity suddenly the young girl who had with unabashed curiosity knelt beside the exploring official hands of the red chief uttered a cry of gratification  heres something it dropped from the bosom of his shirt on the ground look  she was holding in the air between her thumb and forefinger a folded bit of wellworn newspaper her eyes sparkled  shall i open it she asked  yes  its a little ring she said looks like an engagement ring something is written on it look may to cass  cass darted forward its mine he stammered mine i dropped it its nothingnothing he went on after a pause embarrassed and blushing as the girl and her companion both stared at hima mere trifle ill take it  but the coroner opposed his outstretched hand not much he said significantly  but its mine continued cass indignation taking the place of shame at his discovered secret i found it six months ago in the road ipicked it up  with your name already written on it how handy said the coroner grimly  its an old story said cass blushing again under the halfmischievous halfsearching eyes of the girl all blazing star knows i found it  then yell have no difficulty in provin it said hornsby coolly just now however weve found it and we propose to keep it for the inquest  cass shrugged his shoulders further altercation would have only heightened his ludicrous situation in the girls eyes he turned away leaving his treasure in the coroners hands  the inquest a day or two later was prompt and final no clew to the dead mans identity no evidence sufficiently strong to prove murder or suicide no trace of any kind inculpating any party known or unknown were found but much publicity and interest were given to the proceedings by the presence of the principal witness a handsome girl to the pluck persistency and intellect of miss porter said the red chief recorder tuolumne county owes the recovery of the body  no one who was present at the inquest failed to be charmed with the appearance and conduct of this beautiful young lady  miss porter has but lately arrived in this district in which it is hoped she will become an honored resident and continue to set an example to all lackadaisical and sentimental members of the socalled sterner sex after this universally recognized allusion to cass beard the recorder returned to its record some interest was excited by what appeared to be a clew to the mystery in the discovery of a small gold engagement ring on the body evidence was afterward offered to show it was the property of a mr cass beard of blazing star who appeared upon the scene after the discovery of the corpse by miss porter he alleged he had dropped it in lifting the unfortunate remains of the deceased much amusement was created in court by the sentimental confusion of the claimant and a certain partisan spirit shown by his fellowminers of blazing star it appearing however by the admission of this sighing strephon of the foot hills that he had himself found this pledge of affection lying in the highway six months previous the coroner wisely placed it in the safekeeping of the county court until the appearance of the rightful owner  thus on the 13th of september 186 the treasure found at blazing star passed out of the hands of its finder    autumn brought an abrupt explanation of the mystery kanaka joe had been arrested for horse stealing but had with noble candor confessed to the finer offense of manslaughter that swift and sure justice which overtook the horse stealer in these altitudes was stayed a moment and hesitated for the victim was clearly the mysterious unknown curiosity got the better of an extempore judge and jury  it was a fair fight said the accused not without some human vanity feeling that the camp hung upon his words and was settled by the man az was peartest and liveliest with his weapon we had a sort of unpleasantness over at lagrange the night afore along of our both hevin a monotony of four aces we had a clinch and a stamp around and when we was separated it was only a question of shootin on sight he left lagrange at sun up the next morning and i struck across a bit o buckeye and underbrush and came upon him accidental like on the red chief road i drawed when i sighted him and called out he slipped from his mare and covered himself with her flanks reaching for his holster but she rared and backed down on him across the road and into the grass where i got in another shot and fetched him  and you stole his mare suggested the judge  i got away said the gambler simply  further questioning only elicited the fact that joe did not know the name or condition of his victim he was a stranger in lagrange  it was a breezy afternoon with some turbulency in the camp and much windy discussion over this unwonted delay of justice the suggestion that joe should be first hanged for horse stealing and then tried for murder was angrily discussed but milder counsels were offeredthat the fact of the killing should be admitted only as proof of the theft a large party from red chief had come over to assist in judgment among them the coroner  cass beard had avoided these proceedings which only recalled an unpleasant experience and was wandering with pick pan and wallet far from the camp these accoutrements as i have before intimated justified any form of aimless idleness under the equally aimless title of prospecting he had at the end of three hours relaxation reached the highway to red chief half hidden by blinding clouds of dust torn from the crumbling red road at every gust which swept down the mountain side the spot had a familiar aspect to cass although some freshlydug holes near the wayside with scattered earth beside them showed the presence of a recent prospector he was struggling with his memory when the dust was suddenly dispersed and he found himself again at the scene of the murder he started he had not put foot on the road since the inquest there lacked only the helpless dead man and the contrasting figure of the alert young woman to restore the picture the body was gone it was true but as he turned he beheld miss porter at a few paces distant sitting on her horse as energetic and observant as on the first morning they had met a superstitious thrill passed over him and awoke his old antagonism  she nodded to him slightly i came here to refresh my memory she said as mr hornsby thought i might be asked to give my evidence again at blazing star  cass carelessly struck an aimless blow with his pick against the sod and did not reply  and you she queried  i stumbled upon the place just now while prospecting or i shouldnt be here  then it was you made these holes  no said cass with illconcealed disgust nobody but a stranger would go foolin round such a spot  he stopped as the rude significance of his speech struck him and added surlily i meanno one would dig here  the girl laughed and showed a set of very white teeth in her square jaw cass averted his face  do you mean to say that every miner doesnt know that its lucky to dig wherever human blood has been spilt  cass felt a return of his superstition but he did not look up i never heard it before he said severely  and you call yourself a california miner  i do  it was impossible for miss porter to misunderstand his curt speech and unsocial manner she stared at him and colored slightly lifting her reins lightly she said you certainly do not seem like most of the miners i have met  nor you like any girl from the east i ever met he responded  what do you mean she asked checking her horse  what i say he answered doggedly reasonable as this reply was it immediately struck him that it was scarcely dignified or manly but before he could explain himself miss porter was gone  he met her again that very evening the trial had been summarily suspended by the appearance of the sheriff of calaveras and his posse who took joe from that selfconstituted tribunal of blazing star and set his face southward and toward authoritative although more cautious justice but not before the evidence of the previous inquest had been read and the incident of the ring again delivered to the public  it is said the prisoner burst into an incredulous laugh and asked to see this mysterious waif it was handed to him standing in the very shadow of the gallows treewhich might have been one of the pines that sheltered the billiard room in which the vigilance committee held their conclavethe prisoner gave way to a burst of merriment so genuine and honest that the judge and jury joined in automatic sympathy when silence was restored an explanation was asked by the judge but there was no response from the prisoner except a subdued chuckle  did this ring belong to you asked the judge severely the jury and spectators craning their ears forward with an expectant smile already on their faces but the prisoners eyes only sparkled maliciously as he looked around the court  tell us joe said a sympathetic and laughterloving juror under his breath let it out and well make it easy for you  prisoner said the judge with a return of official dignity remember that your life is in peril do you refuse  joe lazily laid his arm on the back of his chair with to quote the words of an animated observer the air of having a christian hope and a sequence flush in his hand and said well as i reckon im not up yer for stealin a ring that another man lets on to have found and as fur as i kin see hez nothin to do with the case i do and as it was here that the sheriff of calaveras made a precipitate entry into the room the mystery remained unsolved  the effect of this freshlyimportant ridicule on the sensitive mind of cass might have been foretold by blazing star had it ever taken that sensitiveness into consideration he had lost the good humor and easy pliability which had tempted him to frankness and he had gradually become bitter and hard he had at first affected amusement over his own vanished day dreamhiding his virgin disappointment in his own breast but when he began to turn upon his feelings he turned upon his comrades also cass was for a while unpopular there is no ingratitude so revolting to the human mind as that of the butt who refuses to be one any longer the man who rejects that immunity which laughter generally casts upon him and demands to be seriously considered deserves no mercy  it was under these hard conditions that cass beard convicted of overt sentimentalism aggravated by inconsistency stepped into the red chief coach that evening it was his habit usually to ride with the driver but the presence of hornsby and miss porter on the box seat changed his intention yet he had the satisfaction of seeing that neither had noticed him and as there was no other passenger inside he stretched himself on the cushion of the back seat and gave way to moody reflections he quite determined to leave blazing star to settle himself seriously to the task of money getting and to return to his comrades some day a sarcastic cynical successful man and so overwhelm them with confusion for poor cass had not yet reached that superiority of knowing that success would depend upon his ability to forego his past indeed part of his boyhood had been cast among these men and he was not old enough to have learned that success was not to be gauged by their standard the moon lit up the dark interior of the coach with a faint poetic light the lazy swinging of the vehicle that was bearing him awayalbeit only for a night and a daythe solitude the glimpses from the window of great distances full of vague possibilities made the abused ring potent as that of gyges he dreamed with his eyes open from an alnaschar vision he suddenly awoke the coach had stopped the voices of men one in entreaty one in expostulation came from the box cass mechanically put his hand to his pistol pocket  thank you but i insist upon getting down  it was miss porters voice this was followed by a rapid halfrestrained interchange of words between hornsby and the driver then the latter said gruffly  if the lady wants to ride inside let her  miss porter fluttered to the ground she was followed by hornsby just a minit miss he expostulated half shamedly half brusquely ye dont onderstand me i only  but miss porter had jumped into the coach  hornsby placed his hand on the handle of the door miss porter grasped it firmly from the inside there was a slight struggle  all of which was part of a dream to the boyish cass but he awoke from ita man do you he asked in a voice he scarcely recognized himselfdo you want this man inside  no  cass caught at hornsbys wrist like a young tiger but alas what availed instinctive chivalry against main strength he only succeeded in forcing the door open in spite of miss porters superior strategy andi fear i must add muscle alsoand threw himself passionately at hornsbys throat where he hung on and calmly awaited dissolution but he had in the onset driven hornsby out into the road and the moonlight  here somebody take my lines the voice was mountain charleys the driver the figure that jumped from the box and separated the struggling men belonged to this singularly direct person  youre riding inside said charley interrogatively to cass before he could reply miss porters voice came from the window  he is  charley promptly bundled cass into the coach  and you to hornsby onless youre kalkilatin to take a little pasear youre booked outside get up  it is probable that charley assisted mr hornsby as promptly to his seat for the next moment the coach was rolling on  meanwhile cass by reason of his forced entry had been deposited in miss porters lap whence freeing himself he had attempted to climb over the middle seat but in the starting of the coach was again thrown heavily against her hat and shoulder all of which was inconsistent with the attitude of dignified reserve he had intended to display miss porter meanwhile recovered her good humor  what a brute he was ugh she said retying the ribbons of her bonnet under her square chin and smoothing out her linen duster  cass tried to look as if he had forgotten the whole affair who oh yes i see he responded absently  i suppose i ought to thank you she went on with a smile but you know really i could have kept him out if you hadnt pulled his wrist from outside ill show you look put your hand on the handle there now ill hold the lock inside firmly you see you cant turn the catch  she indeed held the lock fast it was a firm hand yet softtheir fingers had touched over the handleand looked white in the moonlight he made no reply but sank back again in his seat with a singular sensation in the fingers that had touched hers he was in the shadow and without being seen could abandon his reserve and glance at her face it struck him that he had never really seen her before she was not so tall as she had appeared to be her eyes were not large but her pupils were black moist velvety and so convex as to seem embossed on the white she had an indistinctive nose a rather colorless facewhiter at the angles of the mouth and nose through the relief of tiny freckles like grains of pepper her mouth was straight dark red but moist as her eyes she had drawn herself into the corner of the back seat her wrist put through and hanging over the swinging strap the easy lines of her plump figure swaying from side to side with the motion of the coach finally forgetful of any presence in the dark corner opposite she threw her head a little farther back slipped a trifle lower and placing two wellbooted feet upon the middle seat completed a charming and wholesome picture  five minutes elapsed she was looking straight at the moon cass beard felt his dignified reserve becoming very much like awkwardness he ought to be coldly polite  i hope youre not flustered miss by theby the he began  i she straightened herself up in the seat cast a curious glance into the dark corner and then letting herself down again said oh dear no  another five minutes elapsed she had evidently forgotten him she might at least have been civil he took refuge again in his reserve but it was now mixed with a certain pique  yet how much softer her face looked in the moonlight even her square jaw had lost that hard matteroffact practical indication which was so distasteful to him and always had suggested a harsh criticism of his weakness how moist her eyes wereactually shining in the light how that light seemed to concentrate in the corner of the lashes and then slippeda flashaway was she yes she was crying  cass melted he moved miss porter put her head out of the window and drew it back in a moment dryeyed  one meets all sorts of folks traveling said cass with what he wished to make appear a cheerful philosophy  i dare say i dont know i never before met any one who was rude to me i have traveled all over the country alone and with all kinds of people ever since i was so high i have always gone my own way without hindrance or trouble i always do i dont see why i shouldnt perhaps other people maynt like it i do i like excitement i like to see all that there is to see because im a girl i dont see why i cannot go out without a keeper and why i cannot do what any man can do that isnt wrong do you perhaps you doperhaps you dont perhaps you like a girl to be always in the house dawdling or thumping a piano or reading novels perhaps you think im bold because i dont like it and wont lie and say i do  she spoke sharply and aggressively and so evidently in answer to casss unspoken indictment against her that he was not surprised when she became more direct  you know you were shocked when i went to fetch that hornsby the coroner after we found the dead body  hornsby wasnt shocked said cass a little viciously  what do you mean she said abruptly  you were good friends enough until  until he insulted me just now is that it  until he thought stammered cass that because you wereyou knownot sososo careful as other girls he could be a little freer  and so because i preferred to ride a mile with him to see something real that had happened and tried to be useful instead of looking in shop windows in main street or promenading before the hotel  and being ornamental interrupted cass but this feeble and uncasslike attempt at playful gallantry met with a sudden check  miss porter drew herself together and looked out of the window do you wish me to walk the rest of the way home  no said cass hurriedly with a crimson face and a sense of gratuitous rudeness  then stop that kind of talk right there  there was an awkward silence i wish i was a man she said half bitterly half earnestly cass beard was not old and cynical enough to observe that this devout aspiration is usually uttered by those who have least reason to deplore their own femininity and but for the rebuff he had just received would have made the usual emphatic dissent of our sex when the wish is uttered by warm red lips and tender voicesa dissent it may be remarked generally withheld however when the masculine spinster dwells on the perfection of woman i dare say miss porter was sincere for a moment later she continued poutingly  and yet i used to go to fires in sacramento when i was only ten years old i saw the theatre burnt down nobody found fault with me then  something made cass ask if her father and mother objected to her boyish tastes the reply was characteristic if not satisfactory  object id like to see them do it  the direction of the road had changed the fickle moon now abandoned miss porter and sought out cass on the front seat it caressed the young fellows silky moustache and long eyelashes and took some of the sunburn from his cheek  whats the matter with your neck said the girl suddenly  cass looked down blushing to find that the collar of his smart duck sailor shirt was torn open but something more than his white soft girlish skin was exposed the shirt front was dyed quite red with blood from a slight cut on the shoulder he remembered to have felt a scratch while struggling with hornsby  the girls soft eyes sparkled let me she said vivaciously do im good at wounds come over here nostay there ill come over to you  she did bestriding the back of the middle seat and dropping at his side the magnetic fingers again touched his he felt her warm breath on his neck as she bent toward him  its nothing he said hastily more agitated by the treatment than the wound  give me your flask she responded without heeding a stinging sensation as she bathed the edges of the cut with the spirit brought him back to common sense again there she said skillfully extemporizing a bandage from her handkerchief and a compress from his cravat now button your coat over your chest so and dont take cold she insisted upon buttoning it for him greater even than the feminine delight in a mans strength is the ministration to his weakness yet when this was finished she drew a little away from him in some embarrassmentan embarrassment she wondered at as his skin was finer his touch gentler his clothes cleaner andnot to put too fine a point upon ithe exhaled an atmosphere much sweeter than belonged to most of the men her boyish habits had brought her in contact withnot excepting her own father later she even exempted her mother from the possession of this divine effluence after a moment she asked suddenly what are you going to do with hornsby  cass had not thought of him his shortlived rage was past with the occasion that provoked it without any fear of his adversary he would have been content and quite willing to meet him no more he only said that will depend upon him  oh you wont hear from him again said she confidently but you really ought to get up a little more muscle youve no more than a girl she stopped a little confused  what shall i do with your handkerchief asked the uneasy cass anxious to change the subject  oh keep it if you want to only dont show it to everybody as you did that ring you found seeing signs of distress in his face she added of course that was all nonsense if you had cared so much for the ring you couldnt have talked about it or shown it could you  it relieved him to think that this might be true he certainly had not looked at it in that light before  but did you really find it she asked with sudden gravity really now  yes  and there was no real may in the case  not that i know of laughed cass secretly pleased  but miss porter after eying him critically for a moment jumped up and climbed back again to her seat perhaps you had better give me that handkerchief back  cass began to unbutton his coat  no no do you want to take your death of cold she screamed and cass to avoid this direful possibility rebuttoned his coat again over the handkerchief and a peculiarly pleasing sensation  very little now was said until the rattling bounding descent of the coach denoted the approach to red chief the straggling main street disclosed itself light by light in the flash of glittering windows and the sound of eager voices miss porter descended without waiting for casss proffered assistance and anticipated mountain charleys descent from the box a few undistinguishable words passed between them  you kin freeze to me miss said charley and miss porter turning her frank laugh and frankly opened palm to cass half returned the pressure of his hand and slipped away  a few days after the stage coach incident mountain charley drew up beside cass on the blazing star turnpike and handed him a small packet i was told to give ye that by miss porter hushlisten its that rather old doggoned ring o yours thats bin in all the papers shes bamboozled that sapheaded county judge boompointer into givin it to her take my advice and sling it away for some other feller to pick up and get looney over thats all  did she say anything asked cass anxiously as he received his lost treasure somewhat coldly  well yes i reckon she asked me to stand betwixt hornsby and you so dont you tackle him and ill see he dont tackle you and with a portentous wink mountain charley whipped up his horses and was gone  cass opened the packet it contained nothing but the ring unmitigated by any word of greeting remembrance or even raillery it seemed almost an insult had she intended to flaunt his folly in his face or had she believed he still mourned for it and deemed its recovery a sufficient reward for his slight service for an instant he felt tempted to follow charleys advice and cast this symbol of folly and contempt in the dust of the mountain road and had she not made his humiliation complete by begging charleys interference between him and his enemy he would go home and send her back the handkerchief she had given him but here the unromantic reflection that although he had washed it that very afternoon in the solitude of his own cabin he could not possibly iron it but must send it rough dried stayed his indignant feet  two or three days a week a fortnight even of this hopeless resentment filled casss breast then the news of kanaka joes acquittal in the state court momentarily revived the story of the ring and revamped a few stale jokes in the camp but the interest soon flagged the fortunes of the little community of blazing star had been for some months failing and with early snows in the mountain and wasted capital in fruitless schemes on the river there was little room for the indulgence of that lazy and original humor which belonged to their lost youth and prosperity blazing star truly in the grim figure of their slang was played out not dug out worked out or washed out but dissipated in a year of speculation and chance  against this tide of fortune cass struggled manfully and even evoked the slow praise of his companions better still he won a certain praise for himself in himself in a consciousness of increased strength health power and selfreliance he began to turn his quick imagination and perception to some practical account and made one or two discoveries which quite startled his more experienced but more conservative companions nevertheless casss discoveries and labors were not of a kind that produced immediate pecuniary realization and blazing star which consumed so many pounds of pork and flour daily did not unfortunately produce the daily equivalent in gold blazing star lost its credit blazing star was hungry dirty and ragged blazing star was beginning to set  participating in the general ill luck of the camp cass was not without his own individual mischances he had resolutely determined to forget miss porter and all that tended to recall the unlucky ring but cruelly enough she was the only thing that refused to be forgottenwhose undulating figure reclined opposite to him in the weird moonlight of his ruined cabin whose voice mingled with the song of the river by whose banks he toiled and whose eyes and touch thrilled him in his dreams partly for this reason and partly because his clothes were beginning to be patched and torn he avoided red chief and any place where he would be likely to meet her in spite of this precaution he had once seen her driving in a pony carriage but so smartly and fashionably dressed that he drew back in the cover of a wayside willow that she might pass without recognition he looked down upon his redsplashed clothes and grimy soilstreaked hands and for a moment half hated her his comrades seldom spoke of herinstinctively fearing some temptation that might beset his spartan resolutions but he heard from time to time that she had been seen at balls and parties apparently enjoying those very frivolities of her sex she affected to condemn  it was a sabbath morning in early spring that he was returning from an ineffectual attempt to enlist a capitalist at the county town to redeem the fortunes of blazing star he was pondering over the narrowness of that capitalist who had evidently but illogically connected casss present appearance with the future of that struggling camp when he became so footsore that he was obliged to accept a lift from a wayfaring teamster as the slowly lumbering vehicle passed the new church on the outskirts of the town the congregation were sallying forth it was too late to jump down and run away and cass dared not ask his newfound friend to whip up his cattle conscious of his unshorn beard and ragged garments he kept his eyes fixed upon the road a voice that thrilled him called his name it was miss porter a resplendent vision of silk laces and easter flowersyet actually running with something of her old dash and freedom beside the wagon as the astonished teamster drew up before this elegant apparition she panted  why did you make me run so far and why didnt you look up  cass trying to hide the patches on his knees beneath a newspaper stammered that he had not seen her  and you did not hold down your head purposely  no said cass  why have you not been to red chief why didnt you answer my message about the ring she asked swiftly  you sent nothing but the ring said cass coloring as he glanced at the teamster  why that was a message you born idiot  cass stared the teamster smiled miss porter gazed anxiously at the wagon i think id like a ride in there it looks awfully good she glanced mischievously around at the lingering and curious congregation  may i  but cass deprecated that proceeding strongly it was dirty he was not sure it was even wholesome she would be so uncomfortable he himself was only going a few rods farther and in that time she might ruin her dress  oh yes she said a little bitterly certainly my dress must be looked after andwhat else  people might think it strange and believe i had invited you continued cass hesitatingly  when i had only invited myself thank you goodby  she waved her hand and stepped back from the wagon cass would have given worlds to recall her but he sat still and the vehicle moved on in moody silence at the first cross road he jumped down thank you he said to the teamster youre welcome returned that gentleman regarding him curiously but the next time a gal like that asks to ride in this yer wagon i reckon i wont take the vote of any deadhead passenger adios young fellow dont stay out late ye might be run off by some gal and what would your mother say of course the young man could only look unutterable things and walk away but even in that dignified action he was conscious that its effect was somewhat mitigated by a large patch from a material originally used as a flour sack which had repaired his trousers but still bore the ironical legend best superfine  the summer brought warmth and promise and some blossom if not absolute fruition to blazing star the long days drew nature into closer communion with the men and hopefulness followed the discontent of their winter seclusion it was easier too for capital to be wooed and won into making a picnic in these mountain solitudes than when high water stayed the fords and drifting snow the sierran trails at the close of one of these arcadian days cass was smoking before the door of his lonely cabin when he was astounded by the onset of a dozen of his companions peter drummond far in the van was waving a newspaper like a victorious banner alls right now cass old man he panted as he stopped before cass and shoved back his eager followers  whats all right asked cass dubiously  you you kin rake down the pile now youre hunky youre on velvet listen  he opened the newspaper and read with annoying deliberation as follows  lostif the finder of a plain gold ring bearing the engraved inscription may to cass alleged to have been picked up on the high road near blazing star on the 4th march 186 will apply to bookham  sons bankers 1007 y street sacramento he will be suitably rewarded either for the recovery of the ring or for such facts as may identify it or the locality where it was found  cass rose and frowned savagely on his comrades no no cried a dozen voices assuringly its all right honest injun true as gospel no joke cass  heres the paper sacramento union of yesterday look for yourself said drummond handing him the wellworn journal and you see he added how darned lucky you are it aint necessary for you to produce the ring so if that old biled owl of a boompointer dont giv it back to ye its all the same  and they say nobody but the finder need apply interrupted another that shuts out boompointer or kanaka joe for the matter o that  its clar that it means you cass ez much ez if theyd given your name added a third  for miss porters sake and his own cass had never told them of the restoration of the ring and it was evident that mountain charley had also kept silent cass could not speak now without violating a secret and he was pleased that the ring itself no longer played an important part in the mystery but what was that mystery and why was the ring secondary to himself why was so much stress laid upon his finding it  you see said drummond as if answering his unspoken thought that ar galfor it is a gal in coursehez read all about it in the papers and hez sort o took a shine to ye it dont make a bit o difference who in thunder cass is or waz for i reckon shes kicked him over by this time  sarved him right too for losing the girls ring and then lying low and keeping dark about it interrupted a sympathizer  and shes just weakened over the romantic hightoned way you stuck to it continued drummond forgetting the sarcasms he had previously hurled at this romance indeed the whole camp by this time had become convinced that it had fostered and developed a chivalrous devotion which was now on the point of pecuniary realization it was generally accepted that she was the daughter of this banker and also felt that in the circumstances the happy father could not do less than develop the resources of blazing star at once even if there were no relationship what opportunity could be more fit for presenting to capital a locality that even produced engagement rings and as jim fauquier put it the men ez knew how to keep em it was this sympathetic virginian who took cass aside with the following generous suggestion if you find that you and the old gal couldnt hitch hosses owin to your not likin red hair or a game leg it may be here recorded that blazing star had for no reason whatever attributed these unprepossessing qualities to the mysterious advertiser you might let me in you might say ez how i used to jest worship that ring with you and allers wanted to borrow it on sundays if anything comes of itwhywere pardners  a serious question was the outfitting of cass for what now was felt to be a diplomatic representation of the community his garments it hardly need be said were inappropriate to any wooing except that of the maiden all forlorn which the advertiser clearly was not he might suggested fauquier drop in jest as he iskinder as if hed got keerless of the world being lovesick but cass objected strongly and was borne out in his objection by his younger comrades at last a pair of white duck trousers a red shirt a flowing black silk scarf and a panama hat were procured at red chief on credit after a judicious exhibition of the advertisement a heavy wedding ring the property of drummond who was not married was also lent as a graceful suggestion and at the last moment fauquier affixed to casss scarf an enormous specimen pin of gold and quartz it sorter indicates the auriferous wealth o this yer region and the old man the senior member of bookham  sons neednt know i won it at draw poker in frisco said fauquier  ef you pass on the gal you kin hand it back to me and ill try it on forty dollars for expenses was put into casss hands and the entire community accompanied him to the cross roads where he was to meet the sacramento coach which eventually carried him away followed by a benediction of waving hats and exploding revolvers  that cass did not participate in the extravagant hopes of his comrades and that he rejected utterly their matrimonial speculations in his behalf need not be said outwardly he kept his own counsel with goodhumored assent but there was something fascinating in the situation and while he felt he had forever abandoned his romantic dream he was not displeased to know that it might have proved a reality nor was it distasteful to him to think that miss porter would hear of it and regret her late inability to appreciate his sentiment if he really were the object of some opulent maidens passion he would show miss porter how he could sacrifice the most brilliant prospects for her sake alone on the top of the coach he projected one of those satisfying conversations in which imaginative people delight but which unfortunately never come quite up to rehearsal dear miss porter he would say addressing the back of the driver if i could remain faithful to a dream of my youth however illusive and unreal can you believe that for the sake of lucre i could be false to the one real passion that alone supplanted it in the composition and delivery of this eloquent statement an hour was happily forgotten the only drawback to its complete effect was that a misplace of epithets in rapid repetition did not seem to make the slightest difference and cass found himself saying dear miss porter if i could be false to a dream of my youth etc etc can you believe i could be faithful to the one real passion etc etc with equal and perfect satisfaction as miss porter was reputed to be well off if the unknown were poor that might be another drawback  the banking house of bookham  sons did not present an illusive nor mysterious appearance it was eminently practical and matter of fact it was obtrusively open and glassy nobody would have thought of leaving a secret there that would have been inevitably circulated over the counter cass felt an uncomfortable sense of incongruity in himself in his story in his treasure to this temple of disenchanting realism with the awkwardness of an embarrassed man he was holding prominently in his hand an envelope containing the ring and advertisement as a voucher for his intrusion when the nearest clerk took the envelope from his hand opened it took out the ring returned it said briskly tother shop next door young man and turned to another customer  cass stepped to the door saw that tother shop was a pawnbrokers and returned again with a flashing eye and heightened color its an advertisement i have come to answer he began again  the clerk cast a glance at casss scarf and pin place taken yesterdayno room for any more he said abruptly  cass grew quite white but his old experience in blazing star repartee stood him in good stead if its your place you mean he said coolly i reckon you might put a dozen men in the hole youre rattlin round inbut its this advertisement im after if bookham isnt in maybe youll send me one of the grownup sons the production of the advertisement and some laughter from the bystanders had its effect the pert young clerk retired and returned to lead the way to the bank parlor casss heart sank again as he was confronted by a dark irongray manin dress features speech and actionuncompromisingly opposed to casshis ring and his romance when the young man had told his story and produced his treasure he paused the banker scarcely glanced at it but said impatiently  well your papers  my papers  yes proof of your identity you say your name is cass beard good what have you got to prove it how can i tell who you are  to a sensitive man there is no form of suspicion that is as bewildering and demoralizing at the moment as the question of his identity cass felt the insult in the doubt of his word and the palpable sense of his present inability to prove it the banker watched him keenly but not unkindly  come he said at length this is not my affair if you can legally satisfy the lady for whom i am only agent well and good i believe you can i only warn you that you must and my present inquiry was to keep her from losing her time with impostors a class i dont think you belong to theres her card good day  miss mortimer it was not the bankers daughter the first illusion of blazing star was rudely dispelled but the care taken by the capitalist to shield her from imposture indicated a person of wealth of her youth and beauty cass no longer thought  the address given was not distant with a beating heart he rung the bell of a respectablelooking house and was ushered into a private drawingroom instinctively he felt that the room was only temporarily inhabited an air peculiar to the best lodgings and when the door opened upon a tall lady in deep mourning he was still more convinced of an incongruity between the occupant and her surroundings with a smile that vacillated between a habit of familiarity and ease and a recent restraint she motioned him to a chair  miss mortimer was still young still handsome still fashionably dressed and still attractive from her first greeting to the end of the interview cass felt that she knew all about him this relieved him from the onus of proving his identity but seemed to put him vaguely at a disadvantage it increased his sense of inexperience and youthfulness  i hope you will believe she began that the few questions i have to ask you are to satisfy my own heart and for no other purpose she smiled sadly as she went on had it been otherwise i should have instituted a legal inquiry and left this interview to some one cooler calmer and less interested than myself but i think i know i can trust you perhaps we women are weak and foolish to talk of an instinct and when you know my story you may have reason to believe that but little dependence can be placed on that but i am not wrong in sayingam i with a sad smile that you are not above that weakness she paused closed her lips tightly and grasped her hands before her you say you found that ring in the road some three months beforethetheyou know what i meanthe bodywas discovered  yes  you thought it might have been dropped by some one in passing  i thought so yesit belonged to no one in camp  before your cabin or on the highway  before my cabin  you are sure there was something so very sweet and sad in her smile that it oddly made cass color  but my cabin is near the road he suggested  i see and there was nothing else no paper nor envelope  nothing  and you kept it because of the odd resemblance one of the names bore to yours  yes  for no other reason  none yet cass felt he was blushing  youll forgive my repeating a question you have already answered but i am so anxious there was some attempt to prove at the inquest that the ring had been found on the body ofthe unfortunate man but you tell me it was not so  i can swear it  good godthe traitor she took a hurried step forward turned to the window and then came back to cass with a voice broken with emotion i have told you i could trust you that ring was mine  she stopped and then went on hurriedly years ago i gave it to a man who deceived and wronged me a man whose life since then has been a shame and disgrace to all who knew him a man who once a gentleman sank so low as to become the associate of thieves and ruffians sank so low that when he died by violencea traitor even to themhis own confederates shrunk from him and left him to fill a nameless grave that mans body you found  cass started and his name was  part of your surname casshenry cass  you see why providence seems to have brought that ring to you she went on but you ask me why knowing this i am so eager to know if the ring was found by you in the road or if it were found on his body listen it is part of my mortification that the story goes that this man once showed this ring boasted of it staked and lost it at a gambling table to one of his vile comrades  kanaka joe said cass overcome by a vivid recollection of joes merriment at the trial  the same dont you see she said hurriedly if the ring had been found on him i could believe that somewhere in his heart he still kept respect for the woman he had wronged i am a womana foolish woman i knowbut you have crushed that hope forever  but why have you sent for me asked cass touched by her emotion  to know it for certain she said almost fiercely can you not understand that a woman like me must know a thing once and forever but you can help me i did not send for you only to pour my wrongs in your ears you must take me with you to this placeto the spot where you found the ringto the spot where you found the bodyto the spot wherewhere he lies you must do it secretly that none shall know me  cass hesitated he was thinking of his companions and the collapse of their painted bubble how could he keep the secret from them  if it is money you need let not that stop you i have no right to your time without recompense do not misunderstand me there has been a thousand dollars awaiting my order at bookhams when the ring should be delivered it shall be doubled if you help me in this last moment  it was possible he could convey her secretly there invent some story of a reward delayed for want of proofs and afterward share that reward with his friends he answered promptly i will take you there  she took his hands in both of hers raised them to her lips and smiled the shadow of grief and restraint seemed to have fallen from her face and a halfmischievous halfcoquettish gleam in her dark eyes touched the susceptible cass in so subtle a fashion that he regained the street in some confusion he wondered what miss porter would have thought but was he not returning to her a fortunate man with one thousand dollars in his pocket why should he remember he was handicapped by a pretty woman and a pathetic episode it did not make the proximity less pleasant as he helped her into the coach that evening nor did the recollection of another ride with another woman obtrude itself upon those consolations which he felt it his duty from time to time to offer it was arranged that he should leave her at the red chief hotel while he continued on to blazing star returning at noon to bring her with him when he could do it without exposing her to recognition the gray dawn came soon enough and the coach drew up at red chief while the lights in the barroom and diningroom of the hotel were still struggling with the far flushing east cass alighted placed miss mortimer in the hands of the landlady and returned to the vehicle it was still musty close and frowzy with halfawakened passengers there was a vacated seat on the top which cass climbed up to and abstractedly threw himself beside a figure muffled in shawls and rugs there was a slight movement among the multitudinous enwrappings and then the figure turned to him and said dryly good morning it was miss porter  have you been long here he stammered  all night  he would have given worlds to leave her at that moment he would have jumped from the starting coach to save himself any explanation of the embarrassment he was furiously conscious of showing without as he believed any adequate cause and yet like all inexperienced sensitive men he dashed blindly into that explanation worse he even told his secret at once then and there and then sat abashed and conscience stricken with an added sense of its utter futility  and this summed up the young girl with a slight shrug of her pretty shoulders is your may  cass would have recommenced his story  no dont pray it isnt interesting nor original do you believe it  i do said cass indignantly  how lucky then let me go to sleep  cass still furious but uneasy did not again address her when the coach stopped at blazing star she asked him indifferently when does this sentimental pilgrimage begin  i return for her at one oclock replied cass stiffly  he kept his word he appeased his eager companions with a promise of future fortune and exhibited the present and tangible reward by a circuitous route known only to himself he led miss mortimer to the road before the cabin there was a pink flush of excitement on her somewhat faded cheek  and it was here she asked eagerly  i found it here  and the body  that was afterward over in that direction beyond the clump of buckeyes on the red chief turnpike  and any one coming from the road we left just now and going totothat place would have to cross just here tell me she said with a strange laugh laying her cold nervous hand on his wouldnt they  they would  let us go to that place  cass stepped out briskly to avoid observation and gain the woods beyond the highway you have crossed here before she said there seems to be a trail  i may have made it its a short cut to the buckeyes  you never found anything else on the trail  you remember i told you before the ring was all i found  ah true she smiled sweetly it was that which made it seem so odd to you i forgot  in half an hour they reached the buckeyes during the walk she had taken rapid recognizance of everything in her path when they crossed the road and cass had pointed out the scene of the murder she looked anxiously around you are sure we are not seen  quite  you will not think me foolish if i ask you to wait here while i go in thereshe pointed to the ominous thicket near themalone  she was quite white  casss heart which had grown somewhat cold since his interview with miss porter melted at once  go i will stay here  he waited five minutes she did not return  what if the poor creature had determined upon suicide on the spot where her faithless lover had fallen he was reassured in another moment by the rustle of skirts in the undergrowth  i was becoming quite alarmed he said aloud  you have reason to be returned a hurried voice he started it was miss porter who stepped swiftly out of the cover look she said look at that man down the road he has been tracking you two ever since you left the cabin do you know who he is  no  then listen it is threefingered dick one of the escaped road agents i know him  let us go and warn her said cass eagerly  miss porter laid her hand upon his shoulder  i dont think shell thank you she said dryly perhaps youd better see what shes doing first  utterly bewildered yet with a strong sense of the masterfulness of his companion he followed her she crept like a cat through the thicket suddenly she paused look she whispered viciously look at the tender vigils of your heartbroken may  cass saw the woman who had left him a moment before on her knees on the grass with long thin fingers digging like a ghoul in the earth he had scarce time to notice her eager face and eyes cast now and then back toward the spot where she had left him before there was a crash in the bushes and a manthe stranger of the roadleaped to her side run he said run for it now youre watched  oh that man beard she said contemptuously  no another in a wagon quick fool you know the place nowyou can come later run and halfdragging halflifting her he bore her through the bushes scarcely had they closed behind the pair than miss porter ran to the spot vacated by the woman look she cried triumphantly look  cass looked and sank on his knees beside her  it was worth a thousand dollars wasnt it she repeated maliciously wasnt it but you ought to return it really you ought  cass could scarcely articulate but how did you know it he finally gasped  oh i suspected something there was a woman and you know youre such a fool  cass rose stiffly  dont be a greater fool now but go and bring my horse and wagon from the hill and dont say anything to the driver  then you did not come alone  no it would have been bold and improper  please  and to think it was the ring after all that pointed to this she said  the ring that you returned to me  what did you say  nothing  dont please the wagon is coming    in the next mornings edition of the red chief chronicle appeared the following startling intelligence   extraordinary discovery  finding of the stolen treasure of wells fargo  co  over 800000 recovered  our readers will remember the

known in this county succeeded in exhuming the treasure in a copse of hazel near the red chief turnpikeadjacent to the spot where an unknown body was lately discovered this body is now strongly suspected to be that of one henry cass a disreputable character who has since been ascertained to have been one of the road agents who escaped the matter is now under legal investigation the successful result of the search is due to a systematic plan evolved from the genius of mr beard who has devoted over a year to this labor it was first suggested to him by the finding of a ring now definitely identified as part of the treasure which was supposed to have been dropped from wells fargo  cos boxes by the robbers in their midnight flight through blazing star   in the same journal
