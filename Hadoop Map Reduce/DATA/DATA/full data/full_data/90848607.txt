there is      a sound as of a closing outer door                            the curtain falls     the curtain rises again at once  scene ii       in the barthwicks diningroom  jack is still asleep the      morning light is coming through the curtains  the time is      halfpast eight  wheeler brisk person enters with a dustpan      and mrs jones more slowly with a scuttle  wheeler  drawing the curtains  that precious husband of yours was round for you after youd gone yesterday mrs jones  wanted your money for drink i suppose  he hangs about the corner here half the time  i saw him outside the goat and bells when i went to the post last night  if i were you i would nt live with him  i would nt live with a man that raised his hand to me  i wouldnt put up with it  why dont you take your children and leave him  if you put up with im itll only make him worse  i never can see why because a mans married you he should knock you about  mrs jones  slim darkeyed and darkhaired ovalfaced and with a smooth soft even voice her manner patient her way of talking quite impersonal she wears a blue linen dress and boots with holes  it was nearly two last night before he come home and he wasnt himself  he made me get up and he knocked me about he didnt seem to know what he was saying or doing  of course i would leave him but im really afraid of what hed do to me  he s such a violent man when hes not himself  wheeler  why dont you get him locked up  youll never have any peace until you get him locked up  if i were you id go to the police court tomorrow  thats what i would do  mrs jones  of course i ought to go because he does treat me so badly when hes not himself  but you see bettina he has a very hard timehe s been out of work two months and it preys upon his mind  when hes in work he behaves himself much better  its when hes out of work that hes so violent  wheeler  well if you wont take any steps you ll never get rid of him  mrs jones  of course its very wearing to me i dont get my sleep at nights  and it s not as if i were getting help from him because i have to do for the children and all of us  and he throws such dreadful things up at me talks of my having men to follow me about  such a thing never happens no man ever speaks to me  and of course its just the other way  its what he does thats wrong and makes me so unhappy  and then he s always threatenin to cut my throat if i leave him  its all the drink and things preying on his mind he s not a bad man really  sometimes hell speak quite kind to me but ive stood so much from him i dont feel it in me to speak kind back but just keep myself to myself  and hes all right with the children too except when hes not himself  wheeler  you mean when hes drunk the beauty  mrs jones  yes  without change of voice  theres the young gentleman asleep on the sofa       they both look silently at jack  mrs jones  at last in her soft voice  he does nt look quite himself  wheeler  hes a young limb thats what he is  it s my belief he was tipsy last night like your husband  it s another kind of bein out of work that sets him to drink  i ll go and tell marlow this is his job       she goes       mrs jones upon her knees begins a gentle sweeping  jack  waking  whos there  what is it  mrs jones  its me sir mrs jones  jack  sitting up and looking round  where is itwhatwhat time is it  mrs jones  its getting on for nine oclock sir  jack  for nine  whywhat  rising and loosening his tongue putting hands to his head and staring hard at mrs jones  look here you mrsmrs jonesdont you say you caught me asleep here  mrs jones  no sir of course i wont sir  jack  its quite an accident i dont know how it happened  i must have forgotten to go to bed  its a queer thing  i ve got a most beastly headache  mind you dont say anything mrs jones       goes out and passes marlow in the doorway  marlow is young      and quiet he is cleanshaven and his hair is brushed high from      his forehead in a coxcomb  incidentally a butler he is first      a man  he looks at mrs jones and smiles a private smile  marlow  not the first time and wont be the last  looked a bit dicky eh mrs jones  mrs jones  he did nt look quite himself  of course i did nt take notice  marlow  youre used to them  hows your old man  mrs jones  softly as throughout  well he was very bad last night he did nt seem to know what he was about  he was very late and he was most abusive  but now of course hes asleep  marlow  thats his way of finding a job eh  mrs jones  as a rule mr marlow he goes out early every morning looking for work and sometimes he comes in fit to dropand of course i cant say he does nt try to get it because he does trades very bad  she stands quite still her fan and brush before her at the beginning and the end of long vistas of experience traversing them with her impersonal eye  but hes not a good husband to melast night he hit me and he was so dreadfully abusive  marlow  bank oliday eh  he s too fond of the goat and bells thats whats the matter with him  i see him at the corner late every night  he hangs about  mrs jones  he gets to feeling very low walking about all day after work and being refused so often and then when he gets a drop in him it goes to his head  but he shouldnt treat his wife as he treats me  sometimes i ve had to go and walk about at night when he wouldnt let me stay in the room but hes sorry for it afterwards  and he hangs about after me he waits for me in the street and i dont think he ought to because i ve always been a good wife to him  and i tell him mrs barthwick wouldnt like him coming about the place  but that only makes him angry and he says dreadful things about the gentry  of course it was through me that he first lost his place through his not treating me right and thats made him bitter against the gentry  he had a very good place as groom in the country but it made such a stir because of course he did nt treat me right  marlow  got the sack  mrs jones  yes his employer said he couldnt keep him because there was a great deal of talk and he said it was such a bad example  but its very important for me to keep my work here i have the three children and i dont want him to come about after me in the streets and make a disturbance as he sometimes does  marlow  holding up the empty decanter  not a drain  next time he hits you get a witness and go down to the court  mrs jones  yes i think i ve made up my mind  i think i ought to  marlow  thats right  wheres the ciga       he searches for the silver box he looks at mrs jones who is      sweeping on her hands and knees he checks himself and stands      reflecting  from the tray he picks two halfsmoked cigarettes      and reads the name on them  nestorwhere the deuce       with a meditative air he looks again at mrs jones and      taking up jacks overcoat he searches in the pockets      wheeler with a tray of breakfast things comes in  marlow  aside to wheeler  have you seen the cigarettebox  wheeler  no  marlow  well its gone  i put it on the tray last night  and hes been smoking  showing her the ends of cigarettes  its not in these pockets  he cant have taken it upstairs this morning have a good look in his room when he comes down  whos been in here  wheeler  only me and mrs jones  mrs jones  i ve finished here shall i do the drawingroom now  wheeler  looking at her doubtfully  have you seenbetter do the boudwower first       mrs jones goes out with pan and brush  marlow and wheeler      look each other in the face  marlow  itll turn up  wheeler  hesitating  you dont think she nodding at the door  marlow  stoutly  i donti never believes anything of anybody  wheeler  but the masterll have to be told  marlow  you wait a bit and see if it dont turn up  suspicions no business of ours  i set my mind against it                       the curtain falls                    the curtain rises again at once    scene iii       barthwick and mrs barthwick are seated at the breakfast table      he is a man between fifty and sixty quietly important with a      bald forehead and pincenez and the times in his hand  she      is a lady of nearly fifty well dressed with greyish hair      good features and a decided manner  they face each other  barthwick  from behind his paper  the labour man has got in at the byelection for barnside my dear  mrs barthwick  another labour  i cant think what on earth the country is about  barthwick  i predicted it  its not a matter of vast importance  mrs barthwick  not  how can you take it so calmly john  to me its simply outrageous  and there you sit you liberals and pretend to encourage these people  barthwick  frowning  the representation of all parties is necessary for any proper reform for any proper social policy  mrs barthwick  ive no patience with your talk of reformall that nonsense about social policy  we know perfectly well what it is they want they want things for themselves  those socialists and labour men are an absolutely selfish set of people  they have no sense of patriotism like the upper classes they simply want what weve got  barthwick  want what weve got  he stares into space  my dear what are you talking about  with a contortion  i m no alarmist  mrs barthwick  cream  quite uneducated men  wait until they begin to tax our investments  i m convinced that when they once get a chance they will tax everythingthey ve no feeling for the country  you liberals and conservatives you re all alike you dont see an inch before your noses  youve no imagination not a scrap of imagination between you  you ought to join hands and nip it in the bud  barthwick  you re talking nonsense  how is it possible for liberals and conservatives to join hands as you call it  that shows how absurd it is for womenwhy the very essence of a liberal is to trust in the people  mrs barthwick  now john eat your breakfast  as if there were any real difference between you and the conservatives  all the upper classes have the same interests to protect and the same principles  calmly  oh  youre sitting upon a volcano john  barthwick  what  mrs barthwick  i read a letter in the paper yesterday  i forget the mans name but it made the whole thing perfectly clear  you dont look things in the face  barthwick  indeed  heavily  i am a liberal  drop the subject please  mrs barthwick  toast  i quite agree with what this man says education is simply ruining the lower classes  it unsettles them and thats the worst thing for us all  i see an enormous difference in the manner of servants  barthwick with suspicious emphasis  i welcome any change that will lead to something better  he opens a letter  hm  this is that affair of master jacks again  high street oxford  sir we have received mr john barthwick seniors draft for forty pounds oh the letters to him  we now enclose the cheque you cashed with us which as we stated in our previous letter was not met on presentation at your bank  we are sir yours obediently moss and sons tailors  h m  staring at the cheque  a pretty business altogether  the boy might have been prosecuted  mrs barthwick  come john you know jack did nt mean anything he only thought he was overdrawing  i still think his bank ought to have cashed that cheque  they must know your position  barthwick  replacing in the envelope the letter and the cheque much good that would have done him in a court of law       he stops as jack comes in fastening his waistcoat and      staunching a razor cut upon his chin  jack  sitting down between them and speaking with an artificial joviality  sorry i m late  he looks lugubriously at the dishes  tea please mother  any letters for me  barthwick hands the letter to him  but look here i say this has been opened  i do wish you would nt  barthwick  touching the envelope  i suppose i m entitled to this name  jack  sulkily  well i cant help having your name father  he reads the letter and mutters  brutes  barthwick  eyeing him  you dont deserve to be so well out of that  jack  havent you ragged me enough dad  mrs barthwick  yes john let jack have his breakfast  barthwick  if you hadnt had me to come to where would you have been  its the merest accidentsuppose you had been the son of a poor man or a clerk  obtaining money with a cheque you knew your bank could not meet  it might have ruined you for life  i cant see whats to become of you if these are your principles  i never did anything of the sort myself  jack  i expect you always had lots of money  if youve got plenty of money of course  barthwick  on the contrary i had not your advantages  my father kept me very short of money  jack  how much had you dad  barthwick  its not material  the question is do you feel the gravity of what you did  jack  i dont know about the gravity  of course i m very sorry if you think it was wrong  have nt i said so  i should never have done it at all if i had nt been so jolly hard up  barthwick  how much of that forty pounds have you got left jack  jack  hesitating  i dont knownot much  barthwick  how much  jack  desperately  i have nt got any  barthwick  what  jack  i know i ve got the most beastly headache       he leans his head on his hand  mrs barthwick  headache  my dear boy  cant you eat any breakfast  jack  drawing in his breath  too jolly bad  mrs barthwick  im so sorry  come with me dear ill give you something that will take it away at once       they leave the room and barthwick tearing up the letter      goes to the fireplace and puts the pieces in the fire  while      he is doing this marlow comes in and looking round him is      about quietly to withdraw  barthwick  whats that  what d you want  marlow  i was looking for mr john sir

black but rather shabby dress a      black and white trimmed hat with a bunch of parma violets      wrongly placed and fuzzyspotted veil  at the sight of mr      barthwick she exhibits every sign of

there is a short struggle and jones is overpowered      mrs jones raises her hands avid drops her face on them                            the curtain falls     scene ii       the barthwicks diningroom the same evening  the barthwicks      are seated at dessert  mrs barthwick  john  a silence broken by the cracking of nuts john  barthwick  i wish youd speak about the nuts theyre uneatable he puts one in his mouth  mrs barthwick  its not the season for them  i called on the holyroods       barthwick fills his glass with port  jack  crackers please dad       barthwick passes the crackers  his demeanour is reflective  mrs barthwick  lady holyrood has got very stout  i ve noticed it coming for a long time  barthwick  gloomily  stout  he takes up the crackerswith transparent airiness  the holyroods had some trouble with their servants had nt they  jack  crackers please dad  barthwick  passing the crackers  it got into the papers  the cook was nt it  mrs barthwick  no the ladys maid  i was talking it over with lady holyrood  the girl used to have her young man to see her  barthwick  uneasily  im not sure they were wise  mrs barthwick  my dear john what are you talking about  how could there be any alternative  think of the effect on the other servants  barthwick  of course in principlei wasnt thinking of that  jack  maliciously  crackers please dad       barthwick is compelled to pass the crackers  mrs barthwick  lady holyrood told me i had her up she said i said to her youll leave my house at once i think your conduct disgraceful  i cant tell i dont know and i dont wish to know what you were doing  i send you away on principle you need not come to me for a character  and the girl said if you dont give me my notice my lady i want a months wages  im perfectly respectable  ive done nothingdone nothing  barthwick  hm  mrs barthwick  servants have too much license  they hang together so terribly you never can tell what theyre really thinking its as if they were all in a conspiracy to keep you in the dark  even with marlow you feel that he never lets you know whats really in his mind  i hate that secretiveness it destroys all confidence  i feel sometimes i should like to shake him  jack  marlows a most decent chap  its simply beastly every one knowing your affairs  barthwick  the less you say about that the better  mrs barthwick  it goes all through the lower classes  you can not tell when they are speaking the truth  today when i was shopping after leaving the holyroods one of these unemployed came up and spoke to me  i suppose i only had twenty yards or so to walk to the carnage but he seemed to spring up in the street  barthwick  ah  you must be very careful whom you speak to in these days  mrs barthwick  i did nt answer him of course  but i could see at once that he wasnt telling the truth  barthwick  cracking a nut  theres one very good rulelook at their eyes  jack  crackers please dad  barthwick  passing the crackers  if their eyes are straightforward i sometimes give them sixpence  it s against my principles but its most difficult to refuse  if you see that theyre desperate and dull and shiftylooking as so many of them are its certain to mean drink or crime or something unsatisfactory  mrs barthwick  this man had dreadful eyes  he looked as if he could commit a murder  i ve ad nothing to eat today he said just like that  barthwick  what was william about  he ought to have been waiting  jack  raising his wineglass to his nose  is this the 63 dad       barthwick holding his wineglass to his eye lowers it and      passes it before his nose  mrs barthwick  i hate people that cant speak the truth  father and son exchange a look behind their port  it s just as easy to speak the truth as not  ive always found it easy enough  it makes it impossible to tell what is genuine one feels as if one were continually being taken in  barthwick  sententiously  the lower classes are their own enemies  if they would only trust us they would get on so much better  mrs barthwick  but even then its so often their own fault  look at that mrs jones this morning  barthwick  i only want to do whats right in that matter  i had occasion to see roper this afternoon  i mentioned it to him  hes coming in this evening  it all depends on what the detective says ive had my doubts  ive been thinking it over  mrs barthwick  the woman impressed me most unfavourably  she seemed to have no shame  that affair she was talking aboutshe and the man when they were young so immoral  and before you and jack i could have put her out of the room  barthwick  oh  i dont want to excuse them but in looking at these matters one must consider  mrs barthwick  perhaps youll say the mans employer was wrong in dismissing him  barthwick  of course not  its not there that i feel doubt  what i ask myself is  jack  port please dad  barthwick  circulating the decanter in religious imitation of the rising and setting of the sun  i ask myself whether we are sufficiently careful in making inquiries about people before we engage them especially as regards moral conduct  jack  pass theport please mother  mrs barthwick  passing it  my dear boy are nt you drinking too much       jack fills his glass  marlow  entering  detective snow to see you sir  barthwick  uneasily  ah  say ill be with him in a minute  mrs barthwick  without turning  let him come in here marlow       snow enters in an overcoat his bowler hat in hand  barthwick  halfrising  oh  good evening  snow  good evening sir good evening maam i ve called round to report what i ve done rather late i m afraidanother case took me away  he takes the silver box out o f his pocket causing a sensation in the barthwick family  this is the identical article i believe  barthwick  certainly certainly  snow  havin your crest and cypher as you described to me sir i d no hesitation in the matter  barthwick  excellent  will you have a glass of he glances at the waning portersherrypours out sherry  jack just give mr snow this       jack rises and gives the glass to snow then lolling in his      chair regards him indolently  snow  drinking off wine and putting down the glass  after seeing you i went round to this womans lodgings sir  its a low neighborhood and i thought it as well to place a constable below and not without e was wanted as things turned out  barthwick  indeed  snow  yes sir i ad some trouble  i asked her to account for the presence of the article  she could give me no answer except to deny the theft so i took her into custody then her husband came for me so i was obliged to take him too for assault  he was very violent on the way to the stationvery violentthreatened you and your son and altogether he was a handful i can till you  mrs barthwick  what a ruffian he must be  snow  yes maam a rough customer  jack  sipping his mine bemused  punch the beggars head  snow  given to drink as i understand sir  mrs barthwick  its to be hoped he will get a severe punishment  snow  the odd thing is sir that he persists in sayin he took the box himself  barthwick  took the box himself  he smiles  what does he think to gain by that  snow  he says the young gentleman was intoxicated last night       jack stops the cracking of a nut and looks at snow       barthwick losing his smile has put his wineglass down      there is a silencesnow looking from face to face remarks  took him into the house and gave him whisky and under the influence of an empty stomach the man says he took the box  mrs barthwick  the impudent wretch  barthwick  d you mean that heerintends to put this forward tomorrow  snow  thatll be his line sir but whether hes endeavouring to shield his wife or whether he looks at jack  theres something in it will be for the magistrate to say  mrs barthwick  haughtily  something in what  i dont understand you  as if my son would bring a man like that into the house  barthwick  from the fireplace with an effort to be calm  my son can speak for himself no doubt  well jack what do you say  mrs barthwick  sharply  what does he say  why of course he says the whole storys stuff  jack  embarrassed  well of course iof course i dont know anything about it  mrs barthwick  i should think not indeed  to snow  the man is an audacious ruffian  barthwick  suppressing jumps  but in view of my sons saying theres nothing in thisthis fablewill it be necessary to proceed against the man under the circumstances  snow  we shall have to charge him with the assault sir  it would be as well for your son to come down to the court  therell be a remand no doubt  the queer thing is there was quite a sum of money found on him and a crimson silk purse       barthwick starts jack rises and sits dozen again  i suppose the lady has nt missed her purse  barthwick  hastily  oh no  oh  no  jack  no  mrs barthwick  dreamily  no  to snow  i ve been inquiring of the servants  this man does hang about the house  i shall feel much safer if he gets a good long sentence i do think we ought to be protected against such ruffians  barthwick  yes yes of course on principle but in this case we have a number of things to think of  to snow  i suppose as you say the man must be charged eh  snow  no question about that sir  barthwick  staring gloomily at jack  this prosecution goes very much against the grain with me  i have great sympathy with the poor  in my position i m bound to recognise the distress there is amongst them  the condition of the people leaves much to be desired  d you follow me  i wish i could see my way to drop it  mrs barthwick  sharply  john  its simply not fair to other people  its putting property at the mercy of any one who likes to take it  barthwick  trying to make signs to her aside  i m not defending him not at all  im trying to look at the matter broadly  mrs barthwick  nonsense john theres a time for everything  snow  rather sardonically  i might point out sir that to withdraw the charge of stealing would not make much difference because the facts must come out he looks significantly at jack  in reference to the assault and as i said that charge will have to go forward  barthwick  hastily  yes oh  exactly  its entirely on the womans accountentirely a matter of my own private feelings  snow  if i were you sir i should let things take their course its not likely therell be much difficulty  these things are very quick settled  barthwick  doubtfully  you think soyou think so  jack  rousing himself  i say what shall i have to swear to  snow  thats best known to yourself sir  retreating to the door  better employ a solicitor sir in case anything should arise  we shall have the butler to prove the loss of the article youll excuse me going i m rather pressed tonight  the case may come on any time after eleven  good evening sir good evening maam  i shall have to produce the box in court tomorrow so if youll excuse me sir i may as well take it with me

along that i did nt take the box  magistrate  yes but did you know that it was taken  mrs jones  no your worship  and of course to what my husband says your worship i cant speak of my own knowledge  of course i know that he came home very late on the monday night  it was past one oclock when he came in and he was not himself at all  magistrate  had he been drinking  mrs jones  yes your worship  magistrate  and was he drunk  mrs jones  yes your worship he was almost quite drunk  magistrate  and did he say anything to you  mrs jones  no your worship only to call me names  and of course in the

to say  mrs jones  of course when i saw the box your worship i was dreadfully upset and i could nt think why he had done such a thing when the officer came we were having words about it because it is ruin to me your worship in my profession and i have three little children dependent on me  magistrate  protruding his neck  yesyesbut what did he say to you  mrs jones  i asked him whatever came over him to do such a thing and he said it was the drink  he said he had had too much to drink and something came over him  and of course your worship he had had very little to eat all day and the drink does go to the head when you have not had enough to eat  your worship may not know but it is the truth  and i would like to say that all through his married life i have never known him to do such a thing before though we have passed through great hardships and speaking with soft emphasis  i am quite sure he would not have done it if he had been himself at the time  magistrate  yes yes  but dont you know that that is no excuse  mrs jones  yes your worship  i know that it is no excuse       the magistrate leans over and parleys with his clerk  jack  leaning over from his seat behind  i say dad  barthwick  tsst  sheltering his mouth he speaks to roper roper you had better get up now and say that considering the circumstances and the poverty of the prisoners we have no wish to proceed any further and if the magistrate would deal with the case as one of disorder only on the part of  bald constable  hssshh       roper shakes his head  magistrate  now supposing what you say and what your husband says is true what i have to consider ishow did he obtain access to this house and were you in any way a party to his obtaining access you are the charwoman employed at the house  mrs jones

the purse  how did you come by all that money  jones  after a long pause suddenly  i declines to say  magistrate  but if you had all that money what made you take this box  jones  i took it out of

you ask im wot made im take the ladys       but the bald constable catches him by the sleeve  bald constable  sssh  magistrate  emphatically  now listen to me  i ve nothing to do with what he may or

smothered up i want it all dealt with fair i want my rights  magistrate  rapping his desk  now you have said all you have to say and you will be quiet       there is a silence the magistrate bends over and parleys with      his clerk  yes i think i may discharge the woman  in a kindly voice he addresses mrs jones who stands unmoving with her hands crossed on the rail  it is very unfortunate for you that this man has behaved as he has  it is not the consequences to him but the consequences to you  you have been brought here twice you have lost your work he glares at jonesand this is what always happens  now you may go away and i am very sorry it was necessary to bring you here at all  mrs jones  softly  thank you very much your worship       she leaves the dock and looking back at jones twists her      fingers and is still  magistrate  yes yes but i cant pass it over  go away theres a good woman       mrs jones stands back  the magistrate leans his head on his      hand then raising it he speaks to jones  now listen to me  do you wish the case to be settled here or do you wish it to go before a jury  jones  muttering  i dont want no jury  magistrate  very well then i will deal with it here  after a pause  you have pleaded guilty to stealing this box  jones  not to stealin  bald constable  hssshh  magistrate  and to assaulting the police  jones  any man as was a man  magistrate  your conduct here has been most improper  you give the excuse that you were drunk when you stole the box  i tell you that is no excuse  if you choose to get drunk and break the law

leaning from his seat  dad  thats what you said to me  barthwick  tsst       there is a silence while the magistrate consults his clerk      jones leans forward waiting  magistrate  this is your first offence and i am going to give you a light sentence  speaking sharply but without expression  one month with hard labour       he bends and parleys with his clerk  the bald constable and      another

  the prisoners door is shut on jones and from the      seedylooking men and women comes a hoarse and whispering groan  magistrate  we will now adjourn for lunch  he rises from his seat       the court is in a stir  roper gets up and speaks to the      reporter  jack throwing up his head walks with a swagger to      the corridor barthwick follows  mrs jones  turning to him zenith a humble gesture  oh  sir       barthwick hesitates then yielding to his nerves he makes a      shamefaced gesture of refusal and hurries out of court  mrs      jones stands looking after him

old beech tree      overshadows everything in the darkness of whose hollow many      things are hidden  a rustic seat encircles it  a low wall      clothed in creepers with two openings divides this

where then  mrs hope  whyupoh  gracious       mrs gwyn standing alone is smiling  lever approaches from      the towingpath  he is a man like a fencers wrist supple and      steely  a man whose age is difficult to tell with a quick      goodlooking face and a line between his brows his darkish      hair is flecked with grey  he gives the feeling that he has      always had to spurt to keep pace with his own life  mrs hope  also entering the hollow tree  nooh  colonel  from the depths in a high voice  well dash it then what do you want  mrs gwyn  peachey may i introduce mr lever to you  miss

pleased she watches  mrs gwyn  pointing to the treemaliciously  this is my uncle and my aunt  theyre taking exercise i think       the colonel and mrs hope emerge convulsively  they are very      hot  lever and mrs gwyn are very cool  mrs  hope  shaking hands with him  so you ve got here  are nt you very hottom  colonel  brought a splendid day with you  splendid       as he speaks joy comes running with a bunch of roses seeing      lever she stops and stands quite rigid  miss beech  sitting in the swing  thunder  colonel  thunder  nonsense peachey youre always imagining something  look at the sky  miss beech  thunder       mrs gwyns smile has faded   mrs hope  turning  joy dont you see mr lever       joy turning to her mother gives her the roses  with a forced      smile lever advances

fixed on her daughter  miss beech is watching them      intently  mrs hope is buttoning the colonels coat                            the curtain falls      act ii       it is afternoon and at a gardentable placed beneath the hollow      tree the colonel is poring over plans  astride of a      gardenchair lever is smoking cigarettes  dick is hanging      chinese lanterns to the hollow tree  lever  of course if this level pointing with his cigarette peters out to the west we shall be in a tightish place you know what a mine is at this stage colonel hope  colonel  absently  yes yes  tracing a line  what is there to prevent its running out here to the east  lever  well nothing except that as a matter of fact it doesnt  colonel  with some excitement  im very glad you showed me these papers very glad  i say that its a most astonishing thing if the ore suddenly stops there  a gleam of humour visits levers face im not an expert but you ought to prove that ground to the east more thoroughly  lever  quizzically  of course sir if you advise that  colonel  if it were mine id no more sit down under the belief that the ore stopped there than i dtheres a harmony in these things  never  i can only tell you what our experts say  colonel  ah  experts  no faith in themnever had  miners lawyers theologians cowardly lotpays them to be cowardly  when they have nt their own axes to grind theyve got their theories a theorys a dangerous thing  he loses himself in contemplation of the papers  now my theory is you re in strata here of what we call the triassic age  lever  smiling faintly  ah  colonel  youve struck a fault thats whats happened  the ore may be as much as thirty or forty yards out but it s there depend on it  lever  would you back that opinion sir  colonel  with dignity  i never give an opinion that im not prepared to back  i want to get to the bottom of this  whats to prevent the gold going down indefinitely  lever  nothing so far as i know  colonel  with suspicion  eh  lever  all i can tell you is this is as far as weve got and we want more money before we can get any farther  colonel  absently  yes yes thats very usual  lever  if you ask my personal opinion i think its very doubtful that the gold does go down  colonel  smiling  oh  a personal opinion a matter of this sort  lever  as though about to take the papers  perhaps wed better close the sitting sir sorry to have bored you  colonel  now now  dont be so touchy  if im to put money in im bound to look at it all round  lever  with lifted brows  please dont imagine that i want you to put money in  colonel  confound it sir  d you suppose i take you for a company promoter  lever  thank you  colonel  looking at him doubtfully  youve got irish blood in youum  youre so hasty  lever  if you re really thinking of taking sharesmy advice to you is dont  colonel  regretfully  if this were an ordinary gold mine i wouldnt dream of looking at it i want you to understand that nobody has a greater objection to gold mines than i  lever  looks down at his host with halfclosed eyes  but it is a gold mine colonel hope  colonel  i know i know but i ve been into it for myself ive formed my opinion personally  now what s the reason you dont want me to invest  lever  well if it doesnt turn out as you expect youll say its my doing  i know what investors are  colonel  dubiously  if it were a westralian or a kaffir i would nt touch it with a pair of tongs  it s not as if i were going to put much in  he suddenly bends above the papers as though magnetically attracted i like these triassic formations       dick who has hung the last lantern moodily departs  lever  looking after him  that young man seems depressed  colonel  as though remembering his principles  i dont like mines never have  suddenly absorbed again  i tell you what leverthis things got tremendous possibilities  you dont seem to believe in it enough  no mines any good without faith until i see for myself however i shant commit myself beyond a thousand  lever  are you serious sir  colonel  certainly  ive been thinking it over ever since you told me henty had fought shy  i ve a poor opinion of henty  hes one of those fellows that says one thing and does another  an opportunist  lever  slowly  im afraid were all that more or less  he sits beneath the hollow tree  colonel  a man never knows what he is himself  there s my wife she thinks she sby the way dont say anything to her about this please  and lever nervously i dont think you know this is quite the sort of thing for my niece  lever  quietly  i agree  i mean to get her out of it  colonel  a little taken aback  ah  you know sheshes in a very delicate position living by herself in london  lever looks at him ironically  you  very nervously  see a good deal of her  if it had nt been for joy growing so fast we shouldnt have had the child down here  her mother ought to have her with her  eh  dont you think so  lever  forcing a smile  mrs gwyn always seems to me to get on all right  colonel  as though making a discovery  you know ive found that when a womans living alone and unprotected the very least thing will set a lot of hags and jackanapes talking  hotly  the more unprotected and helpless a woman is the more they revel in it  if theres anything i hate in this world its those wretched creatures who babble about their neighbours affairs  lever  i agree with you  colonel  one ought to be very careful not to give themthat is checks himself confused then hurrying oni suppose you and joy get on all right  lever  coolly  pretty well thanks  im not exactly in joys line have nt seen very much of her in fact       miss beech and joy have been approaching from the house  but      seeing lever joy turns abruptly hesitates a moment and with      an angry gesture goes away  colonel unconscious  wonderfully affectionate little thing  well shell be going home tomorrow  miss beech  who has been gazing after joy  talkin business poor creatures  lever  oh no  if youll excuse me ill wash my hands before tea       he glances at the colonel poring over papers and shrugging      his shoulders strolls away  miss beech  sitting in the swing  i see

colonel  who told you that rubbish  miss beech with devilry  you did  colonel  this is nt an ordinary gold mine  miss beech  oh quite a special thing       colonel stares at her but subsiding at hey impassivity he      pores again over the papers       rosy has approached with a tea cloth  rose  if you please sir the missis told me to lay the tea  colonel  go away  ten fives fifty  ten 5 16ths

to put molly into a thing like that  colonel  what do you mean sir  ernest  any juggins can see that shes a bit gone on our friend  colonel  freezingly  indeed  ernest  hes not at all the sort of johnny that appeals to me  colonel  really  ernest  unmoved  if i were you colonel i should tip her the wink  he was hanging about her at ascot all the time  it s a bit thick       mrs hope followed by rose appears from the house  colonel  stammering with passion  jackanapes  mrs hope  dont stand there tom clear those papers and let rose lay the table  now ernest go and get another chair       the colonel looks wildly round and sits beneath the hollow      tree with his head held in his hands  rose lays the cloth  mrs beech  sitting beside the colonel  poor creature  ernest  carrying his

necessity for colonel hope to take any shares and it looks to me as if hed better not       he lights a cigarette  mrs hope  now mr lever dont be offended  im very anxious for tom to take the shares

a waltz sounds from the house  lever  for gods sake dont mollyi dont believe in going to meet trouble  mrs gwyn  its staring me in the face  lever  let the future take care of itself       mrs gwyn

bottle of champagne wipes it and carries it away but seeing mrs gwyns scarf lying across the chair she fingers it and stops listening to the waltz suddenly draping it round her shoulders she seizes the bottle of champagne and waltzes with abandon to the music as though avenging a long starvation of her instincts  thus dancing she is surprised by dick who has come to smoke a cigarette and think at the spot where he was told to have a go  rose startled stops and hugs the bottle  dick  its not claret rose i should nt warm it       rose taking off the scarf replaces it on the chair then with      the halfwarmed bottle she retreats  dick in the swing sits      thinking of his fate  suddenly from behind the hollow tree he      sees joy darting forward in her day dress with her hair about      her neck and her skirt all torn  as he springs towards her      she turns at bay  dick  joy  joy  i want uncle tom  dick  in consternation  but ought you to have got upi thought you were ill in bed

awfully important but a man understands these things       joy looks at him  seeing the impression he has made he tries      again  i mean he understands better than a woman  ive often argued about moral questions with men up at oxford  joy  catching at a straw  but theres nothing to argue about  dick  hastily  of course i believe in morals       they stare solemnly at each other  some men dont  but i cant help seeing marriage is awfully important  joy  solemnly  its sacred  dick  yes i know but there must be exceptions joy  joy  losing herself a little in the stress of this discussion how can there be exceptions if a thing s sacred  dick  earnestly  all rules have exceptions thats true you know its a proverb  joy  it cant be true about marriagehow can it when  dick  with intense earnestness  but look here joy i know a really clever manan author  he says that if marriage is a failure people ought to be perfectly free it isnt everybody who believes that marriage is everything  of course i believe it s sacred but if its a failure i do think it seems awfuldont you  joy  i dont knowyesifsuddenly  but its my own mother  dick  gravely  i know of course  i cant expect you to see it in your own case like this  with desperation  but look here joy thisll show you  if a person loves a person they have to decide have nt they  well then you see that s what your mothers done  joy  but that does nt show me anything  dick  but it does  the thing is to look at it as if it was nt yourself  if it had been you and me in love joy and it was wrong like them of course ruefully  i know youd have decided right fiercely  but i swear i should have decided wrong triumphantly  that s why i feel i understand your mother  joy  brushing her sleeve across her eyes  oh dick you are so

their feetthe waltz sounds louder  youre missing it all  i cant bear you to miss the dancing  it seems so queer  couldnt we  just a little turn  joy  no no  dick  oh  try       he takes her gently by the waist she shrinks back  joy  brokenly  nono  oh  dicktomorrow ll be so awful  dick  tomorrow shant hurt you joy nothing shall ever hurt you again       she looks at him and her face changes suddenly she buries it      against his shoulder  they stand so just a moment in the moon light then turning to the river move slowly out of sight  again the hollow tree is left alone the music of the waltz has stopped  the voices of miss beech and the colonel are heard approaching from the house  they appear in the opening of the wall  the colonel carries a pair of field glasses with which to look at the moon  colonel  charming to see molly dance with lever their steps go so well together  i can always tell when a womans enjoying herself peachey  miss beech  sharply  can you  youre very clever  colonel  wonderful that moon  im going to have a look at her splendid glasses these peachy he screws them out not a better pair in england  i remember in burmah with these glasses i used to be able to tell a man from a woman at two miles and a quarter  and thats no joke i can tell you  but on his way to the moon he has taken a survey of the earth to the right along the river  in a low but excited voice  i say i sayis it one of the maidsthe baggage  why  its dick  by george shes got her hair down peachey  its joy       miss beech goes to look  he makes as though to hand the      glasses to her but puts them to his own eyes instead      excitedly  it is  what about her headache  by george theyre kissing  i say peachey  i shall have to tell nell  miss beech  are you sure theyre kissing  well thats some comfort  colonel  theyre at the stile now  oughtnt i to stop them eh he stands on tiptoe  we must nt spy on them dash it all  he drops the glasses theyre out of sight now  miss beech  to herself  he said he wouldnt let her  colonel  what  have you been encouraging them  miss beech  dont be in such a hurry       she moves towards the hollow tree  colonel  abstractedly  by george peachey to think that nell and i were oncepoor nell  i remember just such a night as this       he stops and stares before him sighing  miss beech impressively  its a comfort shes got that good young man  shes found out that her mother and this mr lever areyou know  colonel  losing all traces of his fussiness and drawing himself up as though he were on parade  you tell me that my niece  miss beech  out of her own mouth  colonel  bowing his head  i never would have believed shed have forgotten herself  miss beech  very solemnly  ah my dear  were all the same were all as hollow as that tree  when its ourselves its always a special case       the colonel makes a movement of distress and miss beech goes      to him  dont you take it so to heart my dear       a silence  colonel  shaking his head  i couldnt have believed molly would forget that child  miss beech  sadly  they must go their own ways poor things  she cant put herself in the childs place and the child cant put herself in mollys  a woman and a girltheres the tree of life between them  colonel  staring into the tree to see indeed if that were the tree alluded to  its a grief to me peachey its a grief  he sinks into a chair stroking his long moustaches  then to avenge his hurt  shant tell nelldashed if i do anything to make the trouble worse  miss beech  nodding  theres suffering enough without adding to it with our trumpery judgments  if only things would last between them  colonel  fiercely  last  by george theyd better       he stops and looking up with a queer sorry look  i say peachey lifes very funny  miss beech  men and women are  touching his forehead tenderly there theretake care of your poor dear head  tsst  the blessed innocents       she pulls the colonels sleeve  they slip away towards the      house as joy and dick come back  they are still linked      together and stop by the hollow tree  joy  in a whisper  dick is love always like this  dick  putting his arms around her with conviction its never been like this before  its you and me       he kisses her on the lips                                  the curtain falls       strife  a drama in three acts     persons of the play  john

of noon and six in the afternoon close to the trenartha tin plate works on the borders of england and wales where a strike has been in progress throughout the winter      act i        it is noon  in the underwoods diningroom a bright fire is      burning  on one side of the fireplace are doubledoors leading      to the drawingroom on the other side a door leading to the      hall  in the centre of the room a long diningtable without a      cloth is set out as a board table  at the head of it in the      chairmans seat sits john anthony an old man big      cleanshaven and highcoloured with thick white hair and thick      dark eyebrows  his movements are rather slow and feeble but his      eyes are very much alive  there is a glass of water by his side      on his right sits his son edgar an earnestlooking man of thirty      reading a newspaper  next him wanklin a man with jutting      eyebrows and silverstreaked light hair is bending over transfer      papers  tench the secretary a short and rather humble nervous      man with side whiskers stands helping him  on wanklins right      sits underwood the manager a quiet man with along stiff jaw      and steady eyes  back to the fire is scantlebury a very large      pale sleepy man with grey hair rather bald  between him and      the chairman are two empty chairs  wilder  who is lean cadaverous and complaining with drooping grey moustaches stands before the fire  i say this fires the devil  can i have a screen tench  scantlebury  a screen ah  tench  certainly mr wilder  he looks at underwood  that is perhaps the managerperhaps mr underwood  scantlebury  these fireplaces of yours underwood  underwood  roused from studying some papers  a screen  rather im sorry  he goes to the door with a little smile  were not accustomed to complaints of too much fire down here just now       he speaks as though he holds a pipe between his teeth slowly      ironically  wilder  in an injured voice  you mean the men  hm       underwood goes out  scantlebury  poor devils  wilder  its their own fault scantlebury  edgar  holding out his paper  theres great distress among them according to the trenartha news  wilder  oh that rag  give it to wanklin  suit his radical views they call us monsters i suppose  the editor of that rubbish ought to be shot  edgar  reading  if the board of worthy gentlemen who control the trenartha tin plate works from their armchairs in london would condescend to come and see for themselves the conditions prevailing amongst their workpeople during this strike  wilder  well we have come  edgar  continuing  we cannot believe that even their legofmutton hearts would remain untouched       wanklin takes the paper from him  wilder  ruffian  i remember that fellow when he had nt a penny to his name little snivel of a chap thats made his way by blackguarding everybody who takes a different view to himself       anthony says something that is not heard  wilder  what does your father say  edgar  he says the kettle and the pot  wilder  hm       he sits down next to scantlebury  scantlebury  blowing out his cheeks  i shall boil if i dont get that screen       underwood and enid enter with a screen which they place before      the fire  enid is tall she has a small decided face and is      twentyeight years old  enid  put it closer frank  will that do mr wilder  its the highest weve got  wilder  thanks capitally  scantlebury  turning with a sigh of pleasure  ah  merci madame  enid  is there anything else you want father  anthony shakes his head  edgaranything  edgar  you might give me a j nib old girl  enid  there are some down there by mr scantlebury  scantlebury  handing a little box of nibs  ah  your brother uses js  what does the manager use  with expansive politeness what does your husband use mrs underwood  underwood  a quill  scantlebury  the homely product of the goose  he holds out quills  underwood  drily  thanks if you can spare me one  he takes a quill  what about lunch enid  enid  stopping at the doubledoors and looking back  were going to have lunch here in the drawingroom so you need nt hurry with your meeting       wanklin and wilder bow and she goes out  scantlebury  rousing himself suddenly  ah  lunch  that hotel dreadful  did you try the whitebait last night  fried fat  wilder  past twelve  are nt you going to read the minutes tench  tench  looking for the chairmans assent reads in a rapid and monotonous voice  at a board meeting held the 31st of january at the companys offices 512 cannon street ec  presentmr anthony in the chair messrs  f h wilder william scantlebury oliver wanklin and edgar anthony  read letters from the manager dated january 20th 23d 25th 28th relative to the strike at the companys

manager for the purpose of discussing the situation with mr simon harness and the mens committee on the spot passed twelve transfers signed and sealed nine certificates and one balance certificate  he pushes the book over to the chairman  anthony  with a heavy sigh  if its your pleasure sign the same       he signs moving the pen with difficulty   wanklin  whats the unions game tench  they have nt made up their split with the men  what does harness want this interview for  tench  hoping we shall come to a compromise i think sir hes having a meeting with the men this afternoon  wilder  harness  ah  hes one of those coldblooded coolheaded chaps  i distrust them  i dont know that we didnt make a mistake to come down  what timell the men be here  underwood  any time now  wilder  well if were not ready theyll have to waitwont do them any harm to cool their heels a bit  scantlebury slowly  poor devils  its snowing  what weather  underwood  with meaning slowness  this housell be the warmest place theyve been in this winter  wilder  well i hope were going to settle this business in time for me to catch the 630  ive got to take my wife to spain tomorrow chattily  my old father had a strike at his works in 69 just such a february as this  they wanted to shoot him  wanklin  what  in the close season  wilder  by george there was no close season for employers then  he used to go down to his office with a pistol in his pocket  scantlebury  faintly alarmed  not seriously  wilder  with finality  ended in his shootin one of em in the legs  scantlebury  unavoidably feeling his thigh  no  which  anthony  lifting the agenda paper  to consider the policy of the board in relation to the strike  there is a silence  wilder  its this infernal threecornered duelthe union the men and ourselves  wanklin  we need nt consider the union  wilder  its my experience that youve always got to consider the union confound them  if the union were going to withdraw their support from the men as theyve done why did they ever allow them to strike at all  edgar  weve had that over a dozen times  wilder  well ive never understood it  its beyond me  they talk of the engineers and furnacemens demands being excessiveso they arebut thats not enough to make the union withdraw their support whats behind it  underwood  fear of strikes at harpers and tinewells  wilder  with triumph  afraid of other strikesnow thats a reason  why could nt we have been told that before  underwood  you were  tench  you were absent from the board that day sir  scantlebury  the men must have seen they had no chance when the union gave them up  its madness  underwood  its roberts  wilder  just our luck the men finding a fanatical firebrand like roberts for leader  a pause  wanklin  looking at anthony  well  wilder  breaking in fussily  its a regular mess  i dont like the position were in i dont like it ive said so for a long time looking at wanklin  when wanklin and i came down here before christmas it looked as if the men must collapse  you thought so too underwood  underwood  yes  wilder  well they havent  here we are going from bad to worse losing our customersshares going down  scantlebury  shaking his head  mm  mm  wanklin  what loss have we made by this strike tench  tench  over fifty thousand sir  scantlebury pained  you dont say  wilder  we shall never got it back  tench  no sir  wilder  whod have supposed the men were going to stick out like thisnobody suggested that looking angrily at tench  scantlebury  shaking his head  ive never liked a fightnever shall  anthony  no surrender  all look at him  wilder  who wants to surrender  anthony looks at him  ii want to act reasonably  when the men sent roberts up to the board in decemberthen was the time  we ought to have humoured him instead of that the chairmandropping his eyes before anthonyserwe snapped his head off  we could have got them in then by a little tact  anthony  no compromise  wilder  there we are  this strikes been going on now since october and as far as i can see it may last another six months pretty mess we shall be in by then  the only comfort is the menll be in a worse  edgar  to underwood  what sort of state are they really in frank  underwood  without expression  damnable  wilder  well who on earth would have thought theyd have held on like this without support  underwood  those who know them  wilder  i defy any one to know them  and what about tin  price going up daily  when we do get started we shall have to work off our contracts at the top of the market  wanklin  what do you say to that chairman  anthony  cant be helped  wilder  shant pay a dividend till goodness knows when  scantlebury  with emphasis  we ought to think of the shareholders  turning heavily  chairman i say we ought to think of the shareholders  anthony mutters  scantlebury  whats that  tench  the chairman says he is thinking of you sir  scantlebury  sinking back into torpor  cynic  wilder  its past a joke  i dont want to go without a dividend for years if the chairman does  we cant go on playing ducks and drakes with the companys prosperity  edgar  rather ashamedly  i think we ought to consider the men       all but anthony fidget in their seats  scantlebury  with a sigh  we must nt think of our private feelings young man  thatll never do  edgar  ironically  im not thinking of our feelings  im thinking of the mens  wilder  as to thatwere men of business  wanklin  that is the little trouble  edgar  theres no necessity for pushing things so far in the face of all this sufferingitsits cruel       no one speaks as though edgar had uncovered something whose      existence no man prizing his selfrespect could afford to      recognise  wanklin  with an ironical smile  im afraid we must nt base our policy on luxuries like sentiment  edgar  i detest this state of things  anthony  we did nt seek the quarrel  edgar  i know that sir but surely weve gone far enough  anthony  no all look at one another  wanklin  luxuries apart chairman we must look out what were doing  anthony  give way to the men once and therell be no end to it  wanklin  i quite agree but       anthony shakes his head  you make it a question of bedrock principle       anthony nods  luxuries again chairman  the shares are below par  wilder  yes and theyll drop to a half when we pass the next dividend  scantlebury  with alarm  come come  not so bad as that  wilder  grimly  youll see  craning forward to catch anthonys speech  i didnt catch  tench  hesitating  the chairman says sir fais quequedevra  edgar  sharply  my father says do what we oughtand let things rip  wilder  tcha  scantlebury  throwing up his hands  the chairmans a stoici always said the chairman was a stoic  wilder  much good thatll do us  wanklin  suavely  seriously chairman are you going to let the ship sink under you for the sake ofa principle  anthony  she wont sink  scantlebury  with alarm  not while im on the board i hope  anthony  with a twinkle  better rat scantlebury  scantlebury  what a man  anthony  ive always fought them ive never been beaten yet  wanklin  were with you in theory chairman  but were not all made of castiron  anthony  weve only to hold on  wilder  rising and going to the fire  and go to the devil as fast as we can  anthony  better go to the devil than give in  wilder  fretfully  that may suit you sir but it does nt suit me or any one else i should think       anthony looks him in the facea silence  edgar  i dont see how we can get over it that to go on like this means starvation to the mens wives and families       wilder turns abruptly to the fire and scantlebury puts out a      hand to push the idea away  wanklin  im afraid again that sounds a little sentimental  edgar  men of business are excused from decency you think  wilder  nobodys more sorry for the men than i am but if they lashing himself  choose to be such a pigheaded lot its nothing to do with us weve quite enough on our hands to think of ourselves and the shareholders  edgar  irritably  it wont kill the shareholders to miss a dividend or two i dont see that thats reason enough for knuckling under  scantlebury  with grave discomfort  you talk very lightly of your dividends young man i dont know where we are  wilder  theres only one sound way of looking at it  we cant go on ruining ourselves with this strike  anthony  no caving in  scantlebury  with a gesture of despair  look at him       anthonys leaning back in his chair  they do look at him  wilder  returning to his seat  well all i can say is if thats the chairmans view i dont know what weve come down here for  anthony  to tell the men that weve got nothing for them grimly  they wont believe it till they hear it spoken in plain english  wilder  hm  shouldnt be a bit surprised if that brute roberts had nt got us down here with the very same idea  i hate a man with a grievance  edgar  resentfully  we didnt pay him enough for his discovery i always said that at the time  wilder  we paid him five hundred and a bonus of two hundred three years later  if thats not enough  what does he want for goodness sake  tench complainingly  company made a hundred thousand out of his brains and paid him seven hundredthats the way he goes on sir  wilder  the mans a rank agitator  look here i hate the unions but now weve got harness here lets get him to settle the whole thing  anthony  no again they look at him  underwood  roberts wont let the men assent to that  scantlebury  fanatic  fanatic  wilder  looking at anthony  and not the only one  frost enters from the hall  frost  to anthony  mr harness from the union waiting sir  the men are here too sir       anthony nods  underwood goes to the door returning with      harness a pale cleanshaven man with hollow cheeks quick      eyes and lantern jawfrost has retired  underwood  pointing to tenchs chair  sit there next the chairman harness wont you       at harnesss appearance the board have drawn together as it      were and turned a little to him like cattle at a dog  harness  with a sharp look round and a bow  thanks  he sits his accent is slightly nasal  well gentlemen were going to do business at last i hope  wilder  depends on what you call business harness  why dont you make the men come in  harness  sardonically  the men are far more in the right than you are  the question with us is whether we shant begin to support them again       he ignores them all except anthony to whom he turns in      speaking  anthony  support them if you like well put in free labour and have done with it  harness  that wont do mr anthony  you cant get free labour and you know it  anthony  we shall see that  harness  im quite frank with you  we were forced to withhold our support from your men because some of their demands are in excess of current rates  i expect to make them withdraw those demands today if they do take it straight from me gentlemen we shall back them again at once  now i want to see something fixed upon before i go back tonight  cant we have done with this oldfashioned tugofwar business  what goods it doing you  why dont you recognise once for all that these people are men like yourselves and want whats good for them just as you want whats good for you bitterly  your motorcars and champagne and eightcourse dinners  anthony  if the men will come in well do something for them  harness  ironically  is that your opinion too sirand yours and yours  the directors do not answer  well all i can say is its a kind of high and mighty aristocratic tone i thought wed grown out ofseems i was mistaken  anthony  its the tone the men use  remains to be seen which can hold out longestthey without us or we without them  harness  as business men i wonder youre not ashamed of this waste of force gentlemen  you know what itll all end in  anthony  what  harness  compromiseit always does  scantlebury  cant you persuade the men that their interests are the same as ours  harness turning ironically  i could persuade them of that sir if they were  wilder  come harness youre a clever man you dont believe all the socialistic claptrap thats talked nowadays  there s no real difference between their interests and ours  harness  theres just one very simple question id like to put to you  will you pay your men one penny more than they force you to pay them       wilder is silent  wanklin  chiming in  i humbly thought that not to pay more than was necessary was the a b c of commerce  harness  with irony  yes that seems to be the a b c of commerce sir and the a b c of commerce is between your interests and the mens  scantlebury  whispering  we ought to arrange something  harness  drily  am i to understand then gentlemen that your board is going to make no concessions       wanklin and wilder bend forward as if to speak but stop  anthony  nodding  none       wanklin and wilder again bend forward and scantlebury gives an      unexpected grunt  harness  you were about to say something i believe       but scantlebury says nothing  edgar  looking up suddenly  were sorry for the state of the men  harness  icily  the men have no use for your pity sir  what they want is justice  anthony  then let them be just  harness  for that word just read humble mr anthony  why should they be humble  barring the accident of money are nt they as good men as you  anthony  cant  harness  well ive been five years in america  it colours a mans notions  scantlebury  suddenly as though avenging his uncompleted grunt lets have the men in and hear what theyve got to say       anthony nods and underwood goes out by the single door  harness  drily  as im to have an interview with them this afternoon gentlemen i ll ask you to postpone your final decision till thats over       again anthony nods and taking up his glass drinks       underwood comes in again followed by roberts green bulgin      thomas rous  they file in hat in hand and stand silent in a      row  roberts is lean of middle height with a slight stoop      he has a little ratgnawn browngrey beard moustaches high      cheekbones hollow cheeks small fiery eyes  he wears an old      and greasestained blue serge suit and carries an old bowler      hat  he stands nearest the chairman  green next to him has a      clean worn face with a small grey goatee beard and drooping      moustaches iron spectacles and mild straightforward eyes  he      wears an overcoat green with age and a linen collar  next to      him is bulgin a tall strong man with a dark moustache and      fighting jaw wearing a red muffler who keeps changing his cap      from one hand to the other  next to him is thomas an old man      with a grey moustache full beard and weatherbeaten bony face      whose overcoat discloses a lean pluckedlooking neck  on his      right rous the youngest of the five looks like a soldier he      has a glitter in his eyes  underwood  pointing  there are some chairs there against the wall roberts wont you draw them up and sit down  roberts  thank you mr underwoodwell stand in the presence of the board  he speaks in a biting and staccato voice rolling his rs pronouncing his as like an italian a and his consonants short and crisp  how are you mr harness  did nt expect t have the pleasure of seeing you till this afternoon  harness  steadily  we shall meet again then roberts  roberts  glad to hear that we shall have some news for you to take to your people  anthony  what do the men want  roberts  acidly  beg pardon i dont quite catch the chairmans remark  tench  from behind the chairmans chair  the chairman wishes to know what the men have to say  roberts  its what the board has to say weve come to hear  its for the board to speak first  anthony  the board has nothing to say  roberts  looking along the line of men  in that case were wasting the directors time  well be taking our feet off this pretty carpet       he turns the men move slowly as though hypnotically      influenced  wanklin suavely  come roberts you did nt give us this long cold journey for the pleasure of saying that  thomas  a pure welshman  no sir an what i say iss  robertsbitingly  go on henry thomas go on  you re better able to speak to thedirectors than me  thomas is silent  tench  the chairman means roberts that it was the men who asked for the conference the board wish to hear what they have to say  roberts  gad  if i was to begin to tell ye all they have to say i wouldnt be finished today  and thered be some thatd wish theyd never left their london palaces  harness  whats your proposition man  be reasonable  roberts  you want reason mr harness  take a look round this afternoon before the meeting  he looks at the men no sound escapes them  youll see some very pretty scenery  harness  all right my friend you wont put me off  roberts  to the men  we shant put mr harness off  have some champagne with your lunch mr harness youll want it sir  harness  come get to business man  thomas  what were asking look you is just simple justice  roberts  venomously  justice from london  what are you talking about henry thomas  have you gone silly  thomas is silent  we know very well what we arediscontented dogsnever satisfied  what did the chairman tell me up in london  that i did nt know what i was talking about  i was a foolish uneducated man that knew nothing of the wants of the men i spoke for  edgar  do please keep to the point  anthony  holding up his hand  there can only be one master roberts  roberts  then be gad itll be us       there is a silence anthony and roberts stare at one another  underwood  if youve nothing to say to the directors roberts perhaps you ll let green or thomas speak for the men       green and thomas look anxiously at roberts at each other and      the other men  green  an englishman  if id been listened to gentlemen  thomas  what ife got to say iss what wefe all got to say  roberts  speak for yourself henry thomas  scantlebury  with a gesture of deep spiritual discomfort  let the poor men call their souls their own  roberts  aye they shall keep their souls for its not much body that youve left them mr with biting emphasis as though the word were an offence  scantlebury  to the men  well will you speak or shall i speak for you  rous  suddenly  speak out roberts or leave it to others  roberts  ironically  thank you george rous  addressing himself to anthony  the chairman and board of directors have honoured us by leaving london and coming all this way to hear what weve got to say it would not be polite to keep them any longer waiting  wilder  well thank god for that  roberts  ye will not dare to thank him when i have done mr wilder for all your piety  may be your god up in london has no time to listen to the working man  im told he is a wealthy god but if he listens to what i tell him he will know more than ever he learned in kensington  harness  come roberts you have your own god  respect the god of other men  roberts  thats right sir  we have another god down here i doubt he is rather different to mr wilders  ask henry thomas he will tell you whether his god and mr wilders are the same       thomas lifts his hand and cranes his head as though to      prophesy  wanklin  for goodness sake let s keep to the point roberts  roberts  i rather think it is the point mr wanklin  if you can get the god of capital to walk through the streets of labour and pay attention to what he sees youre a brighter man than i take you for for all that youre a radical  anthony  attend to me roberts  roberts is silent  you are here to speak for the men as i am here to speak for the board       he looks slowly round       wilder wanklin and scantlebury make movements of uneasiness      and edgar gazes at the floor  a faint smile comes on harnesss      face  now then what is it  roberts  right sir       throughout all that follows he and anthony look fixedly upon      each other  men and directors show in their various ways      suppressed uneasiness as though listening to words that they      themselves would not have spoken  the men cant afford to travel up to london and they dont trust you to believe what they say in black and white  they know what the post is he darts a look at underwood and tench and what directors meetings are refer it to the managerlet the manager advise us on the mens condition  can we squeeze them a little more  underwood  in a low voice  dont hit below the belt roberts  roberts  is it below the belt mr underwood  the men know  when i came up to london i told you the position straight  an what came of it  i was told i did nt know what i was talkin about  i cant afford to travel up to london to be told that again  anthony  what have you to say for the men  roberts  i have this to sayand first as to their condition  ye shall ave no need to go and ask your manager  ye cant squeeze them any more  every man of us is wellnigh starving  a surprised murmur rises from the men  roberts looks round  ye wonder why i tell ye that  every man of us is going short  we cant be no worse off than weve been these weeks past  ye need nt think that by waiting yell drive us to come in  well die first the whole lot of us  the men have sent for ye to know once and for all whether ye are going to grant them their demands  i see the sheet of paper in the secretarys hand  tench moves nervously  thats it i think mr tench  its not very large  tench  nodding  yes  roberts  theres not one sentence of writing on that paper that we can do without       a movement amongst the men  roberts turns on them sharply  isnt that so       the men assent reluctantly  anthony takes from tench the paper      and peruses it  not one single sentence  all those demands are fair  we have not asked anything that we are not entitled to ask  what i said up in london i say again now there is not anything on that piece of paper that a just man should not ask and a just man give       a pause  anthony  there is not one single demand on this paper that we will grant       in the stir that follows on these words roberts watches the      directors and anthony the men  wilder gets up abruptly and goes      over to the fire  roberts  d ye mean that  anthony  i do       wilder at the fire makes an emphatic movement of disgust  roberts  noting it with dry intensity  ye best know whether the condition of the company is any better than the condition of the men scanning the directors faces  ye best know whether ye can afford your tyrannybut this i tell ye if ye think the men will give way the least part of an inch yere making the worst mistake ye ever made  he fixes his eyes on scantlebury  ye think because the union is not supporting usmore shame to itthat well be coming on our knees to you one fine morning  ye think because the men have got their wives an families to think ofthat its just a question of a week or two  anthony  it would be better if you did not speculate so much on what we think  roberts  aye  its not much profit to us  i will say this for you mr anthonyye know your own mind  staying at anthony  i can reckon on ye  anthony  ironically  i am obliged to you  roberts  and i know mine  i tell ye this the men will send their wives and families where the country will have to keep them an they will starve sooner than give way  i advise ye mr anthony to prepare yourself for the worst that can happen to your company  we are not so ignorant as you might suppose  we know the way the cat is jumping  your position is not all that it might benot exactly  anthony  be good enough to allow us to judge of our position for ourselves  go back and reconsider your own  roberts  stepping forward  mr anthony you are not a young man now from the time i remember anything ye have been an enemy to every man that has come into your works  i dont say that yere a mean man or a cruel man but yeve grudged them the say of any word in their own fate  yeve fought them down four times  ive heard ye say ye love a fightmark my wordsyere fighting the last fight yell ever fight       tench touches robertss sleeve  underwood  roberts  roberts  roberts  roberts  roberts  i must nt speak my mind to the chairman but the chairman may speak his mind to me  wilder  what are things coming to  anthony with a grim smile at wilder  go on roberts say what you like  roberts  after a pause  i have no more to say  anthony  the meeting stands adjourned to five oclock  wanklin  in a low voice to underwood  we shall never settle anything like this  roberts  bitingly  we thank the chairman and board of directors for their gracious hearing       he moves towards the door the men cluster together stupefied      then rous throwing up his head passes roberts and goes out      the others follow  roberts  with his hand on the doormaliciously  good day gentlemen  he goes out  harness  ironically  i congratulate you on the conciliatory spirit thats been displayed  with your permission gentlemen ill be with you again at halfpast five  good morning       he bows slightly rests his eyes on anthony who returns his      stare unmoved and followed by underwood goes out  there is a      moment of uneasy silence  underwood reappears in the doorway  wilder  with emphatic disgust  well       the doubledoors are opened  enid  standing in the doorway  lunch is ready       edgar getting up abruptly walks out past his sister  wilder  coming to lunch scantlebury  scantlebury  rising heavily  i suppose so i suppose so  its the only thing we can do       they go out through the doubledoors  wanklin  in a low voice  do you really mean to fight to a finish chairman       anthony nods  wanklin  take care  the essence of things is to know when to stop       anthony does not answer  wanklin  very gravely  this way disaster lies  the ancient trojans were fools to your father mrs underwood  he goes out through the doubledoors  enid  i want to speak to father frank       underwood follows wanklin out  tench passing round the table      is restoring order to the scattered pens and papers  enid  are nt you coming dad       anthony shakes his head  enid looks meaningly at tench  enid  wont you go and have some lunch mr tench  tench  with papers in his hand  thank you maam thank you  he goes slowly looking back  enid  shutting the doors  i do hope its settled father  anthony  no  enid  very disappointed  oh  have nt you done anything       anthony shakes his head  enid  frank says they all want to come to a compromise really except that man roberts  anthony  i dont  enid  its such a horrid position for us  if you were the wife of the manager and lived down here and saw it all  you cant realise dad  anthony  indeed  enid  we see all the distress  you remember my maid annie who married roberts  anthony nods  its so wretched her hearts weak since the strike began she has nt even been getting proper food  i know it for a fact father  anthony  give her what she wants poor woman  enid  roberts wont let her take anything from us  anthony  staring before him  i cant be answerable for the mens obstinacy  enid  theyre all suffering  father  do stop it for my sake  anthony  with a keen look at her  you dont understand my dear  enid  if i were on the board id do something  anthony  what would you do  enid  its because you cant bear to give way  its so  anthony  well  enid  so unnecessary  anthony  what do you know about necessity  read your novels play your music talk your talk but dont try and tell me whats at the bottom of a struggle like this  enid  i live down here and see it  anthony  what d you imagine stands between you and your class and these men that youre so sorry for  enid  coldly  i dont know what you mean father  anthony  in a few years you and your children would be down in the condition theyre in but for those who have the eyes to see things as they are and the backbone to stand up for themselves  enid  you dont know the state the men are in  anthony  i know it well enough  enid  you dont father if you did you would nt  anthony  its you who dont know the simple facts of the position what sort of mercy do you suppose youd get if no one stood between you and the continual demands of labour  this sort of mercy he puts his hand up to his throat and squeezes it  first would go your sentiments my dear then your culture and your comforts would be going all the time  enid  i dont believe in barriers between classes  anthony  youdontbelieveinbarriersbetween the classes  enid  coldly  and i dont know what that has to do with this question  anthony  it will take a generation or two for you to understand  enid  its only you and roberts father and you know it       anthony thrusts out his lower lip  itll ruin the company  anthony  allow me to judge of that  enid  resentfully  i wont stand by and let poor annie roberts suffer like this  and think of the children father  i warn you  anthony  with a grim smile  what do you propose to do  enid  thats my affair       anthony only looks at her  enid  in a changed voice stroking his sleeve  father you know you oughtnt to have this strain on youyou know what dr fisher said  anthony  no old man can afford to listen to old women  enid  but you have done enough even if it really is such a matter of principle with you  anthony  you think so  enid  dont dad  her face works  youyou might think of us  anthony  i am  enid  itll break you down  anthony  slowly  my dear i am not going to funk on that you may rely       reenter tench with papers he glances at them then plucking      up courage  tench  beg pardon madam i think id rather see these papers were disposed of before i get my lunch       enid after an impatient glance at him looks at her father      turns suddenly and goes into the drawingroom  tench  holding the papers and a pen to anthony very nervously would you sign these for me please sir       anthony takes the pen and signs  tench  standing with a sheet of blottingpaper behind edgars chair begins speaking nervously  i owe my position to you sir  anthony  well  tench  im obliged to see everything thats going on sir ii depend upon the company entirely  if anything were to happen to it itd be disastrous for me  anthony nods  and of course my wifes just had another and so it makes me doubly anxious just now and the rates are really terrible down our way  anthony  with grim amusement  not more terrible than they are up mine  tench  no sir  very nervously  i know the company means a great deal to you sir  anthony  it does i founded it  tench  yes sir  if the strike goes on itll be very serious  i think the directors are beginning to realise that sir  anthony  ironically  indeed  tench  i know you hold very strong views sir and its always your habit to look things in the face but i dont think the directors like it sir now theythey see it  anthony  grimly  nor you it seems  tench  with the ghost of a smile  no sir of course ive got my children and my wifes delicate in my position i have to think of these things       anthony nods  it was nt that i was going to say sir if youll excuse me hesitates  anthony  out with it then  tench  i knowfrom my own father sir that when you get on in life you do feel things dreadfully  anthony  almost paternally  come out with it trench  tench  i dont like to say it sir  anthony  stonily  you must  tench  after a pause desperately bolting it out  i think the directors are going to throw you over sir  anthony  sits in silence  ring the bell       tench nervously rings the bell and stands by the fire  tench  excuse me for saying such a thing  i was only thinking of you sir       frost enters from the hall he comes to the foot of the table      and looks at anthony tench coveys his nervousness by arranging      papers  anthony  bring me a whiskey and soda  frost  anything to eat sir       anthony shakes his head  frost goes to the sideboard and      prepares the drink  tench  in a low voice almost supplicating  if you could see your way sir it would be a great relief to my mind it would indeed he looks up at anthony who has not moved  it does make me so very anxious  i havent slept properly for weeks sir and thats a fact       anthony looks in his face then slowly shakes his head  disheartened  no sir  he goes on arranging papers       frost places the whiskey and salver and puts it down by      anthonys right hand  he stands away looking gravely at      anthony  frost  nothing i can get you sir       anthony shakes his head  youre aware sir of what the doctor said sir  anthony  i am       a pause  frost suddenly moves closer to him and speaks in a      low voice  frost  this strike sir puttin all this strain on you  excuse me sir is itis it worth it sir       anthony mutters some words that are inaudible  very good sir       he turns and goes out into the hall  tench makes two attempts      to speak but meeting his chairmans gaze he drops his eyes      and turning dismally he too goes out  anthony is left alone      he grips the glass tilts it and drinks deeply then sets it      down with a deep and rumbling sigh and leans back in his      chair                            the curtain falls      act ii  scene i       it is halfpast three  in

that they do  if the men did nt spend such a lot in drink and betting theyd be quite well off  mrs roberts  they say workin so hard they must have some pleasure  enid  but surely not low pleasure like that  mrs roberts  a little resentfully  roberts never touches a drop and hes never had a bet in his life  enid  oh  but hes not a comi mean hes an engineer a superior man  mrs roberts  yes mm  roberts says theyve no chance of other pleasures  enid  musing  of course i know its hard  mrs roberts  with a spice of malice  and they say gentlefolks just as bad  enid  with a smile  i go as far as most people annie but you know yourself thats nonsense  mrs roberts  with painful effort  a lot o the men never go near the public but even they dont save but very little and that goes if theres illness  enid  but theyve got their clubs have nt they  mrs roberts  the clubs only give up to eighteen shillins a week mm and its not much amongst a family  roberts says workin folk have always lived from hand to mouth  sixpence today is worth more than a shillin tomorrow thats what they say  enid  but thats the spirit of gambling  mrs roberts  with a sort of excitement  roberts says a working mans life is all a gamble from the time e s born to the time e dies       enid leans forward interested  mrs roberts goes on with a      growing excitement that culminates in the personal feeling of      the last words  he says mm that when a working mans baby is born its a tossup from breath to breath whether it ever draws another and so on all is life an when he comes to be old its the workhouse or the grave  he says that without a man is very near and pinches and stints imself and is children to save there cant be neither surplus nor security  thats why he wouldnt have no children she sinks back not though i wanted them  enid  yes yes i know  mrs roberts  no you dont mm  youve got your children and youll never need to trouble for them  enid  gently  you oughtnt to be talking so much annie  then in spite of herself  but roberts was paid a lot of money was nt he for discovering that process  mrs roberts  on the defensive  all robertss savins have gone he s always looked forward to this strike  he says hes no right to a farthing when the others are suffering  t is nt so with all o them  some dont seem to care no more than thatso long as they get their own  enid  i dont see how they can be expected to when they re suffering like this  in a changed voice  but roberts ought to think of you  its all terrible  the kettles boiling  shall i make the tea  she takes the teapot and

 for my wifes sake for everybodys sakefor the sake of mr anthony  enid  why are you so bitter against my father  he has never done anything to you  roberts  has he not  enid  he cant help his views

voice  if i saw mr anthony going to die and i could save him by lifting my hand i would not lift the little finger of it  enid  youyoushe stops again biting her lips  roberts  i would not and thats flat  enid  coldly  you dont mean what you say and you know it  roberts  i mean every word of it  enid  but why  roberts  with a flash  mr anthony stands for tyranny  thats why  enid  nonsense       mrs roberts makes a movement as if to rise but sinks back in      her chair  enid  with an impetuous movement  annie  roberts  please not to touch my wife  enid  recoiling with a sort of horror  i believeyou are mad  roberts  the house of a madman then is not the fit place for a lady  enid  i m not afraid of you  roberts  bowing  i would not expect the daughter of mr anthony to be afraid  mr anthony is not a coward like the rest of them  enid  suddenly  i suppose you think it brave then to go on with the struggle  roberts  does mr anthony think it brave to fight against women and children  mr anthony is a rich man i believe does he think it brave to fight against those who have nt a penny  does he think it brave to set children crying with hunger an women shivering with cold  enid  putting up her hand as though warding off a blow  my father is acting on his principles and you know it  roberts  and so am i  enid  you hate us and you cant bear to be beaten  roberts  neither can mr anthony for all that he may say  enid  at any rate you might have pity on your wife       mrs roberts who has her hand pressed to her heart takes it      away and tries to calm her breathing  roberts  madam i have no more to say       he takes up the loaf  there is a knock at the door and      underwood comes in  he stands looking at them enid turns to      him then seems undecided  underwood  enid  roberts  ironically  ye were not needing to come for your wife mr underwood  we are not rowdies  underwood  i know that roberts  i hope mrs roberts is better       roberts turns away without answering  come enid  enid  i make one more appeal to you mr roberts for the sake of your wife  roberts  with polite malice  if i might advise ye maammake it for the sake of your husband and your father       enid suppressing a retort goes out  underwood opens the door      for her and follows  roberts going to the fire holds out his      hands to the dying glow  roberts  how goes it my girl  feeling better are you       mrs roberts smiles faintly  he brings his overcoat and wraps      it round her  looking at his watch  ten minutes to four  as though inspired ive seen their faces theres

till we have beaten these       he meets her eyes again and again turns his away  excitedly  this is what ive been waiting for all these months  to get the old robbers down and send them home again without a farthins worth o change  i ve seen their faces i tell you in the valley of the shadow of defeat       he goes to the peg and takes down his hat  mrs roberts  following with her eyessoftly

     about are half malicious half yearning  he looks at his watch      again and turns to go  in the doorway he meets jan thomas a      boy of ten in clothes too big for him carrying a penny      whistle  roberts  hallo boy       he goes  jan stops within a yard of mrs roberts and stares      at her without a word  mrs roberts  well jan  jan  father s coming sister madge is coming       he

rous  who has a fierce distracted look  madge  im going to the meeting       madge without moving smiles contemptuously  d ye hear me       they speak in quick low voices  madge  i hear  go and kill

on mrs      robertss face the smile has changed to horrified surprise  she      makes a sudden movement sitting forward pressing her hands      against her breast  then slowly she sinks back slowly her      face loses the look of pain the smile returns  she fixes her      eyes again on jan and moves her lips and finger to the tune                            the curtain falls     scene ii       it is past four  in a grey failing light an open muddy space      is crowded with workmen  beyond divided from it by a      barbedwire fence is the raised towingpath of a canal on which      is moored a barge  in the distance are marshes and snowcovered      hills  the works high wall runs from the canal across the open      space and ivy the angle of this wall is a rude platform of      barrels and boards  on it harness is standing  roberts a      little apart from the crowd leans his back against the wall on      the raised towingpath two bargemen lounge and smoke      indifferently  harness  holding out his hand  well ive spoken to you straight if i speak till tomorrow i cant say more  jago  a dark sallow spanishlooking man with a short thin beard  mister want to ask you  can

fighting face theres always blacklegs its the nature of em  theres always men thatll save their own skins       another savage murmur  there is a movement and old thomas      joining the crowd takes his stand in front  harness  holding up his hand  they cant get them  but that wont help you  now men be reasonable  your demands would have brought on us the burden of a dozen strikes at a time when we were not prepared for them  the unions live by justice not to one but all  any fair man will tell youyou were illadvised  i dont say you go too far for that which youre entitled to but youre going too far for the moment youve dug a pit for yourselves  are you to stay there or are you to climb out  come  lewis  a cleancut welshman with a dark moustache  youve hit it mister  which is it to be

lifting his voice  those who know their right hands from their lefts know that the unions are neither thieves nor traitors i ve said my say  figure it out my lads when you want me you know where i shall be       he jumps down the crowd gives way he passes through them and      goes away  a bargeman looks after him jerking his pipe with a      derisive gesture  the men close up in groups and many looks      are cast at roberts who stands alone against the wall  evans  he wants ye to turn blacklegs thats what he wants  he wants ye to go back on us  sooner than turn blacklegi d starve i

down during his little speech which is ironically      spoken there is a restless discomfort in the crowd  rous      stepping forward jumps on the platform  he has an air of      fierce distraction  sullen murmurs of disapproval from the      crowd  rous  speaking with great excitement  im no blanky orator mates but wot i say is drove from me  what i say is yuman nature can a man set an see is

towards roberts  hell speak to you again mark my words but dont ye listen  the crowd groans  its hell fire thats on that mans tongue  roberts is seen laughing  sim arness is right  what are we without the unionhandful o parched leavesa puff o smoke  im no orator but i say chuck it up  chuck it up  sooner than go on starving the women and the children       the murmurs of acquiescence almost drown the murmurs of      dissent  evans  whats turned you to blacklegging  rous  with a furious look  sim arness knows what hes talking about  give us power to come to terms with london im no orator but i sayhave done wi this black misery       he gives his muter a twist jerks his head back and jumps off      the platform  the crowd applauds and surges forward  amid      cries of thats enough  up union  up harness roberts      quietly ascends the platform  there is a moment of silence  blacksmith  we dont want to hear you  shut it  henry rous  get down       amid such cries they surge towards the platform  evans  fiercely  let im speak  roberts  roberts  bulgin  muttering  hed better look out that i dont crack his skull       roberts faces the crowd probing them with his eyes till they      gradually become silent  he begins speaking  one of the      bargemen rises and stands  roberts  you dont want to hear me then  youll listen to rous and to that old man but not to me  youll listen to sim harness of the union thats treated you so fair maybe youll listen to those men from london  ah  you groan  what for  you love their feet on your necks dont you  then as bulgin elbows his way towards the platform with calm bathos  youd like to break my jaw john bulgin  let me speak then do your smashing if it gives you pleasure  bulgin stands motionless and sullen  am i a liar a coward a traitor  if only i were yed listen to me im sure the murmurings cease and there is now dead silence  is there a man of you here that has less to gain by striking  is there a man of you that had more to lose  is there a man of you that has given up eight hundred pounds since this trouble here began  come now is there  how much has thomas given upten pounds or five or what you listened to him and what had he to say  none can pretend he said that im not a believer in principlewith biting ironybut when nature says no further t es going agenst nature i tell you if a man cannot say to nature budge me from this if ye can with a sort of exaltationhis principles are but his belly  oh but thomas says a man can be pure and honest just and merciful and take off his hat to nature  i tell you natures neither pure nor honest just nor merciful  you chaps that live over the hill an go home dead beat in the dark on a snowy nightdont ye fight your way every inch of it  do ye go lyin down an trustin to the tender mercies of this merciful nature  try it and youll soon know with what yeve got to deal  t es only by thathe strikes a blow with his clenched fistin natures face that a man can be a man give in says thomas go down on your knees throw up your foolish fight an perhaps he said perhaps your enemy will chuck you down a crust  jago  never  evans  curse them  thomas  i nefer said that  roberts  bitingly  if ye did not say it man ye meant it an what did ye say about chapel  chapels against it ye said she s against it  well if chapel and nature go hand in hand its the first ive ever heard of it  that young man there pointing to roussaid i ad ell fire on my tongue  if i had i would use it all to scorch and wither this talking of surrender surrendering s the work of cowards and traitors  henry rous  as george rous moves forward  go for him george dont stand his lip  roberts  flinging out his finger  stop there george rous its no time this to settle personal matters  rous stops  but there was one other spoke to youmr simon harness  we have not much to thank mr harness and the union for  they said to us desert your mates or well desert you  an they did desert us  evans  they did  roberts  mr simon harness is a clever man but he has come too late  with intense conviction  for all that mr simon harness says for all that thomas rous for all that any man present here can sayweve

monster with the bloody lips that has sucked the life out of ourselves our wives and children since the world began  dropping the note of passion but with the utmost weight and intensity  if we have not the hearts of men to stand against it breast to breast and eye to eye and force it backward till it cry for mercy it will go on sucking life and we shall stay forever what we are in almost a whisper less than the very dogs       an utter stillness and roberts stands rocking his body      slightly with his eyes burning the faces of the crowd  evans and jago  suddenly  roberts  the shout is

         the curtain falls     act iii       it is five oclock  in the underwoods drawingroom which is      artistically furnished enid is sitting on the sofa working at a      babys frock  edgar by a little spindlelegged table in the      centre of the room is fingering a chinabox  his eyes are      fixed on the doubledoors that lead into the diningroom  edgar  putting down the chinabox and glancing at his watch just on five theyre all in there waiting except frank  wheres he  enid  hes had to go down to gasgoynes about a contract  will you want him  edgar  he cant help us  this is a directors job  motioning towards a single door half hidden by a curtain  father in his room  enid  yes  edgar  i wish hed stay there enid       enid looks up at him  this is a beastly business old girl       he takes up the little box again and turns it over and over  enid  i went to the robertss this afternoon ted  edgar  that was nt very wise  enid  hes simply killing his wife  edgar  we are you mean  enid  suddenly  roberts ought to give way  edgar  theres a lot to be said on the mens side  enid  i dont feel half so sympathetic with them as i did before i went  they just set up class feeling against you  poor annie was looking dread fully badfire going out and nothing fit for her to eat       edgar walks to and fro  but she would stand up for roberts  when you see all this wretchedness going on and feel you can do nothing you have to shut your eyes to the whole thing  edgar  if you can  enid  when i went i was all on their side but as soon as i got there i began to feel quite different at once  people talk about sympathy with the working classes they dont know what it means to try and put it into practice  it seems hopeless  edgar  ah  well  enid  its dreadful going on with the men in this state  i do hope the dad will make concessions  edgar  he wont  gloomily  its a sort of religion with him curse it  i know whats coming  hell be voted down  enid  they would nt dare  edgar  they willtheyre in a funk  enid  indignantly  hed never stand it  edgar  with a shrug  my dear girl if youre beaten in a vote youve got to stand it  enid  oh  she gets up in alarm  but would he resign  edgar  of course  it goes to the roots of his beliefs  enid  but hes so wrapped up in this company ted  thered be nothing left for him  itd be dreadful       edgar shrugs his shoulders  oh ted hes so old now  you must nt let them  edgar  hiding his feelings in an outburst  my sympathies in this strike are all on the side of the men  enid  hes been chairman for more than thirty years  he made the whole thing  and think of the bad times theyve had its always been he who pulled them through  oh ted you must  edgar  what is it you want  you said just now you hoped hed make concessions  now you want me to back him in not making them  this is nt a game enid  enid  hotly  it is nt a game to me that the dads in danger of losing all he cares about in life  if he wont give way and hes beaten itll simply break him down  edgar  did nt you say it was dreadful going on with the men in this state  enid  but cant you see ted fatherll never get over it  you must stop them somehow  the others are afraid of him  if you back him up  edgar  putting his hand to his head  against my convictions against yours  the moment it begins to pinch one personally  enid  it is nt personal its the dad  edgar  your family or yourself and over goes the show  enid  resentfully  if you dont take it seriously i do  edgar  i am as fond of him as you are thats nothing to do with it  enid  we cant tell about the men its all guesswork  but we know the dad might have a stroke any day  d you mean to say that he isnt more to you than  edgar  of course he is  enid  i dont understand you then  edgar  hm  enid  if it were for oneself it would be different but for our own father  you dont seem to realise  edgar  i realise perfectly  enid  its your first duty to save him  edgar  i wonder  enid  imploring  oh ted  its the only interest hes got left itll be like a deathblow to him  edgar  restraining his emotion  i know  enid  promise  edgar  ill do what i can       he turns to the doubledoors       the curtained door is opened and anthony appears  edgar opens      the doubledoors and passes through       scantleburys voice is faintly heard past five we shall      never get throughhave to eat another dinner at that hotel      the doors are shut  anthony walks forward  anthony  youve been seeing roberts i hear  enid  yes  anthony  do you know what trying to bridge such a gulf as this is like       enid puts her work on the little table and faces him  filling a sieve with sand  enid  dont  anthony  you think with your gloved hands you can cure the trouble of the century       he passes on   enid  father       anthony stops at the double doors  im only thinking of you  anthony  more softly  i can take care of myself my dear  enid  have you thought whatll

what       it ceases instantly  anthony passes through closing the doors      behind him  enid springs to them with a gesture of dismay  she      puts her hand on the knob and begins turning it then goes to      the fireplace and taps her foot on the fender  suddenly she      rings the bell  frost comes in by the door that leads into the      hall  frost  yes mm  enid  when the men come frost please show them in here the hall s cold  frost  i could put them in the pantry mm  enid  no  i dont want toto offend them theyre so touchy  frost  yes mm  pause  excuse me mr anthonys ad nothing to

were a younger man an knew what was good for im he will have his own way  enid  i suppose we all want that  frost  yes mm  quietly  excuse me speakin about the strike im sure if the other gentlemen were to give up to mr anthony and quietly let the men ave what they want afterwards thatd be the best way  i find that very useful with him at times mm       enid shakes hey head  if hes crossed it makes him violent with an air of discovery and ive noticed in my own case when im violent im always sorry for it afterwards  enid  with a smile  are you ever violent frost  frost  yes mm oh  sometimes very violent  enid  ive never seen you  frost  impersonally  no mm that is so       enid fidgets towards the back of the door  with feeling  bein with mr anthony as you know mm ever since i was fifteen it worries me to see him crossed like this at his age ive taken the liberty to speak to mr wanklin dropping his voice seems to be the most sensible of the gentlemenbut e said to me thats all very well frost but this strikes a very serious thing e said  serious for all parties no doubt i said but yumour im sir i said yumour im  its like this if a man comes to a stone wall e does nt drive is ead against it e gets over it  yes e said youd better tell your master that frost looks at his nails  thats where it is mm  i said to mr anthony this morning is it worth it sir  damn it he said to me frost  mind your own business or take a months notice  beg pardon mm for using such a word  enid  moving to the doubledoors and listening  do you know that man roberts frost  frost  yes mm thats to

personal  a man may ave what opinions e likes so long as e s not personal when e s that e s not safe  enid  i think thats what my father feels about roberts  frost  no doubt mm mr anthony has a feeling against him       enid glances at him sharply but finding him in perfect      earnest stands biting her lips and looking at the      doubledoors  it s a regular right down struggle between the two  ive no patience with this roberts from what i ear hes just an ordinary workin man like the rest of em  if he did invent a thing hes no worse off than undreds of others  my brother invented a new kind o dumbwaiternobody gave him anything for it an there it is bein used all over the place       enid moves closer to the doubledoors  theres a kind o man that never forgives the world because e wasnt born a gentleman  what i say isno man thats a gentleman looks down on another because e appens to be a class or two above im no more than if e appens to be a class or two below  enid  with slight impatience  yes i know frost of course will you please go in and ask if theyll have some tea say i sent you  frost  yes mm       he opens the doors gently and goes in  there is a momentary      sound of earnest gather angry talk  wilder  i dont agree with you  wanklin  weve had this over a dozen times  edgar  impatiently  well whats the proposition  scantlebury  yes what does your father say  tea  not for me not for me  wanklin  what i understand the chairman to say is this       frost reenters closing the door behind him  enid  moving from the door  wont they have any tea frost       she goes to the little table and remains motionless looking      at the babys frock       a parlourmaid enters from the hall  parlourmaid  a miss thomas mm  enid  raising her head  thomas  what miss

stands by      the door  enid  come in  what is it  what have you come for please  madge  brought a message from mrs roberts  enid  a message  yes  madge  she asks you to look after her mother  enid  i dont understand  madge  sullenly  thats the message  enid  butwhatwhy  madge  annie roberts is dead       there is a silence  enid  horrified  but its only a little more than an hour since i saw her  madge  of cold and hunger  enid  rising  oh  thats not true the poor things heart what makes you look at me like that  i tried to help her  madge  with suppressed savagery  i thought youd like to

passionately  i wont talk to you  how can you tell what i feel  its not my fault that i was born better off than you  madge  we dont want your money  enid  you dont understand and you dont want to

strike  madge  with sombre triumph  then tell him mrs roberts is dead that ll make him better  enid  go away  madge  when a person hurts us we get it back on them       she makes a sudden and swift movement towards enid fixing her      eyes on the childs frock lying across the little table  enid      snatches the frock up as though it were the child itself  they      stand a yard apart crossing glances  madge  pointing to the frock with a little smile  ah  you felt that  lucky its her mothernot her childrenyouve to look after is nt it  she wont trouble you long  enid  go away  madge  ive given you the message       she turns and goes out into the hall  enid motionless till      she has gone sinks down at the table bending her head over the      frock which she is still clutching to her  the doubledoors      are opened and anthony comes slowly in he passes his daughter      and lowers himself into an armchair  he is very flushed  enid  hiding her emotionanxiously  what is it dad       anthony makes a gesture but does not speak  who was it       anthony does not answer  enid going to the doubledoors meets      edgar coming in  they speak together in low tones  what is it ted  edgar  that fellow wilder  taken to personalities  he was downright insulting  enid  what did he say  edgar  said father was too old and feeble to know what he was doing  the dads worth six of him  enid  of course he is       they look at anthony       the doors open wider wanklin appears with scantlebury  scantlebury  sotto voce  i dont like the look of this  wanklin  going forward  come chairman  wilder sends you his apologies  a man cant do more       wilder followed by tench comes in and goes to anthony  wilder  glumly  i withdraw my words sir  im sorry       anthony nods to him  enid  you have nt come to a decision mr wanklin       wanklin shakes his head  wanklin  were all here chairman what do you say  shall we get on with the business or shall we go back to the other room  scantlebury  yes yes lets get on  we must settle something       he turns from a small chair and settles himself suddenly in      the largest chair with a sigh of comfort       wilder and wanklin also sit and tench drawing up a      straightbacked chair close to his chairman sits on the edge      of it with the minutebook and a stylographic pen  enid  whispering i want to speak to you a minute ted       they go out through the doubledoors  wanklin  really chairman its no use soothing ourselves with a sense of false security  if this strikes not brought to an end before the general meeting the shareholders will certainly haul us over the coals  scantlebury  stirring  whatwhats that  wanklin  i know it for a fact  anthony  let them  wilder  and get turned out  wanklin  to anthony  i dont mind martyrdom for a policy in which i believe but i object to being burnt for some one elses principles  scantlebury  very reasonableyou must see that chairman  anthony  we owe it to other employers to stand firm  wanklin  theres a limit to that  anthony  you were all full of fight at the start  scantlebury  with a sort of groan  we thought the men would give in but theyhave nt  anthony  they will  wilder  rising and pacing up and down i cant have my reputation as a man of business destroyed for the satisfaction of starving the men out  almost in tears  i cant have it  how can we meet the shareholders with things in the state they are  scantlebury  hear hearhear hear  wilder  lashing himself  if any one expects me to say to them ive lost you fifty thousand pounds and sooner than put my pride in my pocket ill lose you another  glancing at anthony  itsits unnatural  i dont want to go against you sir  wanklin  persuasively  come chairman we re not free agents were part of a machine  our only business is to see the company earns as much profit as it safely can  if you blame me for want of principle i say that were trustees  reason tells us we shall never get back in the saving of wages what we shall lose if we continue this strugglereally chairman we must bring it to an end on the best terms we can make  anthony  no       there is a pause of general dismay  wilder  its a deadlock then  letting his hands drop with a sort of despair  now i shall never get off to spain  wanklin  retaining a trace of irony  you hear the consequences of your victory chairman  wilder  with a burst of feeling  my wifes ill  scantlebury  dear dear  you dont say so  wilder  if i dont get her out of this cold i wont answer for the consequences       through the doubledoors edgar comes in looking very grave  edgar  to his father  have you heard this sir  mrs roberts is dead       every one stages at him as if trying to gauge the importance      of this news  enid saw her this afternoon she had no coals or food or anything its enough       there is a silence every one avoiding the others eyes except      anthony who stares hard at his son  scantlebury  you dont suggest that we could have helped the poor thing  wilder  flustered  the woman was in bad health  nobody can say theres any responsibility on us  at leastnot on me  edgar  hotly  i say that we are responsible  anthony  war is war  edgar  not on women  wanklin  it not infrequently happens that women are the greatest sufferers  edgar  if we knew that all the more responsibility rests on us  anthony  this is no matter for amateurs  edgar  call me what you like sir  its sickened me  we had no right to carry things to such a length  wilder  i dont like this business a bitthat radical rag will twist it to their own ends see if they dont  theyll get up some cock and bull story about the poor womans dying from starvation  i wash my hands of it  edgar  you cant  none of us can  scantlebury  striking his fist on the arm of his chair  but i protest against this  edgar  protest as you like mr scantlebury it wont alter facts  anthony  thats enough  edgar  facing him angrily  no sir  i tell you exactly what i think  if we pretend the men are not suffering its humbug and if theyre suffering we know enough of human nature to know the women are suffering more and as to the childrenwellits damnable       scantlebury rises from his chair  i dont say that we meant to be cruel i dont say anything of the sort but i do say its criminal to shut our eyes to the facts  we employ these men and we cant get out of it  i dont care so much about the men but id sooner resign my position on the board than go on starving women in this way       all except anthony are now upon their feet anthony sits      grasping the arms of his chair and staring at his son  scantlebury  i donti dont like the way youre putting it young sir  wanklin  youre rather overshooting the mark  wilder  i should think so indeed  edgar  losing control  its no use blinking things  if you want to have the death of women on your handsi dont  scantlebury  now now young man  wilder  on our hands  not on mine i wont have it  edgar  we are five members of this board if we were four against it why did we let it drift till it came to this  you know perfectly well whybecause we hoped we should starve the men out  well all weve done is to starve one woman out  scantlebury  almost hysterically  i protest i protest  im a humane manwere all humane men  edgar  scornfully  theres nothing wrong with our humanity  its our imaginations mr scantlebury  wilder  nonsense  my imaginations as good as yours  edgar  if so it is nt good enough  wilder  i foresaw this  edgar  then why didnt you put your foot down  wilder  much good that would have done       he looks at anthony  edgar  if you and i and each one of us here who say that our imaginations are so good  scantlebury  flurried  i never said so  edgar  paying no attentionhad put our feet down the thing would have been ended long ago and this poor womans life wouldnt have been crushed out of her like this  for all we can tell there may be a dozen other starving women  scantlebury  for gods sake sir dont use that word at aat a board meeting itsits monstrous  edgar  i will use it mr scantlebury  scantlebury  then i shall not listen to you  i shall not listen its painful to me       he covers his ears  wanklin  none of us are opposed to a settlement except your father  edgar  im certain that if the shareholders knew  wanklin  i dont think youll find their imaginations are any better than ours  because a woman happens to have a weak heart  edgar  a struggle like this finds out the weak spots in everybody any child knows that  if it hadnt been for this cutthroat policy she need nt have died like this and there would nt be all this misery that any one who is nt a fool can see is going on       throughout the foregoing anthony has eyed his son he now moves      as though to rise but stops as edgar speaks again  i dont defend the men or myself or anybody  wanklin  you may have to  a coroners jury of disinterested sympathisers may say some very nasty things  we mustnt lose sight of our position  scantlebury  without uncovering his ears  coroners jury  no no its not a case for that  edgar  i ve had enough of cowardice  wanklin  cowardice is an unpleasant word mr edgar anthony  it will look very like cowardice if we suddenly concede the mens demands when a thing like this happens we must be careful  wilder  of course we must  weve no knowledge of this matter except a rumour  the proper course is to put the whole thing into the hands of harness to settle for us thats natural thats what we should have come to any way  scantlebury  with dignity  exactly  turning to edgar  and as to you young sir i cant sufficiently express mymy distaste for the way youve treated the whole matter  you ought to withdraw talking of starvation talking of cowardice  considering what our views are  except your own isis one of goodwillits most irregular its most improper and all i can say is itsits given me pain       he places his hand over his heart  edgar  stubbornly  i withdraw nothing       he is about to say mote when scantlebury once more coveys up      his ears  tench suddenly makes a demonstration with the      minutebook  a sense of having been engaged in the unusual comes      over all of them and one by one they resume their seats  edgar      alone remains on his feet  wilder  with an air of trying to wipe something out  i pay no attention to what young mr anthony has said  coroners jury  the ideas preposterous  ii move this amendment to the chairmans motion that the dispute be placed at once in the hands of mr simon harness for settlement on the lines indicated by him this morning any one second that       tench writes in his book  wanklin  i do  wilder  very well then i ask the chairman to put it to the board  anthony  with a great sighslowly  we have been made the subject of an attack  looking round at wilder and scantlebury with ironical contempt  i take it on my shoulders  i am seventysix years old i have been chairman of this company since its inception twoandthirty years ago  i have seen it pass through good and evil report my connection with it began in the year that this young man was born       edgar bows his head  anthony gripping his chair goes on  i have had do to with men for fifty years ive always stood up to them i have never been beaten yet  i have fought the men of this company four times and four times i have beaten them  it has been said that i am not the man i was  he looks at wilder  however that may be i am man enough to stand to my guns       his voice grows stronger  the doubledoors are opened  enid      slips in followed by underwood who restrains her  the men have been treated justly they have had fair wages we have always been ready to listen to complaints  it has been said that times have changed if they have i have not changed with them neither will i  it has been said that masters and men are equal cant  there can only be one master in a house  where two men meet the better man will rule  it has been said that capital and labour have the same interests  cant  their interests are as wide asunder as the poles  it has been said that the board is only part of a machine  cant  we are the machine its brains and sinews it is for us to lead and to determine what is to be done and to do it without fear or favour  fear of the men  fear of the shareholders  fear of our own shadows  before i am like that i hope to die       he pauses and meeting his sons eyes goes on  there is only one way of treating menwith the iron hand  this half and half business the half and half manners of this generation has brought all this upon us  sentiment and softness and what this young man no doubt would call his social policy  you cant eat cake and have it  this middleclass sentiment or socialism or whatever it may be is rotten  masters are masters men are men yield one demand and they will make it six  they are he smiles grimly  like oliver twist asking for more  if i were in their place i should be the same  but i am not in their place  mark my words one fine morning when you have given way here and given way thereyou will find you have parted with the ground beneath your feet and are deep in the bog of bankruptcy and with you floundering in that bog will be the very men you have given way to i have been accused of being a domineering tyrant thinking only of my pridei am thinking of the future of this country threatened with the black waters of confusion threatened with mob government threatened with what i cannot see  if by any conduct of mine i help to bring this on us i shall be ashamed to look my fellows in the face       anthony stares before him at what he cannot see and there is      perfect stillness  frost comes in from the hall and all but      anthony look round at him uneasily  frost  to his master  the men are here sir  anthony makes a gesture of dismissal  shall i bring them in sir  anthony  wait       frost goes out anthony turns to face his son  i come to the attack that has been made upon me       edgar with a gesture of deprecation remains motionless with      his head a little bowed  a woman has died  i am told that her blood is on my hands i am told that on my hands is the starvation and the suffering of other women and of children  edgar  i said on our hands sir  anthony  it is the same  his voice grows stronger and stronger his feeling is more and more made manifest  i am not aware that if my adversary suffer in a fair fight not sought by me it is my fault if i fall under his feetas fall i mayi shall not complain  that will be my lookoutand this ishis  i cannot separate as i would these men from their women and children  a fair fight is a fair fight  let them learn to think before they pick a quarrel  edgar  in a low voice  but is it a fair fight father  look at them and look at us  theyve only this one weapon  anthony  grimly  and youre weakkneed enough to teach them how to use it  it seems the fashion nowadays for men to take their enemys side  i have not learnt that art  is it my fault that they quarrelled with their union too  edgar  there is such a thing as mercy  anthony  and justice comes before it  edgar  what seems just to one man sir is injustice to another  anthony  with suppressed passion  you accuse me of injusticeof what amounts to inhumanityof cruelty       edgar makes a gesture of horrora general frightened      movement  wanklin  come come chairman  anthony  in a grim voice  these are the words of my own son they are the words of a generation that i dont understand the words of a soft breed       a general murmur  with a violent effort anthony recovers his      control  edgar  quietly  i said it of myself too father       a long look is exchanged between them and anthony puts out his      hand with a gesture as if to sweep the personalities away then      places it against his brow swaying as though from giddiness      there is a movement towards him  he moves them back  anthony  before i put this amendment to the board i have one more word to say  he looks from face to face  if it is carried it means that we shall fail in what we set ourselves to do  it means that we shall fail in the duty that we owe to all capital  it means that we shall fail in the duty that we owe ourselves  it means that we shall be open to constant attack to which we as constantly shall have to yield  be under no misapprehensionrun this time and you will never make a stand again  you will have to fly like curs before the whips of your own men  if that is the lot you wish for you will vote for this amendment       he looks again from face to face finally resting his gaze on      edgar all sit with their eyes on the ground  anthony makes a      gesture and tench hands him the book  he reads  moved by mr wilder and seconded by mr wanklin that the mens demands be placed at once in the hands of mr simon harness for settlement on the lines indicated by him this morning  with sudden vigour  those in favour signify the same in the usual way       for a minute no one moves then hastily just as anthony is      about to speak wilders hand and wanklins are held up then      scantleburys and last edgars who does not lift his head       anthony lifts his own hand  in a clear voice  the amendment is carried  i resign my position on this board       enid gasps and there is dead silence  anthony sits      motionless his head slowly drooping suddenly he heaves as      though the whole of his life had risen up within him  contrary  fifty years  you have disgraced me gentlemen  bring in the men       he sits motionless staring before him  the board draws      hurriedly together and forms a group  tench in a frightened      manner speaks into the hall  underwood

thomas green bulgin and rous who file up in a row      past the little table  tench sits down and writes  all eyes      are foxed on anthony who makes no sign  wanklin  stepping up to the little table

retires       harness has a piece of paper in his hand he bows to the      directors nods towards the men and takes his stand behind the      little table in the very centre of the room  harness  good

whole of those demands are yielded       anthony looks at him but does not speak  there is a movement      amongst the men as though they were bewildered  harness  roberts  roberts  glancing fiercely at him and back to anthony  is that clear enough for ye  is it short enough and to the point  ye made a mistake to think that we would come to heel  ye may break the body but ye cannot break the spirit  get back to london the men have nothing for ye       pausing uneasily he takes a step towards the unmoving anthony  edgar  were all sorry for you roberts but  roberts  keep your sorrow young man  let your father speak  harness  with the sheet of paper in his hand speaking from behind the little table  roberts  robert  to anthony with passionate intensity  why dont ye answer  harness  roberts  roberts  turning sharply  what is it  harness  gravely  youre talking without the book things have travelled past you       he makes a sign to tench who beckons the directors  they      quickly sign his copy of the terms  look at this man  holding up his sheet of paper  demands conceded with the exception of those relating to the engineers and furnacemen  double wages for saturdays

from him all but rous who stands his ground  with deadly stillness  ye have gone back on me  i stood by ye to the death ye waited for that to throw me over       the men answer all speaking together  rous  its a lie  thomas  ye were past endurance man  green  if yed listen to me  bulgin  under his breath hold your jaw  roberts  ye waited for that  harness  taking the directors copy of the terms

his hand to tench  look after the chairman hes not well hes not wellhe had no lunch  if theres any fund started for the women and children put me down forfor twenty pounds       he goes out into the hall in cumbrous haste and wanklin who      has been staring at roberts and anthony with twitchings of his      face follows  edgar remains seated on the sofa looking at the      ground tench returning to the bureau writes in his minute      book  harness stands by the little table gravely watching      roberts  roberts  then youre no longer chairman of this company  breaking into halfmad

they stand several seconds gazing at each other fixedly      anthony lifts his hand as though to salute but lets it fall      the expression of robertss face changes from hostility to      wonder  they bend their heads in token of respect  anthony      turns and slowly walks towards the curtained door  suddenly      he sways as though about to fall recovers himself and is      assisted out by edgar and enid underwood follows but stops at      the door  roberts remains motionless for several seconds      staring intently after anthony then goes out into the hall  tench  approaching harness  its a great weight off my mind mr harness  but what a painful scene sir  he wipes his brow       harness pale and resolute regards with a grim halfsmile the      quavering  tench  its all been so

inquisitive stare moves on to the drawingroom  left alone      without the roses freda still lingers  at the slamming of a      door above and hasty footsteps she shrinks back against the      stairs  bill runs down and comes on her suddenly  he is a      tall goodlooking edition of his father with the same stubborn      look of veiled choler  bill  freda and as she shrinks still further back whats

thats all  dunning  yes  sir william  sir william  well now go along and take a day to think it over       bill who has sauntered moody from the diningroom stands by the      stairs listening  catching sight of him dunning raises his      hand to his forelock  dunning  very good sir william  he turns fumbles and turns again  my old mothers dependent on me  sir william  now dunning ive no more to say      dunning goes sadly away under the stairs  sir william  following  and look here  just understand this      he too goes out       bill lighting a cigarette has approached the writingtable      he looks very glum  the billiardroom door is flung open      mabel lanfarne appears and makes him a little curtsey  mabel  against my will i am bidden to bring you in to pool  bill  sorry  ive got letters  mabel  you seem to have become very conscientious  bill  oh  i dont know  mabel  do you remember the last day of the covert shooting  bits  i do  mabel  suddenly  what a pretty girl freda studdenhams grown  bill  has she  mabel  she walks in beauty  bill  really  hadnt noticed  mabel  have you been taking lessons in conversation  bill  dont think so  mabel  oh  there is a silence  mr cheshire  bill  miss lanfarne  mabel  whats the matter with you arent you rather queer considering that i dont bite and was rather a pal  bill  stolidly im sorry       then seeing that his mother has came in from the billiardroom      he sits down at the writingtable  lady cheshire  mabel dear do take my cue  wont you play too bill and try and stop ronny hes too terrible  bill  thanks  ive got these letters  mabel taking the cue passes back into the billiardroom whence comes out the sound of talk and laughter  lady cheshire  going over and standing behind her sons chair anything wrong darling  bill  nothing thanks  suddenly  i say i wish you hadnt asked that girl here  lady cheshire  mabel  why  shes wanted for rehearsals  i thought you got on so well with her last christmas  bill  with a sort of sullen exasperation  a year ago  lady cheshire  the girls like her so does your father personally i must say i think shes rather nice and irish  bill  shes all right i daresay       he looks round as if to show his mother that he wishes to be      left alone  but lady cheshire having seen that he is about to      look at her is not looking at him  lady cheshire  im afraid your fathers been talking to you bill  bill  he has  lady cheshire  debts  do try and make allowances  with a faint smile of course he is a little  bill  he is  lady cheshire  i wish i could  bill  oh lord  dont you get mixed up in it  lady cheshire  it seems almost a pity that you told him  bill  he wrote and asked me point blank what i owed  lady cheshire  oh  forcing herself to speak in a casual voice i happen to have a little money billi think it would be simpler if  bill  now look here mother youve tried that before  i cant help spending money i never shall be able unless i go to the colonies or something of the kind  lady cheshire  dont talk like that dear  bill  i would for two straws  lady cheshire  its only because your father thinks such a lot of the place and the name and your career  the cheshires are all like that  theyve been here so long theyre allroot  bill  deuced funny business my career will be i expect  lady cheshire  fluttering but restraining herself lest he should see but bill why must you spend more than your allowance  bill  whyanything i didnt make myself  lady cheshire  im afraid we did that  it was inconsiderate perhaps  bill  yes youd better have left me out  lady cheshire  but why are you soonly a little fuss about money  bill  yees  lady cheshire  youre not keeping anything from me are you  bill  facing her no  he then turns very deliberately to the writing things and takes up a pen i must write these letters please  lady cheshire  bill if theres any real trouble you will tell me wont you  bill  theres nothing whatever       he suddenly gets up and walks about  lady cheshire too moves      over to the fireplace and after an uneasy look at him turns to      the fire  then as if trying to switch of his mood she changes      the subject abruptly  lady cheshire  isnt it a pity about young dunning  im so sorry for rose taylor       there is a silence  stealthily under the staircase freda has      entered and seeing only bill advances to speak to him  bill  suddenly  oh  wellyou cant help these things in the country       as he speaks freda stops dead perceiving that he is not alone      bill too catching sight of her starts  lady cheshire  still speaking to the fire it seems dreadful to force him  i do so believe in people doing things of their own accord  then seeing freda standing so uncertainly by the stairs do you want me freda  freda  only your cloak my lady  shall ibegin it       at this moment sir william enters from the drawingroom  lady cheshire  yes yes  sir william  genially  can you give me another five minutes bill pointing to the billiardroom  well come directly my dear       freda with a look at bill has gone back whence she came and      lady cheshire goes reluctantly away into the billiardroom  sir william  i shall give young dunning short shrift  he moves over to the fireplace and divides hip coattails  now about you bill  i dont want to bully you the moment you come down but you know this cant go on  ive paid your debts twice  shant pay them this time unless i see a disposition to change your mode of life a pause  you get your extravagance from your mother  shes very queera pauseall the winterleighs are like that about money  bill  mothers particularly generous if thats what you mean  sir william  drily  we will put it that way  a pause  at the present moment you owe as i understand it eleven hundred pounds  bill  about that  sir william  mere fleabite  a pause  ive a proposition to make  bill  wont it do tomorrow sir  sir william  tomorrow appears to be your motto in life  bill  thanks  sir william  im anxious to change it today  bill looks at him in silence  its time you took your position seriously instead of hanging about town racing and playing polo and what not  bill  go ahead       at something dangerous in his voice sir william modifies his      attitude  sir william  the propositions very simple  i cant suppose anything so rational and to your advantage will appeal to you but drily i mention it  marry a nice girl settle down and stand for the division you can have the dower house and fifteen hundred a year and ill pay your debts into the bargain  if youre elected ill make it two thousand  plenty of time to work up the constituency before we kick out these infernal rads  carpetbagger against you if you go hard at it in the summer itll be odd if you dont manage to get in your three days a week next season  you can take rocketer and that fouryearoldhes well up to your weight fully eight and a half inches of bone  youll only want one other and if missif your wife means to hunt  bill  youve chosen my wife then  sir  william  with a quick look  i imagine youve some girl in your mind  bill  ah  sir william used not to be unnatural at your age  i married your mother at twentyeight  here you are eldest son of a family that stands for something  the more i see of the times the more im convinced that everybody who is anybody has got to buckle to and save the landmarks left  unless were true to our caste and prepared to work for it the landed classes are going to go under to this infernal democratic spirit in the air  the outlooks very serious  were threatened in a hundred ways  if you mean business youll want a wife  when i came into the property i should have been lost without your mother  bill  i thought this was coming  sir william  with a certain geniality  my dear fellow i dont want to put a pistol to your head  youve had a slack rein so far ive never objected to your sowing a few wild oatsso long as you erunseen by sir william bill makes a sudden movement  short of thatat all events ive not inquired into your affairs  i can only judge by theerpecuniary evidence youve been good enough to afford me from time to time  i imagine youve lived like a good many young men in your positionim not blaming you but theres a time for all things  bill  why dont you say outright that you want me to marry mabel lanfarne  sits william  well i do  girls a nice one  good familygot a little moneyrides well  isnt she goodlooking enough for you or what  bill  quite thanks  sir william  i understood from your mother that you and she were on good terms  bill  please dont drag mother into it  sir william  with dangerous politeness  perhaps youll be good enough to state your objections  bill  must we go on with this  sir william  ive never asked you to do anything for me before i expect you to pay attention now  ive no wish to dragoon you into this particular marriage  if you dont care for miss lanfarne marry a girl youre fond of  bill  i refuse  sir william  in that case you know what to look out for  with a sudden rush of choler  you young  he checks himself and stands glaring at bill who glares back at him  this means i suppose that youve got some entanglement or other  bill  suppose what you like sir  sits william  i warn you if you play the blackguard  bill  you cant force me like young dunning       hearing the raised voices lady cheshire has come back from the      billiardroom  lady cheshire  closing the door what is it  sir william  you deliberately refuse  go away dorothy  lady cheshire  resolutely i havent seen bill for two months  sir william  what  hesitating  wellwe must talk it over again  lady cheshire  come to the billiardroom both of you  bill do finish those letters       with a deft movement she draws sir william toward the      billiardroom and glances back at bill before going out but he      has turned to the writingtable  when the door is closed bill      looks into the drawingroom them opens the door under the      stairs and backing away towards the writingtable sits down      there and takes up a pen  freda who has evidently been      waiting comes in and stands by the table  bill  i say this is dangerous you know  freda  yesbut i must  bill  well thenwith natural recklessness  arent you going to kiss me       without moving she looks at him with a sort of miserable inquiry  bill  do you know you havent seen me for eight weeks  freda  quitelong enoughfor you to have forgotten  bill  forgotten  i dont forget people so soon  freda  no  bill  whats the matter with you freda  freda  after a long look  itll never be as it was  bill  jumping up how dyou mean  freda  ive got something for you  she takes a diamond ring out of her dress and

 with a sudden break in her voice oh  bill  bill  with his head down seizing her hands  freda  he breaks away from her towards the fire  good god       she stands looking at him then quietly slips away      by the door under the staircase  bill turns to      speak to her and sees that she has gone  he      walks up to the fireplace and grips the mantelpiece  bill  by jove  this is

 bill  clenching his fists  look here  ill prove it  then as she suddenly flings her arms round his neck and clings to him there there       there is a click of a door handle  they start away from each      other and see lady cheshire regarding them  lady cheshire  without irony  i beg your pardon       she makes as if to withdraw from an unwarranted intrusion but      suddenly turning stands with lips pressed together waiting  lady cheshire  yes       freda has muffled her face  but bill turns and confronts his      mother  bill  dont say anything against her  lady cheshire  tries to

doorway followed by bill  lady cheshire  no bill  i want to speak to her alone       bill does not move  lady cheshire  icily i must ask you to leave us       bill hesitates then shrugging his shoulders he touches fredas      arms and goes back into the workroom closing the door  there      is silence  lady cheshire  how did it come about  freda  i dont know my lady  lady cheshire  for

his hand and falls into the fireplace      while he stands looking at it blankly there is a knock  sir william  come in       freda enters from the corridor  sir william  ive asked you to be good

i dont expect anything  sir william you knowyou havent earned the right to be considered  freda not yet  sir william what  that oughtnt to help you  on the contrary  now brace yourself up and listen

perception of the monstrous nature of it  i must tell you this if you do this mad thing you fend for yourself  youll receive nothing from me now or hereafter  i consider that only due to the position

   kisses her hungrily  seelchen art thou angry       he does not answer but turning out the lamp goes into an inner      room       seelchen sits gazing through the window at the peaks bathed in      full moonlight  then drawing the blankets about her she      snuggles doom on the window seat  seelchen in a sleepy voice they kissed meboth she sleeps                      the scene falls quite dark     scene ii       the scene is slowly illumined as by dawn  seelchen is still      lying on the window seat  she sits up freeing her face and      hands from the blankets changing the swathings of deep sleep      for the filmy coverings of a dream  the wall of the hut has      vanished there is nothing between her and the three mountains      veiled in mist save a through of darkness  there as the peaks      of the mountains brighten they are seen to have great faces  seelchen  oh  they have faces       the face of the wine horn is the profile of a beardless youth      the face of the cow horn is that of a mountain shepherd      solemn and broom with fierce black eyes and a black beard      between them the great horn whose hair is of snow has a high      beardless visage as of carved bronze like a male sphinx      serene without cruelty  far down below the faces of the peaks      above the trough of darkness are peeping out the four little      heads of the flowers of edelweiss and gentian mountain      dandelion and alpenrose on their heads are crowns made of      their several flowers all powdered with dewdrops and when the      flowers lift their childfaces little tinkling bells ring  all around the peaks there is nothing but blue sky  edelweiss  in a tiny voice  would you   would you   would you ah ha  gentian  m dandelion  alpenrose  with their bells ranging enviously  oooooo            from behind the cow horn are heard the voices of cowbells           and mountain air       clinkelclink  clinkelclink      mountain air  mountain air            from behind the wine horn rise the rival voices of view of           italy  flume of steam  and things in books       i am italy  italy       see mesteam in the distance       o remember the things in books            and all call out together very softly with the flowers           ringing their bells  then far away like an echo comes a           sighing       mountain air  mountain air            and suddenly the peak of the cow horn speaks in a voice as           of one unaccustomed  the cow horn  amongst kine and my blackbrown sheep i live i am silence and monotony i am the solemn hills  i am fierceness and the mountain wind clean pasture and wild rest  look in my eyes love me alone  seelchen  breathless  the cow horn  he is speaking for felsman and the mountains  it is the half of my heart            the flowers laugh happily  the cow horn  i stalk the eternal hillsi drink the mountain snows my eyes are the colour of burned wine in them lives melancholy  the lowing of the kine the wind the sound of falling rocks the running of the torrents no other talk know i  thoughts simple and blood hot strength hugethe cloak of gravity  seelchen yes yes  i want him he is strong            the voices of cowbells and mountain air cry out together       clinkelclink  clinkelclink       mountain air  mountain air  the cow horn  little soul  hold to me  love me  live with me under the stars  seelchen  below her breath  i am afraid            and suddenly the peak of the wine horn speaks in a youths           voice  the wine horn  i am the will o the wisp that dances thro the streets i am the cooing dove of towns from the plane trees and the chestnuts shade from day to day all changes where i burn my incense to my thousand little gods  in white palaces i dwell and passionate dark alleys  the life of men in crowds is mineof lamplight in the streets at dawn  softly  i have a thousand loves and never one too long for i am nimbler than your heifers playing in the sunshine            the flowers ringing in alarm cry       we know them  the wine horn  i hear the rustlings of the birth and death of pleasure and the rattling of swift wheels  i hear the hungry oaths of men and love kisses in the airless night  without me little soul you starve and die  seelchen  he is speaking for the gentle sir and the big world of the town  it pulls my heart  the wine horn  my thoughts surpass in number the flowers in your meadows they fly more swiftly than your eagles on the wind i drink the wine of aspiration and the drug of disillusion  thus am i never dull            the voices of view of italy flume of steam and things in           books are heard calling out together       i am italy italy       see mesteam in the distance       o remember remember  the wine horn  love me little soul  i paint life fifty colours i make a thousand pretty things  i twine about your heart  seelchen  he is honey            the flowers ring their bells jealously and cry       bitter bitter   the cow horn  stay with me seelchen  i wake thee with the crystal air            the voices of cowbells and mountain air tiny out far away       clinkelclink  clinkelclink       mountain air  mountain air

softly       i am italy  italy       see mesteam in the distance       o remember remember            and the flowers moan  seelchen  in grief  my heart  it is torn  the wine horn  with me little soul you shall race in the streets and peep at all secrets  we will hold hands and fly like the thistledown  m dandelion  my puffballs fly faster  the wine horn  i will show you the sea  gentian  my blue is deeper  the wine horn i will shower on you blushes  alpenrose  i can blush redder  the wine horn  little soul listen  my jewels  silk  velvet  edelweiss  i am softer than velvet  the wine horn proudly  my wonderful rags  the flowers moaning  of those we have none  seelchen  he has all things  the cow horn  mine are the clouds with the dark silvered wings mine are the rocks on fire with the sun and the dewdrops cooler than pearls away from my breath of snow and sweet grass thou wilt droop little soul  the wine horn  the dark clove is my fragrance            the flowers ring eagerly and turning up their faces cry       we too smell sweet            but the voices of view of italy flume of steam and things           in books cry out       i am italy  italy       see mesteam in the distance       o remember  remember  seelchen distracted  oh it is hard  the cow horn  i will never desert thee  the wine horn  a hundred times i will desert you a hundred times come back and kiss you  seelchen  whispering  peace for my heart  the cow horn  with me thou shalt lie on the warm wild thyme            the flowers laugh happily  the wine horn  with me you shall lie on a bed of doves feathers            the flowers moan  the wine horn  i will give you old wine  the cow horn  i will give thee new milk  the wine horn  hear my song            from far away comes the sound as of mandolins  seelchen  clasping her breast  my heartit is leaving me  the cow horn  hear my song            from the distance floats the piping of a shepherds reed  seelchen  curving her hand at her ears the piping  ah  the cow horn  stay with me seelchen  the wine horn  come with me seelchen  the cow horn  i give thee certainty  the wine horn  i give you chance  the cow horn  i give thee peace  the wine horn  i give you change  the cow horn  i give thee stillness  the wine horn  i give you voice  the cow horn  i give thee one love  the wine horn  i give you many  seelchen  as if the words were torn from her heart  both bothi will love       and suddenly the peak of the great horn speaks  the great horn  and both thou shalt love little soul  thou shalt lie on the hills with silence and dance in the cities with knowledge  both shall possess thee  the sun and the moon on the mountains shall burn thee the lamps of the town singe thy wings small moth  each shall seem all the world to thee each shall seem as thy grave  thy heart is a feather blown from one mouth to the other  but be not afraid  for the life of a man is for all loves in turn tis a little raft moored then sailing out into the blue a tune caught in a hush then whispering on a newborn babe half courage and half sleep  there is a hidden rhythm  change quietude  chance  certainty  the one  the many  burn onthou pretty flame trying to eat the world  thou shaft come to me at last my little soul       the voices and the flowerbells peal out       seelchen enraptured stretches her arms to embrace the sight      and sound but all fades slowly into dark sleep     scene iii  the dark scene again becomes glamorous  seelchen is seen with her hand stretched out towards the piazza of a little town with a plane tree on one side a wall on the other and from the open doorway of an inn a pale path of light  over the inn hangs a full golden moon against the wall under the glimmer of a lamp leans a youth with the face of the wine horn in a crimson dock thrumming a mandolin and singing           little star soul           through the frost fields of night           roaming alone disconsolate           from out the cold           i call thee in           striking my dark mandolin           beneath this moon of gold       from the inn comes a burst of laughter and the sound of      dancing  seelchen  whispering  it is the big world       the youth of the wine horn sings on           pretty grey moth           where the strange candles shine           seeking for warmth so desperate           ah fluttering dove           i bid thee win           striking my dark mandolin           the crimson flame of love  seelchen  gazing enraptured at the inn  they are dancing       as she speaks from either side come mothchildren meeting and      fluttering up the path of light to the inn doorway then      wheeling aside they form again and again flutter forward  seelchen  holding out her hands  they are real  their wings are windy       the youth of the wine horn sings on           lips of my song           to the white maidens heart           go ye and whisper  passionate           these words that burn           o listening one           love that flieth past is gone           nor ever may return       seelchen runs towards himbut the light above him fades he has      become shadow  she turns bewildered to the dancing mothchildren      but they vanish before her  at the door of the inn stands      lamond in a dark cloak  seelchen  it is you  lamond  without my little soul i am cold  come  he holds out his arms to her  seelchen  shall i be safe  lamond  what is safety   are you safe in your mountains  seelchen  where am i here  lamond  the town       smiling he points to the doorway and silent as shadows there      come dancing out two by two two girls and two youths  the      first girl is dressed in white satin and jewels and the first      youth in black velvet  the second girl is in rags and a shawl      and the second youth in shirt and corduroys  they dance      gravely each couple as if in a world apart  seelchen whispering  in the mountains all dance together  do they never change partners  lamond how could they little one   those are rich these poor but see       a corybantic couple come dancing forth the girl has bare limbs      a flamecoloured shift and hair bound with red flowers the      youth wears a pantherskin  they pursue not only each other      but the other girls and youths  for a moment all is a furious      medley  then the corybantic couple vanish into the inn and the      first two couples are left slowly solemnly dancing apart from      each other as before  seelchen shuddering  shall i one day dance like that       the youth of the wine horn appears again beneath the lamp  he      strikes a loud chord then as seelchen moves towards that sound      the lamp goes out there is again only blue shadow but the      couples have disappeared into the inn and the doorway has grown      dark  seelchen  ah  what i do not like he will not let me see  lamond  will you not come then little soul  seelchen  always to dance  lamond  not so       the shutters of the houses are suddenly thrown wide in a      lighted room on one aide of the inn are seen two pale men and a      woman amongst many clicking machines  on the other side of the      inn in a forge are visible two women and a man but half      clothed making chains  seelchen  recoiling from both sights in turn  how sad they look all  what are they making       in the dark doorway of the inn a light shines out and in it is      seen a figure visible only from the waist up clad in      goldcloth studded with jewels with a flushed complacent face      holding in one hand a glass of golden wine  seelchen  it is beautiful what is it  lamond  luxury  seelchen  what is it standing on  i cannot see       unseen the wine horns mandolin twangs out  lamond  for that do not look little soul  seelchen  can it not walk   he shakes his head  is that all they make here with their sadness       but again the mandolin twangs out the shutters fall over the      houses the door of the inn grows dark  lamond  what is it then you would have  is it learning  there are books here that piled on each other would reach to the stars but seelchen shakes her head  there is religion so deep that no man knows what it means but seelchen shakes her head  there is religion so shallow you may have it by turning a handle  we have everything  seelchen  is god here  lamond  who knows  is god with your goats  but seelchen shakes her head  what then do you want  seelchen  life       the mandolin twangs out  lamond  pointing to his breast  there is but one road to life  seelchen  ah but i do not love  lamond  when a feather dies is it not loving the windthe unknown when the day brings not new things we are children of sorrow  if darkness and light did not change could we breathe  child  to live is to love to love is to liveseeking for wonder  and as she draws nearer  see  to love is to peer over the edge and spying the little grey flower to climb down  it has wings it has flownagain you must climb it shivers tis but air in your handyou must crawl you must cling you must leap and still it is there and not therefor the grey flower flits like a moth and the wind of its wings is all you shall catch  but your eyes shall be shining your cheeks shall be burning your breast shall be pantingah little heart  the scene falls darker  and when the night comesthere it is still thistledown blown on the dark and your white hands will reach for it and your honey breath waft it and never never shall you grasp that wanton thingbut life shall be lovely  his voice dies to a whisper  he stretches out his arms  seelchen  touching his breast  i will come  lamond  drawing her to the dark doorway  love me  seelchen  i love       the mandolin twangs out the doorway for a moment is all      glamorous and they pass through  illumined by the glimmer of      the lamp the youth of the wine hour is seen again  and slowly      to the chords of his mandolin he begins to sing           the windy hours through darkness fly           canst hear them little heart           new loves are born and old loves die           and kissing lips must part            the dusky bees of passing years           canst see them soul of mine           from flower and flower supping tears           and pale sweet honey wine       his voice grown strange and passionate            o flame that treads the marsh of time           flitting for ever low           where through the black enchanted slime           we desperate following go           untimely fire we bid thee stay           into dark air above           the golden gipsy thins away           so has it been with love       while he is singing the moon grows pale and dies  it falls      dark save for the glimmer of the lamp beneath which he stands      but as his song ends the dawn breaks over the houses the lamp      goes outthe wine horn becomes shadow  then from the doorway      of the inn in the shrill grey light seelchen comes forth  she      is pale as if wan with living her eyes like pitch against the      powdery whiteness of her face  seelchen  my heart is old       but as she speaks from far away is heard a faint chiming of      cowbells and while she stands listening lamond appears in the      doorway of the inn  lamond  little soul  seelchen  you  always you  lamond  i have new wonders  seelchen  mournfully  no  lamond  i swear it  you have not tired of me that am never the same  it cannot be  seelchen  listen       the chime of the cowbells is heard again  lamond  jealously  the music of dull sleep  has life then with me been sorrow  seelchen  i do not regret  lamond  come  seelchen  pointingto her breast  the bird is tired with flying touching her lips  the flowers have no dew  lamond  would you leave me  seelchen  see       there in a streak of the dawn against the plane tree is seen      the shepherd of the cow horn standing wrapped in his mountain      cloak  lamond  what is it  seelchen  he  lamond  there is nothing  he holds her fast  i have shown you the marvels of my townthe gay the bitter wonders  we have known life if with you i may no longer live then let us die  see  here are sweet deaths by slumber and by drowning  the mandolin twangs out and from the dim doorway of the inn come forth the shadowy forms  death by slumber and death by drowning who to a ghostly twanging of mandolins dance slowly towards seelchen stand smiling at her and as slowly dance away  seelchen  following yes  they are good and sweet       while she moves towards the inn  lamonds face becomes      transfigured with joy  but just as she reaches the doorway      there is a distant chiming of bells and blowing of pipes and      the shepherd of the cow horn sings           to the wild grass come and the dull far roar           of the falling rock to the flowery meads           of thy mountain home where the eagles soar           and the grizzled flock in the sunshine feeds           to the alp where i in the pale light crowned           with the moons thin horns to my pasture roam           to the silent sky and the wistful sound           of the rosy dawnsmy daughter come       while he sings the sun has risen and seelchen has turned      with parted lips and hands stretched out and the forms of      death have vanished  seelchen  i come  lamond  clasping her knees  little soul  must i then die like a gnat when the sun goes down   without you i am nothing  seelchen  releasing herself  poor hearti am gone  lamond  it is dark  he covers his face with his cloak       then as seelchen reaches the shepherd of the cow horn there is      blown a long note of a pipe the scene falls back and there      rises a far continual mingled sound of cowbells and flower      bells and pipes      scene iv       the scene slowly brightens with the misty flush of dawn      seelchen stands on a green alp with all around nothing but      blue sky  a slip of a crescent moon is lying on her back  on a      low rock sits a brown faced goatherd blowing on a pipe and the      four flowerchildren are dancing in their shifts of grey white      and blue rosepink and burntgold  their bells are ringing      as they pelt each other with flowers of their own colours and      each in turn wheeling flings one flower at seelchen who puts      them to her lips and eyes  seelchen  the dew she moves towards the rock  goatherd       but the flowers encircle him and when they wheel away he has      vanished  she turns to the flowers but they too vanish  the      veils of mist are rising  seelchen  gone  she rubs her eyes then turning once more to the rock sees felsman standing there with his arms folded  thou  felsman  so thou hast comelike a sick heifer to be healed  was it good in the townthat kept thee so long  seelchen  i do not regret  felsman  why then return  seelchen  i was tired  felsman  never again shalt thou go from me  seelchen  mocking  with what wilt thou keep me  felsman  grasping her thus  seelchen i have known changei am no timid maid  felsman  moodily  aye thou art different  thine eyes are hollow thou art whitefaced  seelchen  still mocking  then what hast thou here that shall keep me  felsman  the sun  seelchen  to burn me  felsman  the air       there is a faint wailing of wind  seelchen  to freeze me  felsman  the silence       the noise of the wind dies away  seelchen  yes it is lonely  felsman  wait  and the flowers shall dance to thee       and to a ringing of their bells  the flowers come dancing      till one by one they cease and sink down nodding falling      asleep  seelchen  see  even they grow sleepy here  felsman  i will call the goats to wake them       the goatherd is seen again sitting upright on his rock and      piping  and there come four little brown wildeyed naked      boys with goats legs and feet who dance gravely in and out of      the sleeping flowers and the flowers wake spring up and fly      till each goat catching his flower has vanished and the      goatherd has ceased to pipe and lies motionless again on his      rock  felsman  love me  seelchen  thou art rude  felsman  love me  seelchen  thou art grim  felsman  aye  i have no silver tongue  listen  this is my voice sweeping his arm round all the still alp  it is quiet  from dawn to the first star all is fast  laying his hand on her heart  and the wings of the birds shall be still  seelchen  touching his eyes  thine eyes are fierce  in them i see the wild beasts crouching  in them i see the distance  are they always fierce  felsman  neverto look on thee my flower  seelchen  touching his hands  thy hands are rough to pluck flowers  she breaks away from him to the rock where the goatherd is lying  see  nothing moves  the very day stands still  boy  but the goatherd neither stirs nor answers  he is lost in the blue passionately  boy  he will not answer me  no one will answer me here  felsman with fierce longing  am i then no one  seelchen  thou       the scene darkens with evening  see  sleep has stolen the day  it is night already       there come the female shadow forms of sleep in grey cobweb      garments waving their arms drowsily wheeling round her  seelchen  are you sleep   dear sleep       smiling she holds out her arms to felsman  he takes her      swaying form  they vanish encircled by the forms of sleep it      is dark save for the light of the thin horned moon suddenly      grown bright  then on his rock to a faint gaping the goatherd      sings           my goat my little speckled one           my yelloweyed sweetsmelling           let moon and wind and golden sun           and stars beyond all telling           make every day a sweeter grass           and multiply thy leaping           and may the mountain foxes pass           and never scent thee sleeping           oh  let my pipe be clear and far           and let me find sweet water           no hawk nor udderseeking jar           come near thee little daughter           may fiery rocks defend at noon           thy tender feet from slipping           oh hear my prayer beneath the moon           great master goatgodskipping       there passes in the thin moonlight the goatgood pan and with a      long wail of the pipe the goatherd boy is silent  then the moon      fades and all is black till in the faint grisly light of the      false dawn creeping up seelchen is seen rising from the side of      the sleeping felsman  the goatherd boy has gone but by the      rock stands the shepherd of the cow horn in his dock  seelchen  years years i have slept  my spirit is hungry  then as she sees the shepherd of the cow horn standing there  i know thee nowlife of the earththe smell of thee the sight of thee the taste of thee and all thy music  i have passed thee and gone by she moves away  felsman  waking where wouldst thou go  seelchen  to the edge of the world  felsman  rising and trying to stay her  thou shalt not leave me       but against her smiling gesture he struggles as though against      solidity  seelchen  friend  the time is on me  felsman  were my kisses then too rude   was i too dull  seelchen  i do not regret       the youth of the wine horn is seen suddenly standing opposite      the motionless shepherd of the cow horn and his mandolin twangs      out  felsman  the cursed music of the town  is it back to him thou wilt go  groping for sight of the hated figure  i cannot see  seelchen fear not  i go ever onward  felsman  do not leave me to the wind in the rocks  without thee love is dead and i must die  seelchen  poor heart  i am gone  felsman  crouching against the rock  it is cold       at the blowing of the shepherds pipe the cow horn stretches      forth his hand to her  the mandolin twangs out and the wine      horn holds out his hand  she stands unmoving  seelchen companions  i must go in a moment it will be dawn       in silence the cow horn and the wine horn cover their faces      the false dawn dies  it falls quite dark     scene v       then a faint glow stealing up lights the snowy head of the      great horn and streams forth on seelchen  to either aide of      that path of light like shadows  the cow horn and the wine      horn stand with cloaked heads  seelchen  great one  i come       the peak of the great horn speaks in a faraway voice growing      with the light clearer and stronger            wandering flame thou restless fever           burning all things regretting none           the winds of fate are stilled for ever           thy little generous life is done           and all its wistful wonderings cease           thou traveller to the tideless sea           where light and dark and change and peace           are onecome little soul to mystery       seelchen falling on her knees bows her head to the ground  the      glow slowly fades till the scene is black     scene vi  then as the blackness lifts in the dim light of the false dawn filtering through the window of the mountain hut  lamond and felsman are seen standing beside seelchen looking down at her asleep on the window seat  felsman  putting out his hand to wake her  in a moment it will be dawn       she stirs and her lips move murmuring  lamond  let her sleep  shes dreaming       felsman raises a lantern till its light falls on her face      then the two men move stealthily towards the door and as she      speaks pass out  seelchen  rising to her knees and stretching out her hands with ecstasy  great one  i come  waking she looks around and struggles to her feet  my little dream       through the open door the first flush of dawn shows in the sky      there is a sound of goatbells passing    the curtain falls       justice    persons

doors leads to the outer office which is only divided from the      managing clerks room by a   partition of wood and clear glass      and when the door into this outer office is opened there can be      seen the wide outer door leading out on to the stone stairway of      the building  the other of these two   centre doors leads to      the junior clerks room  the third door is that leading to the      partners room       the managing clerk cokeson is sitting at his table adding up      figures in a passbook and murmuring their numbers to himself      he is a man of sixty wearing spectacles

dignity of pose and gesture       sweedle goes out into the partners room with the passbook  cokeson  looking round at ruth  the young mans out suspiciously  state your business please  ruth  who speaks in a matteroffact voice and with a slight westcountry accent  its a personal matter sir  cokeson  we dont allow private callers here  will you leave a message  ruth  id rather see him please

what am i to do  cokeson  dear me  i cant tell you that       sweedle comes back  he crosses to the outer office and passes      through into it with a quizzical look at cokeson carefully      leaving the door an inch or two open  cokeson  fortified by this look  this wont do you know this wont do at all  suppose one of the partners came in       an incoherent knocking and chuckling is heard from the outer      door of the outer office  sweedle  putting his head in  theres some children outside here  ruth  theyre mine please  sweedle  shall i hold them in check  ruth  theyre quite small sir she takes a step towards cokeson  cokeson  you mustnt take up his time in office hours were a clerk short as it is  ruth  its a matter of life and death  cokeson  again outraged  life and death  sweedle  here is falder       falder has entered through the outer office  he is a pale      goodlooking young man with quick rather scared eyes  he      moves towards the door of the clerks office

head and is just settling down to write when      walter how comes in through the outer office  he is a rather      refinedlooking man of thirtyfive with a pleasant almost      apologetic voice

months salary than had this happen     he broods  james  i hope that fellow will hurry up  cokeson  keeping things pleasant for the cashier  it isnt fifty yards mr james  he wont be a minute  james  the idea of dishonesty about this office it hits me hard cokeson       he goes towards the door of the partners room  sweedle  entering quietly to cokeson in a low voice  shes popped up again

 cokeson  you dont want to upset the young man in there do you hes a nervous young feller  james  this must be thoroughly cleared up cokeson for the sake of falders name to say nothing of yours  cokeson  with some dignity thatll look after itself sir  hes been upset once this morning i dont want him startled again  james  its a matter of form but i cant stand upon niceness over a thing like thistoo serious  just talk to mr cowley       he opens the door of falders room  james  bring in the papers in boulters lease will you falder  cokeson  bursting into voice  do you keep dogs       the cashier with his eyes fixed on the door does not answer  cokeson  you havent such a thing as a bulldog pup you could spare me i suppose       at the look on the cashiers face his jaw drops and he turns to      see falder standing in the doorway with his eyes fixed on      cowley like the eyes of a rabbit fastened on a snake  falder  advancing with the papers here they are sir  james  taking them thank you  falder  do you want me sir  james  no thanks       falder turns and goes back into his own room  as he shuts the      door james gives the cashier an interrogative look and the      cashier nods  james  sure  this isnt as we suspected  cowley  quite  he knew me  i suppose he cant slip out of that room  cokeson  gloomily  theres only the windowa whole floor and a basement       the door of falders room is quietly opened and falder with      his hat in his hand moves towards the door of the outer office  james  quietly  where are you going falder  falder  to have my lunch sir  james  wait a few minutes would you  i want to speak to you about this lease  falder  yes sir  he goes back into his room  cowley  if im wanted i can swear thats the young man who cashed the cheque  it was the last cheque i handled that morning before my lunch  these are the numbers of the notes he had  he puts a slip of paper on the table then brushing his hat round  goodmorning  james  goodmorning mr cowley  cowley  to cokeson  goodmorning  cokeson  with stupefaction  goodmorning       the cashier goes out through the outer office cokeson sits down      in his chair as though it were the only place left in the      morass of his feelings  walter  what are you going to do  james  have him in  give me the cheque and the counterfoil  cokeson  i dont understand  i thought young davis  james  we shall see  walter  one moment father have you thought it out  james  call him in  cokeson  rising with difficulty and opening falders door hoarsely  step in here a minute  falder  impassively  yes sir  james  turning to him suddenly with the cheque held out  you know this cheque falder  falder  no sir  jades  look at it  you cashed it last friday week  falder  oh yes sir that onedavis gave it me  james  i know and you gave davis the cash  falder  yes sir  james  when davis gave you the cheque was it exactly like this  falder  yes i think so sir  james  you know that mr walter drew that cheque for nine pounds  falder  no sirninety  james  nine falder  falder  faintly  i dont understand sir  james  the suggestion of course is that the cheque was altered whether by you or davis is the question  falder  ii  cokeson  take your time take your time  falder  regaining his impassivity  not by me sir  james  the cheque was handed tocokeson by mr walter at one oclock we know that because mr cokesons lunch had just arrived  cokeson  i couldnt leave it  james  exactly he therefore gave the cheque to davis  it was cashed by you at 115  we know that because the cashier recollects it for the last cheque he handled before his lunch  falder  yes sir davis gave it to me because some friends were giving him a farewell luncheon  james  puzzled you accuse davis then  falder  i dont know sirits very funny       walter who has come close to his father says something to him      in a low voice  james  davis was not here again after that saturday was he  cokeson  anxious to be of assistance to the young man and seeing faint signs of their all being jolly once more no he sailed on the monday  james  was he falder  falder  very faintly  no sir  james  very well then how do you account for the fact that this nought was added to the nine in the counterfoil on or after tuesday  cokeson  surprised  hows that       falder gives a sort of lurch he tries to pull himself together      but he has gone all to pieces  james  very grimly  out im afraid cokeson  the chequebook remained in mr walters pocket till he came back from trenton on tuesday morning  in the face of this falder do you still deny that you altered both cheque and counterfoil  falder  no sirno mr how  i did it sir i did it  cokeson  succumbing to his feelings  dear dear what a thing to do  falder  i wanted the money so badly sir  i didnt know what i was doing  cokeson  however such a thing could have come into your head  falder  grasping at the words  i cant think sir really  it was just a minute of madness  james  a long minute falder  tapping the counterfoil four days at least  falder  sir i swear i didnt know what id done till afterwards and then i hadnt the pluck  oh  sir look over it  ill pay the money backi will i promise  james  go into your room       falder with a swift imploring look goes back into his room      there is silence  james  about as bad a case as there could be  cokeson  to break the law like thatin here  walter  whats to be done  james  nothing for it  prosecute  walter  its his first offence  james  shaking his head  ive grave doubts of that  too neat a piece of swindling altogether  cokeson  i shouldnt be surprised if he was tempted  james  lifes one long temptation cokeson  cokeson  yees but im speaking of the flesh and the devil mr james  there was a woman come to see him this morning  walter  the woman we passed as we came in just now  is it his wife  cokeson  no no relation  restraining what in jollier circumstances would have been a wink  a married person though  walter  how do you know  cokeson  brought her children  scandalised  there they were outside the office  james  a real bad egg  walter  i should like to give him a chance  james  i cant forgive him for the sneaky way he went to work counting on our suspecting young davis if the matter came to light it was the merest accident the chequebook stayed in your pocket  walter  it must have been the temptation of a moment  he hadnt time  james  a man doesnt succumb like that in a moment if hes a clean mind and habits  hes rotten got the eyes of a man who cant keep his hands off when theres money about  walter  dryly we hadnt noticed that before  james  brushing the remark aside ive seen lots of those fellows in my time  no doing anything with them except to keep em out of harms way  theyve got a blind spat  walter  its penal servitude  cokeson  theyre nahsty placesprisons  james  hesitating i dont see how its possible to spare him  out of the question to keep him in this officehonestys the sine qua non  cokeson  hypnotised of course it is  james  equally out of the question to send him out amongst people whove no knowledge of his character  one must think of society  walter  but to brand him like this  james  if it had been a straightforward case id give him another chance  its far from that  he has dissolute habits  cokeson  i didnt say thatextenuating circumstances  james  same thing  hes gone to work in the most coldblooded way to defraud his employers and cast the blame on an innocent man  if thats not a case for the law to take its course i dont know what is  walter  for the sake of his future though  james  sarcastically  according to you no one would ever prosecute  walter  nettled  i hate the idea of it  cokeson  thats rather ex parte mr walter  we must have protection  james  this is degenerating into talk       he moves towards the partners room  walter  put yourself in his place father  james  you ask too much of me  walter  we cant possibly tell the pressure there was on him  james  you may depend on it my boy if a man is going to do this sort of thing hell do it pressure or no pressure if he isnt nothingll make him  walter  hell never do it again  cokeson  fatuously spose i were to have a talk with him  we dont want to be hard on the young man  james  thatll do cokeson  ive made up my mind  he passes into the partners room  cokeson  after a doubtful moment  we must excuse your father  i dont want to go against your father if he thinks it right  walter  confound it cokeson why dont you back me up  you know you feel  cokeson  on his dignity  i really cant say what i feel  walter  we shall regret it  cokeson  he must have known what he was doing  walter  bitterly  the quality of mercy is not strained  cokeson  looking at him askance  come come mr walter  we must try and see it sensible  sweedle  entering with a tray your lunch sir  cokeson  put it down       while sweedle is putting it down on cokesons table the      detective wister enters the outer office and finding no one      there comes to the inner doorway  he is a square mediumsized      man cleanshaved in a serviceable blue serge suit and strong      boots  cokeson  hoarsely  here  here  what are we doing  wister  to walter  from scotland yard sir  detectivesergeant blister  walter  askance very well  ill speak to my father       he goes into the partners room  james enters  james  morning  in answer to an appealing gesture from cokeson im sorry id stop short of this if i felt i could  open that door sweedle wondering and scared opens it come here mr falder       as falder comes shrinkingly out the detective in obedience to a      sign from james slips his hand out and grasps his arm  falder  recoiling oh nooh no  walter  come come theres a good lad  james  i charge him with felony  falter  oh sir  theres some onei did it for her  let me be till tomorrow       james motions with his hand  at that sign of hardness falder      becomes rigid  then turning he goes out quietly in the      detectives grip  james follows stiff and erect  sweedle      rushing to the door with open mouth pursues them through the      outer office into the corridor  when they have all disappeared      cokeson spins completely round and makes a rush for the outer      office  cokeson hoarsely here  what are we doing       there is silence  he takes out his handkerchief and mops the      sweat from his face  going back blindly to his table sits      down and stares blankly at his lunch                            the curtain falls      act ii  a court of justice on a foggy october afternoon crowded with barristers solicitors reporters ushers and jurymen  sitting in the large solid dock is falder with a warder on either side of him placed there for his safe custody but seemingly indifferent to and unconscious of his presence  falder is sitting exactly opposite to the judge who raised above the clamour of the court also seems unconscious of and indifferent to everything  harold cleaver the counsel for the crown is a dried yellowish man of more than middle age in a wig worn almost to the colour of his face  hector frome the counsel for the defence is a young tall man clean shaved in a very white wig  among the spectators  having already given their evidence are james and walter how and cowley the cashier  wister the detective is just leaving the witnessbox  cleaver  that is the case for the crown me lud       gathering his robes together he sits down  frome  rising and bowing to the judge if it please your lordship and gentlemen of the jury  i am not going to dispute the fact that the prisoner altered this cheque but i am going to put before you evidence as to the condition of his mind and to submit that you would not be justified in finding that he was responsible for his actions at the time  i am going to show you in fact that he did this in a moment of aberration amounting to temporary insanity caused by the violent distress under which he was labouring gentlemen the prisoner is only twentythree years old  i shall call before you a woman from whom you will learn the events that led up to this act  you will hear from her own lips the tragic circumstances of her life the still more tragic infatuation with which she has inspired the prisoner  this woman gentlemen has been leading a miserable existence with a husband who habitually illuses her from whom she actually goes in terror of her life  i am not of course saying that its either right or desirable for a young man to fall in love with a married woman or that its his business to rescue her from an ogrelike husband  im not saying anything of the sort  but we all know the power of the passion of love and i would ask you to remember gentlemen in listening to her evidence that married to a drunken and violent husband she has no power to get rid of him for as you know another offence besides violence is necessary to enable a woman to obtain a divorce and of this offence it does not appear that her husband is guilty  judge  is this relevant mr frome  frome  my lord i submit extremelyi shall be able to show your lordship that directly  judge  very well  frome  in these circumstances what alternatives were left to her she could either go on living with this drunkard in terror of her life or she could apply to the court for a separation order  well gentlemen my experience of such cases assures me that this would have given her very insufficient protection from the violence of such a man and even if effectual would very likely have reduced her either to the workhouse or the streetsfor its not easy as she is now finding for an unskilled woman without means of livelihood to support herself and her children without resorting either to the poor law orto speak quite plainlyto the sale of her body  judge  you are ranging rather far mr frome  frome  i shall fire pointblank in a minute my lord  judge  let us hope so  frome  now gentlemen markand this is what i have been leading up tothis woman will tell you and the prisoner will confirm her that confronted with such alternatives she set her whole hopes on himself knowing the feeling with which she had inspired him  she saw a way out of her misery by going with him to a new country where they would both be unknown and might pass as husband and wife  this was a desperate and as my friend mr cleaver will no doubt call it an immoral resolution but as a fact the minds of both of them were constantly turned towards it  one wrong is no excuse for another and those who are never likely to be faced by such a situation possibly have the right to hold up their handsas to that i prefer to say nothing  but whatever view you take gentlemen of this part of the prisoners storywhatever opinion you form of the right of these two young people under such circumstances to take the law into their own handsthe fact remains that this young woman in her distress and this young man little more than a boy who was so devotedly attached to her did conceive thisif you like reprehensible design of going away together  now for that of course they required money andthey had none  as to the actual events of the morning of july 7th on which this cheque was altered the events on which i rely to prove the defendants irresponsibility i shall allow those events to speak for themselves through the lips of my witness  robert cokeson  he turns looks round takes up a sheet of paper and waits       cokeson is summoned into court and goes into the witnessbox      holding his hat before him  the oath is administered to him  frome  what is your name  cokeson  robert cokeson  frome  are you managing clerk to the firm of solicitors who employ the prisoner  cokeson  yees  frome  how long had the prisoner been in their employ  cokeson  two years  no im wrong thereall but seventeen days  frome  had you him under your eye all that time  cokeson  except sundays and holidays  frome  quite so  let us hear please what you have to say about his general character during those two years  cokeson  confidentially to the jury and as if a little surprised at being asked  he was a nice pleasantspoken young man  id no fault to find with himquite the contrary  it was a great surprise to me when he did a thing like that  frome  did he ever give you reason to suspect his honesty  cokeson  no  to have dishonesty in our office thatd never do  frome  im sure the jury fully appreciate that mr cokeson  cokeson  every man of business knows that honestys the sign qua non  frome  do you give him a good character all round or do you not  cokeson  turning to the judge  certainly  we were all very jolly and pleasant together until this happened  quite upset me  frome  now coming to the morning of the 7th of july the morning on which the cheque was altered  what have you to say about his demeanour that morning  cokeson  to the jury  if you ask me i dont think he was quite compos when he did it  the judge  sharply  are you suggesting that he was insane  cokeson  not compos  the judge  a little more precision please  frome  smoothly  just tell us mr cokeson  cokeson  somewhat outraged  well in my opinionlooking at the judgesuch as it ishe was jumpy at the time  the jury will understand my meaning  frome  will you tell us how you came to that conclusion  cokeson  yees i will  i have my lunch in from the restaurant a chop and a potatosaves time  that day it happened to come just as mr walter how handed me the cheque  well i like it hot so i went into the clerks office and i handed the cheque to davis the other clerk and told him to get change  i noticed young falder walking up and down  i said to him this is not the zoological gardens falder  frome  do you remember what he answered  cokeson  yees i wish to god it were  struck me as funny  frome  did you notice anything else peculiar  cokeson  i did  frome  what was that  cokeson  his collar was unbuttoned  now i like a young man to be neat  i said to him your collars unbuttoned  frome  and what did he answer  cokeson  stared at me  it wasnt nice  the judge  stared at you  isnt that a very common practice  cokeson  yees but it was the look in his eyes  i cant explain my meaningit was funny  frome  had you ever seen such a look in his eyes before  cokeson  no  if i had i should have spoken to the partners  we cant have anything eccentric in our profession  the judge  did you speak to them on that occasion  cokeson  confidentially  well i didnt like to trouble them about prime facey evidence  frome  but it made a very distinct impression on your mind  cokeson  yees  the clerk davis could have told you the same  frome  quite so  its very unfortunate that weve not got him here now can you tell me of the morning on which the discovery of the forgery was made  that would be the 18th  did anything happen that morning  cokeson  with his hand to his ear  im a little deaf  frome  was there anything in the course of that morningi mean before the discoverythat caught your attention  cokeson  yeesa woman  the judge  how is this relevant mr frome  frome  i am trying to establish the state of mind in which the prisoner committed this act my lord  the judge  i quite appreciate that  but this was long after the act  frome  yes my lord but it contributes to my contention  the judge  well  frome  you say a woman  do you mean that she came to the office  cokeson  yees  frome  what for  cokeson  asked to see young falder he was out at the moment  frome  did you see her  cokeson  i did  frome  did she come alone  cokeson  confidentially  well there you put me in a difficulty i mustnt tell you what the officeboy told me  frome  quite so mr cokeson quite so  cokeson  breaking in with an air of you are youngleave it to me  but i think we can get round it  in answer to a question put to her by a third party the woman said to me theyre mine sir  the judge  what are  what were  cokeson  her children  they were outside  the judge  how do you know  cokeson  your lordship mustnt ask me that or i shall have to tell you what i was toldand thatd never do  the judge  smiling  the officeboy made a statement  cokeson  eggzactly  frome  what i want to ask you mr cokeson is this  in the course of her appeal to see falder did the woman say anything that you specially remember  cokeson  looking at him as if to encourage him to complete the sentence  a leetle more sir  frome  or did she not  cokeson  she did  i shouldnt like you to have led me to the answer  frome  with an irritated smile  will you tell the jury what it was  cokeson  its a matter of life and death  foreman of the jury  do you mean the woman said that  cokeson  nodding  its not the sort of thing you like to have said to you  frome  a little impatiently  did falder come in while she was there  cokeson nods  and she saw him and went away  cokeson  ah  there i cant follow you  i didnt see her go  frome  well is she there now  cokeson  with an indulgent smile  no  frome  thank you mr cokeson  he sits down  cleaver  rising you say that on the morning of the forgery the prisoner was jumpy  well now sir what precisely do you mean by that word  cokeson  indulgently  i want you to understand  have you ever seen a dog thats lost its master  he was kind of everywhere at once with his eyes  cleaver  thank you i was coming to his eyes  you called them funny  what are we to understand by that  strange or what  cokeson  yees funny  cokeson  sharply  yes sir but what may be funny to you may not be funny to me or to the jury  did they look frightened or shy or fierce or what  cokeson  you make it very hard for me  i give you the word and you want me to give you another  cleaver  rapping his desk does funny mean mad  cleaver  not mad fun  cleaver  very well  now you say he had his collar unbuttoned  was it a hot day  cokeson  yees i think it was  cleaver  and did he button it when you called his attention to it  cokeson  yees i think he did  cleaver  would you say that that denoted insanity       he sits downs  cokeson who has opened his mouth to reply is      left gaping  frome  rising hastily have you ever caught him in that dishevelled state before  cokeson  no  he was always clean and quiet  frome  that will do thank you       cokeson turns blandly to the judge as though to rebuke counsel      for not remembering that the judge might wish to have a chance      arriving at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing      further he turns and descends from the box and sits down next      to james and walter  frome  ruth honeywill       ruth comes into court and takes her stand stoically in the      witnessbox  she is sworn  frome  what is your name please  ruth  ruth honeywill  frome  how old are you  ruth  twentysix  frome  you are a married woman living with your husband  a little louder  ruth  no sir not since july  frome  have you any children  ruth

about  frome  did he illtreat you or what  ruth  ever since my first was born  frome  in what way  ruth  id rather not say  all sorts of ways  the judge  i am afraid i must stop this you know  ruth  pointing to falder  he offered to take me out of it sir we were going to south america  frome  hastily  yes quiteand what prevented you  ruth  i was outside his office when he was taken away  it nearly broke my heart  frome  you knew then that he had been arrested  ruth  yes sir  i called at his office afterwards and  pointing to cokeson that gentleman told me all about it  frome  now do you remember the morning of friday july 7th  ruth  yes  frome  why  ruth  my husband nearly strangled me that morning  the judge  nearly strangled you  ruth  bowing her head yes my lord  frome  with his hands or  ruth  yes i just managed to get away from him  i went straight to my friend  it was eight oclock  the judge  in the morning  your husband was not under the influence of liquor then  ruth  it

you or do you not think that your danger and unhappiness would seriously affect his balance his control over his actions  ruth  yes  frome  his reason even  ruth  for a moment like i think it would  frome  was he very much upset that friday morning or was he fairly calm  ruth  dreadfully upset  i could hardly bear to let him go from me  frome  do you still love him  ruth  with her eyes on falder  hes ruined himself for me  frome  thank you       he sits down  ruth remains stoically upright in the witnessbox  cleaver  in a considerate voice  when you left him on the morning of friday the 7th you would not say that he was out of his mind i suppose  ruth  no sir  cleaver  thank you ive no further questions to ask you  ruth  bending a little forward to the jury  i would have done the same for him i would indeed  the judge  please please  you say your married life is an unhappy one  faults on both sides  ruth  only that i never bowed down to him  i dont see why i should sir not to a man like that  the judge  you refused to obey him  ruth  avoiding the question  ive always studied him to keep things nice  the judge  until you met the prisonerwas that it  ruth  no even after that  the judge  i ask you know because you seem to me to glory in this affection of yours for the prisoner  ruth  hesitating  ii do  its the only thing in my life now  the judge  staring at her hard well step

and is duly      sworn  frome  what is your name  falder  william falder  frome  and age  falder  twentythree  frome  you are not married       falder shakes his head  frome  how long have you known the last witness  falder  six months  frome  is her account of the relationship between you a correct one  falder  yes  frome  you became devotedly attached to her however  falder  yes  the judge  though you knew she was a married woman  falder  i couldnt help it your lordship  the judge  couldnt help it  falder  i didnt seem able to       the judge slightly shrugs his shoulders  frome  how did you come to know her  falder  through my married sister  frome  did you know whether she was happy with her husband  falder  it was trouble all the time  frome  you knew her husband  falder  only through herhes a brute  the judge  i cant allow indiscriminate abuse of a person not present  frome  bowing  if your lordship pleases  to falder  you admit altering this cheque  falder bows his head  frome  carry your mind please to the morning of friday july the 7th and tell the jury what happened  falder  turning to the jury  i was having my breakfast when she came  her dress was all torn and she was gasping and couldnt seem to get her breath at all there were the marks of his fingers round her throat her arm was bruised and the blood had got into her eyes dreadfully  it frightened me and then when she told me i felti feltwellit was too much for me  hardening suddenly  if youd seen it having the feelings for her that i had youd have felt the same i know  frome  yes  falder  when she left mebecause i had to go to the officei was out of my senses for fear that hed do it again and thinking what i could do  i couldnt workall the morning i was like thatsimply couldnt fix my mind on anything  i couldnt think at all  i seemed to have to keep moving  when davisthe other clerkgave me the chequehe said itll do you good will to have a run with this you seem half off your chump this morning  then when i had it in my handi dont know how it came but it just flashed across me that if i put the ty and the nought there would be the money to get her away  it just came and wenti never thought of it again  then davis went out to his luncheon and i dont really remember what i did till id pushed the cheque through to the cashier under the rail i remember his saying gold or notes  then i suppose i knew what id done  anyway when i got outside i wanted to chuck myself under a bus i wanted to throw the money away but it seemed i was in for it so i thought at any rate id save her  of course the tickets i took for the passage and the little i gave hers been wasted and all except what i was obliged to spend myself ive restored  i keep thinking over and over however it was i came to do it and how i cant have it all again to do differently       falder is silent twisting his hands before him  frome  how far is it from your office to the bank  falder  not more than fifty yards sir  frome  from the time davis went out to lunch to the time you cashed the cheque how long do you say it must have been  falder  it couldnt have been four minutes sir because i ran all the way  frome  during those four minutes you say you remember nothing  falder  no sir only that i ran  frome  not even adding the ty and the nought  falder  no sir  i dont really       frome sits down and cleaver rises  cleaver  but you remember running do you  falder  i was all out of breath when i got to the bank  cleaver  and you dont remember altering the cheque  falder  faintly  no sir  cleaver  divested of the romantic glamour which my friend is casting over the case is this anything but an ordinary forgery  come  falder  i was half frantic all that morning sir  cleaver  now now  you dont deny that the ty and the nought were so like the rest of the handwriting as to thoroughly deceive the cashier  falder  it was an accident  cleaver  cheerfully  queer sort of accident wasnt it  on which day did you alter the counterfoil  falder  hanging his head  on the wednesday morning  cleaver  was that an accident too  falder  faintly  no  cleaver  to do that you had to watch your opportunity i suppose  falder  almost inaudibly yes  cleaver  you dont suggest that you were suffering under great excitement when you did that  falder  i was haunted  cleaver  with the fear of being found out  falder  very low yes  the judge  didnt it occur to you that the only thing for you to do was to confess to your employers and restore the money  falder  i was afraid there is silence  cleaver  you desired too no doubt to complete your design of taking this woman away  falder  when i found id done a thing like that to do it for nothing seemed so dreadful  i might just as well have chucked myself into the river  cleaver  you knew that the clerk davis was about to leave england didnt it occur to you when you altered this cheque that suspicion would fall on him  falder  it was all done in a moment  i thought of it afterwards  cleaver  and that didnt lead you to avow what youd done  falder  sullenly  i meant to write when i got out therei would have repaid the money  the judge  but in the meantime your innocent fellow clerk might have been prosecuted  falder  i knew he was a long way off your lordship  i thought thered be time  i didnt think theyd find it out so soon  frome  i might remind your lordship that as mr walter how had the chequebook in his pocket till after davis had sailed if the discovery had been made only one day later falder himself would have left and suspicion would have attached to him and not to davis from the beginning  the judge  the question is whether the prisoner knew that suspicion would light on himself and not on davis  to falder sharply did you know that mr walter how had the chequebook till after davis had sailed  falder  iithoughthe  the judge  now speak the truthyes or no  falder  very low  no my lord  i had no means of knowing  the judge  that disposes of your point mr frome       frome bows to the judge  cleaver  has any aberration of this nature ever attacked you before  falder  faintly  no sir  cleaver  you had recovered sufficiently to go back to your work that afternoon  falder  yes i had to take the money back  cleaver  you mean the nine pounds  your wits were sufficiently keen for you to remember that  and you still persist in saying you dont remember altering this cheque  he sits down  falder  if i hadnt been mad i should never have had the courage  frome  rising  did you have your lunch before going back  falder  i never ate a thing all day and at night i couldnt sleep  frome  now as to the four minutes that elapsed between daviss going out and your cashing the cheque do you say that you recollect nothing during those four minutes  falder  after a moment i remember thinking of mr cokesons face  frome  of mr cokesons face  had that any connection with what you were doing  falder  no sir  frome  was that in the office before you ran out  falder  yes and while i was running  frome  and that lasted till the cashier said will you have gold or notes  falder  yes and then i seemed to come to myselfand it was too late  frome  thank you  that closes the evidence for the defence my lord       the judge nods and falder goes back to his seat in the dock  frome  gathering up notes  if it please your lordshipgentlemen of the jurymy friend in crossexamination has shown a disposition to sneer at the defence which has been set up in this case and i am free to admit that nothing i can say will move you if the evidence has not already convinced you that the prisoner committed this act in a moment when to all practical intents and purposes he was not responsible for his actions a moment of such mental and moral vacuity arising from the violent emotional agitation under which he had been suffering as to amount to temporary madness  my friend has alluded to the romantic glamour with which i have sought to invest this case  gentlemen i have done nothing of the kind  i have merely shown you the background of lifethat palpitating life which believe mewhatever my friend may sayalways lies behind the commission of a crime  now gentlemen we live in a highly civilized age and the sight of brutal violence disturbs us in a very strange way even when we have no personal interest in the matter  but when we see it inflicted on a woman whom we lovewhat then  just think of what your own feelings would have been each of you at the prisoners age and then look at him  well  he is hardly the comfortable shall we say bucolic person likely to contemplate with equanimity marks of gross violence on a woman to whom he was devotedly attached  yes gentlemen look at him  he has not a strong face but neither has he a vicious face  he is just the sort of man who would easily become the prey of his emotions  you have heard the description of his eyes  my friend may laugh at the word funnyi think it better describes the peculiar uncanny look of those who are strained to breakingpoint than any other word which could have been used  i dont pretend mind you that his mental irresponsibilitywas more than a flash of darkness in which all sense of proportion became lost but to contend that just as a man who destroys himself at such a moment may be and often is absolved from the stigma attaching to the crime of selfmurder so he may and frequently does commit other crimes while in this irresponsible condition and that he may as justly be acquitted of criminal intent and treated as a patient  i admit that this is a plea which might well be abused  it is a matter for discretion  but here you have a case in which there is every reason to give the benefit of the doubt you heard me ask the prisoner what he thought of during those four fatal minutes  what was his answer  i thought of mr cokesons face  gentlemen no man could invent an answer like that it is absolutely stamped with truth  you have seen the great affection legitimate or not existing between him and this woman who came here to give evidence for him at the risk of her life  it is impossible for you to doubt his distress on the morning when he committed this act  we well know what terrible havoc such distress can make in weak and highly nervous people  it was all the work of a moment  the rest has followed as death follows a stab to the heart or water drops if you hold up a jug to empty it  believe me gentlemen there is nothing more tragic in life than the utter impossibility of changing what you have done  once this cheque was altered and presented the work of four minutesfour mad minutes the rest has been silence  but in those four minutes the boy before you has slipped through a door hardly opened into that great cage which never again quite lets a man gothe cage of the law  his further acts his failure to confess the alteration of the counterfoil his preparations for flight are all evidencenot of deliberate and guilty intention when he committed the prime act from which these subsequent acts arose nothey are merely evidence of the weak character which is clearly enough his misfortune  but is a man to be lost because he is bred and born with a weak character gentlemen men like the prisoner are destroyed daily under our law for want of that human insight which sees them as they are patients and not criminals  if the prisoner be found guilty and treated as though he were a criminal type he will as all experience shows in all probability become one  i beg you not to return a verdict that may thrust him back into prison and brand him for ever  gentlemen justice is a machine that when some one has once given it the starting push rolls on of itself  is this young man to be ground to pieces under this machine for an act which at the worst was one of weakness  is he to become a member of the luckless crews that man those dark illstarred ships called prisons  is that to be his voyagefrom which so few return  or is he to have another chance to be still looked on as one who has gone a little astray but who will come back  i urge you gentlemen do not ruin this young man  for as a result of those four minutes ruin utter and irretrievable stares him in the face  he can be saved now  imprison him as a criminal and i affirm to you that he will be lost  he has neither the face nor the manner of one who can survive that terrible ordeal weigh in the scales his criminality and the suffering he has undergone  the latter is ten times heavier already  he has lain in prison under this charge for more than two months  is he likely ever to forget that  imagine the anguish of his mind during that time he has had his punishment gentlemen you may depend  the rolling of the chariotwheels of justice over this boy began when it was decided to prosecute him  we are now already at the second stage  if you permit it to go on to the third i would not givethat for him       he holds up finger and thumb in the form of a circle drops his      hand and sits dozen  the jury stir and consult each others faces then they turn towards the counsel for the crown who rises and fixing his eyes on a spot that seems to give him satisfaction slides them every now and then towards the jury  cleaver  may it please your lordshiprising on his toes gentlemen of the jurythe facts in this case are not disputed and the defence if my friend will allow me to say so is so thin that i dont propose to waste the time of the court by taking you over the evidence  the plea is one of temporary insanity  well gentlemen i daresay it is clearer to me than it is to you why this ratherwhat shall we call itbizarre defence has been set up  the alternative would have been to plead guilty  now gentlemen if the prisoner had pleaded guilty my friend would have had to rely on a simple appeal to his lordship  instead of that he has gone into the byways and hedges and found thiserpeculiar plea which has enabled him to show you the proverbial woman to put her in the boxto give in fact a romantic glow to this affair  i compliment my friend i think it highly ingenious of him  by these means he hasto a certain extentgot round the law  he has brought the whole story of motive and stress out in court at first hand in a way that he would not otherwise have been able to do  but when you have once grasped that fact gentlemen you have grasped everything  with goodhumoured contempt  for look at this plea of insanity we cant put it lower than that  you have heard the woman  she has every reason to favour the prisoner but what did she say  she said that the prisoner was not insane when she left him in the morning  if he were going out of his mind through distress that was obviously the moment when insanity would have shown itself  you have heard the managing clerk another witness for the defence  with some difficulty i elicited from him the admission that the prisoner though jumpy a word that he seemed to think you would understand gentlemen and im sure i hope you do was not mad when the cheque was handed to davis  i agree with my friend that its unfortunate that we have not got davis here but the prisoner has told you the words with which davis in turn handed him the cheque he obviously therefore was not mad when he received it or he would not have remembered those words  the cashier has told you that he was certainly in his senses when he cashed it  we have therefore the plea that a man who is sane at ten minutes past one and sane at fifteen minutes past may for the purposes of avoiding the consequences of a crime call himself insane between those points of time  really gentlemen this is so peculiar a proposition that i am not disposed to weary you with further argument  you will form your own opinion of its value  my friend has adopted this way of saying a great deal to youand very eloquentlyon the score of youth temptation and the like  i might point out however that the offence with which the prisoner is charged is one of the most serious known to our law and there are certain features in this case such as the suspicion which he allowed to rest on his innocent fellowclerk and his relations with this married woman which will render it difficult for you to attach too much importance to such pleading i ask you in short gentlemen for that verdict of guilty which in the circumstances i regard you as unfortunately bound to record       letting his eyes travel from the judge and the jury to frome he      sits down  the judge  bending a little towards the jury and speaking in a businesslike voice  gentlemen you have heard the evidence and the comments on it  my only business is to make clear to you the issues you have to try  the facts are admitted so far as the alteration of this cheque and counterfoil by the prisoner  the defence set up is that he was not in a responsible condition when he committed the crime  well you have heard the prisoners story and the evidence of the other witnessesso far as it bears on the point of insanity if you think that what you have heard establishes the fact that the prisoner was insane at the time of the forgery you will find him guilty but insane  if on the other hand you conclude from what you have seen and heard that the prisoner was saneand nothing short of insanity will countyou will find him guilty  in reviewing the testimony as to his mental condition you must bear in mind very carefully the evidence as to his demeanour and conduct both before and after the act of forgerythe evidence of the prisoner himself of the woman of the witnessercokeson anderof the cashier and in regard to that i especially direct your attention to the prisoners admission that the idea of adding the ty and the nought did come into his mind at the moment when the cheque was handed to him and also to the alteration of the counterfoil and to his subsequent conduct generally  the bearing of all this on the question of premeditation and premeditation will imply sanity is very obvious  you must not allow any considerations of age or temptation to weigh with you in the finding of your verdict  before you can come to a verdict of guilty but insane you must be well and thoroughly convinced that the condition of his mind was such as would have qualified him at the moment for a lunatic asylum  he pauses then seeing that the jury are doubtful whether to retire or no adds you may retire gentlemen if you wish to do so       the jury retire by a door behind the judge  the judge bends      over his notes  falder leaning from the dock speaks excitedly      to his solicitor pointing dawn at ruth  the solicitor in turn      speaks to frome  frome  rising my lord  the prisoner is very anxious that i should ask you if your lordship would kindly request the reporters not to disclose the name of the woman witness in the press reports of these proceedings  your lordship will understand that the consequences might be extremely serious to her  the judge  pointedlywith the suspicion of a smile  well mr frome you deliberately took this course which involved bringing her here  frome with an ironic bow  if your lordship thinks i could have brought out the full facts in any other way  the judge  hm  well  frome  there is very real danger to her your lordship  the judge  you see i have to take your word for all that  frome  if your lordship would be so kind  i can assure your lordship that i am not exaggerating  the judge  it goes very much against the grain with me that the name of a witness should ever be suppressed  with a glance at falder who is gripping and clasping his hands before him and then at ruth who is sitting perfectly rigid with her eyes fixed on falder  ill consider your application  it must depend  i have to remember that she may have come here to commit perjury on the prisoners behalf  frome  your lordship i really  the judge  yes yesi dont suggest anything of the sort mr frome  leave it at that for the moment       as he finishes speaking the jury return and file back into the      box  clerk of assize  gentlemen are you agreed on your verdict  foreman  we are  clerk of assize  is it guilty or guilty but insane  foreman  guilty       the judge nods then gathering up his notes sits looking at      falder who stands motionless  frome  rising if your lordship would allow me to address you in mitigation of sentence  i dont know if your lordship thinks i can add anything to what i have said to the jury on the score of the prisoners youth and the great stress under which he acted  the judge  i dont think you can mr frome  frome  if your lordship says soi do most earnestly beg your lordship to give the utmost weight to my plea  he sits down  the judge  to the clerk call upon him  the clerk  prisoner at the bar you stand convicted of felony  have you anything to say for yourself why the court should not give you judgment according to law  falder shakes his head  the judge  william falder you have been given fair trial and found guilty in my opinion rightly found guilty of forgery  he pauses then consulting his notes goes on  the defence was set up that you were not responsible for your actions at the moment of committing this crime  there is no doubt i think that this was a device to bring out at first hand the nature of the temptation to which you succumbed  for throughout the trial your counsel was in reality making an appeal for mercy  the setting up of this defence of course enabled him to put in some evidence that might weigh in that direction  whether he was well advised to so is another matter  he claimed that you should be treated rather as a patient than as a criminal  and this plea of his which in the end amounted to a passionate appeal he based in effect on an indictment of the march of justice which he practically accused of confirming and completing the process of criminality  now in considering how far i should allow weight to his appeal i have a number of factors to take into account  i have to consider on the one hand the grave nature of your offence the deliberate way in which you subsequently altered the counterfoil the danger you caused to an innocent manand that to my mind is a very grave pointand finally i have to consider the necessity of deterring others from following your example  on the other hand i have to bear in mind that you are young that you have hitherto borne a good character that you were if i am to believe your evidence and that of your witnesses in a state of some emotional excitement when you committed this crime  i have every wish consistently with my dutynot only to you but to the communityto treat you with leniency  and this brings me to what are the determining factors in my mind in my consideration of your case  you are a clerk in a lawyers officethat is a very serious element in this case there can be no possible excuse made for you on the ground that you were not fully conversant with the nature of the crime you were committing and the penalties that attach to it  it is said however that you were carried away by your emotions  the story has been told here today of your relations with thisermrs honeywill on that story both the defence and the plea for mercy were in effect based  now what is that story  it is that you a young man and she a young woman unhappily married had formed an attachment which you both saywith what truth i am unable to gauge had not yet resulted in immoral relations but which you both admit was about to result in such relationship  your counsel has made an attempt to palliate this on the ground that the woman is in what he describes i think as a hopeless position  as to that i can express no opinion  she is a married woman and the fact is patent that you committed this crime with the view of furthering an immoral design  now however i might wish i am not able to justify to my conscience a plea for mercy which has a basis inimical to morality it is vitiated ab initio and would if successful free you for the completion of this immoral project  your counsel has made an attempt to trace your offence back to what he seems to suggest is a defect in the marriage law he has made an attempt also to show that to punish you with further imprisonment would be unjust  i do not follow him in these flights  the law is what it isa majestic edifice sheltering all of us each stone of which rests on another i am concerned only with its administration  the crime you have committed is a very serious one  i cannot feel it in accordance with my duty to society to exercise the powers i have in your favour  you will go to penal servitude for three years       falder who throughout the judges speech has looked at him      steadily lets his head fall forward on his breast  ruth starts      up from her seat as he is taken out by the warders  there is a      bustle in court  the judge  speaking to the reporters gentlemen of the press i think that the name of the female witness should not be reported       the reporters bow their acquiescence  the judge  to ruth who      is staring in the direction in which falder has disappeared do      you understand your name will not be mentioned  cokeson  pulling her sleeve  the judge is speaking to you       ruth turns stares at the judge and turns away  the judge  i shall sit rather late today  call the next case  clerk of assize  to a warder  put up john booley       to cries of witnesses in the case of booley                       the curtain falls     act iii  scene i       a prison  a plainly furnished room with two large barred      windows overlooking the prisoners exercise yard where men in      yellow clothes marked with arrows and yellow brimless caps are      seen in single file at a distance of four yards from each other      walking rapidly on serpentine white lines marked on the concrete      floor of the yard  two warders in blue uniforms with peaked      caps and swords are stationed amongst them  the room has      distempered walls a bookcase with numerous officiallooking      books a cupboard between the windows a plan of the prison on      the wall a writingtable covered with documents  it is      christmas eve       the governor a neat gravelooking man with a trim fair      moustache the eyes of a theorist and grizzled hair receding      from the temples is standing close to this writingtable      looking at a sort of rough saw made out of a piece of metal      the hand in which he holds it is gloved for two fingers      are missing  the chief warder wooder a tall thin      militarylooking man of sixty with grey moustache and      melancholy monkeylike eyes stands very upright two paces      from him  the governor  with a faint abstracted smile  queerlooking affair mr wooder  where did you find it  wooder  in his mattress sir  havent come across such a thing for two years now  the governor  with curiosity had he any set plan  wooder  hed sawed his windowbar about that much  he holds up his thumb and finger a quarter of an inch apart  the governor  ill see him this afternoon  whats his name moaney  an old hand i think  wooder  yes sirfourth spell of penal  youd think an old lag like him would have had more sense by now  with pitying contempt occupied his mind he said  breaking in and breaking outthats all they think about  the governor  whos next him  wooder  ocleary sir  the governor  the irishman  wooder  next him again theres that young fellow falderstar classand next him old clipton  the governor  ah yes  the philosopher  i want to see him about his eyes  wooder  curious thing sir they seem to know when theres one of these tries at escape going on  it makes them restivetheres a regular wave going through them just now  the governor  meditatively  odd thingsthose waves  turning to look at the prisoners exercising  seem quiet enough out here  wooder  that irishman ocleary began banging on his door this morning  little thing like thats quite enough to upset the whole lot  theyre just like dumb animals at times  the governor  ive seen it with horses before thunderitll run right through cavalry lines       the prison chaplain has entered  he is a darkhaired ascetic      man in clerical undress with a peculiarly steady tightlipped      face and slow cultured speech  the governor  holding up the saw  seen this miller  the chaplain  usefullooking specimen  the governor  do for the museum eh  he goes to the cupboard and opens it displaying to view a number of quaint ropes hooks and metal tools with labels tied on them  thatll do thanks mr wooder  wooder  saluting  thank you sir  he goes out  the governor  account for the state of the men last day or two miller  seems going through the whole place  the chaplain  no  i dont know of anything  the governor  by the way will you dine with us on christmas day  the chaplain  tomorrow  thanks very much  the governor  worries me to feel the men discontented  gazing at the saw  have to punish this poor devil  cant help liking a man who tries to escape  he places the saw in his pocket and locks the cupboard again  the chaplain  extraordinary perverted willpowersome of them nothing to be done till its broken  the governor  and not much afterwards im afraid  ground too hard for golf       wooder comes in again  wooder  visitor whos been seeing q 3007 asks to speak to you sir i told him it wasnt usual  the governor  what about  wooder  shall i put him off sir  the governor  resignedly  no no  lets see him  dont go miller  wooder motions to some one without and as the visitor comes in withdraws       the visitor is cokeson who is attired in a thick overcoat to      the knees woollen gloves and carries a top hat  cokeson  im sorry to trouble you  ive been talking to the young man  the governor  we have a good many here  cokeson  name of falder forgery  producing a card and handing it to the governor  firm of james and walter how  well known in the law  the governor  receiving the cardwith a faint smile  what do you want to see me about sir  cokeson  suddenly seeing the prisoners at exercise  why what a sight  the governor  yes we have that privilege from here my office is being done up  sitting down at his table  now please  cokeson  dragging his eyes with difficulty from the window i wanted to say a word to you i shant keep you long confidentially  fact is i oughtnt to be here by rights  his sister came to mehes got no father and motherand she was in some distress  my husband wont let me go and see him she said says hes disgraced the family  and his other sister she said is an invalid  and she asked me to come  well i take an interest in him  he was our juniori go to the same chapeland i didnt like to refuse  and what i wanted to tell you was he seems lonely here  the governor  not unnaturally  cokeson  im afraid itll prey on my mind  i see a lot of them about working together  the governor  those are local prisoners  the convicts serve their three months here in separate confinement sir  cokeson  but we dont want to be unreasonable  hes quite downhearted  i wanted to ask you to let him run about with the others  the governor  with faint amusement  ring the bellwould you miller  to cokeson  youd like to hear what the doctor says about him perhaps  the chaplain  ringing the bell  you are not accustomed to prisons it would seem sir  cokeson  no  but its a pitiful sight  hes quite a young fellow i said to him before a months up i said youll be out and about with the others itll be a nice change for you  a month he said like that  come i said we mustnt exaggerate  whats a month  why its nothing  a day he said shut up in your cell thinking and brooding as i do its longer than a year outside  i cant help it he said i trybut im built that way mr cokeson  and he held his hand up to his face  i could see the tears trickling through his fingers  it wasnt nice  the chaplain  hes a young man with large rather peculiar eyes isnt he  not church of england i think  cokeson  no  the chaplain  i know  the governor  to wooder who has come in  ask the doctor to be good enough to come here for a minute  wooder salutes and goes out  lets see hes not married  cokeson  no  confidentially  but theres a party hes very much attached to not altogether comilfa  its a sad story  the chaplain  if it wasnt for drink and women sir this prison might be closed  cokeson  looking at the chaplain over his spectacles yees but i wanted to tell you about that special  he had hopes theyd have let her come and see him but they havent  of course he asked me questions  i did my best but i couldnt tell the poor young fellow a lie with him in hereseemed like hitting him  but im afraid its made him worse  the governor  what was this news then  cokeson  like this  the woman had a nahsty spiteful feller for a husband and shed left him  fact is she was going away with our young friend  its not nicebut ive looked over it  well when he was put in here she said shed earn her living apart and wait for him to come out  that was a great consolation to him  but after a month she came to mei dont know her personallyand she said i cant earn the childrens living let alone my ownive got no friends  im obliged to keep out of everybodys way else my husbandd get to know where i was  im very much reduced she said and she has lost flesh  ill have to go in the workhouse its a painful story  i said to her no i said not that  ive got a wife an family but sooner than you should do that ill spare you a little myself  really she saidshes a nice creaturei dont like to take it from you  i think id better go back to my husband well i know hes a nahsty spiteful fellerdrinksbut i didnt like to persuade her not to  the chaplain  surely no  cokeson  yees but im sorry now its upset the poor young fellow dreadfully  and what i wanted to say was hes got his three years to serve  i want things to be pleasant for him  the chaplain  with a touch of impatience the law hardly shares your view im afraid  cokeson  but i cant help thinking that to shut him up there by himselfll turn him silly  and nobody wants that i spose  i dont like to see a man cry  the chaplain  its a very rare thing for them to give way like that  cokeson  looking at himin a tone of sudden dogged hostility i keep dogs  the chaplain  indeed  cokeson  yees  and i say this i wouldnt shut one of them up all by himself month after month not if hed bit me all over  the chaplain  unfortunately the criminal is not a dog he has a sense of right and wrong  cokeson  but thats not the way to make him feel it  the chaplain  ah  there im afraid we must differ  cokeson  its the same with dogs  if you treat em with kindness theyll do anything for you but to shut em up alone it only makes em savage  the chaplain  surely you should allow those who have had a little more experience than yourself to know what is best for prisoners  cokeson  doggedly  i know this young feller ive watched him for years  hes euroticgot no stamina  his father died of consumption  im thinking of his future  if hes to be kept there shut up by himself without a cat to keep him company itll do him harm  i said to him where do you feel it  i cant tell you mr cokeson he said but sometimes i could beat my head against the wall  its not nice       during this speech the doctor has entered  he is a      mediumsized rather goodlooking man with a quick eye      he stands leaning against the window  the governor  this gentleman thinks the separate is telling on q 3007falder young thin fellow star class  what do you say doctor clements  the doctor  he doesnt like it but its not doing him any harm  cokeson  but hes told me  the doctor  of course hed say so but we can always tell  hes lost no weight since hes been here  cokeson  its his state of mind im speaking of  the doctor  his minds all right so far  hes nervous rather melancholy  i dont see signs of anything more  im watching him carefully  cokeson  nonplussed  im glad to hear you say that  the chaplain  more suavely its just at this period that we are able to make some impression on them sir  i am speaking from my special standpoint  cokeson  turning bewildered to the governor i dont want to be unpleasant but having given him this news i do feel its awkward  the governor  ill make a point of seeing him today  cokeson  im much obliged to you  i thought perhaps seeing him every day you wouldnt notice it  the governor  rather sharply  if any sign of injury to his health shows itself his case will be reported at once  thats fully provided for  he rises  cokeson  following his own thoughts  of course what you dont see doesnt trouble you but having seen him i dont want to have him on my mind  the governor  i think you may safely leave it to us sir  cokeson  mollified and apologetic  i thought youd understand me im a plain mannever set myself up against authority  expanding to the chaplain  nothing personal meant  goodmorning       as he goes out the three officials do not look at each other      but their faces wear peculiar expressions  the chaplain  our friend seems to think that prison is a hospital  cokeson  returning suddenly with an apologetic air  theres just one little thing  this womani suppose i mustnt ask you to let him see her  itd be a rare treat for them both  hes thinking about her all the time  of course shes not his wife  but hes quite safe in here  theyre a pitiful couple  you couldnt make an exception  the governor  wearily as you say my dear sir i couldnt make an exception he wont be allowed another visit of any sort till he goes to a convict prison  cokeson  i see  rather coldly sorry to have troubled you he again goes out  the chaplain  shrugging his shoulders  the plain man indeed poor fellow  come and have some lunch clements        he and the doctor go out talking       the governor with a sigh sits down at his table and takes up a      pen                            the curtain falls     scene ii       part of the ground corridor of the prison  the walls are      coloured with greenish distemper up to a stripe of deeper green      about the height of a mans shoulder and above this line are      whitewashed  the floor is of blackened stones  daylight is      filtering through a heavily barred window at the end  the doors      of four cells are visible  each cell door has a little round      peephole at the level of a mans eye covered by a little round      disc which raised upwards affords a view o f the cell  on      the wall close to each cell door hangs a little square board      with the prisoners name number and record       overhead can be seen the iron structures of the firstfloor and      secondfloor corridors       the warder instructor a bearded man in blue uniform with an      apron and some dangling keys is just emerging from one of the      cells  instructor  speaking from the door into the cell  ill have another bit for you when thats finished  ocleary  unseenin an irish voice little doubt o that sirr  instructor  gossiping  well youd rather have it than nothing i spose  ocleary  an thats the blessed truth       sounds are heard of a cell door being closed and locked and of      approaching footsteps  instructor  in a sharp changed voice  look alive over it       he shuts the cell door and stands at attention       the governor comes walking down the corridor followed by      wooder  the governor  anything to report  instructor  saluting  q 3007  he points to a cell  is behind with his work sir  hell lose marks today       the governor nods and passes on to the end cell  the instructor      goes away  the governor  this is our maker of saws isnt it       he takes the saw from his pocket as wooder throws open the door      of the cell  the convict moaney is seen lying on his bed      athwart the cell with his cap on  he springs up and stands in      the middle of the cell  he is a rawboned fellow about      fiftysix years old with outstanding bats ears and fierce      staring steelcoloured eyes  wooder  cap off  moaney removes his cap out here moaney comes to the door  the governor  beckoning him out into the corridor and holding up the sawwith the manner of an officer speaking to a private anything to say about this my man  moaney is silent  come  moaney  it passed the time  the governor  pointing into the cell  not enough to do eh  moaney  it dont occupy your mind  the governor  tapping the saw  you might find a better way than this  moaney  sullenly  well  what way  i must keep my hand in against the time i get out  whats the good of anything else to me at my time of life  with a gradual change to civility as his tongue warms  ye know that sir  ill be in again within a year or two after ive done this lot  i dont want to disgrace meself when im out  youve got your pride keeping the prison smart well ive got mine  seeing that the governor is listening with interest he goes on pointing to the saw  i must be doin a little o this  its no harm to any one  i was five weeks makin that sawa bit of all right it is too now ill get cells i suppose or seven days bread and water  you cant help it sir i know thati quite put meself in your place  the governor  now look here moaney if i pass it over will you give me your word not to try it on again  think  he goes into the cell walks to the end of it mounts the stool and tries the windowbars  the governor  returning  well  moaney  who has been reflecting ive got another six weeks to do in here alone  i cant do it and think o nothing  i must have something to interest me  youve made me a sporting offer sir but i cant pass my word about it  i shouldnt like to deceive a gentleman  pointing into the cell another four hours steady work would have done it  the governor  yes and what then  caught brought back punishment five weeks hard work to make this and cells at the end of it while they put anew bar to your window  is it worth it moaney  moaney  with a sort of fierceness yes it is  the governor  putting his hand to his brow oh well  two days cellsbread and water  moaney  thank e sir       he turns quickly like an animal and slips into his cell       the governor looks after him and shakes his head as wooder      closes and locks the cell door  the governor  open cliptons cell       wooder opens the door of cliptons cell   clipton is sitting on      a stool just inside the door at work on a pair of trousers  he      is a small thick oldish man with an almost shaven head and      smouldering little dark eyes behind smoked spectacles  he gets      up and stands motionless in the doorway peering at his      visitors  the governor  beckoning come out here a minute clipton       clipton with a sort of dreadful quietness comes into the      corridor the needle and thread in his hand  the governor signs      to wooder who goes into

and glances through the peephole  the governor  open       wooder throws open the door  ocleary who is seated at a      little table by the door as if listening springs up and stands      at attention jest inside the doorway  he is a broadfaced      middleaged man with a wide thin flexible mouth and little      holes under his high cheekbones  the governor  wheres the joke ocleary  ocleary  the

into his cell  the governor shuts the door  the governor  looking at the record card  cant help liking the poor blackguard  wooder  hes an amiable man sir  the governor  pointing down the corridor ask the doctor to come here mr wooder       wooder salutes and goes away down the corridor       the governor goes to the door of falders cell  he raises his      uninjured hand to uncover the peephole but without uncovering      it shakes his head and drops his hand then after scrutinising      the record board he opens the cell door  falder who is      standing against it lurches forward  the governor  beckoning him out  now tell me cant you settle down falder  falder  in a breathless voice  yes sir  the governor  you know what i mean  its no good running your head against a stone wall is it  falder  no sir  the governor  well come  falder  i try sir  the governor  cant you sleep  falder  very little  between two oclock and getting ups the worst time  the governor  hows that  falder  his lips twitch with a sort of smile i dont know sir  i was always nervous  suddenly voluble  everything seems to get such a size then  i feel ill never get out as long as i live  the governor  thats morbid my lad  pull yourself together  falder  with an equally sudden dogged resentment yesive got to  the governor  think of all these other fellows  falder  theyre used to it  the governor  they all had to go through it once for the first time just as youre doing now  falder  yes sir i shall get to be like them in time i suppose  the governor  rather taken aback  hm  well  that rests with you  now come  set your mind to it like a good fellow  youre still quite young  a man can make himself what he likes  falder  wistfully yes sir  the governor  take a good hold of yourself  do you read  falder  i dont take the words in  hanging his head i know its no good but i cant help thinking of whats going on outside  in my cell i cant see out at all  its thick glass sir  the governor  youve had a visitor  bad news  falder  yes  the governor  you mustnt think about it  falder  looking back at his cell  how can i help it sir       he suddenly becomes motionless as wooder and the doctor      approach  the governor motions to him to go back into his cell  falder  quick and low  im quite right in my head sir  he goes back into his cell  the governor  to the doctor  just go in and see him clements       the doctor goes into the cell  the governor pushes the door to      nearly closing it and walks towards the window  wooder  following  sorry you should be troubled like this sir very contented lot of men on the whole  the governor  shortly  you think so  wooder  yes sir  its christmas doing it in my opinion  the governor  to himself  queer that  wooder  beg pardon sir  the governor  christmas       he turns towards the window leaving wooder looking at him with      a sort of pained anxiety  wooder  suddenly  do you think we make show enough sir  if youd like us to have more holly  the governor  not at all mr wooder  wooder  very good sir       the doctor has come out of falders cell and the governor      beckons to him  the governor  well  the doctor  i cant make anything much of him  hes nervous of course  the governor  is there any sort of case to report  quite frankly doctor  the doctor  well i dont think the separates doing him any good but then i could say the same of a lot of themtheyd get on better in the shops theres no doubt  the governor  you mean youd have to recommend others  the doctor  a dozen at least  its on his nerves  theres nothing tangible  that fellow there pointing to oclearys cell for instancefeels it just as much in his way  if i once get away from physical factsi shant know where i am  conscientiously sir i dont know how to differentiate him  he hasnt lost weight  nothing wrong with his eyes  his pulse is good  talks all right  the governor  it doesnt amount to melancholia  the doctor  shaking his head  i can report on him if you like but if i do i ought to report on others  the governor  i see  looking towards falders cell  the poor devil must just stick it then       as he says thin he looks absently at wooder  wooder  beg pardon sir       for answer the governor stares at him turns on his heel and      walks away  there is a sound as of beating on metal  the governor  stopping  mr wooder  wooder  banging on his door sir  i thought we should have more of that       he hurries forward passing the governor who follows closely                            the curtain falls     scene iii       falders cell a whitewashed space thirteen feet broad by seven      deep and nine feet high with a rounded  ceiling  the floor is      of shiny blackened bricks  the barred window of opaque glass      with a ventilator is high up in the middle of the end wall  in      the middle of the opposite end wall is the narrow door  in a      corner are the mattress and bedding rolled up two blankets two      sheets and a coverlet  above them is a quartercircular      wooden shelf on which is a bible and several little devotional      books piled in a symmetrical pyramid there are also a black      hair brush toothbrush and a bit of soap  in another corner      is the wooden frame of a bed standing on end  there is a dark      ventilator under the window and another over the door      falders work a shirt to which he is putting buttonholes is      hung to a nail on the wall over a small wooden table on which      the novel lorna doone lies open  low down in the corner by      the door is a thick glass screen about a foot square covering      the gasjet let into the wall there is also a wooden stool and      a pair of shoes beneath it  three bright round tins are set      under the window       in fastfailing daylight falder in his stockings is seen      standing motionless with his head inclined towards the door      listening  he moves a little closer to the door his stockinged      feet making no noise  he stops at the door  he is trying      harder and harder to hear something any little thing that is      going on outside  he springs suddenly uprightas if at a      soundand remains perfectly motionless  then with a heavy      sigh he moves to his work and stands looking at it with his      head doom he does a stitch or two having the air of a man so      lost in sadness that each stitch is as it were a coming to      life  then turning abruptly he begins pacing the cell moving      his head like an animal pacing its cage  he stops again at the      door listens and placing the palms of hip hands against it      with his fingers spread out leans his forehead against the      iron  turning from it presently he moves slowly back towards      the window tracing his way with his finger along the top line      of the distemper that runs round the wall  he stops under the      window and picking up the lid of one of the tins peers into      it  it has grown very nearly dark  suddenly the lid falls out      of his hand with a clatterthe only sound that has broken the      silenceand he stands staring intently at the wall where the      stuff of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darknesshe      seems to be seeing somebody or something there  there is a      sharp tap and click the cell light behind the glass screen has      been turned up  the cell is brightly lighted  falder is seen      gasping for breath       a sound from far away as of distant dull beating on thick      metal is suddenly audible  falder shrinks back not able to      bear this sudden clamour  but the sound grows as though some      great tumbril were rolling towards the cell  and gradually it      seems to hypnotise him  he begins creeping inch by inch      nearer to the door  the banging sound travelling from cell to      cell draws closer and closer falders hands are seen moving as      if his spirit had already joined in this beating and the sound      swells till it seems to have entered the very cell  he suddenly      raises his clenched fists  panting violently he flings himself      at his door and beats on it                            the curtain falls     act iv       the scene is again cokesons room at a few minutes to ten of a      march morning two years later  the doors are all open      sweedle now blessed with a sprouting moustache is getting the      offices ready  he arranges papers on cokesons table then goes      to a covered washstand raises the lid and looks at himself in      the mirror  while he is gazing his full ruth honeywill comes in      through the outer office and stands in the doorway  there seems      a kind of exultation and excitement behind her habitual      impassivity  sweedle  suddenly seeing her and dropping the lid of the washstand with a bang hello  its you  ruth  yes  sweedle  theres only me here  they dont waste their time hurrying down in the morning  why it must be two years since we had the pleasure of seeing you  nervously  what have you been doing with yourself  ruth  sardonically living  sweedle  impressed  if you want to see him he points to cokesons chair hell be here directlynever missesnot much  delicately i hope our friends back from the country  his times been up these three months if i remember  ruth nods i was awful sorry about that  the governor made a mistakeif you ask me  ruth  he did  sweedle  he ought to have given him a chanst  and i say the judge ought to ha let him go after that  theyve forgot what human natures like  whereas we know ruth gives him a honeyed smile  sweedle  they come down on you like a cartload of bricks flatten you out and when you dont swell up again they complain of it  i know emseen a lot of that sort of thing in my time  he shakes his head in the plenitude of wisdom  why only the other day the governor       but cokeson has come in through the outer office brisk with      east wind and decidedly greyer  cokeson  drawing off his coat and gloves  why its you  then motioning sweedle out and closing the door  quite a stranger  must be two years  dyou want to see me  i can give you a minute  sit down  family well  ruth  yes  im not living where i was  cokeson  eyeing her askance i hope things are more comfortable at home  ruth  i couldnt stay with honeywill after all  cokeson  you havent done anything rash i hope  i should be sorry if youd done anything rash  ruth  ive kept the children with me  cokeson  beginning to feel that things are not so jolly as ha had hoped  well im glad to have seen you  youve not heard from the young man i suppose since he came out  ruth  yes i ran across him yesterday  cokeson  i hope hes well  ruth  with sudden fierceness  he cant get anything to do  its dreadful to see him  hes just skin and bone  cokeson  with genuine concern dear me  im sorry to hear that on his guard again  didnt they find him a place when his time was up  ruth  he was only there three weeks  it got out  cokeson  im sure i dont know what i can do for you  i dont like to be snubby  ruth  i cant bear his being like that  cokeson  scanning her not unprosperous figure i know his relations arent very forthy about him  perhaps you can do something for him till he finds his feet  ruth  not now  i could havebut not now  cokeson  i dont understand  ruth  proudly  ive seen him againthats all over  cokeson  staring at herdisturbed  im a family mani dont want to hear anything unpleasant  excuse meim very busy  ruth  id have gone home to my people in the country long ago but theyve never got over me marrying honeywill  i never was waywise mr cokeson but im proud  i was only a girl you see when i married him  i thought the world of him of course       he used to come travelling to our farm  cokeson  regretfully  i did hope youd have got on better after you saw me  ruth  he used me worse than ever  he couldnt break my nerve but i lost my health and then he began knocking the children about  i couldnt stand that  i wouldnt go back now if he were dying  cokeson  who has risen and is shifting about as though dodging a stream of lava we mustnt be violent must we  ruth  smouldering  a man that cant behave better than that there is silence  cokeson  fascinated in spite of himself  then there you were  and what did you do then  ruth  with a shrug  tried the same as when i left him before making skirts cheap things  it was the best i could get but i never made more than ten shillings a week buying my own cotton and working all day i hardly ever got to bed till past twelve  i kept at it for nine months  fiercely  well im not fit for that i wasnt made for it  id rather die  cokeson  my dear woman  we mustnt talk like that  ruth  it was starvation for the children tooafter what theyd always had  i soon got not to care  i used to be too tired she is silent  cokeson  with fearful curiosity  why what happened then  ruth  with a laugh my employer happened thenhes happened ever since  cokeson  dear  oh dear  i never came across a thing like this  ruth  dully hes treated me all right  but ive done with that suddenly her lips begin to quiver and she hides them with the back of her hand i never thought id see him again you see  it was just a chance i met him by hyde park  we went in there and sat down and he told me all about himself  oh  mr cokeson give him another chance  cokeson  greatly disturbed  then youve both lost your livings what a horrible position  ruth  if he could only get herewhere theres nothing to find out about him  cokeson  we cant have anything derogative to the firm  ruth  ive no one else to go to  cokeson  ill speak to the partners but i dont think theyll take him under the circumstances  i dont really  ruth  he came with me hes down there in the street she points to the window  cokeson  on his dignity he shouldnt have done that until hes sent for  then softening at the look on her face  weve got a vacancy as it happens but i cant promise anything  ruth  it would be the saving of him  cokeson  well ill do what i can but im not sanguine  now tell him that i dont want him till i see how things are  leave your address  repeating her 83 mullingar street  he notes it on blottingpaper goodmorning  ruth  thank you       she moves towards the door turns as if to speak but does not      and goes away  cokeson  wiping his head and forehead with a large white cotton handkerchief what a business  then looking amongst his papers he sounds his bell  sweedle answers it  cokeson  was that young richards coming here today after the clerks place  sweedle  yes  cokeson  well keep him in the air i dont want to see him yet  sweedle  what shall i tell him sir  cokeson  with asperity invent something  use your brains  dont stump him off altogether  sweedle  shall i tell him that weve got illness sir  cokeson  no  nothing untrue  say im not here today  sweedle  yes sir  keep him hankering  cokeson  exactly  and look here  you remember falder  i may be having him round to see me  now treat him like youd have him treat you in a similar position  sweedle  i naturally should do  cokeson  thats right  when a mans down never hit im  tisnt necessary  give him a hand up  thats a metaphor i recommend to you in life  its sound policy  sweedle  do you think the governors will take him on again sir  cokeson  cant say anything about that  at the sound of some one having entered the outer office  whos there  sweedle  going to the door and looking its falder sir  cokeson  vexed  dear me  thats very naughty of her  tell him to call again  i dont want       he breaks off as falder comes in  falder is thin pale older      his eyes have grown more restless  his clothes are very worn      and loose       sweedle nodding cheerfully withdraws  cokeson  glad to see you  youre rather previous  trying to keep things pleasant  shake hands  shes striking while the irons hot he wipes his forehead i dont blame her  shes anxious       falder  timidly takes cokesons hand and glances towards the      partners door  cokeson  nonot yet  sit down  falder sits in the chair at the aide of cokesons table on which he places his cap  now you are here id like you to give me a little account of yourself  looking at him over his spectacles  hows your health  falder  im alive mr cokeson  cokeson  preoccupied  im glad to hear that  about this matter i dont like doing anything out of the ordinary its not my habit im a plain man and i want everything smooth and straight  but i promised your friend to speak to the partners and i always keep my word  falder  i just want a chance mr cokeson  ive paid for that job a thousand times and more  i have sir  no one knows  they say i weighed more when i came out than when i went in  they couldnt weigh me here he touches his head  or here he toucheshis heart and gives a sort of laugh  till last night id have thought there was nothing in here at all  cokeson  concerned youve not got heart disease  falder  oh  they passed me sound enough  cokeson  but they got you a place didnt they  falser  yes very good people knew all about itvery kind to me i thought i was going to get on first rate  but one day all of a sudden the other clerks got wind of it  i couldnt stick it mr cokeson i couldnt sir  cokeson easy my dear fellow easy  falder  i had one small job after that but it didnt last  cokeson  how was that  falder  its no good deceiving you mr cokeson  the fact is i seem to be struggling against a thing thats all round me  i cant explain it its as if i was in a net as fast as i cut it here it grows up there  i didnt act as i ought to have about references but what are you to do  you must have them  and that made me afraid and i left  in fact imim afraid all the time now       he bows his head and leans dejectedly silent over the table  cokeson  i feel for youi do really  arent your sisters going to do anything for you  falder  ones in consumption  and the other  cokeson  yees  she told me her husband wasnt quite pleased with you  falder  when i went therethey were at suppermy sister wanted to give me a kissi know  but he just looked at her and said what have you come for  well i pocketed my pride and i said arent you going to give me your hand jim  cis is i know i said  look here he said thats all very well but wed better come to an understanding  ive been expecting you and ive made up my mind ill give you fifteen pounds to go to canada with  i see i saidgood riddance  no thanks keep your fifteen pounds friendships a queer thing when youve been where i have  cokeson  i understand  will you take the fifteen pound from me flustered as falder regards him with a queer smile  quite without prejudice i meant it kindly  falder  im not allowed to leave the country  cokeson  oh  yeesticketofleave  you arent looking the thing  falder  ive slept in the park three nights this week  the dawns arent all poetry there  but meeting heri feel a different man this morning  ive often thought the being fond of hers the best thing about me its sacred somehowand yet it did for me  thats queer isnt it  cokeson  im sure were all very sorry for you  falder  thats what ive found mr cokeson  awfully sorry for me with quiet bitterness  but it doesnt do to associate with criminals  cokeson  come come its no use calling yourself names  that never did a man any good  put a face on it  falder  its easy enough to put a face on it sir when youre independent  try it when youre down like me  they talk about giving you your deserts  well i think ive had just a bit over  cokeson  eyeing him askance over his spectacles  i hope they havent made a socialist of you       falder is suddenly still as if brooding over his past self he      utters a peculiar laugh  cokeson  you must give them credit for the best intentions  really you must  nobody wishes you harm im sure  falder  i believe that mr cokeson  nobody wishes you harm but they down you all the same  this feelinghe stares round him as though at something closing in  its crushing me  with sudden impersonality  i know it is  cokeson  horribly disturbed theres nothing there  we must try and take it quiet  im sure ive often had you in my prayers  now leave it to me  ill use my gumption and take em when theyre jolly  as he speaks the two partners come in  cokeson  rather disconcerted but trying to put them all at ease i didnt expect you quite so soon  ive just been having a talk with this young man  i think youll remember him  james  with a grave keen look quite well  how are you falder  walter  holding out his hand almost timidly very glad to see you again falder  falder  who has recovered his selfcontrol takes the hand thank you sir  cokeson  just a word mr james  to falder pointing to the clerks office you might go in there a minute  you know your way our junior wont be coming this morning  his wifes just had a little family       falder goes uncertainly out into the clerks office  cokeson  confidentially im bound to tell you all about it  hes quite penitent  but theres a prejudice against him  and youre not seeing him to advantage this morning hes undernourished  its very trying to go without your dinner  james  is that so cokeson  cokeson  i wanted to ask you  hes had his lesson  now we know all about him and we want a clerk  there is a young fellow applying but im keeping him in the air  james  a gaolbird in the office cokeson  i dont see it  walter  the rolling of the chariotwheels of justice  ive never got that out of my head  james  ive nothing to reproach myself with in this affair  whats he been doing since he came out  cokeson  hes had one or two places but he hasnt kept them  hes sensitivequite natural  seems to fancy everybodys down on him  james  bad sign  dont like the fellownever did from the first weak characters written all over him  walter  i think we owe him a leg up  james  he brought it all on himself  walter  the doctrine of full responsibility doesnt quite hold in these days  james  rather grimly  youll find it safer to hold it for all that my boy  walter  for oneself yesnot for other people thanks  james  well  i dont want to be hard  cokeson  im glad to hear you say that  he seems to see something spreading his arms round him  tisnt healthy  james  what about that woman he was mixed up with  i saw some one uncommonly like her outside as we came in  cokeson  that  well i cant keep anything from you  he has met her  james  is she with her husband  cokeson  no  james  falder living with her i suppose  cokeson  desperately trying to retain the newfound jollity i dont know that of my own knowledge  tisnt my business  james  its our business if were going to engage him cokeson  cokeson  reluctantly i ought to tell you perhaps  ive had the party here this morning  james  i thought so  to walter no my dear boy it wont do  too shady altogether  cokeson  the two things together make it very awkward for youi see that  walter  tentatively  i dont quite know what we have to do with his private life  james  no no  he must make a clean sheet of it or he cant come here  walter  poor devil  cokeson  will youhave him in  and as james nods i think i can get him to see reason  james  grimly you can leave that to me cokeson  walter  to james in a low voice while cokeson is summoning falder  his whole future may depend on what we do dad  falder comes in  he has pulled himself together and presents a steady front  james  now look here falder  my son and i want to give you another chance but there are two things i must say to you  in the first place its no good coming here as a victim  if youve any notion that youve been unjustly treatedget rid of it  you cant play fast and loose with morality and hope to go scotfree  if society didnt take care of itself nobody wouldthe sooner you realise that the better  falder  yes sir butmay i say something  james  well  falder  i had a lot of time to think it over in prison  he stops  cokeson  encouraging him im sure you did  falder  there were all sorts there  and what i mean sir is that if wed been treated differently the first time and put under somebody that could look after us a bit and not put in prison not a quarter of us would ever have got there  james  shaking his head im afraid ive very grave doubts of that falder  falder  with a gleam of malice yes sir so i found  james  my good fellow dont forget that you began it  falder  i never wanted to do wrong  james  perhaps not  but you did  falder  with all the bitterness of his past suffering its knocked me out of time  pulling himself up  that is i mean im not what i was  james  this isnt encouraging for us falder  cokeson  hes putting it awkwardly mr james  falder  throwing over his caution from the intensity of his feeling  i mean it mr cokeson  james  now lay aside all those thoughts falder and look to the future  falder  almost eagerly yes sir but you dont understand what prison is  its here it gets you       he grips his chest  cokeson  in a whisper to james i told you he wanted nourishment  walter  yes but my dear fellow thatll pass away  times merciful  falder  with his face twitching  i hope so sir  james  much more gently  now my boy what youve got to do is to put all the past behind you and build yourself up a steady reputation  and that brings me to the second thing  this woman you were mixed up with you must give us your word you know to have done with that  theres no chance of your keeping straight if youre going to begin your future with such a relationship  falder  looking from one to the other with a hunted expression but sir       but sir       its the one thing i looked forward to all that time  and she too       i couldnt find her before last night       during this and what follows cokeson becomes more and more      uneasy  james  this is painful falder  but you must see for yourself that its impossible for a firm like this to close its eyes to everything give us this proof of your resolve to keep straight and you can come backnot otherwise  falder  after staring at james suddenly stiffens himself  i couldnt give her up  i couldnt  oh sir       im all shes got to look to  and im sure shes all ive got  james  im very sorry falder but i must be firm  its for the benefit of you both in the long run  no good can come of this connection  it was the cause of all your disaster  falder  but sir it meanshaving gone through all thatgetting broken upmy nerves are in an awful statefor nothing  i did it for her  james  come  if shes anything of a woman shell see it for herself  she wont want to drag you down further  if there were a prospect of your being able to marry herit might be another thing  falder  its not my fault sir that she couldnt get rid of him she would have if she could  thats been the whole trouble from the beginning  looking suddenly at walter       if anybody would help her  its only money wants now im sure  cokeson  breaking in as walter hesitates and is about to speak i dont think we need consider thatits rather farfetched  falder  to walter appealing  he must have given her full cause since she could prove that he drove her to leave him  walter  im inclined to do what you say falder if it can be managed  falder  oh sir  he goes to the window and looks down into the street  cokeson  hurriedly  you dont take me mr walter  i have my reasons  falder  from the window  shes down there sir  will you see her i can beckon to her from here       walter hesitates and looks from cokeson to james  james  with a sharp nod yes let her come  falder beckons from the window  cokeson  in a low fluster to james and walter  no mr james shes not been quite what she ought to ha been while this young mans been away  shes lost her chance  we cant consult how to swindle the law       falder has come from the window  the three men look at him in a      sort of awed silence

accustomed      groove  james  sharply  shut the door there  sweedle shuts the door weve asked you to come up because there are certain facts to be faced in this matter  i understand you have only

let me know what you do with yourselves thats all  falder  as if he has not heard ruth       ruth looks at him and falder covers his face with his hands      there is silence  cokeson  suddenly  theres some one out there  to ruth  go in here  youll feel better by yourself for a minute       he points to the clerks room and moves towards the outer      office  falder does not move  ruth puts out her hand timidly      he shrinks back from the touch  she turns and goes miserably      into the clerks room  with a brusque movement he follows      seizing her by the shoulder just inside the doorway  cokeson      shuts the door  james  pointing to the outer office  get rid of that whoever it is  sweedle  opening the office door in a scared voice detectivesergeant blister       the detective enters and closes the door behind him  wister  sorry to disturb you sir  a clerk you had here two years and a half ago i arrested him in this room  james  what about him  wister  i thought perhaps i might get his whereabouts from you there is an awkward silence  cokeson  pleasantly coming to the rescue were not responsible for his movements you know that  james  what do you want with him  wister  hes failed to report himself this last four weeks  walter  how dyou mean  wister  ticketofleave wont be up for another six months sir  walter  has he to keep in touch with the police till

employment with a forged reference  what with the two things togetherwe must have him       again there is silence  walter and cokeson steal glances at      james who stands staring steadily at the detective  cokeson  expansively  were very busy at the moment  if you could make it convenient to call again we might be able to tell you then  james  decisively im a servant of the law but i dislike peaching  in fact i cant do such a thing  if you want him you must find him without us       as he speaks his eye falls on falders cap still lying on the      table and his face contracts  wister  noting the gesturequietly  very good sir  i ought to warn you that having broken the terms of his licence hes still a convict and sheltering a convict  james  i shelter no one  but you mustnt come here and ask questions which its not my business to answer  wister  dryly i wont trouble you further then gentlemen  cokeson  im sorry we couldnt give you the information  you quite understand dont you  goodmorning       wister turns to go but instead of going to the door of the      outer office he goes to the door of the clerks room  cokeson  the other door  the other door       wister opens the clerks door  ruthss voice is heard oh      do and falders i cant  there is a little pause then      with sharp fright ruth says whos that       wister has gone in       the three men look aghast at the door  wister  from within  keep back please       he comes swiftly out with his arm twisted in falders  the      latter gives a white staring look at the three men  walter  let him go this time for gods sake  wister  i couldnt take the responsibility sir  falder  with a queer desperate laugh  good       flinging a look back at ruth he throws up his head and goes      out through the outer office half dragging wister after him  walter  with despair  that finishes him  itll go on for ever now       sweedle can be seen staring through the outer door  there are      sounds of footsteps descending the stone stairs suddenly a dull      thud a faint my god in wisters voice  james  whats that       sweedle dashes forward  the door swings to behind him  there      is dead silence  walter  starting forward to the inner room the womanshes fainting       he and cokeson support the fainting ruth from the doorway of the      clerks room  cokeson  distracted  here my dear  there there  walter  have you any brandy  cokeson  ive got sherry  walter  get it then  quick       he places ruth in a chairwhich james has dragged forward  cokeson  with sherry here  its good strong sherry  they try to force the sherry between her lips       there is the sound of feet and they stop to listen       the outer door is reopenedwister and sweedle are seen carrying      some burden  james  hurrying forward  what is it       they lay the burden doom in the outer office out of sight and      all but ruth cluster round it speaking in hushed voices  wister  he jumpednecks broken  walter  good god  wister  he must have been mad to think he could give me the slip like that  and what was itjust a few months  walter  bitterly was that all  james  what a desperate thing  then in a voice unlike his own run for a doctoryou  sweedle rushes from the outer office an ambulance       wister goes out  on ruths face an expression of fear and      horror has been seen growing as if she dared not turn towards      the voices  she now rises and steals towards them  walter  turning suddenly look       the three men shrink back out of her way one by one into      cokesons room  ruth drops on her knees

reginald  i dont know whats to become of them  you dont think the rectoryou dont think your father would speak to clare  huntingdon  afraid the governors hardly well enough  he takes anything of that

to relieve malise  sir charles  very fine sunset       quite softly clare begins to laugh  all look at her first with      surprise then with offence then almost with horror  george is      about to

dropping his hand  cant you make it up  clare  i dont feel very christian       she opens the door passes through and closes it behind her      george steps quickly towards it stops and turns back into the      room  he goes to the window and stands looking out shuts it      with a bang and again contemplates the door  moving forward      he rests his hand on the deserted card table clutching its      edge and muttering  then he crosses to the door into the hall      and switches off the light  he opens the door to go out then      stands again irresolute in the darkness and heaves a heavy sigh      suddenly he mutters no  crosses resolutely back to the      curtained door and opens it  in the gleam of light clare is      standing unhooking a necklet       he goes in shutting the door

cigarette and tries the rhythm of the last sentence holding up      a sheet of quarto ms  malise  not a word not a whisper of liberty from all those excellent frockcoated gentlemennot a sign not a grimace  only the monumental silence of their profound deference before triumphant tyranny       while he speaks a substantial woman a little over middleage      in old dark clothes and a black straw

to get into communication  clare  why did you spy here  sir charles  no no  nobodys spied on you  what  twisden  im afraid the answer is that we appear to have been justified  at the expression on clares face he goes on hastily now mrs dedmond im a lawyer and i know that appearances are misleading  dont think im unfriendly i wish you well  clare raises her eyes  moved by that look which is exactly as if she had said i have no friends he hurries on  what we want to say to you is this dont let this split go on  dont commit yourself to what youll bitterly regret  just tell us whats the

galvanized by the sound sir charles comes to life out of the      transfixed bewilderment with which he has been listening  sir charles  for gods sake dont laugh like that       clare stops  lady dedmond  with real feeling  for the sake of the simple right clare  clare  right  whatever else is rightour life is not  she puts her hand on her heart i swear before god that ive tried and tried i

gentleman  lady dedmond  charles  sir charles  let me alone  i can only say thatdamme i dont know that i can say anything       he looks at her very grieved then turns and marches out      followed by lady dedmond whose voice is heard without answered      by his what  in the doorway as they pass george is      standing he comes in  george  going up to clare who has recovered all her selfcontrol will you come outside and speak to me  clare  no       george glances at malise who is leaning against the wall with      folded arms  george  in a low voice  clare  clare  well  george  you try me pretty high dont you forcing me to come here and speak before this fellow  most men would think the worst finding you like this  clare  you need not have comeor thought at all  george  did you imagine i was going to let you vanish without an effort  clare  to save me  george  for gods sake be just  ive come here to say certain things  if you force me to say them before himon your head be it will you appoint somewhere else  clare  no  george  why not  clare  i know all those certain things  you must come back  it is your duty  you have no money  your friends wont help you  you cant earn your living  you are making a scandal  you might even say for the moment your room shall be respected  george  well its true and youve no answer  clare  oh  suddenly  our lifes a lie  its stupid its disgusting  im tired of it  please leave me alone  george  you rather miss the point im afraid  i didnt come here to tell you what you know perfectly well when youre sane  i came here to say this anyone in her senses could see the game your friend here is playing  it wouldnt take a baby in  if you think that a gentleman like that  his stare travels round the dishevelled room till it rests on malise  champions a pretty woman for nothing you make a fairly bad mistake  clare  take care       but malise after one convulsive movement of his hands has      again become rigid  george  i dont pretend to be subtle or that kind of thing but i have ordinary common sense  i dont attempt to be superior to plain facts  clare  under her breath  facts  george  oh for goodness sake drop that hifalutin tone  it doesnt suit you  look here  if you like to go abroad with one of your young sisters until the autumn ill let the flat and go to the club  clare  put the fire out with a penny hose  slowly  i am not coming back to you george  the farce is over  george  taken aback for a moment by the finality of her tone suddenly fronts malise then there is something between you and this fellow  malise  dangerously but without moving  i beg your pardon  clare  thereisnothing  george  looking from one to the other  at all events i wonti wont see a woman who onceclare makes a sudden effacing movement with her hands  i wont see her go to certain ruin without lifting a finger  clare  that is noble  george  with intensity  i dont know that you deserve anything of me  but on my honour as a gentleman i came here this morning for your sake to warn you of what youre doing  he turns suddenly on malise  and i tell this precious friend of yours plainly what i think of him and that im not going to play into his hands       malise without stirring from the wall looks at clare and his      lips move  clare  shakes her head at himthen to george  will you go please  george  i will go when you do  malise  a man of the world should know better than that  george  are you coming  malise  that is inconceivable  george  im not speaking to you sir  malise  you are right  your words and mine will never kiss each other  george  will you come  clare shakes her head  george  with fury  dyou mean to stay in this pigsty with that rhapsodical swine  malise  transformed by god if you dont go ill kill you  george  as suddenly calm  that remains to be seen  malise  with most deadly quietness  yes i will kill you       he goes stealthily along the wall takes up from where it lies      on the pile of books the great black knobby stick and      stealthily approaches george his face quite fiendish  clare  with a swift movement grasping the stick  please       malise resigns the stick and the two men perfectly still      glare at each other  clare letting the stick fall puts her      foot on it  then slowly she takes off her hat and lays it on      the table  clare  now will you go  there is silence  george  staring at her hat  you mad little fool  understand this if youve not returned home by three oclock ill divorce you and you may roll in the gutter with this highsouled friend of yours and mind this you siri wont spare youby god  your pocket shall suffer  thats the only thing that touches fellows like you       turning he goes out and slams the door  clare and malise      remain face to face  her lips have begun to quiver  clare  horrible       she turns away shuddering and sits down on the edge of the      armchair covering her eyes with the backs of her hands  malise

   he releases her hand  just touching his bent head with her      other hand clare turns and goes  malise remains with bowed      head listening to the sound of her receding footsteps  they      die away  he raises himself and strikes out into the air with      his clenched fist                                 curtain      act iii       malises sittingroom  an afternoon three months later      on

as i give satisfaction  malise  holding the door for him  certainly  good evening  haywood  good evenin sir no offence i hope  malise  on the contrary       doubtfully haywood goes  and malise stands scratching his head      then slipping the bill into one of the volumes to remind him he      replaces them at the top of the pile  the boy again advances      into the doorway  malise  yes now for you       he goes to the table and takes some sheets of ms from an old      portfolio  but the door is again timidly pushed open and      haywood reappears  malise  yes mr haywood  haywood  about that little matter sir  ifif its any convenience to youivethought of a place where i could  malise  read them  youll enjoy them thoroughly  haywood  no sir no  where i can dispose of them  malise  holding

sir and departs  malise      again takes up the sheets of ms  and cons a sentence over to      himself gazing blankly at the stolid boy  malise  man of the worldgood form your god  poor buttonedup philosopher  the boy shifts his feet  inbred to the point of cretinism and founded to the bone on fear of ridicule  the boy breathes heavilyyou are the slave of facts       there is a knock on the door  malise  who is it       the door is pushed open and reginald huntingdon stands there  huntingdon  i apologize sir can i come in a minute       malise bows with ironical hostility  huntingdon  i dont know if you remember meclare dedmonds brother  malise  i remember you       he motions to the stolid boy to go outside again  huntingdon  ive come to you sir as a gentleman  malise  some mistake  there is one i believe on the first floor  huntingdon  its about my sister  malise  dn you  dont you know that ive been shadowed these last three months  ask your detectives for any information you want  huntingdon  we know that you havent seen her or even known where she is  malise  indeed  youve found that out  brilliant  huntingdon  we know it from my sister  malise  oh  so youve tracked her down  huntingdon  mrs fullarton came across her yesterday in one of those big shopsselling gloves  malise  mrs fullarton the lady with the husband  well youve got her  clap her back into prison  huntingdon  we have not got her  she left at once and we dont know where shes gone  malise  bravo  huntingdon  taking hold of his bit  look here mr malise in a way i share your feeling but im fond of my sister and its damnable to have to go back to india knowing she must be all adrift without protection going through god knows what  mrs fullarton says shes looking awfully pale and down  malise  struggling between resentment and sympathy  why do you come to me  huntingdon  we thought  malise  who  huntingdon  mymy father and myself  malise  go on  huntingdon  we thought there was just a chance that having lost that job she might come to you again for advice  if she does it would be really generous of you if youd put my father in touch with her  hes getting old and he feels this very much  he hands malise a card  this is his address  malise  twisting the card  let there be no mistake sir i do nothing that will help give her back to her husband  shes out to save her soul alive and i dont join the hue and cry thats after her  on the contraryif i had the power  if your father wants to shelter her thats another matter  but shed her own ideas about that  huntingdon  perhaps you dont realize how unfit my sister is for rough and tumble  shes not one of this new sort of woman  shes always been looked after and had things done for her  pluck shes got but thats all and shes bound to come to grief  malise  very likelythe first birds do  but if she drops halfway its better than if shed never flown  your sister sir is trying the wings of her spirit out of the old slave market  for women as for men theres more than one kind of dishonour captain huntingdon and worse things than being dead as you may know in your profession  huntingdon  admittedbut  malise  we each have our own views as to what they are  but they all come todeath of our spirits for the sake of our carcases anything more  huntingdon  my leaves up  i sail tomorrow  if you do see my sister i trust you to give her my love and say i begged she would see my father  malise  if i have the chanceyes       he makes a gesture of salute to which huntingdon responds      then the latter turns and goes out  malise  poor fugitive  where are you running now       he stands at the window through which the evening sunlight is      powdering the room with smoky gold  the stolid boy has again      come in  malise stares at him then goes back to the table      takes up the ms and booms it at him he receives the charge      breathing hard  malise  man of the worldproduct of a material age incapable of perceiving reality in motions of the spirit having no use as you would say for sentimental nonsense accustomed to believe yourself the national spineyour position is unassailable  you will remain the idol of the countryarbiter of law parson in mufti darling of the playwright and the novelistgod bless youwhile waters lap these shores       he places the sheets of ms in an envelope and hands them to      the boy  malise  youre going straight back to the watchfire  boy  stolidly  yes sir  malise  staring at him youre a masterpiece  dyou know that  boy  no sir  malise  get out then       he lifts the portfolio from the table and takes it into the      inner room  the boy putting his thumb stolidly to his nose      turns to go  in the doorway he shies violently at the figure of      clare standing there in a darkcoloured dress skids past her      and goes  clare comes into the gleam of sunlight her white      face alive with emotion or excitement  she looks round her      smiles sighs goes swiftly to the door closes it and comes      back to the table  there she stands fingering the papers on      the table smoothing malises hat wistfully eagerly waiting  malise  returning  you  clare  with a faint smile  not very glorious is it       he goes towards her and checks himself then slews the armchair      round  malise  come  sit down sit down  clare heaving a long sigh sinks down into the chair  teas nearly ready       he places a cushion for her and prepares tea she looks up at      him softly but as he finishes and turns to her she drops that      glance  clare  do you think me an awful coward for coming  she has taken a little plain cigarette case from her dress  would you mind if i smoked       malise shakes his head then draws back from her again as if      afraid to be too close  and again unseen she looks at him  malise  so youve lost your job  clare  how did you  malise  your brother  you only just missed him  clare starts up they had an idea youd come  hes sailing tomorrowhe wants you to see your father  clare  is father ill  malie  anxious about you  clare  ive written to him every week  excited  theyre still hunting me  malise  touching her shoulder gently  its all rightall right       she sinks again into the chair and again he withdraws  and      once more she gives him that soft eager look and once more      averts it as he turns to her  clare  my nerves have gone funny lately  its being always on ones guard and stuffy air and feeling people look and talk about you and dislike your being there  malise  yes that wants pluck  clare  shaking her head  i curl up all the time  the only thing i know for certain is that i shall never go back to him  the more ive hated what ive been doing the more sure ive been  i might come to anythingbut not that  malise  had a very bad time  clare  nodding  im spoilt  its a curse to be a lady when you have to earn your living  its not really been so hard i suppose ive been selling things and living about twice as well as most shop girls  malise  were they decent to you  clare  lots of the girls are really nice  but somehow they dont want me cant help thinking ive got airs or something and in here she touches her breast  i dont want them  malise  i know  clare  mrs fullarton and i used to belong to a society for helping reduced gentlewomen to get work  i know now what they want enough money not to workthats all  suddenly looking up at him  dont think me worse than i amplease  its working under people its having to do it being driven  i have tried ive not been altogether a coward really  but every morning getting there the same time every day the same stale dinner as they call it every evening the same good evening miss clare  good evening miss simpson  good evening miss hart  good evening miss clare and the same walk home or the same bus and the same men that you mustnt look at for fear theyll follow you  she rises  oh and the feelingalways alwaysthat theres no sun or life or hope or anything  it was just like being ill the way ive wanted to ride and dance and get out into the country  her excitement dies away into the old clipped composure and she sits down again  dont think too badly of meit really is pretty ghastly  malise  gruffly  hm  why a shop  clare  references  i didnt want to tell more lies than i could help a married woman on strike cant tell the truth you know  and i cant typewrite or do shorthand yet  and chorusi thoughtyou wouldnt like  malise  i  what have i  he checks himself  have men been brutes  clare  stealing a look at him  one followed me a lot  he caught hold of my arm one evening  i just took this out she draws out her hatpin and holds it like a dagger her lip drawn back as the lips of a dog going to bite  and said will you leave me alone please and he did  it was rather nice  and there was one quite decent little man in the shopi was sorry for himsuch a humble little man  malise  poor devilits hard not to wish for the moon       at the tone of his voice clare looks up at him his face is      turned away  clare  softly  how have you been  working very hard  malise  as hard as god will let me  clare  stealing another look have you any typewriting i could do i could learn and ive still got a brooch i could sell  which is the best kind  malise  i had a catalogue of them somewhere       he goes into the inner room  the moment he is gone clare      stands up her hands pressed to her cheeks as if she felt them      flaming  then with hands clasped she stands waiting  he      comes back with the old portfolio  malise  can you typewrite where you are  clare  i have to find a new room anyway  im changingto be safe she takes a luggage ticket from her glove  i took my things to charing crossonly a bag and one trunk  then with that queer expression on her face which prefaces her desperations you dont want me now i suppose  malise  what  clare  hardly above a whisper becauseif you still wanted me i donow       etext editors note in the 1924 revision 11 years after this      1913 edition i donow is changed to i couldnow      a significant change in meaning  dw  malise  staring hard into her face that is quivering and smiling you mean it  you do  you care  clare  ive thought of youso much  but onlyif youre sure       he clasps her and kisses her closed eyes and so they stand for      a moment till the sound of a latchkey in the door sends them      apart  malise  its the housekeeper  give me that ticket ill send for your things       obediently she gives him the ticket smiles and goes quietly      into the inner room  mrs miler has entered her face more      chinese than ever shows no sign of having seen  malise  that lady will stay here mrs miler  kindly go with this ticket to the cloakroom at charing cross station and bring back her luggage in a cab  have you money  mrs miler  arf a crown  she takes the ticketthen impassively in case you dont knowtheres two o them men about the stairs now       the moment she is gone malise makes a gesture of maniacal fury      he steals on tiptoe to the outer door and listens  then      placing his hand on the knob he turns it without noise and      wrenches back the door  transfigured in the last sunlight      streaming down the corridor are two men close together      listening and consulting secretly  they start back  malise  with strange almost noiseless ferocity  youve run her to earth your jobs done  kennel up hounds  and in their faces he slams the door                                 curtain      scene ii  scene iithe same early

leather box  she puts it      down on her typing table as malise returns followed by mrs      miler wearing her hat and carrying his overcoat  mrs miler  put your coat on  its a bitter wind       he puts on the coat  clare  where are you going  malise  to the watchfire       the door closes behind him and mrs miler goes up to clare      holding out a little blue bottle with a red label nearly

for a moment      he does not see her standing there against the curtain that is      much the same colour as her dress  his face is that of a man in      the grip of a rage that he feels to be impotent  then seeing      her he pulls himself together walks to his armchair and sits      down there in his hat and coat  clare  well  the watchfire  you may as well tell me  malise  nothing to

sufferance breath at the pleasure of the enemy  and some day in the fullness of his mercy to be made a present of the right to eat and drink and breathe again  his gesture sums up the rage within him fine  he puts his hat on and rises  thats the last groan they get from me  class  are you going out again  he nods  where  malise  blackberrying  our trains not till six       he goes into the bedroom  clare gets up and stands by the fire      looking round in a dazed way  she puts her hand up and      mechanically gathers together the violets in the little vase      suddenly she twists them to a buttonhole and sinks down into      the armchair which he must pass  there she sits the violets      in her hand  malise comes out and crosses towards the outer      door  she puts the violets up to him  he stares at them      shrugs his shoulders and passes on  for just a moment clare      sits motionless  clare  quietly  give me a kiss       he turns and kisses her  but his lips after that kiss have      the furtive bitterness one sees on the lips of those who have      done what does not suit their mood  he goes out  she is left      motionless by the armchair her throat working  then      feverishly she goes to the little table seizes a sheet of      paper and writes  looking up suddenly she sees that mrs miler      has let herself in with her latchkey  mrs miler  ive settled the baker

mrs miler has come      back into the room clare still stands there  mrs miler  pointing to the typewriter dyou want this ere too  clare  yes       mrs miler carries it out  then from the doorway

barrel of oysters in a gilded tub  arnaud      the waiter slim dark quick his face seamed with a quiet      soft irony is opening oysters and listening to the robust joy      of a distant supperparty where a man is playing the last bars      of do ye ken john peel on a horn  as the sound dies away he      murmurs tres joli and opens another oyster  two ladies with      bare shoulders and large hats pass down the corridor  their      talk is faintly wafted in well i never like derby night  the      boys do get so bobbish  that hornvulgar i call it       arnauds eyebrows rise the corners of his mouth droop  a lady      with bare shoulders and crimson roses in her hair comes along      the corridor and stops for a second at the window for a man to      join her  they come through into the room  arnaud has sprung      to attention but with lets go in here shall we they pass      through into the further room  the manager a gentleman with      neat moustaches and buttoned into a

seats  seeing them      safely landed the manager brisk and noiseless moves away  in      the corridor a lady in black with a cloak falling open seems      uncertain whether to come in  she advances into the doorway      it is clare  arnaud  pointing to the other table as he flies with dishes  nice table madame       clare moves to the corner of it  an artist in observation of      his clients arnaud takes in her facevery pale under her wavy      simplydressed hair shadowy beneath the eyes not powdered her      lips not reddened without a single ornament takes in her black      dress finely cut her arms and neck beautifully white and at      her breast three gardenias  and as he nears her she lifts her      eyes  it is very much the look of something lost appealing for      guidance  arnaud  madame is waiting for some one  she shakes her head  then madame will be veree well hereveree well  i take madames cloak       he takes the cloak gently and lays it on the back of the chair      fronting the room that she may put it round her when she      wishes  she sits down  languid voice  from the corner  waiter  arnaud  milord  languid voice  the roederer  arnaud  at once milord       clare sits tracing a pattern with her finger on the cloth her      eyes lowered  once she raises them and follows arnauds dark      rapid figure  arnaud  returning madame feels the eat  he scans her with increased curiosity you wish something madame  clare  again giving him that look  must i order  arnaud  non madame it is not necessary  a glass of water  he pours it out  i have not the pleasure of knowing madames face  clare  faintly smiling  no  arnaud  madame will find it veree good ere veree quiet  languid voice  waiter  arnaud  pardon  he goes       the barenecked ladies with large hats

    by those sounds clare has caught her cloak and halfrisen they      die away and she subsides  arnaud  back at her table with a quaint shrug towards the corridor it is not rowdy here madame as a rulenot as in some places  tonight a little noise  madame is fond of flowers  he whisks out and returns almost at once with a bowl of carnations from some table in the next room these smell good  clare  you are very kind  arnaud  with courtesy  not at all madame a pleasure  he bows       a young man tall thin hard straight with closecropped      sandyish hair and moustache a face tanned very red and one of      those small long lean heads that only grow in britain clad in      a thin dark overcoat thrown open an opera hat pushed back a      white waistcoat round his lean middle he comes in from the      corridor  he looks round glances at clare passes her table      towards the further room stops in the doorway and looks back      at her  her eyes have just been lifted and are at once cast      down again  the young man wavers catches arnauds eye jerks      his head to summon him and passes into the further room      arnaud takes up the vase that has been superseded and follows      him out  and clare sits alone in silence broken by the murmurs      of the languid lord and his partner behind the screen  she is      breathing as if she had been running hard  she lifts her eyes      the tall young man divested of hat and coat is standing by her      table holding out his hand with a sort of bashful hardiness  young man  how dyou do  didnt recognize you at first  so sorry awfully rude of me       clares eyes seem to fly from him to appeal to him to resign      herself all at once  something in the young man responds  he      drops his hand  clare  faintly  how

man sits down again uncomfortable nonplussed  there      is silence broken by the inaudible words of the languid lord      and the distant merriment of the supperparty  arnaud brings      the plovers eggs  young man  the wine quick  arnaud  at once sare  young man  abruptly dont you ever go racing then  clare  no       arnaud pours out champagne  young man  i remember awfully well my first day  it

floundering in these waters deeper than he had bargained for i sayabout things having beginningsdid you mean anything       clare nods  young man  what dyou mean its really the first       clare nods  the champagne has flicked her courage  young man  by george  he leans back  ive often wondered  arnaud  again filling the glasses  monsieur finds  young man  abruptly  its all right       he drains his glass then sits bolt upright  chivalry and the      camaraderie of class have begun to stir in him  young man  of course i can see that youre noti mean that youre aa lady  clare smiles  and i say you knowif you have to because youre in a holei should feel a cad  let me lend you  clare  holding up her glass le vin est tire il faut le boire       she drinks  the french words which he does not too well      understand completing his conviction that she is a lady he      remains quite silent frowning  as clare held up her glass two      gentlemen have entered  the first is blond of good height and      a comely insolence  his crisp fair hair and fair brushedup      moustache are just going grey an eyeglass is fixed in one of      two eyes that lord it over every woman they see his face is      broad and coloured with air and wine  his companion is a tall      thin dark bird of the night with sly roving eyes and hollow      cheeks  they stand looking round then pass into the further      room but in passing they have stared unreservedly at clare  young man  seeing her wince  look here  im afraid you must feel me rather a brute you know  clare  no i dont really  young man  are you absolute stoney  clare nods  but looking at her frock and cloak youre so awfully well  clare  i had the sense to keep them  young man  more and more disturbed  i say you knowi wish youd let me

long view holloa and a blast of the horn  young man  but i say what about your people  you must have people of some sort       he is fast becoming fascinated for her cheeks have begun to      flush and her eyes to shine  clare  oh yes ive had people and a husband andeverything and here i am  queer isnt it  she touches her glass  this is going to my head  do you mind  i shant sing songs and get up and dance and i wont cry i promise you  young man  between fascination and chivalry  by george  one simply cant believe in this happening to a lady  clare  have you got sisters breaking into her soft laughter  my brothers in india  i shant meet him anyway  young man  no buti sayare you really quite cut off from everybody  clare nods  something rather awful must have happened       she smiles  the two gentlemen have returned the blond one is      again staring fixedly at clare  this time she looks back at      him flaming and with a little laugh he passes with his      friend into the corridor  clare  who are those two  young man  dont knownot been much about town yet  im just back from india myself  you said your brother was there whats his regiment  clare  shaking her head  youre

running ever since  young man  i dont understand a bit  youmust have had aasome one       but there is such a change in her face such rigidity of her      whole body that he stops and averts his eyes  when he looks      again she is drinking  she puts the glass down and gives a      little laugh  young man  with a sort of awe  anyway it must have been like riding at a pretty stiff fence for you to come here tonight  clare  yes  whats the other side       the young man puts out his hand and touches her arm  it is      meant for sympathy but she takes it for attraction  clare  shaking her head  not yet please  im enjoying this  may i have a cigarette       he takes out his case and gives her one  clare  letting the smoke slowly forth  yes im enjoying it  had a pretty poor time lately not enough to eat sometimes  young man  not really  how damnable  i saydo have something more substantial       clare gives a sudden gasp as if going off into hysterical      laughter but she stifles it and shakes her head  young man  a peach       arnaud brings peaches to the table  clare  smiling thank you       he fills their glasses and retreats  clare raising her glass eat and drink for tomorrow welisten       from the supperparty comes the sound of an abortive chorus      with a hey ho chivy hark forrard hark forrard tantivy      jarring out into a discordant whoop it sinks  clare  this day a stag must die  jolly old song  young man  rowdy lot  suddenly i sayi admire your pluck  clare  shaking her head havent kept my end up  lots of women do you see im too fine and not fine enough  my

touches the gardenias  with the last shilling over from my cab fare  young man  did you really  dd sporting  clare  its no use doing things by halves is it  imin for it wish me luck  she drinks and puts her glass down with a smile in for itdeep  she flings up her hands above her smiling face down down till theyre just above water and thendown down down and all over  are you sorry now you came

while i pay the bill       as he goes out into the corridor the two gentlemen reappear      clare is sitting motionless looking straight before her  dark one  a fiver you dont get her to  blond one  done       he advances to her table with his inimitable insolence and      taking the cigar from his mouth bends his stare on her and      says charmed to see you lookin so well  will you have supper      with me here tomorrow night  startled out of her reverie      clare looks up  she sees those eyes she sees beyond him the      eyes of his companionsly malevolent amusedwatching and she      just sits gazing without a word  at that regard so clear the      blond one does not wince  but rather suddenly he says thats      arranged then  halfpast eleven  so good of you  goodnight      he replaces his cigar and strolls back to his companion and in      a low voice says pay up  then at a languid hullo charles      they turn to greet the two in their nook behind the screen      clare has not moved nor changed the direction of her gaze      suddenly she thrusts her hand into the pocket of the cloak that      hangs behind her and brings out the little blue bottle which      six months ago she took from malise  she pulls out the cork      and pours the whole contents into her champagne  she lifts the      glass holds it before hersmiling as if to call a toast then      puts it to her lips and drinks  still smiling she sets the      empty glass down and lays the gardenia flowers against her      face  slowly she droops back in her chair the drowsy smile      still on her lips the gardenias drop into her lap her arms      relax her head falls forward on her breast  and the voices      behind the screen talk on and the sounds of joy from the      supperparty wax and wane       the waiter arnaud returning from the corridor passes to his      servicetable with a tall beribboned basket of fruit  putting      it down he goes towards the table behind the screen and sees      he runs up to clare  arnaud  madame madame  he listens for her breathing then suddenly catching sight of the little bottle smells at it bon dieu       at that queer sound they come from behind the screenall four      and look  the dark night bird says hallo fainted arnaud      holds out the bottle  languid lord  taking it and smelling good god  the woman bends over clare and lifts her hands arnaud rushes to his servicetable and speaks into his tube  arnaud  the boss  quick  looking up he sees the young man returning monsieur elle a fui  elle est morte  languid lord  to the young man standing there aghast  whats this friend of yours  young man  my god  she was a lady  thats all i know about her  languid lord  a lady       the blond and dark gentlemen have slipped from the room and out      of the supperpartys distant laughter comes suddenly a long      shrill gone away and the sound of the horn playing the seven      last notes of the old song this day a stag must die from the      last note of all the sound flies up to an octave higher sweet      and thin like a spirit passing till it is drowned once more in      laughter  the young man has covered his eyes with his hands      arnaud is crossing himself fervently the languid lord stands      gazing with one of the dropped gardenias twisted in his      fingers and the woman bending over clare kisses her forehead   curtain

tray stands a teapot with glasses      lemon sugar and a decanter of rum  through a huge uncurtained      window close to the street door the snowy lamplit street can be      seen and beyond it the river and a night of stars       the sound of a latchkey turned in the lock of the street door      and ann wellwyn enters a girl of seventeen with hair tied in a      ribbon and covered by a scarf

bath gown and two blankets  wellwyn  now then  he precedes her towards the door of the models room  hsssh  he opens the door and holds up the candle to show her the room  will it do  theres a couch

confirm himself in his hospitality  night like this       a sputter of snow is blown in his face  a voice says      monsieur pardon  wellwyn recoils spasmodically  a figure      moves from the lamppost to the doorway  he is seen to be young      and to have ragged clothes  he speaks again you do not      remember me monsieur  my name is ferrandit was in paris in      the champselyseesby the

by inch he has advanced      into the doorway the light from within falls on him a tall      gaunt young pagan with fair hair and reddish golden stubble of      beard a long ironical nose a little to one side and large      grey rather prominent eyes  there is a certain grace in his      figure and movements his clothes are nearly dropping off him  wellwyn  yielding to a pleasant memory  ah  yes  by the fountain  i was sitting there and you came and ate a roll and drank the water  ferrand  with faint eagerness  my breakfast  i was in poverty veree bad off  you gave me ten francs  i thought i

found you monsieuri would have been a little hole in the river tonight i was so discouraged  he inhales and puffs a long luxurious whif of smoke  very bitterly  life  he disperses the puff of smoke with his finger and stares before him  and to think that in a few minutes he will be born  monsieur  he gazes intently at wellwyn the world would reproach you for your goodness to me  wellwyn  looking uneasily at the door into the house  you think so  ah  ferrand  monsieur if he himself were on earth now there would be a little heap of gentlemen writing to the journals every day to call him sloppee sentimentalist  and what is veree funny these gentlemen they would all be most strong christians  he regards wellwyn deeply  but that will not trouble you monsieur i saw well from the first that you

quite       he passes through the door into the house  ferrand stands at      the fire with his limbs spread as it were to embrace it      smoking with abandonment  wellwyn returns stealthily dressed      in a jaeger dressinggown and bearing a pair of drawers his      trousers a pair of slippers and a sweater  wellwyn  speaking in a low voice for the door is still open  can you make these do for the moment  ferrand  je vous remercie monsieur  pointing to the screen may i retire  wellwyn  yes yes       ferrand goes behind the screen  wellwyn closes the door into      the house then goes to the window to draw the curtains  he      suddenly recoils and stands petrified with doubt  wellwyn  good lord       there is the sound of tapping on glass  against the      windowpane is pressed the face of a man wellwyn motions to him      to go away  he does not go but continues tapping  wellwyn      opens the door  there enters a square old man with a red      pendulous jawed shaking face under a

so engaged ferrand is sizing up old timson as one      dog will another  the old man glass in hand seems to have      lapsed into coma  ferrand  indicating timson  monsieur       he makes the gesture of one drinking and shakes his head  wellwyn  handing him the needle and cotton  um  afraid so       they approach timson who takes no notice  ferrand  gently  it is an old cabby is it not monsieur

suddenly      away  ferrand  to himself  poor pigeon  looking long at old timson espece de type anglais       he sits down in the firelight curls up a foot on his knee and      taking out a knife rips the stitching of a turnedup end of      trouser pinches the cloth double and puts in the preliminary      stitch of a new hemall with the swiftness of one wellaccustomed      then as if hearing a sound behind him he gets up quickly and      slips behind the screen  mrs megan attracted by the cessation      of voices has opened the door and is creeping from the models      room towards the fire  she has almost reached it before she      takes in the torpid crimson figure of old timson she halts and      puts her hand to her chesta queer figure in the firelight      garbed in the canarycoloured bath gown and rabbitswool      slippers her black matted hair straggling down on her neck      having quite digested the fact that the old man is in a sort of      stupor mrs megan goes close to the fire and sits on the little      stool smiling sideways at old timson  ferrand coming quietly      up behind examines her from above drooping his long nose as if      enquiring with it as to her condition in life then he steps back      a yard or two  ferrand  gently pardon mamoiselle  mrs megan  springing to her feet  oh  ferrand  all right all right  we are brave gents  timson  faintly roused  old up there  ferrand  trust in me mamoiselle       mrs megan responds by drawing away  ferrand  gently  we must be good comrades  this asylumit is better than a dossouse       he

little      struggle then she resigns her lips  the little stool      overturned falls with a clatter  they spring up and move      apart  the door opens and ann enters from the house in a blue      dressinggown with her hair loose and a candle held high above      her head  taking in the strange halfcircle round the stove      she recoils  then standing her ground calls in a voice      sharpened

back at wellwyn as if to draw his eyes to her but he      is gazing at the picture then catching old timsons sour      glance she grimaces at him kicking up her feet with a little      squeal  but

little brush then puts      it absentmindedly into his pocket  wellwyn  gravely  id never stand in the way of your bettering yourself timson  and by the way my daughter spoke to a friend about you today  i think something may come of it  timson  oh  oh  she did  well it might do me a bit o good  he makes for the outer door but stops  that foreigner  e sticks in my gizzard  its not as if there wasnt plenty o pigeons for im to pluck in is own gawdforsaken country  reglar jay thats what i calls im  i could tell yer something       he has opened the door and suddenly sees that ferrand himself      is standing there  sticking out his lower lip timson gives a      roll of his jaw and lurches forth into the street  owing to a      slight miscalculation his face and raised arms are plainly      visible through the window as he fortifies himself from his      battle against the cold  ferrand having closed the door      stands with his thumb acting as pointer towards this spectacle      he is now remarkably dressed in an artists squashy green hat a      frock coat too small for him a bright blue tie of knitted silk      the grey trousers that were torn wellworn brown boots and a      tan waistcoat  wellwyn  what luck today  ferrand  with a shrug  again i have beaten all london monsieur not one bite  contemplating himself  i think perhaps that for the bourgeoisie there is a little too much colour in my costume  wellwyn  contemplating him  lets seei believe ive an old top hat somewhere  ferrand  ah  monsieur merci but that i could not  it is scarcely in my character  wellwyn  true  ferrand  i have been to merchants of wine of tabac to hotels to leicester square  i have been to a society for spreading christian knowledgei thought there i would have a chance perhaps as interpreter  toujours meme chose we regret we have no situation for yousame thing everywhere  it seems there is nothing doing in this town  wellwyn  ive noticed there never is  ferrand  i was thinking monsieur that in aviation there might be a career for mebut it seems one must be trained  wellwyn  afraid so ferrand  ferrand  approaching the picture  ah  you are always working at this  you will have something of very good there monsieur  you wish to fix the type of wild savage existing ever amongst our high civilisation  cest tres chic ca  wellwyn manifests the quiet delight of an english artist actually understood  in the figures of these good citizens to whom she offers her flower you would give the idea of all the cage doors open to catch and make tame the wild bird that will surely die within  tres gentil  believe me monsieur you have there the greatest comedy of life  how anxious are the tame birds to do the wild birds good  his voice changes for the wild birds it is not funny  there is in some human souls monsieur what cannot be made tame  wellwyn  i believe you ferrand       the face of a young man appears at the window unseen      suddenly ann opens the door leading to the house  ann  daddyi want you  wellwyn  to ferrand  excuse me a minute       he goes to his daughter and they pass out  ferrand remains      at the picture  mrs megan dressed in some of anns discarded      garments has come out of the models room  she steals up      behind ferrand like a cat reaches an arm up and curls it      round his mouth  he turns and tries to seize her she      disingenuously slips away he follows  the chase circles the      tea table  he catches her lifts her up swings round with      her so that her feet fly out kisses her bentback face and      sets her down  she stands there smiling the face at the      window darkens  ferrand  la valse       he takes her with both hands by the waist she puts her hands      against his shoulders to push him ofand suddenly they are      whirling  as they whirl they bob together once or twice and      kiss  then with a warning motion towards the door she      wrenches herself free and stops beside the picture trying      desperately to appear demure  wellwyn and ann have entered      the face has vanished  ferrand  pointing to the picture  one does not comprehend all this monsieur without well studying  i was in train to interpret for mamoiselle the chiaroscuro  wellwyn  with a queer look  dont take it too seriously ferrand  ferrand  it is a masterpiece  wellwyn  my daughters just spoken to a friend professor calway hed like to meet you  could you come back a little later  ferrand  certainly mamoiselle  that will be an opening for me i trust  he goes to the street door  ann  paying no attention to him  mrs megan will you too come back in half an hour  ferrand  tres bien mamoiselle i will see that she does  we will take a little promenade together  that will do us good       he motions towards the door mrs megan all eyes follows him      out  ann  oh  daddy they are rotters  couldnt you see they were having the most high jinks  wellwyn  at his picture  i seemed to have noticed

ann  thank goodness its the vicars business to see that married people live together in his parish  wellwyn  oh  dubiously  the megans are roman catholicatheists ann  ann  with heat  then theyre all the more bound  wellwyn gives a sudden and alarmed whistle  ann  whats the matter  wellwyn  didnt you say you spoke to sir thomas too  suppose he comes in while the professors here  theyre cat and dog  ann  blankly  oh  as wellwyn strikes a match the samovar is lighted  taking up the nearly empty decanter of rum and going to the cupboard  its all right  he wont  wellwyn  well hope not       he turns back to his picture  ann  at the cupboard  daddy  wellwyn  hi  ann  there were three bottles  wellwyn  oh  ann  well  now there arent any  wellwyn  abstracted  thatll be timson  ann  with real horror  but its awful  wellwyn  it is my dear  ann  in seven days  to say nothing of the stealing  wellwyn  vexed  i blame myselfvery much  ought to have kept it locked up  ann  you ought to keep him

ann  abruptly  remove him  bertley  before i say that ann i must certainly see the individual  wellwyn  pointing to the window  there he is       in the failing light timsons face is indeed to be seen      pressed against the window pane  ann  daddy i do wish youd have thick glass put in  its so disgusting to be spied at  wellwyn going quickly to the door has opened it  what do you want  timson

room  she points to the models room  theres a broom in there  timson  disagreeably surprised  certainly never make bones about a little extranever ave in all me life  do it at onsh i will  he moves

fraud  wellwyn  in and on  mark my words hell restore thebottles  bertley  but my dear wellwyn that is stealing  wellwyn  we all have our discrepancies vicar  ann  daddy  discrepancies  wellwyn  well ann my theory is that as regards solids timsons an individualist but as regards liquids hes a socialist       or vice versa according to taste  bertley  no no we mustnt joke about it  gravely  i do think he should be spoken to  wellwyn  yes but not by me  bertley  surely youre the proper person  wellwyn  shaking his head  it was my rum vicar  look so personal       there sound a number of little tattat knocks  wellwyn  isnt that the professors knock       while ann sits down to make tea he goes to the door and opens      it  there dressed in an ulster stands a thin cleanshaved      man with a little hollow sucked into either cheek who taking      off a grey squash hat discloses a majestically bald forehead      which completely dominates all that comes below it  wellwyn  come in professor  so awfully good of you  you know canon bentley i think  calway  ah  how dyou do  wellwyn  your opinion will be invaluable professor  ann  tea professor calway       they have assembled round the tea

ii think thats what you call him  calway  not old  ann  no and quite healthya vagabond  calway  sipping  i see  yes  is it do you think chronic unemployment with a vagrant tendency  or would it be nearer the mark to say vagrancy  wellwyn  pure  oh  pure  professor  awfully human  calway  with a smile of knowledge  quite  ander  ann  breaking in  before he comes theres another  bertley  blandly  yes when you came in we were discussing what should be done with a man who drinks rumcalway pauses in the act of drinkingthat doesnt belong to him  calway  really  dipsomaniac  bertley  wellperhaps you could tell usdrink certainly changing thine to mine  the professor could see him wellwyn  ann  rising  yes do come and look at him professor calway hes in there       she points towards the models room  calway smiles      deprecatingly  ann  no really we neednt open the door  you can see him through the glass  hes more than half  calway  well i hardly  ann  oh  do  come on professor calway  we must know what to do with him  calway rises  you can stand on a chair  its all science       she draws calway to the models room which is lighted by a      glass panel in the top of the high door  canon bertley also      rises and stands watching  wellwyn hovers torn between      respect for science and dislike of espionage  ann  drawing up a chair  come on  calway  do you seriously wish me to  ann  rather  its quite safe he cant see you  calway  but he might come out       ann puts her back against the door  calway mounts the chair      dubiously and raises his head cautiously bending it more and      more downwards  ann  well  calway  he appears to besitting on the floor  wellwyn  yes thats all right       bertley covers his lips  calway  to anndescending  by the look of his face as far as one can see it i should say there was a leaning towards mania  i know the treatment       there come three loud knocks on the door  wellwyn and ann      exchange a glance of consternation  ann  whos that  wellwyn  it sounds like sir thomas  calway  sir thomas hoxton  wellwyn  nodding  awfully sorry professor  you see we  calway  not at all  only i must decline to be involved in argument with him please  bertley  he has experience  we might get his opinion dont you think  calway  on a point of reform  a jp  bertley  deprecating  my dear sirwe neednt take it       the three knocks resound with extraordinary fury  ann  youd better open the door daddy       wellwyn opens the door  sir thomas hoxton is disclosed in a      fur overcoat and top hat  his square wellcoloured face is      remarkable for a massive jaw dominating all that comes above      it  his voice is resolute  hoxton  afraid i didnt make myself heard  wellwyn  so good of you to come sir thomas  canon bertley  they greet  professor calway you know i think  hoxton  ominously  i do       they almost greet  an awkward pause  ann  blurting it out  that old cabman i told you ofs been drinking fathers rum  bertley  we were just discussing whats to be done with him sir thomas  one wants to do the very best of course  the question of reform is always delicate  calway  i beg your pardon  there is no question here  hoxton  abruptly  oh  is he in the house  ann  in there  hoxton  works for you eh  wellwyn  eryes  hoxton  lets have a look at him       an embarrassed pause  bertley  wellthe fact is sir thomas  calway  when last under observation  ann  he was sitting on the floor  wellwyn  i dont want the old fellow to feel hes being made a show of  disgusting to be spied at ann  ann  you cant daddy  hes drunk  hoxton  never mind miss wellwyn  hundreds of these fellows before me in my time  at calway  the only thing is a sharp lesson  calway  i disagree  ive seen the man what he requires is steady control and the bobbins treatment       wellwyn approaches them with fearful interest  hoxton  not a bit of it  he wants one for his knob  brace em up its the only thing  bertley  personally i think that if he were spoken to seriously  calway  i cannot walk arm in arm with a crab  hoxton  approaching calway  i beg your pardon  calway  moving back a little youre moving backwards sir thomas  ive told you before convinced reactionaryism in these days       there comes a single knock on the street door  bertley  looking at his watch  dyou know im rather afraid this may be our young husband wellwyn  i told him halfpast four  wellwyn  oh  ah  yes  going towards the two reformers  shall we go into the house professor and settle the question quietly while the vicar sees a young man  calway  pale with uncompleted statement and gravitating insensibly in the direction indicated  the merest sense of continuitya simple instinct for order  hoxton  following  the only way to get order sir is to bring the disorderly up with a round turn  calway turns to him in the doorway  you people without practical experience  calway  if youll listen to me a minute  hoxton  i can show you in a mo       they vanish through the door  wellwyn  i was afraid of it  bertley  the two points of view  pleasant to see such keenness i may want you wellwyn  and ann perhaps had better not be present  wellwyn  relieved  quite so  my dear       ann goes reluctantly  wellwyn opens the street door  the      lamp outside has just been lighted and by its gleam is seen      the figure of rory megan thin pale youthful  ann turning at      the door into the house gives him a long inquisitive look      then goes  wellwyn  is that megan  megan  yus  wellwyn  come in       megan comes in  there follows an awkward silence during      which wellwyn turns up the light then goes to the tea table      and pours out a glass of tea and rum  bertley  kindly  now my boy how is it that you and your wife are

agamble  bertley  im afraid were wandering a little from the point husband and wife should be together  you were brought up to that your father and mother  megan  never was  wellwyn  turning from the picture  the question is megan will you take your wife home  shes a good little soul  megan  she never let me know it       there is a feeble knock on the door  wellwyn  well now come  here she is       he points to the door and stands regarding megan with his      friendly smile  megan  with a gleam of responsiveness  i might perhaps to please you sir  bertley  appropriating the gesture  capital i thought we should get on in time  megan  yus       wellwyn opens the door  mrs megan and ferrand are revealed      they are about to enter but catching sight of megan      hesitate  bertley  come in  come in       mrs megan enters stolidly  ferrand following stands apart      with an air of extreme detachment  megan after a quick glance      at them both remains unmoved  no one has noticed that the      door of the models room has been opened and that the unsteady      figure of old timson is standing there  bertley a little awkward in the presence of ferrandto the megans  this begins a new chapter  we wont improve the occasion no need       megan turning towards his wife makes her a gesture as if to      say here  lets get out of this  bentley  yes yes youll like to get home at oncei

presence they all turn  timson  waking up and looking round him  well praps id better go       assisted by wellwyn he lurches gingerly off the dais towards      the door which wellwyn holds open for him  timson  mechanically  where to sir       receiving no answer he passes out touching his hat and the      door is closed  wellwyn  ann       ann goes back whence she came       bertley steadily regarding mrs megan who has put her arm up      in front of her face beckons to ferrand and the young man      comes gravely forward  bertley  young people this is very dreadful  mrs megan lowers her

minute wellyn  i must finish speaking to her  he motions mrs megan towards the models room we cant leave the matter thus  ferrand  suavely do you desire my company monsieur       bertley with a prohibitive gesture of his hand shepherds the      reluctant mrs megan into the models room  wellwyn  sorrowfully  you shouldnt have done this ferrand  it wasnt the square thing  ferrand  with dignity  monsieur i feel that i am in the wrong it was stronger than me       as he speaks sir thomas hoxton and professor calway enter      from the house  in the dim light and the full cry of      argument they do not notice the figures at the fire  sir      thomas hoxton leads towards the street door  hoxton  no sir i repeat if the country once commits itself to your views of reform its as good as doomed  calway  i seem to have heard that before sir thomas  and let me say at once that your hittymissy cartload of bricks regime  hoxton  is a deuced sight better sir than your grandmotherly methods  what the old fellow wants is a shock  with all this socialistic mollycoddling youre losing sight of the individual  calway  swiftly you sir with your devil take the hindmost have never even seen him       sir thomas hoxton throwing back a gesture of disgust steps      out into the night and falls heavily professor calway      hastening to his rescue falls more heavily still       timson momentarily roused from slumber on the doorstep sits      up  hoxton  struggling to his knees  damnation  calway  sitting  how simultaneous       wellwyn and ferrand approach hastily  ferrand pointing to timson  monsieur it was true it seems they had lost sight of the individual       a policeman has appeared under the street lamp  he picks up      hoxtons hat  constable  anything wrong sir  hoxton

wellwyn returning to the fire      stands brooding and gazing at his extinct cigarette  wellwyn  to himself  bad lotlow type  no method  no theory       in the open doorway appear ferrand and mrs megan  they      stand unseen looking at him  ferrand is more ragged if      possible than on christmas eve  his chin and cheeks are      clothed in a reddish golden beard  mrs megans dress is not      so woebegone but her face is white her eyes darkcircled      they whisper  she slips back into the shadow of the doorway      wellwyn turns at the sound and stares at ferrand in      amazement  ferrand  advancing  enchanted to see you monsieur  he looks round the empty room  you are leaving  wellwyn  noddingthen taking the young mans hand  how goes it  ferrand  displaying himself simply  as you see monsieur  i have done of my best  it still flies from me  wellwyn  sadlyas if against his will  ferrand it will always fly       the young foreigner shivers suddenly from head to foot then      controls himself with a great effort  ferrand  dont say that monsieur  it is too much the echo of my heart  wellwyn  forgive me  i didnt mean to pain you  ferrand  drawing nearer the fire  that old cabby monsieur you rememberthey tell me he nearly succeeded to gain happiness the other day       wellwyn nods  ferrand  and those sirs so interested in him with their theories he has worn them out  wellwyn nods  that goes without saying and now they wish for him the lethal chamber  wellwyn  startled  how did you know that       there is silence  ferrand  staring into the fire  monsieur while i was on the road this time i fell ill of a fever  it seemed to me in my illness that i saw the truthhow i was wasting in this worldi would never be good for any onenor any one for meall would go by and i never of itfame and fortune and peace even the necessities of life ever mocking me       he draws closer to the fire spreading his fingers to the      flame  and while he is speaking through the doorway mrs      megan creeps in to listen  ferrand  speaking on into the fire  and i saw monsieur so plain that i should be vagabond all my days and my days short i dying in the end the death of a dog  i saw it all in my fever clear as that flamethere was nothing for us others but the herb of death  wellwyn takes his arm and presses it  and so monsieur i wished to die  i told no one of my fever  i lay out on the groundit was verree cold  but they would not let me die on the roads of their parishesthey took me to an institution monsieur i looked in their eyes while i lay there and i saw more clear than the blue heaven that they thought it best that i should die although they would not let me  then monsieur naturally my spirit rose and i said so much the worse for you  i will live a little more  one is made like that  life is sweet monsieur  wellwyn  yes ferrand life is sweet  ferrand  that little girl you had here monsieur  wellwyn nods in her too there is something of wildsavage  she must have joy of life  i have seen her since i came back  she has embraced the life of joy  it is not quite the same thing  he lowers his voice she is lost monsieur as a stone that sinks in water  i can see if she cannot  as wellwyn makes a movement of distress  oh  i am not to blame for that monsieur  it had well begun before i knew her  wellwyn  yes yesi was afraid of it at the time       mrs megan turns silently and slips away  feerrand  i do my best for her monsieur but look at me  besides i am not good for herit is not good for simple souls to be with those who see things clear  for the great part of mankind to see anythingis fatal  wellwyn  even for you it seems  ferrand  no monsieur  to be so near to death has done me good i shall not lack courage any more till the wind blows on my grave since i saw you monsieur i have been in three institutions  they are palaces  one may eat upon the floorthough it is truefor kingsthey eat too much of skilly there  one little thing they lackthose palaces  it is understanding of the uman heart  in them tame birds pluck wild birds naked  wellwyn  they mean well  ferrand  ah  monsieur i am loafer wasterwhat you likefor all that  bitterly  poverty is my only crime  if i were rich should i not be simply veree original ighly respected with soul above commerce travelling to see the world  and that young girl would she not be that

shaking his head  not a bit of it im hopeless too  ferrand  eagerly  monsieur it is just that  you understand when we are with you we feel somethingherehe touches his heart  if i had one prayer to make it would be good god give me to understand  those sirs with their theories they can clean our skins and chain our abitsthat soothes for them the aesthetic sense it gives them too their good little importance  but our spirits they cannot touch for they nevare understand  without that monsieur all is dry as a parched skin of orange  wellwyn  dont be so bitter  think of all the work they do  ferrand  monsieur of their industry i say nothing  they do a good work while they attend with their theories to the sick and the tame old and the good unfortunate deserving  above all to the little children  but monsieur when all is done there are always us hopeless ones  what can they do with me monsieur with that girl or with that old man  ah  monsieur we too ave our qualities we othersit

ask your pardon i am talking  if i could smoke monsieur       wellwyn hands him a tobacco pouch and he rolls a cigarette      with his yellowstained fingers  ferrand  the good god made me so that i would rather walk a whole month of nights hungry with the stars than sit one single day making round business on an office stool  it is not to my advantage  i cannot help it that i am a vagabond  what would you have  it is stronger than me  he looks suddenly at wellwyn monsieur i say to you things i have never said  wellwyn  quietly  go on go on  there is silence  ferrand  suddenly  monsieur  are

 hatless and with drowned hair enveloped in the policemans      waterproof  some curious persons bring up the rear jostling      in the doorway among whom is timson carrying in his hands the      policemans dripping waterproof leg pieces  ferrand  starting forward  monsieur it is that little girl  wellwyn  whats happened  constable  whats happened       the constable and loafer have laid the

    wellwyn fetches the decanter  with the little there is left      ferrand chafes the girls hands and forehead and pours some      between her lips  but there is no response from the inert      body  ferrand  her soul is still away monsieur       wellwyn seizing the decanter pours into it tea and boiling      water  constable  its never drownin sirher head was hardly under i was on to her like

is helen julian a pretty      darkhaired young woman absorbed in thoughts of her own  the      voices are tuned to the pitch of heated discussion as the      curtain rises   the dean i disagree with you stephen absolutely entirely disagree  more  i cant help it  mendip  remember a certain war stephen  were your chivalrous notions any good then  and what was winked at in an obscure young member is anathema for an under secretary of state  you cant afford  more  to follow my conscience  thats new mendip  mendip  idealism can be out of place my friend  the dean  the government is dealing here with a wild lawless race on whom i must say i think sentiment is rather wasted  more  god made them dean  mendip  i have my doubts  the dean  they have proved themselves faithless  we have the right to chastise  more  if i hit a little man in the eye and he hits me back have i the right to chastise him  sir john  we didnt begin this business  more  what  with our missionaries and our trading  the dean  it is news indeed that the work of civilization may be justifiably met by murder  have you forgotten glaive and morlinson  sir john  yes  and that poor fellow groome and his wife  more  they went into a wild country against the feeling of the tribes on their own business  what has the nation to do with the mishaps of gamblers  sir john  we cant stand by and see our own flesh and blood illtreated  the dean  does our rule bring blessingor does it not stephen  more  sometimes but with all my soul i deny the fantastic superstition that our rule can benefit a people like this a nation of one race as different from ourselves as dark from lightin colour religion every mortal thing  we can only pervert their natural instincts  the dean  that to me is an unintelligible point of view  mendip  go into that philosophy of yours a little deeper stephen it spells stagnation  there are no fixed stars on this earth nations cant let each other alone  more  big ones could let little ones alone  mendip  if they could thered be no big ones  my dear fellow we know little nations are your hobby but surely office should have toned you down  sir john  ive served my country fifty years and i say she is not in the wrong  more  i hope to serve her fifty sir john and i say she is  mendip  there are moments when such things cant be said more  more  theyll be said by me tonight mendip  mendip

more  must speak the truth sometimes even at that risk  sir john  it is not the truth  mendip  the greater the truth the greater the libel and the greater the resentment of the person libelled  the dean  trying to bring matters to a blander level  my dear stephen even if you were rightwhich i denyabout the initial merits there surely comes a point where the individual conscience must resign it self to the countrys feeling  this has become a question of national honour  sir john  well said james  more  nations are bad judges of their honour dean  the dean  i shall not follow you there  more  no  its an awkward word  katherine  stopping the dean  uncle james  please       more looks at her intently  sir john  so youre going to put yourself at the head of the cranks ruin your career and make me ashamed that youre my soninlaw  more  is a man only to hold beliefs when theyre popular  youve stood up to be shot at often enough sir john  sir john  never by my country  your speech will be in all the foreign presstrust em for seizing on anything against us  a showup before other countries  more  you admit the showup  sir john  i do not sir  the dean  the position has become impossible

mendip  no no these things are not so simple as all that  more  theres no reason in the world mendip why the rules of chivalry should not apply to nations at least as well as todogs  mendip  my dear friend are you to become that hapless kind of outcast a champion of lost causes  more  this cause is not lost  mendip  right or wrong as lost as ever was cause in all this world there was never a time when the word patriotism stirred mob sentiment as it does now  ware mob stephenware mob  more  because general sentiments against me ia public manam to deny my faith  the point is not whether im right

our honeymoon going up ben lawers  you were lying on your face in the heather you said it was like kissing a loved woman  there was a lark singingyou said that was the voice of ones worship  the hills

in to clear the tablevery low  i ask you not       he does not answer and she goes out  more  to the servant later please henry later       the servant retires  more still stands looking down at the      diningtable then putting his hand to his throat as if to free      it from the grip of his collar he pours out a glass of water      and drinks it of  in the street outside the bay window two      street musicians a harp and a violin have taken up their      stand and after some twangs and scrapes break into music      more goes towards the sound and draws aside one curtain  after      a moment he returns to the table and takes up the notes of the      speech  he is in an agony of indecision  more  a cur       he seems about to tear his notes across  then changing his      mind turns them over and over muttering  his voice gradually      grows louder till he is declaiming to the empty room the      peroration of his speech  more        we have arrogated to our land the title champion of freedom foe of oppression  is that indeed a bygone glory  is it not worth some sacrifice of our pettier dignity to avoid laying another stone upon its grave to avoid placing before the searchlight eyes of history the spectacle of yet one more piece of national cynicism  we are about to force our will and our dominion on a race that has always been free that loves its country and its independence as much as ever we love ours  i cannot sit silent tonight and see this begin  as we are tender of our own land so we should be of the lands of others  i love my country  it is because i love my country that i raise my voice  warlike in spirit these people may bebut they have no chance against ourselves  and war on such however agreeable to the blind moment is odious to the future the great heart of mankind ever beats in sense and sympathy with the weaker  it is against this great heart of mankind that we are going in the name of justice and civilization we pursue this policy but by justice we shall hereafter be judged and by civilizationcondemned       while he is speaking a little figure has flown along the      terrace outside in the direction of the music but has stopped      at the sound of his voice and stands in the open window      listeninga darkhaired darkeyed child in a blue      dressinggown caught up in her hand  the street musicians      having reached the end of a tune are silent       in the intensity of mores feeling a wineglass gripped too      strongly breaks and falls in pieces onto a fingerbowl  the      child starts forward into the room  more

young man enters with a note in his hand  more  hello steel       the street musicians have again begun to play  steel  from sir johnby special messenger from the war office  more  reading the note the ball is opened       he stands brooding over the note and steel looks at him      anxiously  he is a dark sallow thinfaced young man with the      eyes of one who can attach himself to people and

to the diningtable      and picks up his sheaf of notes  hiding them with his sleeve      he goes back to the window where he again stands hesitating  steel  chief gem imitating  we must show impudence at last that dignity is not asleep  more  moving out on to the terrace  nice quiet night  steel  this to the cottage hospitalshall i say you will preside  more  no       steel writes then looking up and seeing that more is no longer      there he goes to the window looks to right and left returns      to the bureau and is about to sit down again when a thought      seems to strike him with consternation  he goes again to the      window  then snatching up his hat he passes hurriedly out      along the terrace  as he vanishes katherine comes in from the      hall  after looking out on to the terrace she goes to the bay      window stands there listening then comes restlessly back into      the room  olive creeping quietly from behind the curtain      clasps her round the waist  katherine  o my darling  how you startled me  what are you doing down here you wicked little sinner  olive  i explained all that to daddy  we neednt go into it again need we  katherine  where is daddy

against her  olive  have you got an ache  katharine  right through me darling  olive  oh       the musicians strike up a dance  olive  oh  mummy  i must just dance       she kicks off her lisle blue

the street comes the noise of distant shouting  olive  listen uncle  isnt it a particular noise       hubert and katherine listen with all their might and olive      stares at their faces  hubert goes to the window  the sound      comes nearer  the shouted words are faintly heard  pyper      warour force crosses frontiersharp fightinpyper  katherine  breathless yes  it is       the street cry is

wreford comes in from the      hall  she is an elderly woman endowed with a motherly grimness      she fixes olive with her eye then suddenly becomes conscious of      the street cry  nurse  oh dont

  they do not dare to kiss and hubert goes out very stiff and      straight in the doorway passing steel of whom he takes no      notice  steel hesitates and would go away  katherine  come in mr steel  steel  the deputation from toulmin ought to be here mrs more its twelve  olive  having made a little ball of newspaperslyly  mr steel catch       she throws and steel catches it in silence  katherine  go upstairs wont you darling  olive  maynt i read in the window mummy  then i shall see if any soldiers pass  katherine  no  you can go out on the terrace a little and then you must go up       olive goes reluctantly out on to the terrace  steel  awful news this morning of that pass  and have you seen these  reading from the newspaper we will have no truck with the jargon of the degenerate who vilifies his country at such a moment the member for toulmin has earned for himself the contempt of all virile patriots  he takes up a second journal  there is a certain type of public man who even at his own expense cannot resist the itch to advertise himself  we would at moments of national crisis muzzle such persons as we muzzle dogs that we suspect of incipient rabies         theyre in full cry after him  katherine  i mind much more all the creatures who are always flinging mud at the country making him their hero suddenly  you know whats in his mind  steel  oh  we must get him to give up that idea of lecturing everywhere against the war mrs more we simply must  katherine  listening  the deputations come  go and fetch him mr steel  hell be in his room at the house       steel goes out and katherine stands at bay  in a moment he      opens the door again to usher in the deputation then retires      the four gentlemen have entered as if conscious of grave issues      the first and most picturesque is james home a thin tall      greybearded man with plentiful hair contradictious eyebrows      and the halfshy halfbold manners alternately rude and over      polite of one not accustomed to society yet secretly much      taken with himself  he is dressed in rough tweeds with a red      silk tie slung through a ring and is closely followed by mark      wace a waxy roundfaced man of middleage with sleek dark      hair traces of whisker and a smooth way of continually rubbing      his hands together as if selling something to an esteemed      customer  he is rather stout wears dark clothes with a large      gold chain  following him comes charles shelder a lawyer of      fifty with a bald eggshaped head and gold pincenez  he has      little side whiskers a leathery yellowish skin a rather kind      but watchful and dubious face and when he speaks seems to have      a plum in his mouth which arises from the preponderance of his      shaven upper lip  last of the deputation comes william banning      an energeticlooking squareshouldered selfmade countryman      between fifty and sixty with grey moustaches ruddy face and      lively brown eyes  katherine  how

window is all the other furniture  through this window the blue night is seen where a mist is rolled out flat amongst trees so that only dark clumps of boughs show here and there beneath a moonlit sky  as the curtain rises katherine with brush arrested is listening  she begins again brushing her hair then stops and taking a packet of letters from a drawer of her dressingtable reads  through the just open door behind her comes the voice of olive  olive  mummy  im awake       but katherine goes on reading and olive steals into the room in      her nightgown  olive  at katherines elbowexamining

blood was running from it and he kept trying to stop itoh  kitby kissing it she pauses stifled by emotion  then i heard wreford laugh and say vultures didnt touch live bodies  and there came a voice from somewhere calling out oh  god im dying  and wreford began to swear at it and i heard hubert say dont wreford let the poor fellow be  but the voice went on and on moaning and crying out ill lie here all night dyingand then ill die  and wreford dragged himself along the ground his face all devilish like a man whos going to kill  katherine  my dear  how ghastly  helen  still that voice went on and i saw wreford take up the dead mans gun  then hubert got upon his feet and went tottering along so feebly so dreadfullybut before he could reach and stop him wreford fired at the man who was crying  and hubert called out you brute and fell right down  and when wreford saw him lying there he began to moan and sob but hubert never stirred  then it all got black againand i could see a dark womanthing creeping first to the man without a head then to wreford then to hubert and it touched him and sprang away  and it cried out aaiah pointing out at the mist  look  out there  the dark things

stone crashes through one of      the panes  it is followed by a hoarse shout of laughter and a      hearty groan  a second stone crashes through the glass  more      turns for a moment with a contemptuous look towards the      street and the flare of the chinese lanterns lights up his      face  then as if forgetting all about the din outside he      moves back into the room looks round him and lets his head      droop  the din rises louder and louder a third stone crashes      through  more raises his head again and clasping his hands      looks straight before him  the footman

slips behind the chintz windowcurtain  a woman has entered      who is clearly the original of the large photograph  she is not      strictly pretty but there is charm in her pale resolute face      with its mocking lips flexible brows and greenish eyes whose      lids square above them have short dark lashes  she is      dressed in blue and her fair hair is coiled up under a cap and      motorveil  she comes in swiftly and closes the door behind      her becomes irresolute then suddenly deciding moves towards      the door into the house  mercy slips from behind her curtain to      make off but at that moment the door into the house is opened      and she has at once to slip back again into covert  it is ivy      who has appeared  ivy  amazed  oh  mrs strangway       evidently

then turning to the door says in a low voice  go  go please quickly do what you will  i wont hurt youcantbutgo  he opens the door  beatrice  greatly moved  thank you       she passes him with her head down and goes out quickly      strangway stands unconsciously tearing at the little birdcage      and while he tears at it he utters a moaning sound  the      terrified mercy peering from behind the curtain and watching      her chance slips to the still open door but in her haste and      fright she knocks against it and strangway sees her  before he      can stop her she has fled out on to the green and away       while he stands there paralysed the door from the house is      opened and mrs burlacombe approaches him in a queer hushed      way  mrs burlacombe  her eyes mechanically fixed on

excited whispering and faint giggles come from the deepest      yewtree shade made ghostly by the white faces and the frocks of      young girls continually flitting up and back in the blackness a      girls figure comes flying out from the porch down the path of      light and joins the stealthy group  whispering voice of mercy  wheres e got to now gladys  whispering voice of gladys  eve just

of a hymn  gladys  nearer my god to thee  voice of mercy  twill be funny with no one ardly singin       the sound of the old hymn sung by just six voices comes out to      them rather sweet and clear  gladys  softly  tis pretty tu  why  theyre only singin one verse       a moments silence and the voice speaks uplifted pronouncing      the blessing the peace of god as the last words die away      dark figures from the inn approach over the grass till quite a      crowd seems standing there without a word spoken  then from out      of the church porch come the congregation  tim clyst first

vestry to the church porch  he stands plainly visible in the      lighted porch locking the door then steps forward  just as he      reaches the edge of the porch a low hiss breaks the silence      it swells very gradually into a long hissing groan  strangway      stands motionless his hand over his eyes staring into the      darkness  a girls figure can be seen to break out of the      darkness and rush away  when at last the groaning has died into      sheer expectancy strangway drops his hand  strangway  in a loco voice  yes  im glad  is jarland there  freman  hes ereno thanks to yu  hsss

visible over the edge of the      bench  ivy catches up the tambourine and to her beating and      humming the dancers dance on       suddenly gladys stops like a wild animal surprised and cranes

shins up the ladder and seizes the lantern  ivy drops      the tambourine  they all fly to the big doors and vanish into      the moonlight pulling the door nearly to again after them       there is the sound of scrabbling at the hitch of the side door      and strangway comes into the nearly dark barn  out in the night      the owl is still hooting  he closes the door and that sound is      lost  like a man walking in his sleep he goes up to the      ladder takes the rope in his hand and makes a noose  he can      be heard breathing and in the darkness the motions of his hands      are dimly seen freeing his throat and putting the noose round      his neck  he stands swaying to and fro at the foot of the      ladder then with a sigh sets his foot on it to mount  one of      the big doors creaks and opens in the wind letting in a broad      path of moonlight       strangway stops freeing his neck from the noose he walks      quickly up the track of moonlight whitened from head to foot      to close the doors       the sound of his boots on the bare floor has awakened tibby      jarland  struggling out of her hay nest she stands staring at      his whitened figure and bursts suddenly

lord       as lord william appears james overcome by reminiscences      salutes and is mechanically answered  lord william has      charm  his hair and moustache are crisp and just beginning to      grizzle  his bearing is free easy and only faintly armoured      he will go far to meet you any day  he is in full evening      dress  lord w  cheerfully  i say poulder what have you and james been doing to the press  liberty of the pressit isnt what it was but there is a limit  where is he       he turns to jams between whom and himself there is still the      freemasonry of the trenches  james  pointing to poulder  beind the parapet me lord       the press mopes out from where he has involuntarily been      screened by poulder who looks at james severely  lord william      hides a smile  press  very glad to meet you lord william  my presence down here is quite involuntary  lord w  with a charming smile  i know  the press has to put its erto go to the bottom of everything  wheres this

look after them lord william catches      sight of his back  lord w  i must apologise sir  can i brush you  press  dusting himself  thanks its only behind  he opens his notebook  now lord william if youd kindly outline your views on the national situation after such a narrow escape from death i feel they might have a moral effect  my paper as you know is concerned withthe deeper aspect of things  by the way what do you value your house and collection at  lord w  twisting his little mustache  really i cant  really  press  might i say a quarter of a millionlifted in two seconds and a halfhundred thousand to the second  it brings it home you know  lord w  no no dash it  no  press  disappointed  i seenot draw attention to your property in the present excited state of public feeling  well suppose we approach it from the viewpoint of the antisweating dinner  i have the list of guestsvery weighty  lord w  taken some liftingwouldnt they  press  seriously  may i say that you designed the dinner to soften the tension at this crisis  you saw that case i suppose this morning of the woman dying of starvation in bethnal green  lord w  desperately  yesyes  ive been horribly affected  i always knew this slump would come after the war sooner or later  press  writing        had predicted slump  lord w  you see ive been an antisweating man for years and i thought if only we could come together now         press  nodding  i seei see  get society interested in the sweated through the dinner  i have the menu here he produces it  lord w  good god manmore than that  i want to show the people that we stand side by side with them as we did in the trenches  the whole things too jolly awful  i lie awake over it       he walks up and down  press  scribbling  one moment please  ill just get that down too jolly awfullies awake over it  was wearing a white waistcoat with pearl buttons  at a sign of resentment from his victim i want the human touch lord williamits everything in my paper what do you say about this attempt to bomb you  lord w  well in a way i think its dd natural  press  scribbling  lord william thought it dd natural  lord w  overhearing  no no dont put that down  what i mean is i should like to get hold of those fellows that are singing the marseillaise about the streetsfellows that have been in the war real sports they are you knowthorough good chaps at bottomand say to them have a feeling heart boys put yourself in my position  i dont believe a bit theyd want to bomb me then       he walks up and down  press  scribbling and muttering the idea of brotherhood dyou mind my saying that  word brotherhoodalways effectivealways       he writes  lord e  bewildered  brotherhood well its pure accident that im here and theyre there  all the same i cant pretend to be starving  cant go out into hyde park and stand on a tub can i but if i could only show them what i feeltheyre such good chaps poor devils  press  i quite appreciate  he writes  camel and needles eye you were at eton and oxford  your constituency i know  clubs  but i can get all that  is it your view that christianity is on the upgrade lord william  lord w  dubious  what dyou mean by christianitylovingkindness and that  of course i think that dogmas got the knock       he walks  press  writing  lord william thought dogma had got the knock i should like you just to develop your definition of christianity lovingkindness strikes rather a new note  lord w  new  what about the sermon on the mount  press  writing  refers to sermon on mount  i take it you dont belong to any church lord william  lord w  exasperated  well reallyive been baptised and that sort of thing  but look here  press  oh  you can trust mei shant say anything that youll regret  now do you consider that a religious revival would help to quiet the country  lord w  well i think it would be a deuced good thing if everybody were a bit more kind  press  ah  musing  i feel that your views are strikingly original lord william  if you could just open out on them a little more  how far would you apply kindness in practice  lord w  can you apply it in theory  press  i believe it is done  but would you allow yourself to be blown up with impunity  lord w  well thats a bit extreme  but i quite sympathise with this chap  imagine yourself in his shoes  he sees a huge house all these bottles us swilling them down perhaps hes got a starving wife or consumptive kids  press  writing and murmuring  umm  kids  lord w  he thinks but for the grace of god there swill i  why should that blighter have everything and i nothing and all that  press  writing  and all that  eagerly  yes  lord w  and graduallyyou seethis contrastbecomes an obsession with him  theres got to be an example made he thinks ander he makes it dont you know  press  writing  yees  andwhen youre the example  lord w  well you feel a bit blue of course  but my point is that you quite see it  press  from the other world  do you believe in a future life lord william  the public took a lot of interest in the question if you remember at the time of the war  it might revive at any moment if theres to be a revolution  lord w  the wish is always father to the thought isnt it  press  yes  buterdoesnt the question of a future life rather bear on your point about kindness  if there isnt onewhy be kind  lord w  well i should say one oughtnt to be kind for any motive thats selfinterest but just because one feels it dont you know  press  writing vigorously  thats very newvery new  lord w  simply  you chaps are wonderful  press  doubtfully  you mean werewere  lord w  no really  you have such a dd hard time  it must be perfectly beastly to interview fellows like me  press  oh  not at all lord william  not at all  i assure you compared with a literary man itsits almost heavenly  lord w  you must have a wonderful knowledge of things  press  bridling a little  welli shouldnt say that  lord w  i dont see how you can avoid it  you turn your hands to everything  press  modestly  wellyes yes  lord w  i say  is there really going to be a revolution or are you making it up you press  press  we dont know  we never know whether we come before the event or it comes before us  lord w  thatsvery deepvery dip  dyou mind lending me your notebook a moment  id like to stick that down  all right ill use the other end  the press

lord w  well as a man  press  as a man i think its rotten  lord w  jotting  rotten  and as a pressman  press  smiling  prime  lord w  what  like a stilton cheese  ha ha       he is about to write  press  my stunt lord william  you said that       he jots it on his cuff  lord w  but look here  would you say that a strong press movement would help to quiet the country  press  well as you ask me lord william ill tell you  no newspapers for a month would do the trick  lord w  jotting  by jove  thats brilliant  press  yes but i should starve  he suddenly looks up and his eyes like gimlets bore their way into lord williams pleasant troubled face  lord william you could do me a real kindness authorise me to go and interview the fellow who left the bomb here ive got his address  i promise you to do it most discreetly  fact iswellim in low water  since the war we simply cant get sensation enough for the new taste  now if i could have an article headed bombed and bombersort of double interview you know itd very likely set me on my legs again  very earnestly  look he holds out his frayed wristbands  lord w  grasping his hand  my dear chap certainly  go and interview this blighter

examines the foundations of his house       a voice calls bill the press snaps the notebook to and      looks up  there where the communication trench runs in      stands a tall and elegant woman in

hornblower had a father  i believe he was spontaneous  but dodo why all thisthis attitude to the hornblowers       she purses her lips and makes a gesture as of pushing persons      away  hillcrist  because theyre pushing  jill  thats only because we are as mother would say and theyre notyet  but why not let them be  hillcrist  you cant  jill  why  hillcrist  it takes generations to learn to live

where do you get your lingo  jill  keep to the point dodo  hillcrist  well jill all lifes a struggle between people at different stages of development in different positions with different amounts of social influence and property  and the only thing is to have rules of the game and keep them  new people like the hornblowers havent learnt those rules their only rule is to get all they can  jill  darling dont prose  theyre not half as bad as you think  hillcrist  well when i sold hornblower longmeadow and the cottages i certainly found him all right  all the same hes got the cloven hoof  warming up  his influence in deepwater is thoroughly bad those potteries of his are demoralisingthe whole atmosphere of the place is changing  it was a thousand pities he ever came here and discovered

hillcrist  yes and i want fellows  ring that bell  jill  crossing to the bell  shall i tell you my definition of a gentleman  a man who gives the hornblower his due  she rings the bell  and i think mother ought to call on them  rolf says old hornblower resents it fearfully that shes never made a sign to chloe the three years shes been here  hillcrist  i dont interfere with your mother in such matters  she may go and call on the devil himself if she likes  jill  i know youre ever so much better than she is  hillcrist  thats respectful  jill  you do keep your prejudices out of your phiz  but mother literally looks down her nose  and she never forgives an h theyd get the hell from her if they took the hinch  hillcrist  jillyour language  jill  dont slime out of it dodo  i say mother ought

can see you      very sharply and you can hardly see that he can see you he      can break into a smile at any moment which has no connection      with him as it were  by a certain hurt look however when      bidding is slow he discloses that he is not merely an      auctioneer but has in him elements of the human being  he can      wink with anyone and is dressed in a snugbrown suit with a      perfectly unbuttoned waistcoat a low turned down collar and      small black and white sailor knot tie  while he is settling      his papers the hillcrists settle themselves tensely  chloe      has drunk her water and leaned back again with the smelling      salts to her nose  rolf leans forward in the seat beside her      looking sideways at jill  a solicitor with a grey beard has      joined

the solicitor rises and reads the conditions of sale in a      voice which no one practically can hear  just as he begins to      read these conditions of sale charles hornblower enters at      back  he stands a moment glancing round at the hillcrist and      twirling his moustache then moves along to his wife and      touches her  charles  chloe arent you well       in the start which she gives

again the room is empty and dark same for      moonlight coming in through the french window which is open       the figure of chloe in a black cloak appears outside in the      moonlight she peers in moves past comes bank hesitatingly      enters  the cloak fallen back reveals a white evening dress      and that magpie figure stands poised watchfully in the dim      light then flaps unhappily left and right as if she could not      keep still  suddenly she stands listening  rolfs voice  outside  chloe  chloe       he appears  chloe  going to the window  what are you doing here  rolf  what are you  i only followed you  chloe  go away  rolf  whats the matter  tell me  chloe  go away and dont say anything  oh  the roses  she has put her nose into some roses in a bowl on a big stand close to

wait for me down in the drive if you want to       rolf starts to go stops looks at her and does go  chloe      with a little moaning sound flutters again magpielike up      and down then stands by the window listening  voices are      heard left  she darts out of the window and away to the      right as hillcrist and jill come in  they have turned up the      electric light and come down in frond of the fireplace where      hillcrist sits in an armchair and jill on the arm of it  they      are in undress evening attire  hillcrist  now tell me  jill  there isnt much dodo  i was in an awful funk for fear i should meet any of the others and of course i did meet rolf but i told him some lie and he took me to her roomboudoir they call it isnt boudoir a dugout word  hillcrist  meditatively  the sulking room  well  jill  she was sitting like this  she buries her chin in her hands wide her elbows on her knees  and she said in a sort of fierce way what do you want  and i said im awfully sorry but i thought you might like it  hillcrist  well  jill  she looked at me hard and said i suppose you know all about it  and i said only vaguely because of course i dont and she said well it was decent of you to come  dodo she looks like a lost soul  what has she done  hillcrist  she committed her real crime when she married young hornblower without telling him  she came out of a certain world to do it  jill  oh  staring in front of her is it very awful in that world dodo  hillcrist  uneasy  i dont know jill  some can stand it i suppose some cant  i dont know which sort she is  jill  one thing im sure of shes awfully fond of chearlie  hillcrist  thats bad thats very bad  jill  and shes frightened horribly  i think shes desperate  hillcrist  women like that are pretty tough jill dont judge her too much by your own feelings  jill  no onlyoh  it was beastly and of course i dried up  hillcrist  feelingly  hm  one always does  but perhaps it was as well youd have been blundering in a dark passage  jill  i just said father and i feel awfully sorry if theres anything we can do  hillcrist  that was risky jill  jill  disconsolately i had to say something  im glad i went anyway  i feel more human  hillcrist  we had to fight for our home  i should have felt like a traitor if i hadnt  jill  im not enjoying home tonight dodo  hillcrist  i never could hate proper its

thought i heardlouderis these anybody out there       no answer  jill springs up and runs to the window  jill  you       she dives through to the right and returns holding chloes      hand and drawing her forward  come in  its only us  to hillcrist  dodo  hillcrist  flustered but making a show of courtesy  good evening  wont you sit down  jill  sit down youre all shaky       she makes chloe sit down in the armchair out of which they      have risen then locks the door and closing the windows draws      the curtains hastily over them  hillcrist  awkward and expectant  can i do anything for you  chloe  i couldnt bear it hes coming to ask you  hillcrist  who  chloe  my husband  she draws in her breath with a long shudder then seem to seize her courage in her hands  ive got to be quick he keeps on askinghe knows theres something  hillcrist  make your mind easy  we shant tell him  chloe  appealing  oh  thats not enough  cant you tell him something to put him back to thinking its all right  ive done him such a wrong  i didnt realise till afteri thought meeting him was just a piece of wonderful good luck after what id been through  im not such a bad lotnot really       she stops from the overquivering of her lips  jill standing      beside the chair strokes her shoulder  hillcrist stands very      still painfully biting at a finger  you see my father went bankrupt and i was in a shop  hillcrist  soothingly and to prevent disclosures yes yes yes yes  chloe  i never gave a man away or did anything i was ashamed ofat leasti mean i had to make my living in all sorts of ways and then i met charlie       again she stopped from the quivering of her lips  jill  its all right  chloe  he thought i was respectable and that was such a relief you cant think soso i let him  jill  dodo  its awful  hillcrist  it is  chloe  and after i married him you see i fell in love  if i had before perhaps i wouldnt have dared only i dont knowyou never know do you  when theres a straw going

that day here  i knew it was in the wind  what gets in the wind never gets out  she rises and throws out her arms  never  it just blows here and there  desolately  and thenblows home  her voice changes to resentment  but ive paid for being a fool tisnt fun that sort of life i can tell you  im not ashamed and repentant and all that  if it wasnt for him  im afraid hell never forgive me its such a disgrace for himand then to have his child  being fond of him i feel it much worse than anything i ever felt and thats saying a good bit  it is  jill  energetically  look here  he simply mustnt find out  chloe  thats it but its started and hes bound to keep on because he knows theres something  a man isnt going to be satisfied when theres something he suspects about his wife charlie wouldnt never  hes clever and hes jealous and hes coming here       she stops and looks round wildly listening  jill  dodo what can we say to put him clean off the scent  hillcrist  anythingin reason  chloe  catching at this straw  you will  you see i dont know what ill do  ive got soft being looked afterhe does love me and if he throws me off ill go underthats all  hillcrist  have you any suggestion  chloe  eagerly  the only thing is to tell him something positive something hell believe thats not too badlike my having been a lady clerk with those people who came here and having been dismissed on suspicion of taking money  i could get him to believe that wasnt true  jill  yes and it isntthats splendid  youd be able to put such conviction into it  dont you think so dodo  hillcrist  anything i can  im deeply sorry  chloe  thank you  and dont say ive been here will you  hes very suspicious  you see he knows that his father has resold that land to you thats what he cant make outthat and my

told him theres nothing he need worry about nothing thats true  hillcrist  what a coil  chloe  im very honest and careful about money  so he wont believe that about me and the old man wants to keep it from charlie i know  hillcrist  that does seem the best way out  chloe  with a touch of defiance  im a true wife to him  chloe  of course we know that  hillcrist  its all unspeakably sad  deceptions horribly against the grainbut  chloe  eagerly  when i deceived him id have deceived god himselfi was so desperate  youve never been right down in the mud  you cant understand what ive been through  hillcrist  yes yes  i daresay id have done the same  i should be the last to judge       chloe covers her eyes with her hands  there there  cheer up  he puts his hand on her arm  chloe  to herself

scene ii       at out eleven oclock the following night an wandas room on the      ground floor in soho  in the light from one closeshaded      electric bulb the room is but dimly visible  a dying fire burns      on the left  a curtained window in the centre of the back wall      a door on the right  the furniture is plushcovered and      commonplace with a kind of shabby smartness  a couch without      back or arms stands aslant between window and fire       on this wanda is sitting her knees drawn up under her staring      at the embers  she has on only her nightgown and a wrapper over      it her bare feet are thrust into slippers  her hands are      crossed and pressed over her breast  she starts and looks up      listening  her eyes are candid and startled her face alabaster      pale and its pale brown hair short and squarecut curls      towards her bare neck  the startled dark eyes and the faint      rose of her lips are like colourstaining on a white mask       footsteps as of a policeman very measured pass on the      pavement outside and die away  she gets up and steals to the      window draws one curtain aside so that a chink of the night is      seen  she opens the curtain wider till the shape of a bare      witchlike tree becomes visible in the open space of the little      square on the far side of the road  the footsteps are heard      once more coming nearer  wanda closes the curtains and cranes      back  they pass and die again  she moves away and looking down      at the floor between door and couch as though seeing something      there  shudders covers her eyes goes back to the couch and      down again just as before to stare at the embers  again she is      startled by noise of the outer door being opened  she springs      up runs and turns the light by a switch close to the door  by      the glimmer of the fire she can just be seen standing by the      dark windowcurtains listening  there comes the sound of      subdued knocking on her door  she stands in breathless terror      the knocking is repeated  the sound of a latchkey in the door      is heard  her terror leaves her  the door opens a man enters      in a dark fur overcoat  wanda  in a voice of breathless relief with a rather foreign accent  oh its you larry  why did you knock  i was so frightened  come in  she crosses quickly and flings her arms round his neck  recoilingin a terrorstricken whisper  oh  who is it  keith  in a smothered voice  a friend of larrys  dont be frightened       she has recoiled again to the window and when he finds the      switch and turns the light up she is seen standing there      holding her dark wrapper up to her throat so that her face has      an uncanny look of being detached from the body  gently  you neednt be afraid  i havent come to do you harm quite the contrary  holding up the keys  larry wouldnt have given me these would he if he hadnt trusted me       wanda does not move staring like a spirit startled out of the      flesh  after looking round him  im sorry to have startled you  wanda  in a whisper  who are you please  keith  larrys brother       wanda with a sigh of utter relief steals forward to the couch      and sinks down  keith goes up to her  hed told me  wanda  clasping her hands round her knees  yes  keith  an awful business  wanda  yes oh yes  awfulit is awful  keith  staring round him again  in this room  wanda  just where you are standing  i see him now always falling  keith  moved by the gentle despair in her voice  youlook very young  whats your name  wanda  wanda  keith  are

i am so afraid for him  keith  checking her emotion  look at me       she looks at him  if the worst comes and this man is traced to you can you trust yourself not to give larry away  wanda  rising and pointing to the fire  look  i have burned all the things he have given meeven his picture  now i have nothing from him  keith  who has risen too  good  one more question  do the police know

suddenly comes close to him  wanda  please do not take him from me altogether  i will be so careful  i will not do anything to hurt him  but if i cannot see him sometimes i shall die  please do not take him from me       she catches his hand and presses it desperately between her      own  keith  leave that to me  im going to do all i can  wanda  looking up into his face  but you will be kind       suddenly she bends and kisses his hand  keith draws his hand      away and she recoils a little humbly looking up at him again      suddenly she stands rigid listening  in a whisper  listen  someoneout there       she darts past him and turns out the light  there is a knock on      the door  they are now close together between door and window   whispering  oh  who is it  keith  under his breath  you said no one comes but larry  wanda  yes and you have his keys  oh if it is larry i must open       keith shrinks back against the wall  wanda goes to the door  opening the door an inch  yes  please  who       a thin streak of light from a bullseye lantern outside plays      over the wall  a policemans voice says all right miss      your outer doors open  you ought to keep it shut after dark      you know  wanda  thank you air       the sound of retreating footsteps of the outer door closing      wanda shuts the door  a policeman  keith  moving from the wall  curse  i must have

seconds to indicate the passage of      three hours  when it rises again the lovers are lying on the      couch in each others arms the lilies stream about them  the      girls bare arm is round larrys neck  her eyes are closed his      are open and sightless  there is no light but firelight       a knocking on the door and the sound of a key turned in the      lock  keith enters  he stands a moment bewildered by the      halflight then calls sharply larry and turns up the light      seeing the forms on the couch he recoils a moment  then      glancing at the table and empty decanters goes up to the couch  keith  muttering  asleep  drunk  ugh       suddenly he bends touches larry and springs back  what  he bends again shakes him and calls  larry larry       then motionless he stares down at his brothers open      sightless eyes  suddenly he wets his finger and holds it to the      girls lips then to larrys       he bends and listens at their hearts catches sight of the      little box lying between them and takes it up  my god       then raising himself he closes his brothers eyes and as he      does so catches sight of a paper pinned to the couch detaches      it and reads  i lawrence darrant about to die by my own hand confess that i       he reads on silently in horror finishes letting the paper      drop and recoils from the couch on to a chair at the      dishevelled supper table  aghast he sits there  suddenly he      mutters  if i leave that theremy namemy whole future       he springs up takes up the paper again and again reads  my god  its ruin       he makes as if to tear it across stops and looks down at      those two covers his eyes with his hand drops the paper and      rushes to the door  but he stops there and comes back      magnetised as it were by that paper  he takes it up once more      and thrusts it into his pocket       the footsteps of a policeman pass slow and regular outside      his face crisps and quivers he stands listening till they die      away  then he snatches the paper from his pocket and goes past      the foot of the couch to the fore  all myno  let him hang       he thrusts the paper into the fire stamps it down with his      foot watches it writhe and blacken  then suddenly clutching      his head he turns to the bodies on the couch  panting and like      a man demented he recoils past the head of the couch and      rushing to the window draws the curtains and throws the window      up for air  out in the darkness rises the witchlike skeleton      tree where a dark shape seems hanging  keith starts back  whats that  what       he shuts the window and draws the dark curtains across it      again  fool  nothing       clenching his fists he draws himself up steadying himself      with all his might  then slowly he moves to the door stands a      second like a carved figure his face hard as stone       deliberately he turns out the light opens the door and goes       the still bodies lie there before the fire which is licking at      the last blackened wafer   curtain       the little man  a farcical morality in three scenes    characters  the little man the american the

returns bringing the little mans      beer then retires  american  that pears to be one up to democracy  to the little man  i judge you go in for brotherhood  little man  startled  oh no  american  i take considerable stock in leo tolstoi myself  grand mangrandsouled apparatus  but i guess youve got to pinch those waiters some to make em skip  to the english who have carelessly looked his way for a moment  youll appreciate that the way he acted about my eggs       the english make faint motions with their chins and avert their      eyes       to the waiter who is standing at the door of the

that poor woman therevery humble womanthere she sits among us with her baby  perhaps youd like to locate her somewhere else  german  shrugging  tolstoi is sentimentalisch  nietzsche is the true philosopher the only one  american  well thats quite in the prospectusvery stimulating partyold nietchvirgin mind  but give me leo  he turns to the redcheeked youth  what do you opine sir  i guess by your labels youll be dutch  do they read tolstoi in your country       the dutch youth laughs  american  that is a very luminous answer  german  tolstoi is nothing  man should himself express  he must pushhe must be strong  american  that is so  in america we believe in virility we like a man to expand  but we believe in brotherhood too  we draw the line at niggers but we aspire  social barriers and distinctions weve not much use for  englishman  do you feel a draught  englishwoman  with a shiver of her shoulder toward the american  i dorather  german  wait  you are a young people  american  that is so there are no flies on us  to the little man who has been gazing eagerly from face to face  say  id like to have you give us your sentiments in relation to the duty of man       the little man fidgets and is about to opens his mouth  american  for exampleis it your opinion that we should kill off the weak and diseased and all that cant jump around  german  nodding ja ja  that is coming  little man  looking from face to face  they might be me       the dutch youth laughs  american  reproving him with a look  thats true humility tisnt grammar  now heres a proposition that brings it nearer the bone  would you step out of your way to help them when it was liable to bring you trouble  german  nein nein  that is stupid  little man  eager but wistful  im afraid not  of course one wants tothere was st francis dassisi and st julien lhospitalier and  american  very lofty dispositions  guess they died of them  he rises  shake hands sirmy name ishe hands a card  i am an icemachine maker  he shakes the little mans hand i like your sentimentsi feel kind of brotherly  catching sight of the waiter appearing in the doorway  waiter where to hll is that glass of beer  german  cigarren  waiter  komm gleich  englishman  consulting watch  trains late  englishwoman  really  nuisance       a station policeman very square and uniformed passes and      repasses  american  resuming his seatto the german  now we dont have so much of that in america  guess we feel more to trust in human nature  german  ah  ha  you will bresently find there is nothing in him but self  little man  wistfully  dont you believe in human nature  american  very stimulating question       he looks round for opinions  the dutch youth laughs  englishman holding out his half of the paper to his wife  swap       his wife swaps  german  in human nature i believe so far as i can see himno more  american  now that pears to me kind o blasphemy  i believe in heroism  i opine theres not one of us settin around here thats not a herogive him the occasion  little man  oh  do you believe that  american  well  i judge a hero is just a person thatll help another at the expense of himself  take that poor woman there well now shes a heroine i guess  she would die for her baby any old time  german  animals will die for their babies  that is nothing  american  i carry it further  i postulate we would all die for that baby if a locomotive was to trundle up right here and try to handle it  to the german  i guess you dont know how good you are  as the german is twisting up the ends of his moustacheto the englishwoman  i should like to have you express an opinion maam  englishwoman  i beg your pardon  american  the english are very humanitarian they have a very high sense of duty  so have the germans so have the americans  to the dutch youth  i judge even in your little country they have that this is an epoch of equality and hightoned ideals  to the little man  what is your nationality sir  little man  im afraid im nothing particular  my father was halfenglish and halfamerican and my mother halfgerman and halfdutch  american  my  thats a bit streaky any old way  the policeman passes again  now i dont believe weve much use any more for those gentlemen in buttons  weve grown kind of mildwe dont think of self as we used to do       the waiter has appeared in the doorway  german  in a voice of thunder cigarren  donnerwetter  american  shaking his fist at the vanishing waiter  that flash of beer  waiter  komm gleich  american  a little more and he will join george washington  i was about to remark when he intruded in this year of grace 1913 the kingdom of christ is quite a going concern  we are mighty near universal brotherhood  the colonel here he indicates the german is a man of blood and iron but give him an opportunity to be magnanimous and hell be right there  oh sir  yep       the german with a profound mixture of pleasure and cynicism      brushes up the ends of his moustache  little man  i wonder  one wants to but somehowhe shakes his head  american you seem kind of skeery about that  youve had experience maybe  im an optimisti think were bound to make the devil hum in the near future  i opine we shall occasion a good deal of trouble to that old party  theres about to be a holocaust of selfish interests  the colonel there with oldman nietch he wont know himself  theres going to be a very sacred opportunity       as he speaks the voice of a railway official is heard an the      distance calling out in german  it approaches and the words      become audible  german  startled der teufel  he gets up and seizes the bag beside him       the station official has appeared he stands for a moment      casting his commands at the seated group  the dutch youth also      rises and takes his coat and hat  the official turns on his      heel and retires still issuing directions  englishman  what does he say  german  our drain has come in de oder platform only one minute we haf       all have risen in a fluster  american  now thats very provoking  i wont get that flash of beer       there is a general scurry to gather coats and hats and wraps      during which the lowly woman is seen making desperate attempts      to deal with her baby and the two large bundles  quite      defeated she suddenly puts all down wrings her hands and      cries out herr jesu  hilfe  the flying procession turn      their heads at that strange cry  american  whats that  help       he continues to run  the little man spins round rushes back      picks up baby and bundle on which it was seated  little man  come along good woman come along       the woman picks up the other bundle and they run       the waiter appearing in the doorway with the bottle of beer      watches with his tired smile                                 curtain     scene ii       a secondclass compartment of a corridor carriage in motion      in it are seated the englishman and his wife opposite each      other at the corridor end she with her face to the engine he      with his back  both are somewhat protected from the rest of the      travellers by newspapers  next to her sits the german and      opposite him sits the american next the american in one window      corner is seated the dutch youth the other window corner is      taken by the germans bag  the silence is only broken by the      slight rushing noise of the trains progression and the      crackling of the english newspapers  american  turning to the dutch youth  guess id like that window raised its kind of chilly after that old run they gave us       the dutch youth laughs and goes through the motions of raising      the window  the english regard the operation with uneasy      irritation  the german opens his bag which reposes on the      corner seat next him and takes out a book  american  the germans are great readers  very stimulating practice i read most anything myself       the german holds up the book so that the title may be read  don quixotefine book  we americans take considerable stock in old man quixote  bit of a wildcatbut we dont laugh at him  german  he is dead  dead as a sheep  a good thing too  american  in america we have still quite an amount of chivalry  german  chivalry is nothing sentimentalisch  in modern daysno good  a man must push he must pull  american  so you say  but i judge your form of chivalry is sacrifice to the state  we allow more freedom to the individual soul  where theres something little and weak we feel it kind of noble to give up to it  that way we feel elevated       as he speaks there is seen in the corridor doorway the little      man with the womans baby still on his arm and the bundle held      in the other hand  he peers in anxiously  the english acutely      conscious try to dissociate themselves from his presence with      their papers  the dutch youth laughs  german  ach  so  american  dear me  little man  is there room  i cant find a seat  american  why yes  theres a seat for one  little man  depositing bundle outside and heaving baby  may i  american  come right in       the german sulkily moves his bag  the little man comes in and      seats himself gingerly  american  wheres the mother  little man  ruefully  afraid she got left behind       the dutch youth laughs  the english unconsciously emerge from      their newspapers  american  my  that would appear to be quite a domestic incident       the englishman suddenly utters a profound ha ha and      disappears behind his paper  and that paper and the one      opposite are seen to shake and little sguirls and squeaks      emerge  german  and you haf got her bundle and her baby  ha  he cackles drily  american  gravely  i smile  i guess providence has played it pretty low down on you  its sure acted real mean       the baby wails and the little man jigs it with a sort of      gentle desperation looking apologetically from face to face      his wistful glance renews the fore of merriment wherever it      alights  the american alone preserves a gravity which seems      incapable of being broken  american  maybe youd better get off right smart and restore that baby  theres nothing can act madder than a mother  little man  poor thing yes  what she must be suffering       a gale of laughter shakes the carriage  the english for a      moment drop their papers the better to indulge  the little man      smiles a wintry smile  american  in a lull  how did it eventuate  little man  we got there just as the train was going to start and i jumped thinking i could help her up  but it moved too quickly andand left her       the gale of laughter blows up again  american  guess id have thrown the baby out to her  little man  i was afraid the poor little thing might break       the baby wails the little man heaves it the gale of laughter      blows  american  gravely  its highly entertainingnot for the baby what kind of an old baby is it anyway  he sniffs  i judge its a bitniffy  little man  afraid ive hardly looked at it yet  american  which end up is it  little mam  oh  i think the right end  yes yes it is  american  well thats something  maybe you should hold it out of window a bit  very excitable things babies  englishwoman  galvanized  no no  englishman  touching her knee  my dear  american  you are right maam  i opine theres a draught out there  this baby is precious  weve all of us got stock in this baby in a manner of speaking  this is a little bit of universal brotherhood  is it a woman baby  little man  ii can only see the top of its head  american  you cant always tell from that  it looks kind of overwrapped up  maybe it had better be unbound  german  nein nein nein  american  i think you are very likely right colonel  it might be a pity to unbind that baby  i guess the lady should be consulted in this matter  englishwoman  yes yes of course  englishman  touching her  let it be  little beggar seems all right  american  that would seem only known to providence at this moment i judge it might be due to humanity to look at its face  little man  gladly  its sucking my finger  there therenice little thingthere  american  i would surmise in your leisure moments you have created babies sir  little man  oh noindeed no  american  dear methat is a loss  addressing himself to the carriage at large  i think we may esteem ourselves fortunate to have this little stranger right here with us  demonstrates what a hold the little and weak have upon us nowadays  the colonel herea man of blood and ironthere he sits quite calm next door to it  he sniffs  now this baby is rather chasteningthat is a sign of grace in the colonelthat is true heroism  little man  faintly  ii can see its face a little now       all bend forward  american  what sort of a physiognomy has it anyway  little man  still faintly  i dont see anything butbut spots  german  oh  ha  pfui       the dutch youth laughs  american  i am told that is not uncommon amongst babies  perhaps we could have you inform us maam  englishwoman  yes of courseonly what sort of  little man  they seem all over itsat the slight recoil of everyone i feel sure itsits quite a good baby underneath  american  that will be rather difficult to come at  im just a bit sensitive  ive very little use for affections of the epidermis  german  pfui  he has edged away as far as he can get and is lighting a big cigar       the dutch youth draws his legs back  american  also taking out a cigar  i guess it would be well to fumigate this carriage  does it suffer do you think  little man  peering  really i dontim not surei know so little about babies  i think it would have a nice expressionifif it showed  american  is it kind of boiled looking  little man  yesyes it is  american  looking gravely round  i judge this baby has the measles       the german screws himself spasmodically against the arm of the      englishwomans seat  englishwoman  poor little thing  shall i       she half rises  englishman  touching her  no nodash it  american  i honour your emotion maam  it does credit to us all but i sympathize with your husband too  the measles is a very important pestilence in connection with a grown woman  little man  it likes my finger awfully  really its rather a sweet baby  american  sniffing  well that would appear to be quite a question  about them spots now  are they rosy  little man  noo theyre dark almost black  german  gott  typhus  he bounds up on to the arm of the englishwomans seat  american  typhus  thats quite an indisposition       the dutch youth rises suddenly and bolts out into the      corridor  he is followed by the german puffing clouds of      smoke  the english and american sit a moment longer without      speaking  the englishwomans face is turned with a curious      expressionhalf pity half feartowards the little man  then      the englishman gets up  englishman  bit stuffy for you here dear isnt it       he puts his arm through hers raises her and almost pushes her      through the doorway  she goes still looking back  american  gravely  theres nothing i admire moren courage  guess ill go and smoke in the corridor       as he goes out the little man looks very wistfully after him      screwing up his mouth and nose he holds the baby away from him      and wavers then rising he puts it on the seat opposite and      goes through the motions of letting down the window  having      done so he looks at the baby who has begun to wail  suddenly      he raises his hands and clasps them like a child praying      since however the baby does not stop wailing he hovers over      it in indecision then picking it up sits down again to dandle      it with his face turned toward the open window  finding that      it still wails he begins to sing to it in a cracked little      voice  it is charmed at once  while he is singing the      american appears in the corridor  letting down the passage      window he stands there in the doorway with the draught blowing      his hair and the smoke of his cigar all about him  the little      man stops singing and shifts the shawl higher to protect the      babys head from the draught  american  gravely  this is the most sublime spectacle i have ever envisaged  there ought to be a record of this       the little man looks at him wondering  you are typical sir      of the sentiments of modern christianity  you illustrate the      deepest feelings in the heart of every man       the little man rises with the baby and a movement of approach  guess im wanted in the diningcar       he vanishes  the little man sits down again but back to the      engine away from the draught and looks out of the window      patiently jogging the baby on his knee                                 curtain    scene iii       an arrival platform  the little man with the baby and the      bundle is standing disconsolate while travellers pass and      luggage is being carried by  a station official accompanied by      a policeman appears from a doorway behind him  official  consulting telegram in his hand das ist der herr       they advance to the little man

man also stops and sits down on      a bench against the wall  the policeman stands stolidly beside      him  the american approaches a step or two beckoning the      official goes up to him  american

guess youd better isolate the baby       a silence during which the little man is heard faintly      whistling and clucking to the baby  official  referring once more to his telegram  rest gentleman mit black baby shaking his head  wir must de gentleman hold  to the german bitte mein herr sagen sie ihm den buben zu niedersetzen  he makes the gesture of deposit  german  to the little man  he say

showing off the little man with a sweep of his arm  this is a white man  hes got a black baby and he won leave it in the lurch  guess we would all act noble that way give us the chance       the little man rises holding out the baby and advances a step      or two  the halfmoon at once gives increasing its size the      american climbs on to a higher trunk  the little man retires      and

is calling his wares  the girls fingers slip between      his own and stay unmoving  he looks round into her face  in      spite of makeup it has a queer unholy touching beauty  young off  with an outburst  no we dont only love ourselves there is more  i cant explain but theres something great theres kindnessandand       the shouting of newspaper boys grows louder and their cries      passionately vehement clash into each other and obscure each      word  his head goes up to listen her hand tightens within his      armshe too is listening  the cries come nearer hoarser more      shrill and clamorous the empty moonlight outside seems suddenly      crowded with figures footsteps voices and a fierce distant      cheering  great victorygreat victory  official  british      eavy defeat of the uns  many thousand prisoners  eavy      defeat it speeds by intoxicating filling him with a fearful      joy he leans far out waving his cap and cheering like a      madman the night seems to flutter and vibrate and answer  he      turns to rush down into the street strikes against something      soft and recoils  the girl stands with hands clenched and      face convulsed panting  all confused with the desire to do      something he stoops to kiss her hand  she snatches away her      fingers sweeps up the notes he has put down and holds them out      to him  girl  take themi will not haf your english moneytake them       suddenly she tears them across twice thrice lets the bits      flutter to the floor and turns her back on him  he stands      looking at her leaning against the plushcovered table her head      down a dark figure in a dark room with the moonlight      sharpening her outline  hardly a moment he stays then makes      for the door  when he is gone she still stands there her chin      on her breast with the sound in her ears of cheering of      hurrying feet and voices crying eavy defeat stands in the      centre of a pattern made by the fragments of the tornup notes      staring out unto the moonlight seeing not this hated room and      the hated square outside but a german orchard and herself a      little girl plucking apples a big dog beside her and a      hundred other pictures such as the drowning see  then she      sinks down on the floor lays her forehead on the dusty carpet      and presses her body to it  mechanically she sweeps together      the scattered fragments of notes assembling them with the dust      into a little pile as of fallen leaves and dabbling in it with      her fingers while the tears run down her cheeks  girl  defeat  der vaterland  defeat     one shillin       then suddenly in the moonlight she sits up and begins to      sing with all her might die wacht am rhein  and outside men      pass

set only about ten feet from the footlights and the rest of the      stage is orchard  what is visible of the room would indicate      the study of a writing man of culture   noteif found      advantageous for scenic purposes this section of room can be      changed to a broad verandah or porch with pillars supporting its      roof in the wall stage left is a curtained opening across      which the curtain is half drawn  stage right of the french      windows is a large armchair turned rather towards the window      with a book rest attached on which is a volume of the

vane  herbert sit in that chair       herbert sits an the armchair with an air of perfect peace  vane  now  all the lights go out  in a wail  great scott       a throaty chuckle from foreson in the darkness  the light      dances up flickers shifts grows steady falling on the      orchard outside  the reading lamp darts alight and a piercing      little glare from it strikes into the auditorium away from      herbert  in a terrible voice  mr foreson  foreson  sir  vane  lookatthatshade       foreson mutters walks up to it and turns it round so that the      light shines on herberts legs  on

window  no noby the curtain       foreson takes his stand by the curtain and suddenly the three      lighting effects are rendered quickly and with miraculous      exactness  good  leave it at that  well begin  mr foreson send up to mr frust       he moves from the auditorium and ascends on to the stage by      some steps stage right  foreson  herb  call the boss and tell beginners to stand by sharp now       herbert gets out of the chair and goes off right       foreson is going off left as vane mounts the stage  vane  mr foreson  foreson  reappearing  sir  vane  i want props  foreson  in a stentorian voice  props       another motheaten man appears through the french windows  vane  is that boulder firm  props  going to where in front of the backcloth and apparently among its apple trees lies the counterfeitment of a mossy boulder he puts his foot on it  if you dont put too much weight on it sir  vane  it wont creak  props  nao  he mounts on it and a dolorous creaking arises  vane  make that right  let me see that lute       props produces a property lute  while they scrutinize it a      broad man with broad leathery cleanshaven face and small mouth      occupied by the butt end of a cigar has come on to the stage      from stage left and stands waiting to be noticed  props  attracted by the scent of the cigar  the boss sir  vane  turning to props  thatll do then       props goes out through the french windows  vane  to frust  now sir were all ready for rehearsal of orpheus with his lute  frust  in a cosmopolitan voice  orphoos with his loot  that his loot mr vane

in      the centre of the front row of the stalls  vane  mr foreson  foreson  appearing through curtain right  sir  vane  beginners  take your curtain down       he descends the steps and seats himself next to frust  the      curtain goes down       a womans voice is heard singing very beautifully sullivans      song orpheus with his lute with his lute made trees and the      mountain tops that freeze etc  frust  some voice       the curtain rises in the armchair the professor is yawning      tall thin abstracted and slightly grizzled in the hair  he      has a pad of paper over his knee ink on the stool to his right      and the encyclopedia volume on the stand to his leftbarricaded      in fact by the article he is writing  he is reading a page over      to himself but the words are drowned in the sound of the song      his wife is singing in the next room partly screened off by the      curtain  she finishes and stops  his voice can then be heard      conning the words of his article  prof  orpheus symbolized the voice of beauty the call of life luring us mortals with his song back from the graves we dig for ourselves  probably the ancients realized this neither more nor less than we moderns  mankind has not changed  the civilized being still hides the faun and the dryad within its broadcloth and its silk  and yethe stops with a driedup airrather impatiently  go on my dear  it helps the atmosphere       the voice of his wife begins again gets as far as made them      sing and stops dead just as the professors pen is beginning      to scratch  and suddenly drawing the curtain further aside       she appears  much younger than the professor pale very      pretty of a botticellian type in face figure and in her      clinging creamcoloured frock  she gazes at her abstracted      husband then swiftly moves to the lintel of the open window      and stands looking out  the wife  god  what beauty  prof  looking up  umm  the wife  i said god  what beauty  prof  aha  the wife  looking at him  do you know that i have to repeat everything to you nowadays  prof  what  the wife  that i have to repeat  prof  yes i heard  im sorry  i get absorbed  the wife  in all but me  prof  startled  my dear your song was helping me like anything to get the mood  this paper is the very deuceto balance between the historical and the natural  the wife  who wants the natural  prof  grumbling  umm  wish i thought that  modern taste history may go hang theyre all for tuppencecoloured sentiment nowadays  the wife  as if to herself  is the spring sentiment  prof  i beg your pardon my dear i didnt catch  wife  as if against her willurged by some pentup force  beauty beauty  prof  thats what im trying to say here  the orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of beauty  he takes up his pen while she continues to stare out at the moonlight  yawning  dash it  i get so sleepy i wish youd tell them to make the afterdinner coffee twice as strong  wife  i will  prof  how does this strike you  conning  many renaissance pictures especially those of botticelli francesca and piero di cosimo were inspired by such legends as that of orpheus and we owe a tiny

not bad  not bad  the christian virtues and the dew  his hand takes up his pen his face droops over his paper while his wife looks at him with a very strange face how far we can trace the modern resurgence against the christian virtues to the symbolic figures of orpheus pan apollo and bacchus might be difficult to estimate but       during those words his wife has passed through the window into      the moonlight and her voice rises singing as she goes      orpheus with his lute with his lute made trees     prof  suddenly aware of something  shell get her throat bad he is silent as the

the mossy boulder a      faunlike figure uncurls itself and peeps over with ears      standing up and elbows leaning on the stone playing a rustic      pipe and there are seen two rabbits and a fox sitting up and      listening  a shiver of wind passes blowing petals from the      appletrees       the faun darts his head towards where from right comes slowly      the figure of a greek youth holding a lute or lyre which his      fingers strike lifting out little wandering strains as of wind      whinnying in funnels and odd corners  the faun darts down      behind the stone and the youth stands by the boulder playing      his lute  slowly while he plays the whitened trunk of an      appletree is seen to dissolve into the body of a girl with      bare arms and feet her dark hair unbound and the face of the      professors wife  hypnotized she slowly sways towards him      their eyes fixed on each other till she is quite close  her      arms go out to him cling round his neck

he shakes hands and goes out followed by harris       when the door is dosed builder stands a moment quite still with a      gratified smile on his face then turns and scrutinises himself in      the glass over the hearth  while he is doing so the door from the      diningroom is opened quietly and camille comes in  builder      suddenly seeing her reflected in the mirror turns  builder  what is

that womanshes a tantalizer       he compresses his lips and is settling back into his chair when      the door from the hall is opened and his daughter maud comes in a      pretty girl rather pale with fine eyes  though her face has a      determined cast her manner at this moment is by no means decisive      she has a letter in her hand and advances rather as if she were      stalking her

   kitchen  she reappears with a bread pan which she deposits in the      centre of the room then crosses again to the bedroom and once more      reappears with a clothes brush two hair brushes and a norfolk      jacket  as she stuffs all these into the bread pan and bears it      back into the kitchen there is the sound of a car driving up and      stopping  annie reappears at the kitchen door

dutchpretty little figure  staring round  hm  extraordinary girls are  fancy athene preferring this to home  what  mrs builder  i didnt say anything  builder  placing a chair for his wife and sitting

mistake to lose my temper with her  mrs builder  isnt it always a mistake to lose ones temper  builder  thats very nice and placid sort of thing you women who live sheltered lives can say  i often wonder if you women realise the strain on a business man  mrs builder  in her softly ironical voice  it seems a shame to add the strain of family life  builder  youve always been so passive  when i want a thing ive got to have it  mrs builder  ive noticed that  builder  with a short laugh  odd if you hadnt in twentythree years touching a canvas standing against the chair with his toe  art  just a pretext  we shall be having maud wanting to cut loose next  shes very restive  still i oughtnt to have had that scene with athene  i ought to have put quiet pressure       mrs builder smiles

crosses and opens the door right  bedroom  mrs builder  to his disappearing form  do you think you ought john       he has disappeared and she ends with an expressive movement of her      hands a long sigh and a closing of her eyes  builders peremptory      voice is heard julia  what now       she follows into the bedroom  the maid annie puts her head out of      the kitchen door she comes out a step as if to fly then at      builders voice shrinks back into the kitchen  builder reappearing with a razor strop in one hand and a shavingbrush in the other is followed by mrs builder  builder

deuce doesnt she come  mrs builder  suppose you leave me here to see her  builder  ominously  this is my job  mrs builder  i think its more mine  builder  dont stand there opposing everything i say  ill go and have another lookhe is going towards the bedroom when the sound of a latchkey in the outer door arrests him  he puts the strop and brush behind his back and adds in a low voice  here she is       mrs builder has approached him and they have both turned towards      the opening door  guy herringhame comes in  they are a little out      of his line of sight and he has shut the door before he sees them      when he does his mouth falls open and his hand on to the knob of      the door  he is a comely young man in harris tweeds  moreover he      is smoking  he would speak if he could but his surprise is too      excessive  builder  well sir  guy  recovering a little i was about to say the same to you sir  builder  very red from repression  these rooms are not yours are they  guy  nor

musical voice with a slight lisp  athene  oh  how are you mother dear  this is rather a surprise father always keeps his word so i certainly didnt expect him  she looks steadfastly at builder but does not approach  builder  controlling himself with an effort  now athene whats this  athene  whats what  builder  the strop held out  are you married to thisthis  athene  quietly  to all intents and purposes  builder  in law  athene  no  builder  my god  youyou  athene  father dont call names please  builder  why arent you married to him  athene  do you want a lot of reasons or the real one

builder  dont be impudent  my patience is at breakingpoint i warn you  athene  im perfectly serious father  i tell you we meant to marry but so far i havent been able to bring myself to it  you never noticed how we children have watched you  builder  me  athene  yes  you and mother and other things all sorts of things  builder  taking out a handkerchief and wiping his brow  i really think youre mad  athene  im sure you must dear  builder  dont dear me  what have you noticed  dyou mean im not a good husband and father  athene  look at mother  i suppose you cant now youre too used to her  builder  of course im used to her  what else is marrying for  athene  that and the production of such as me  and it isnt good enough father  you shouldnt have set us such a perfect example  builder  youre talking the most arrant nonsense i ever heard  he lifts his hands  ive a good mind to shake it out of you  athene  shall i call guy       he drops his hands  confess that being a good husband and father has tried you terribly  it has us you know  builder  taking refuge in sarcasm when youve quite done being funny perhaps youll tell me why youve behaved like a common street flapper  athene  simply  i couldnt bear to think of guy as a family man thats allabsolutely  its not his fault hes been awfully anxious to be one  builder  youve disgraced us then thats what it comes to  athene  i dont want to be unkind but youve brought it on yourself  builder  genuinely distracted  i cant even get a glimmer of what you mean  ive never been anything but firm  impatient perhaps  im not an angel no ordinary healthy man is  ive never grudged you girls any comfort or pleasure  athene  except wills of our own  builder  what do you want with wills of your own till youre married  athene  you forget mother  builder  what about her  athene  shes very married  has she a will of her own  builder  sullenly  shes learnt to know when im in the right  athene  i dont ever mean to learn to know when guys in the right mothers fortyone and twentythree years of that shes been your wife its a long time father  dont you ever look at her face  builder  troubled in a remote way  rubbish  athene  i didnt want my face to get like that  builder  with such views about marriage what business had you to go near a man  come now  athene  because i fell in love  builder  love leads to marriageand to nothing else but the streets what an example to your sister  athene  you dont know maud any more than you knew me  shes got a will of her own too i can tell you  builder  now look here athene  its always been my way to face accomplished facts  whats done cant be undone but it can be remedied you must marry this youngat once before it gets out  hes behaved like a ruffian but by your own confession youve behaved worse youve been bitten by this modern disease thisthis utter lack of common decency  theres an eternal order in certain things and marriage is one of them in fact its the chief  come now  give me a promise and ill try my utmost to forget the whole thing  athene  when we quarrelled father you said you didnt care what became of me  builder  i was angry  athene  so you

pretty irritating i can tell you  shesheeverything suppressed  andand noblood in her  athene  i knew it  builder  aware that he has confirmed some thought in her that he had no intention of confirming  whats that  athene  dont you ever look at your own face father  when you shave for instance  builder  of course i do  athene  it isnt satisfied is it  builder  i dont know what on earth you mean  athene  you cant help it but youd be ever so much happier if you were a mohammedan and two or three instead of one hadhad learned to know when you were in the right  builder  pon my soul  this is outrageous  athene  truth often is  builder  will you be quiet  athene  i dont ever want to feel sorry for guy in that way  builder  i think youre the most immodestim ashamed that youre my daughter

outer door followed by his wife  to athene  ive done with you       he goes out       mrs builder who has so far seemed to accompany him shuts the door      quickly and remains in the studio  she

typewriter  she sits facing the audience with her hands      stretched over the keys  maud  to herself  i must get that expression       her face assumes a furtive listening look  then she gets up      whisks to the mirror over the fireplace scrutinises the expression      in it and going back to the table sits down again with hands      outstretched above the keys and an accentuation of the expression      the door up left is opened and topping appears  he looks at maud      who just turns her eyes  topping  lunch has been ready some time miss maud  maud  i dont want any lunch  did you

point topping its psychological  topping  indeed miss  maud  should i naturally put my hand on them or would there be a reaction quick enough to stop me  you see im aloneand the point is whether the fear of being seen would stop me although i knew i couldnt be seen  its rather subtle  topping  i think theres be a rehaction miss  maud  so do i  to touch them she clasps her chest is a bit obvious

reproducing the sealingwax  the fanshawe diamonds  theres just one thing here too topping  in real life which should i naturally doput them in here  she touches her chest  or in my bag  topping  touching his waistcoatearnestly  well  to put em in here miss i should say is moremore pishchological  maud  subduing her lips  yes but  topping  you see then youve got em on you  maud  but thats just the point  shouldnt i naturally think safer in my bag then i can pretend somebody put them there  you see nobody could put them on me  topping  well i should say that depends on your character  of

studio inside the courtyard where i found three persons in the act of disagreement  no sooner ad i appeared than the defendant who was engaged in draggin a woman towards the door turns to the young woman who accompanied me with violence  you dare father she says whereupon he hit her twice with the stick the same which is produced in the presence of myself and the two other persons which im given to understand is his wife and other daughter  mayor  yes never mind what youre given to understand  moon  no sir  the party struck turns to me and says come in  i give this man in charge for assault

this woman in my presence i says and you come along   we were then at close quarters  the defendant gave me a push with the words get out you idiot  not at all i replies and took old of his arm  a struggle ensues in the course of which i receives the black eye which i herewith produce  he touches his eye with awful solemnity       the mayor clears his throat chantreys eyes goggle harris bends      over and writes rapidly  during the struggle your worship a young man has appeared on the scene and at the instigation of the young woman the same who was assaulted assists me in securing the prisoner whose language and resistance was violent in the extreme  we placed him in a cab which we found outside and i conveyed him to the station  chantrey  what was hiserconduct in theercab  moon  he sat quiet  chantrey  that seems  moon  seein i had his further arm twisted behind him  mayor looking at builder any questions to ask him       builder makes not the faintest sign and the mayor drops his glance  mayor  sergeant       moon steps back two paces and the sergeant steps two paces forward  sergeant  at ten minutes to four your worship yesterday afternoon constable moon brought the defendant to the station in a fourwheeled cab  on his recounting the circumstances of the assault they were taken down and read over to the defendant with the usual warning  the defendant said nothing

nothing  sergeant  he as not opened his lips to my knowledge your worship from that hour to this  mayor  any questions to ask the sergeant  builder continues to stare at the mayor without a word  mayor  very well       the mayor and chantrey now consult each other inaudibly and the      mayor nods  mayor  miss maud builder will you tell us what you know of thiser occurrence  maud  rising with

uncertainty which comes over the most honest in such circumstances  notnot so to speak in black and white your worship but that was my idea at the time  mayor  you wont swear to it  moon  ill swear he called me an idiot and a lout the words made a deep impression on me  chantrey  to himself  mort aux vaches  mayor  eh  thatll do constable stand back  now who else saw the struggle  mrs builder  youre not obliged to say anything unless you like  thats your privilege as his wife       while he is speaking the door has been opened and harris has gone      swiftly to it spoken to someone and

then what is it  harris says something in a low and concerned voice  the mayors face lengthens  he leans to his right and consults chantrey who gives a faint and deprecating shrug  a moments silence  mayor  this is an open court  the press have the right to attend if they wish       harris goes to the door and admits a young man in glasses of a      pleasant appearance and indicates to him a chair at the back  at      this untimely happening builders eyes have moved from side to side      but now he regains his intent and bulllike stare at his      fellowjustices  mayor  to maud  you can sit

sisters studio that miss athene builder is at present working sir  i just happened toto turn up  mayor  did you appear on the scene as the constable says during the struggle  guy  yes sir  mayor  did he summon you to his aid  guy  yesno sir  miss maud builder did that  mayor  what do you say to this blow  guy  jerking his chin up a little  oh  i saw that clearly  mayor  well let us hear  guy  the constables arm struck the cane violently and it flew up and landed him in the eye  mayor  with a little grunt  you are sure of that  guy  quite sure sir  mayor  did you hear any language  guy  nothing out of the ordinary sir  one or two damns and blasts  mayor  you call that ordinary  guy  well hes amagistrate sir       the mayor utters a profound grunt  chantrey smiles  there is a      silence  then the mayor leans over to chantrey for a short      colloquy  chantrey  did you witness any particular violence other than a resistance to arrest  guy  no sir  mayor  with a gesture of dismissal  very well that seems to be the evidence  defendant john builderwhat do you say to all this  builder  in a voice different from any we have heard from him say what business had he to touch me a magistrate  i gave my daughter two taps with a cane in a private house for interfering with me for taking my wife home  mayor  that charge is not pressed and we cant go into the circumstances  what do you wish to say about your conduct towards the constable  builder  in his throat  not a damned thing  mayor  embarrassed  ii didnt catch  chantrey  nothingnothing  he  said  mr mayor  mayor  clearing his throat i understand then that you do not wish to offer any explanation  builder  i consider myself abominably treated and i refuse to say another word  mayor  drily very good  miss maud builder       maud stands up   mayor  when you spoke of the defendant seeing red what exactly did you mean  maud  i mean that my father was so angry that he didnt know what he was doing  chantrey  would you say as angry as heeris now  maud  with a faint smile  oh  much more angry  ralph builder stands up  ralph  would you allow me to say a word mr mayor  mayor  speaking of your own knowledge mr builder  ralph  in regard to the state of my brothers mindyes mr mayor  he was undoubtedly under great strain yesterday certain circumstances domestic and otherwise  mayor  you mean that he might have been as one might say beside himself  ralph  exactly sir  mayor  had you seen your brother  ralph  i had seen him shortly before this unhappy business       the mayor nods and makes a gesture so that maud and ralph sit down      then leaning over he confers in a low voice with chantrey  the      rest all sit or stand exactly as if each was the only person in the      room except the journalist who is writing busily and rather      obviously making a sketch of builder  mayor  miss athene builder       athene stands up  this young man mr herringhame i take it is a friend of the familys       a moment of some tension  athene  nno mr mayor not of my father or mother  chantrey  an acquaintance of yours  athene  yes  mayor  very good  he clears his throat  as the defendant wrongly we think refuses to offer his explanation of this matter the bench has to decide on the evidence as given  there seems to be some discrepancy as to the blow which the constable undoubtedly received  in view of this we incline to take the testimony of mr       harris prompts him  mr erringhameas the party least implicated personally in the affair and most likely to ave a cool and impartial view  that evidence is to the effect that the blow was accidental  there is no doubt however that the defendant used reprehensible language and offered some resistance to the constable in the execution of his duty  evidence as been offered that he was in an excited state of mind and it is possible i dont say that this is any palliationbut it is possible that he may have thought his position as magistrate made himer  chantrey  prompting  caesars wife  mayor  eh  we think considering all the circumstances and the fact that he has spent a night in a cell that justice will be met byer discharging him with a caution  builder  with a deeply muttered  the devil you do       walks out of the room  the journalist grabbing his pad starts up      and follows  the builders rise and huddle and with herringhame      are ushered out by harris  mayor  pulling out a large handkerchief and wiping his forehead my aunt  chantrey  these new constables mayor  i say builderll have to go damn the press how they nose everything out  the great unpaid we shall get it again  he suddenly goes off into a fit of laughter come off it i says to the best of my recollection  oh  oh i shant hit a bird all day  that poor devil builder  its no joke for him  you did it well mayor you did it well  british justice is safe in your hands  he blacked the fellows eye all right  which i herewith produce  oh my golly  it beats the band       his uncontrollable laughter and the mayors rueful appreciation are      exchanged with lightning rapidity for a preternatural solemnity as      the door opens admitting sergeant martin and the lugubrious object      of their next attentions  mayor  charges       sergeant steps forward to read the charge as       the curtain falls     scene ii       noon the same day       builders

father uncle  ralph  they do wonderful things nowadays with inherited trouble  come are you going to be nice to him both of you  athene  were going to try  ralph  good  i dont even now understand how it happened  maud  when you went out with guy it wasnt three minutes before he came  mother had just told us aboutwell about something beastly father wanted us to go and we agreed to go out for five minutes while he talked to mother  we went and when we came back he told me to get a cab to take mother home  poor mother stood there looking like a ghost and he began hunting and hauling her towards the door  i saw red and instead of a cab i fetched that policeman  of course father did black his eye  guy was splendid  athene  you gave him the lead  maud  i couldnt help it seeing father standing there all dumb  athene  it was awful  uncle why didnt you come back with guy  maud  oh yes  why didnt you uncle  athene  when maud had gone for the cab i warned him not to use force i told him it was against the law but he only said the law be damned  ralph  well it all sounds pretty undignified  maud  yes everybody saw red       they have not seen the door opened from the hall and builder      standing there  he is still unshaven a little sunken in the face      with a glum glowering expression  he has a document in his hand      he advances a step or two and they see him  athene and maud  aghast  father  builder  ralph oblige me  see them off the premises  ralph  steady john  builder  go  maud  proudly  all right  we thought you might like to know that athenes married and that ive given up the movies  now well go       builder turns his back on them and sitting down at his      writingtable writes       after a moments whispered conversation with their uncle the two      girls go out       ralph builder stands gazing with whimsical commiseration at his      brothers back  as builder finishes writing he goes up and puts      his hand on his brothers shoulder  ralph  this is an awful jar old man  builder  heres what ive said to that fellow mr mayoryou had the effrontery today to discharge me with a cautionforsoothyour fellow magistrate  ive consulted my solicitor as to whether an action will lie for false imprisonment  im informed that it wont  i take this opportunity of saying that justice in this town is a travesty  i have no wish to be associated further with you or your fellows  but you are vastly mistaken if you imagine that i shall resign my position on the bench or the town councilyours                                         john builder  ralph  i saykeep your sense of humour old boy  builder  grimly  humour  ive spent a night in a cell  see this he holds out the document  it disinherits my family  ralph  john  builder  ive done with those two ladies  as to my wifeif she doesnt come back  when i suffer i make others suffer  ralph  julias very upset my dear fellow we all are  the girls came here to try and  builder  rising they may go to hell  if that lousy mayor thinks im done withhes mistaken  he rings the bell i dont want any soft sawder  im a fighter  ralph  in a low voice  the enemy stands within the gate old chap  builder  whats that  ralph  lets boss our own natures before we boss those of other people have a sleep on it john before you do anything  builder  sleep  i hadnt a wink last night  if youd passed the night i had  ralph  i hadnt many myself       topping enters  builder  take this note to the mayor with my compliments and dont bring back an answer  topping  very good sir  theres a gentleman from the comet in the hall sir  would you see him for a minute he says  builder  tell him to go to       a voice says mr builder  builder turns to see the figure of the      journalist in the hall doorway  topping goes out  journalist  advancing with his card  mr builder its very good of you to see me  i had the pleasure this morningi meani tried to reach you when you left the mayors  i thought you would probably have your own side of this unfortunate matter  we shall be glad to give it every prominence       topping has withdrawn and ralph builder at the window stands      listening  builder  drily regarding the journalist who has spoken in a pleasant and polite voice  very good of you  journalist  not at all sir  we felt that you would almost certainly have good reasons of your own which would put the matter in quite a different light  builder  good reasons  i should think so  i tell youa very little more of this libertylicence i call itand there isnt a man wholl be able to call himself head of a family  journalist  encouragingly  quite  builder  if the law thinks it can back up revolt its damned well mistaken  i struck my daughteri was in a passion as you would have been  journalist  encouraging  im sure  builder glaring at him  well i dont know that you would you look a soft sort but any man with any blood in him  journalist  can one ask what she was doing sir  we couldnt get that point quite clear  builder  doing  i just had my arm round my wife trying to induce her to come home with me after a little family tiff and this girl came at me  i lost my temper and tapped her with my cane  andthat policeman brought by my own daughtera policeman  if the law is going to enter private houses and abrogate domestic authority where the hell shall we be  journalist  encouraging  no im sureim sure  builder  the maudlin sentimentality in these days is absolutely rotting this country  a man cant be master in his own house cant require his wife to fulfil her duties cant attempt to control the conduct of his daughters without coming up against it and incurring odium  a man cant control his employees he cant put his foot down on rebellion anywhere without a lot of humanitarians and licencelovers howling at him  journalist  excellent sir excellent  builder  excellent  its damnable  here am ia man whos always tried to do his duty in private life and publicbrought up before the bench my god because i was doing that duty with a little too much zeal perhapsim not an angel  journalist  no  no of course  builder  a proper englishman never is  but there are no proper englishmen nowadays       he crosses the room in his fervour  ralph  suddenly  as i look at faces  builder  absorbed  what  i told this young man i wasnt an angel  journalist  drawing him on  yes sir i quite understand  builder  if the law thinks it can force me to be one of your weakkneed sentimentalists who let everybody do what they like  ralph  there are a good many who stand on their rights left john  builder  absorbed  what  how can men stand on their rights left  journalist  im afraid you had a painful experience sir  builder  every kind of humiliation  i spent the night in a stinking cell  i havent eaten since breakfast yesterday  did they think i was going to eat the muck they shoved in  and all because in a moment of angerwhich i regret i regreti happened to strike my daughter who was interfering between me and my wife  the thing would be funny if it werent so disgusting  a mans house used to be sanctuary  what is it now  with all the world poking their noses in  he stands before the fire with his head bent excluding as it were his interviewer and all the world  journalist  preparing to go  thank you very much mr builder  im sure i can do you justice  would you like to see a proof  builder  half conscious of him  what  journalist  or will you trust me  builder  i wouldnt trust you a yard  journalist  at the door  very well sir you shall have a proof i promise  good afternoon and thank you  builder  here       but he is gone and builder is left staring at his brother on whose      face is still that look of whimsical commiseration  ralph  take a pull old man  have a hot bath and go to bed  builder  theyve chosen to drive me to extremes now let them take the consequences  i dont care a kick what anybody thinks  ralph  sadly  well i wont worry you anymore now  builder  with a nasty laugh  no come again tomorrow  ralph  when youve had a sleep  for the sake of the family name john dont be hasty  builder  shut the stable door  no my boy the horse has gone  ralph  well well       with a lingering look at his brother who has sat down sullenly at      the writing table he goes out into the hall       builder remains staring in front of him  the diningroom door      opens and camilles head is thrust in  seeing him she draws back      but he catches sight of her  builder  here  camille comes doubtfully up to the writing table  her forehead is puckered as if she were thinking hard  builder  looking at her unsmiling  so you want to be my mistress do you       camille makes a nervous gesture  well you shall  come here  camille  not moving  you ffrighten me  builder  ive paid a pretty price for you  but youll make up for it you and others  camille  starting back  no i dont like you today  no  builder  come along  she is just within reach and he seizes her arm all my married life ive put a curb on myself for the sake of respectability  ive been a man of principle my girl as you saw yesterday  well they dont want that  he draws her close you can sit on my knee now  camille  shrinking  no i dont want to today  builder  but you shall  theyve asked for it  camille  with a supple movement slipping away from him they  what is all that  i dont want any trouble  no no i am not taking any       she moves back towards the door  builder utters a sardonic laugh  oh  you are a dangerous man  no no  not for me  goodbye sare       she turns swiftly and goes out  builder again utters his glum      laugh  and then as he sits alone staring before him perfect      silence reigns in the room  over the windowsill behind him a boys      face is seen to rise it hangs there a moment with a grin spreading      on it  boys voice  sotto  johnny builder       as builder turns sharply it vanishes  oo beat is wife       builder rushes to the window  boys voice  more distant and a little tentative  johnny builder  builder  you little devil  if i catch you ill wring your blasted little neck  boys voice  a little distant oo blacked the coppers eye       builder in an ungovernable passion seizes a small flowerpot from      the sill and dings it with all his force  the sound of a crash  boys voice  very distant  yaaah  missed       builder stands leaning out face injected with blood shaking his      fist       the curtain falls for a few seconds     scene iii  evening the same day       builders study is dim and neglectedlooking the window is still      open though it has become night  a street lamp outside shines in      and the end of its rays fall on builder asleep  he is sitting in a      high chair at the fireside end of the writingtable with his elbows      on it and his cheek resting on his hand  he is still unshaven and      his clothes unchanged  a boys head appears above the level of the      windowsill as if beheaded and fastened there  boys voice  in a forceful whisper  johnny builder       builder stirs uneasily  the boys head vanishes  builder raising      his other hand makes a sweep before his face as if to brush away a      mosquito  he wakes  takes in remembrance and sits a moment      staring gloomily before him  the door from the hall is opened and      topping comes in with a long envelope in his hand  topping  approaching  from the comet sir  proof of your interview sir will you please revise the messenger says he wants to take it back at once  builder  taking it  all right  ill ring  topping  shall i close in sir  builder  not now       topping withdraws  builder turns up a standard lamp on the table      opens the envelope and begins reading the galley slip  the signs      of uneasiness and discomfort grow on him   builder  did i say that  muck muck  he drops the proof sits a moment moving his head and rubbing one hand uneasily on the surface of the table then reaches out for the telephone receiver town 245 pause the comet  john builder  give me the editor  pause that you mr editor  john builder speaking  that interview  ive got the proof  it wont do  scrap the whole thing please  i dont want to

slip he tears it viciously across into many pieces and rams them into the envelope       topping enters  here give this to the messengersharp and tell him to run with it  topping  whose hand can feel the condition of the contents with a certain surprise  yes sir       he goes with a look back from the door  the mayor is here sir  i dont know whether you would wish       builder rising takes a turn up and down the room  builder  nor do i  yes ill see him       topping goes out and builder stands over by the fender with his      head a little down  topping  reentering  the mayor sir       he retires up left  the mayor is overcoated and carries of all      things a top hat  he reaches the centre of the room before he      speaks  mayor  embarrassed  well builder  builder  well  mayor  come  that caution of mine was quite parliamentary  i ad to save face you know  builder  and what about my face  mayor  well youyou made it difficult for me  ang it all  put yourself into my place  builder  grimly  id rather put you into mine as it was last night  mayor  yes yes  i know but the bench has got a name to keep upmust stand well in the peoples eyes  as it is i sailed very near the wind

embarrassment  thats right  we must face your position  builder  with a touch of grim humour  i never yet met a man who couldnt face another mans position  mayor  after all what is it  builder  splendid isolation  no wife no daughters no councillorship no magistracy no futurewith a laugh  not even a french maid  and why  because i tried to exercise a little wholesome family authority thats the position youre facing mayor  mayor  dear dear  youre devilish bitter builder  its unfortunate this publicity  but itll all blow over and youll be back where you were  youve a good sound practical sense underneath your temper  a pause  come now  a pause  well ill say goodnight then  builder  you shall have them in writing tomorrow  mayor  with sincerity  come  shake ands  builder after a long look holds out his hand  the two men exchange a grip       the mayor turning abruptly goes out       builder remains motionless for a minute then resumes his seat at      the side of the writing table leaning his head on his hands       the boys head is again seen rising above the level of the      windowsill and another and another follows till the three      as if decapitated heads are seen in a row  boys voices  one after another in a whispered crescendo  johnny builder  johnny builder  johnny builder       builder rises turns and stares at them  the three heads disappear      and a boys voice cries shrilly  johnny builder  builder moves      towards the window voices are now crying in various pitches and      keys johnny builder  beatey builder  beat is wifeer      beatey builder       builder stands quite motionless staring with the street lamp      lighting up a queer rather pitiful defiance on his face  the      voices swell  there comes a sudden swish and splash of water and      broken yells of dismay  toppings voice  scat  you young devils       the sound of scuffling feet and a longdrawnout and distant      miaou       builder stirs shuts the window draws the curtains goes to the      armchair before the fireplace and sits down in it       topping enters with a little tray on which is a steaming jug of      fluid some biscuits and a glass  he comes stealthily up level with      the chair  builder stirs and looks up at him  topping  excuse me sir you must ave digested yesterday mornings breakfast by nowmust live to eat sir  builder  all right  put it down  topping  putting the tray down on the table and taking up builders pipe i fair copped those young devils  builder  youre a good fellow  topping  filling the pipe  youll excuse me sir the missishas come back sir       builder stares at him and topping stops  he hands builder the      filled pipe and a box of matches  builder  with a shiver  light the fire topping  im chilly       while topping lights the fire builder puts the pipe in his mouth and      applies a match to it  topping having lighted the fire turns to      go gets as far as half way then comes back level with the table      and regards the silent brooding figure in the chair  builder  suddenly  give me that paper on the table  no the other onethe will       topping takes up the will and gives it to him  topping  with much hesitation  excuse me sir  its pluck that gets em ome sirbegging your pardon       builder has resumed his attitude and does not answer  in a voice just touched with feeling goodnight sir  builder  without turning his head  goodnight       topping has gone  builder sits drawing at his pipe between the      firelight and the light from the standard lamp  he takes the pipe      out of his mouth and a quiver passes over his face  with a half      angry gesture he rubs the back of his hand across his eyes  builder  to himself  pluck  pluck  his lips quiver again  he presses them hard together puts his pipe back into his mouth and taking the will thrusts it into the newlylighted fire and holds it there with a poker        while he is doing this the door from the hall is opened quietly and      mrs builder enters without his hearing her  she has a work bag in      her hand  she moves slowly to the table and stands looking at him      then going up to the curtains she mechanically adjusts them and      still keeping her eyes on builder comes down to the table and pours      out his usual glass of whisky toddy  builder who has become      conscious of her presence

his      dressingtable and begins to brush his hair sprinkling on essence      there is a knock on the corridor door  come in       de levis enters clad in pyjamas and flowered dressinggown  he is      a dark goodlooking rather eastern young man  his face is long      and disturbed  hallo  de levis  anything i can do for you  de levis  in a voice whose faint exoticism is broken by a vexed excitement  i say im awfully sorry winsor but i thought id better tell you at once  ive just haderrather a lot of money stolen  winsor  what  there is something of outrage in his tone and glance as who should say in my house  how do you mean stolen  de levis  i put it under my pillow and went to have a bath when i came back it was gone  winsor  good lord  how much  de levis  nearly a thousandnine hundred and seventy i think  winsor  phew  again the faint tone of outrage that a man should have so much money about him  de levis  i sold my rosemary filly today on the course to bentman the bookie and he paid me in notes  winsor  what  that weed dancy gave you in the spring  de levis  yes  but i tried her pretty high the other day and shes in the cambridgeshire  i was only out of my room a quarter of an hour and i locked my door  winsor  again outraged  you locked  de levis  not seeing the fine shade  yes and had the key here  he taps his pocket  look here  he holds out a pocketbook  its been stuffed with my shaving papers  winsor  between feeling that such things dont happen and a sense that he will have to clear it up  this is damned awkward de levis  de levis  with steel in his voice  yes  i should like it back  winsor  have you got the numbers of the notes  de levis  no  winsor  what were they  de levis  one hundred three fifties and the rest tens and fives  winsor  what dyou want me to do  de levis  unless theres anybody you think  winsor  eyeing him  is it likely  de levis  then i think the police ought to see my room  its a lot of money  winsor  good lord  were not in town therell be nobody nearer than newmarket at this time of nightfour miles       the door from the bedroom is suddenly opened and lady adela appears      she has on a lace cap over her finished hair and the wrapper  lady a  closing the door  what is it  are you ill mr de levis  winsor  worse hes had a lot of money stolen  nearly a thousand pounds  lady a  gracious  where  de levis  from under my pillow lady adelamy door was lockedi was in the bathroom  lady a  but how fearfully thrilling  winsor  thrilling  whats to be done  he wants it back  lady a  of course  with sudden realisation  oh  but  oh  its quite too unpleasant  winsor  yes  what am i to do  fetch the servants out of their rooms search the grounds  itll make the devil of a scandal  de levis  whos next

there theyre sure to have drunks  ill have treisure up and speak to him  he rings the bell       lady adela goes out into her room and closes the door  winsor  look here de levis  this isnt an hotel  its the sort of thing that doesnt happen in a decent house  are you sure youre not mistaken and didnt have them stolen on the course  de levis  absolutely  i counted them just before putting them under my pillow then i locked the door and had the key here  theres only one door you know  winsor  how was your window  de levis  open  winsor  drawing back the curtains of his own window  youve got a balcony like this  any sign of a ladder or anything  de levis  no  winsor  it must have been done from the window unless someone had a skeleton key  who knew youd got that money  where did kentman pay you  de levis  just round the corner in the further paddock  winsor  anybody about  de levis  oh yes  winsor  suspicious  de levis  i didnt notice anything  winsor  you must have been marked down and followed here  de levis  how would they know my room  winsor  might have got it somehow  a knock from the corridor come in       treisure the butler appears a silent grave man of almost      supernatural conformity  de levis gives him a quick hard look      noted and resented by winsor  treisure  to winsor  yes sir  winsor  who valets mr de levis  treisure  robert sir  winsor  when was he up last  treisure  in the ordinary course of things about ten oclock sir  winsor  when did he go to bed  treisure  i dismissed at eleven  winsor  but did he go  treisure  to the best of my knowledge  is there anything i can do sir  winsor  disregarding a sign from de levis  look here treisure mr de levis has had a large sum of money taken from his bedroom within the last half hour  treisure  indeed sir  winsor  roberts quite all right isnt he  treisure  he is sir  de levis  how do you know       treisures eyes rest on de levis  treisure  i am a pretty good judge of character sir if youll excuse me  winsor  look here de levis eighty or ninety notes must have been pretty bulky  you didnt have them on you at dinner  de levis  no  winsor  where did you put them  de levis  in a boot and the boot in my suitcase and locked it       treisure smiles faintly  winsor  again slightly outraged by such precautions in his house  and you found it lockedand took them from there to put under your pillow  de levis  yes  winsor  run your mind over things treisurehas any stranger been about  treisure  no sir  winsor  this seems to have happened between 1115 and 1130  is that right  de levis nods  any noiseanything outsideanything suspicious anywhere  treisure  running his mindvery still  no sir  winsor  what time did you shut up  treisure  i should say about elevenfifteen sir  as soon as major colford and captain dancy had finished billiards  what was mr de levis doing out of his room if i may ask sir  winsor  having a bath with his room locked and the key in his pocket  treisure  thank you sir  de levis  conscious of indefinable suspicion  damn it  what do you mean  i was  treisure  i beg your pardon sir  winsor  concealing a smile  look here treisure its infernally awkward for everybody  treisure  it is sir  winsor  what do you suggest  treisure  the proper thing sir i suppose would be a cordon and a complete searchin our interests  winsor  i entirely refuse to suspect anybody  treisure  but if mr de levis feels otherwise sir  de levis  stammering  i  all i know isthe money was there and its gone  winsor  compunctious  quite  its pretty sickening for you  but so it is for anybody else  however we must do our best to get it back for you       a knock on the door  winsor  hallo       treisure opens the door and general canynge enters  oh its you general  come in  adelas told you       general canynge nods  he is a slim man of about sixty very well      preserved intensely neat and selfcontained and still in evening      dress  his eyelids droop slightly but his eyes are keen and his      expression astute  winsor  well general whats the first move  canynge  lifting his eyebrows  mr de levis presses the matter  de levis  flicked again  unless you think its too plebeian of me general canyngea thousand pounds  canynge  drily  just so  then we must wait for the police winsor lady adela has got through to them  what height are these rooms from the ground treisure  treisure  twentythree feet from the terrace sir  canynge  any ladders near  treisure  one in the stables sir very heavy  no others within three hundred yards  canynge  just slip down and see whether thats been moved  treisure  very good general  he goes out  de levis  uneasily  of course hei suppose you  winsor  we do  canynge  you had better leave this in our hands de levis  de levis  certainly only the way he  winsor  curtly treisure has been here since he was a boy  i should as soon suspect myself  de levis  looking from one to the otherwith sudden anger  you seem to think  what was i to do  take it lying down and let whoever it is get clear off  i suppose its natural to want my money back       canynge looks at his nails winsor out of the window  winsor  turning  of course de levis  de levis  sullenly  well ill go to my room  when the police come perhaps youll let me know  he goes out  winsor  phew  did you ever see such a dressinggown       the door is opened  lady adela and margaret orme come in  the      latter is a vivid young lady of about twentyfive in a vivid      wrapper she is smoking a cigarette  lady a  ive told the dancysshe was in bed  and i got through to newmarket charles and inspector dede is coming like the wind on a motor cycle  margaret  did he say like the wind adela  he must have imagination isnt this gorgeous  poor little ferdy  winsor  vexed  you might take it seriously margaret its pretty beastly for us all  what time did you come up  margaret  i came up with adela  am i suspected charles  how thrilling  winsor  did you hear anything  margaret  only little ferdy splashing  winsor  and saw nothing  margaret  not even that alas  lady a  with a finger held up leste  un peu leste  oh  here are the dancys  come in you two       mabel and ronald dancy enter  she is a pretty young woman with      bobbed hair fortunately for she has just got out of bed and is in      her nightgown and a wrapper  dancy is in his smoking jacket  he      has a pale determined face with high cheekbones small deepset      dark eyes reddish crisp hair and looks like a horseman  winsor  awfully sorry to disturb you mrs dancy but i suppose

look out of your window mrs dancy  mabel  yes  i stood there quite five minutes  canynge  when  mabel  just about eleven i should think  it was raining hard then  canynge  yes its just stopped  you

hotel  does he put his boots out  lady a  dont be so naughty meg  canynge  when exactly did you come up dance  dancy  about ten minutes ago  id only just got into my dressingroom before lady adela

say so       he goes  winsor  de levis has got wrong with treisure  suddenly  but i say what would any of us have done if wed been in his shoes  margaret  a thousand pounds  i cant even conceive having it  dancy  we probably shouldnt have found it out  lady a  nobut if we had  dancy  come to youas he did  winsor  yes but theres a way of doing things  canynge  we shouldnt have wanted the police  margaret  no  thats it  the hotel touch  lady a  poor young man i think were rather hard on him  winsor  he sold that weed you gave him dancy to kentman the bookie and these were the proceeds  dancy  oh  winsor  hed tried her high he said  dancy  grimly  he would  mabel  oh ronny what bad luck  winsor  he must have been followed here  at the window  after rain like that there ought to be footmarks       the splutter of a motor cycle is heard  margaret  heres the wind  winsor  whats the move now general  canynge  you and i had better see the inspector in de leviss room winsor  to the others  if youll all be handy in case he wants to put questions for himself  margaret  i hope hell want me its just too thrilling  dancy  i hope he wont want me im dogtired  come on mabel  he puts his arm in his wifes  canynge  just a minute charles       he draws dose to winsor as the others are departing to their rooms  winsor  yes general  canynge  we must be careful with this inspector fellow  if he pitches hastily on somebody in the house itll be very disagreeable  winsor  by jove  it will  canynge  we dont want to rouse any ridiculous suspicion  winsor  quite  a knock  come in  treisure enters  treisure  inspector dede sir  winsor  show him in  treisure  robert is in readiness sir but i could swear he knows nothing about it  winsor  all right       treisure reopens the door and says come in please  the      inspector enters blue formal moustachioed with a peaked cap in      his hand  winsor  good evening inspector  sorry to have brought you out at this time of night  inspector  good  evenin  sir  mr winsor  youre the owner here i think  winsor  yes  general canynge  inspector  good evenin general  i understand a large sum of money  winsor  yes  shall we go straight to the room it was taken from  one of my guests mr de levis  its the third room on the left  canynge  weve not been in there yet inspector in fact weve done nothing except to find out that the stable ladder has not been moved we havent even searched the grounds  inspector  right sir ive brought a man with me       they go out                  curtain  and interval of a minute     scene ii       the same set is used for this scene with the different arrangement      of furniture as specified       the bedroom of de levis is the same in shape as winsors      dressingroom except that there is only one doorto the      corridor  the furniture however is differently arranged a      small fourposter bedstead stands against the wall right back      jutting into the room a chair on which de leviss clothes are      thrown stands at its foot there is a dressingtable against the      wall to the left of the open windows where the curtains are      drawn back and a stone balcony is seen  against the wall to the      right of the window is a chest of drawers and a washstand is      against the wall left  on a small table to the right of the bed      an electric reading lamp is turned up and there is a light over      the dressingtable  the inspector is standing plumb centre      looking at the bed and de levis by the back of the chair at the      foot of the bed  winsor and canynge are close to the door right      forward  inspector  finishing a note  now sir if this is the room as you left it for your bath just show us exactly what you did after takin the pocketbook from the suit case  where was that by the way  de levis  pointing  where it is nowunder the dressingtable       he comes forward to the front of the chair opens the pocketbook      goes through the pretence of counting his shaving papers closes the      pocketbook takes it to the head of the bed and slips it under the      pillow  makes the motion of taking up his pyjamas crosses below      the inspector to the washstand takes up a bath sponge crosses to      the door takes out the key opens the door  inspector  writing  we now have the room as it was when the theft was committed  reconstruct accordin to uman nature gentlemenassumin the thief to be in the room what would he try firstthe clothes the dressintable the suit case the chest of drawers and last the bed       he moves accordingly examining the glass on the dressingtable the      surface of the suit cases and the handles of the drawers with a      spyglass for fingermarks  canynge  sotto voce to winsor  the order would have been just the other way       the inspector goes on hands and knees and examines the carpet      between the window and the bed  de levis  can i come in again  inspector  standing up  did you open the window sir or was it open when you first came in  de levis  i opened it  inspector  drawin the curtains back first  de levis  yes  inspector  sharply  are you sure there was nobody in the room already  de levis  taken aback  i dont know  i never thought  i didnt look under the bed if you mean that  inspector  jotting  did not look under bed  did you look under it after the theft  de levis  no  i didnt  inspector  ah  now what did you do after you came back from your bath just give us that precisely  de levis  locked the door and left the key in  put back my sponge and took off my dressinggown and put it there  he points to the footrails of the bed  then i drew the curtains again  inspector  shutting the window  de levis  no  i got into bed felt for my watch to see the time  my hand struck the pocketbook and somehow it felt thinner  i took it out looked into it and found the notes gone and these shaving papers instead  inspector  let me have a look at those sir  he applies the spyglasses  and then  de levis  i think i just sat on the bed  inspector  thinkin and cursin a bit i suppose  yees  de levis  then i put on my dressinggown and went straight to mr winsor  inspector  not lockin the door  de levis  no  inspector  exactly  with a certain finality  now sir what time did you come up  de levis  about eleven  inspector  precise if you can give it me  de levis  well i know it was elevenfifteen when i put my watch under my pillow before i went to the bath and i suppose id been about a quarter of an hour undressing  i should say after eleven if anything  inspector  just undressin  didnt look over your bettin book  de levis  no  inspector  no prayers or anything  de levis  no  inspector  pretty slippy with your undressin as a rule  de levis  yes  say five past eleven  inspector  mr winsor what time did the gentleman come to you  winsor  halfpast eleven  inspector  how do you fix that sir  winsor  id just looked at the time and told my wife to send her maid off  inspector  then weve got it fixed between 1115 and 1130 jots  now sir before we go further id like to see your butler and the footman that valets this gentleman  winsor  with distaste  very well inspector onlymy butler has been with us from a boy  inspector  quite so  this is just clearing the ground sir  winsor  general dyou mind touching that bell  canynge rings a bell by the bed  inspector  well gentlemen there are four possibilities  either the thief was here all the time waiting under the bed and slipped out after this gentleman had gone to mr winsor  or he came in with a key that fits the lock and ill want to see all the keys in the house  or he came in with a skeleton key and out by the window probably droppin from the balcony  or he came in by the window with a rope or ladder and out the same way  pointing  theres a footmark here from a big boot which has been out of doors since it rained  canynge  inspectoryou erwalked up to the window when you first came into the room  inspector  stiffly  i had not overlooked that general  canynge  of course       a knock on the door relieves a certain tension  winsor  come in       the footman robert a freshfaced young man enters followed by      treisure  inspector  you valet mrmr de levis i think  robert  yes sir  inspector  at what time did you take his clothes and boots  robert  ten oclock sir  inspector  with a pounce  did you happen to look under his bed  robert  no sir  inspector  did you come up again to bring the clothes back  robert  no sir theyre still downstairs  inspector  did you come up again for anything  robert  no sir  inspector  what time did you go to bed  robert  just after eleven sir  inspector  scrutinising him  now be careful  did you go to bed at all  robert  no sir  inspector  then why did you say you did  theres been a theft here and anything you say may be used against you  robert  yes sir  i meant i went to my room  inspector  where is your room  robert  on the ground floor at the other end of the right wing sir  winsor  its the extreme end of the house from this inspector  hes with the other two footmen  inspector  were you there alone  robert  no sir  thomas and frederick was there too  treisure  thats right ive seen them  inspector  holding up his hand for silence  were you out of the room again after you went in  robert  no sir  inspector  what were you doing if you didnt go to bed  robert  to winsor  beggin your pardon sir we were playin bridge  inspector  very good  you can go  ill see them later on  robert  yes sir  theyll say the same as me  he goes out leaving a smile on the face of all except the inspector and de levis  inspector  sharply  call him back       treisure calls robert and the footman reenters  robert  yes sir  inspector  did you notice anything particular about mr de leviss clothes  robert  only that they were very good sir  inspector  i meananything peculiar  robert  after reflection  yes sir  inspector  well  robert  a pair of his boots this evenin was reduced to one sir  inspector  what did you make of that  robert  i thought he might have thrown the other at a cat or something  inspector  did you look for it  robert  no sir i meant to draw his attention to it in the morning  inspector  very good  robert  yes sir  he goes again  inspector  looking at de levis  well sir theres your story corroborated  de levis  stifly i dont know why it should need corroboration inspector  inspector  in my experience you can never have too much of that  to winsor i understand theres a lady in the room on this side pointing left and a gentleman on this pointing right  were they in their rooms  winsor  miss orme was captain dancy not  inspector  do they know of the affair  winsor  yes  inspector  well id just like the keys of their doors for a minute  my man will get them       he goes to the door opens it and speaks to a constable in the      corridor  to treisure  you can go with him       treisure goes out  in the meantime ill just examine the balcony       he goes out on the balcony followed by de levis  winsor  to canynge  damn de levis and his money  its deuced invidious all this general  canynge  the inspectors no earthly       there is a simultaneous reentry of the inspector from the balcony      and of treisure and the constable from the corridor  constable  handing key  room on the left sir  handing key  room on the right sir       the inspector tries the keys in the door watched with tension by      the others  the keys fail  inspector  put them back       hands keys to constable who goes out followed by treisure  ill have to try every key in the house sir  winsor  inspector do you really think it necessary to disturb the whole house and knock up all my guests  its most disagreeable all this you know  the loss of the money is not such a great matter  mr de levis has a very large income  canynge  you could get the numbers of the notes from kentman the bookmaker inspector hell probably have the big ones anyway  inspector  shaking his head  a bookie  i dont suppose he will sir its come and go with them all the time  winsor  we dont want a meldon court scandal inspector  inspector  well mr winsor ive formed my theory       as he speaks de levis comes in from the balcony  and i dont say to try the keys is necessary to it but strictly i ought to exhaust the possibilities  winsor  what do you say de levis  dyou want everybody in the house knocked up so that their keys can be tried  de levis  whose face since his return expresses a curious excitement no i dont  inspector  very well gentlemen  in my opinion the thief walked in before the door was locked probably during dinner and was under the bed  he escaped by dropping from the balconythe creeper at that corner he points stage left has been violently wrenched  ill go down now and examine the grounds and ill see you again sir  he makes another entry in his notebook  goodnight then gentlemen  canynge  goodnight  winsor  with relief  ill come with you inspector       he escorts him to the door and they go out  de levis  suddenly general i know who took them  canynge  the deuce you do  are you following the inspectors theory  de levis  contemptuously  that ass  pulling the shaving papers out of the case  no  the man who put those there was clever and cool enough to wrench that creeper off the balcony as a blind  come and look here general  he goes to the window the general follows  de levis points stage right  see the rail of my balcony and the rail of the next  he holds up the cord of his dressinggown stretching his arms out  ive measured it with this  just over seven feet thats all  if a man can take a standing jump on to a narrow bookcase four feet high and balance there hed make nothing of that  and look here  he goes out on the balcony and returns with a bit of broken creeper in his hand and holds it out into the light  someones stood on thatthe stalks crushedthe inner corner too where hed naturally stand when he took his jump back  canynge  after examining itstiffly  that other balcony is young dancys mr de levis a soldier and a gentleman  this is an extraordinary insinuation  de levis  accusation  canynge  what  de levis  i have intuitions general its in my blood  i see the whole thing  dancy came up watched me into the bathroom tried my door slipped back into his dressingroom saw my window was open took that jump sneaked the notes filled the case up with these wrenched the creeper there he points stage left for a blind jumped back and slipped downstairs again  it didnt take him four minutes altogether  canynge  very gravely  this is outrageous de levis  dancy says he was downstairs all the time  you must either withdraw unreservedly or i must confront you with him  de levis  if hell return the notes and apologise ill do nothing except cut him in future  he gave me that filly you know as a hopeless weed and hes been pretty sick ever since that he was such a flat as not to see how good she was  besides hes hard up i know  canynge  after a vexed turn up and down the room  its mad sir to jump to conclusions like this  de levis  not so mad as the conclusion dancy jumped to when he lighted on my balcony  canynge  nobody could have taken this money who did not know you had it  de levis  how do you know that he didnt  canynge  do you know that he did  de levis  i havent the least doubt of it  canynge  without any proof  this is very ugly de levis  i must tell winsor  de levis  angrily  tell the whole blooming lot  you think ive no feelers but ive felt the atmosphere here i can tell you general  if i were in dancys shoes and he in mine your tone to me would be very different  canynge  suavely frigid  im not aware of using any tone as you call it  but this is a private house mr de levis and something is due to our host and to the esprit de corps that exists among gentlemen  de levis  since when is a thief a gentleman  thick as thievesa good motto isnt it  canynge  thats enough  he goes to the door but stops before opening it  now look here  i have some knowledge of the world  once an accusation like this passes beyond these walls no one can foresee the consequences  captain dancy is a gallant fellow with a fine record as a soldier and only just married  if hes as innocent aschristmud will stick to him unless the real thief is found  in the old days of swords either you or he would not have gone out of this room alive  it you persist in this absurd accusation you will both of you go out of this room dead in the eyes of society  you for bringing it he for being the object of it  de levis  society  do you think i dont know that im only tolerated for my money  society cant add injury to insult and have my money as well thats all  if the notes are restored ill keep my mouth shut if theyre not i shant  im certain im right  i ask nothing better than to be confronted with dancy but if you prefer it deal with him in your own wayfor the sake of your esprit de corps  canynge  pon my soul mr de levis you go too far  de levis  not so far as i shall go general canynge if those notes arent given back  winsor comes in  winsor  well de levis im afraid thats all we can do for the present so very sorry this should have happened in my house  canynge  alter a silence  theres a development winsor  mr de levis accuses one of your guests  winsor  what  canynge  of jumping from his balcony to this taking the notes and jumping back  ive done my best to dissuade him from indulging the fancywithout success  dancy must be told  de levis  you can deal with dancy in your own way  all i want is the money back  canynge  drily  mr de levis feels that he is only valued for his money so that it is essential for him to have it back  winsor  damn it  this is monstrous de levis  ive known ronald dancy since he was a boy  canynge  you talk about adding injury to insult de levis  what do you call such treatment of a man who gave you the mare out of which you made this thousand pounds  de levis  i didnt want the mare i took her as a favour  canynge  with an eye to possibilities i venture to thinkthe principle guides a good many transactions  de levis  as if flicked on a raw spot  in my race do you mean  canynge  coldly  i said nothing of the sort  de levis  no you dont say these things any of you  canynge  nor did i think it  de levis  dancy does  winsor  really de levis if this is the way you repay hospitality  de levis  hospitality that skins my feelings and costs me a thousand pounds  canynge  go and get dancy winsor but dont say anything to him       winsor goes out  canynge  perhaps you will kindly control yourself and leave this to me       de levis turns to the window and lights a cigarette  winsor comes      back followed by dancy  canynge  for winsors sake dancy we dont want any scandal or fuss about this affair  weve tried to make the police understand that  to my mind the whole thing turns on our finding who knew that de levis had this money  its about that we want to consult you  winsor  kentman paid de levis round the corner in the further paddock he says       de levis turns round from the window so that he and dancy are      staring at each other  canynge  did you hear anything that throws light dancy  as it was your filly originally we thought perhaps you might  dancy  i  no  canynge  didnt hear of the sale on the course at all  dancy  no  canynge  then you cant suggest any one who could have known  nothing else was taken you see  dancy  de levis is known to be rolling as i am known to be stony  canynge  there are a good many people still rolling besides mr de levis but not many people with so large a sum in their pocketbooks  dancy  he won two races  de levis  do you suggest that i bet in ready money  dancy  i dont know how you bet and i dont care  canynge  you cant help us then  dancy  no  i cant  anything else  he looks fixedly at de levis  canynge  putting his hand on dancys arm  nothing else thank you dancy       dancy goes  canynge puts his hand up to his face  a moments      silence  winsor  you see de levis  he didnt even know youd got the money  de levis  very conclusive  winsor  well  you are       there is a knock on the door and the inspector enters  inspector  im just going gentlemen  the grounds im sorry to say have yielded nothing  its a bit of a puzzle  canynge  youve searched thoroughly  inspector  we have general  i can pick up nothing near the terrace  winsor  after a look at de levis whose face expresses too much  hm youll take it up from the other end then inspector  inspector  well well see what we can do with the bookmakers about the numbers sir  before i go gentlemenyouve had time to think it over theres no one you suspect in the house i suppose       de leviss face is alive and uncertain  canynge is staring at him      very fixedly  winsor  emphatically no       de levis turns and goes out on to the balcony  inspector  if youre coming in to the racing tomorrow sir you might give us a call  ill have seen kentman by then  winsor  right you are inspector  good night and many thanks  inspector  youre welcome sir  he goes out  winsor  gosh  i thought that chap  with a nod towards the balcony was going to  look here general we must stop his tongue  imagine it going the rounds  they may never find the real thief you know  its the very devil for dancy  canynge  winsor  dancys sleeve was damp  winsor  how dyou mean  canynge  quite damp  its been raining       the two look at each other  winsor  ii dont follow  his voice is hesitative and lower showing that he does  canynge  it was coming down hard a minute out in it would have been enoughhe motions with his chin towards the balcony  winsor  hastily  he must have been out on his balcony since  canynge  it stopped before i came up half an hour ago  winsor  hes been leaning on the wet stone then  canynge  with the outside of the upper part of the arm  winsor  against the wall perhaps  there may be a dozen explanations very low and with great concentration  i entirely and absolutely refuse to believe anything of the sort against ronald dancy in my house  dash it general we must do as wed be done by  it hits us allit hits us all  the things intolerable  canynge  i agree  intolerable  raising his voice  mr de levis  de levis returns into view in the centre of the open window  canynge  with cold decision  young dancy was an officer and is a gentleman this insinuation is pure supposition and you must not make it  do you understand me  de levis  my tongue is still mine general if my money isnt  canynge  unmoved  must not  youre a member of three clubs you want to be member of a fourth  no one who makes such an insinuation against a fellowguest in a country house except on absolute proof can do so without complete ostracism  have we your word to say nothing  de levis  social blackmail  hm  canynge  not at allsimple warning  if you consider it necessary in your interests to start this scandalno matter how we shall consider it necessary in ours to dissociate ourselves completely from one who so recklessly disregards the unwritten code  de levis  do you think your code applies to me  do you general  canynge  to anyone who aspires to be a gentleman sir  de levis  ah  but you havent known me since i was a boy  canynge  make up your mind       a pause  de levis  im not a fool general  i know perfectly well that you can get me outed  canynge  icily  well  de levis  sullenly  ill say nothing about it unless i get more proof  canynge  good  we have implicit faith in dancy       there is a moments encounter of eyes the generals steady shrewd      impassive winsors angry and defiant de leviss mocking a little      triumphant malicious  then canynge and winsor go to the door and      pass out  de levis  to himself  rats                              curtain     act ii  scene i       afternoon three weeks later in the card room of a london club  a      fire is burning left  a door right leads to the billiardroom      rather left of centre at a card table lord st erth an old john      bull sits facing the audience to his right is general canynge to      his left augustus borring an essential clubman about thirtyfive      years old with a very slight and rather becoming stammer or click      in his speech  the fourth bridge player charles winsor stands      with his back to the fire  borring  and the rrub  winsor  by george  you do hold cards borring  st erth  who has lost  not a patch on the old whistthis game  dont know why i play itnever did  canynge  st erth shall we raise the flag for whist again  winsor  no go general  you cant go back on pace  no getting a man to walk when he knows he can fly  the young men wont look at it  borring  better develop it so that ttwo can sit out general  st erth  we ought to have stuck to the old game  wish id gone to newmarket canynge in spite of the weather  canynge  looking at his watch  lets hear whats won the cambridgeshire  ring wont you winsor winsor rings  st erth  by the way canynge young de levis was blackballed  canynge  what  st erth  i looked in on my way down       canynge sits very still and winsor utters a disturbed sound  borring  but of ccourse he was general  what did you expect       a footman enters  footman  yes my lord  st erth  what won the cambridgeshire  footman  rosemary my lord  sherbet second barbizon third  nine to one the winner  winsor  thank you  thats all       footman goes  borring  rosemary  and de levis sold her  but he got a good pprice i suppose       the other three look at him  st erth  many a slip between price and pocket young man  canynge  cut  they cut  borring  i say is that the yarn thats going round about his having had a lot of mmoney stolen in a country house  by jove  hell be pretty ssick  winsor  you and i borring       he sits down in canynges chair and the general takes his place by      the fire  borring  phew  wont dancy be mad  he gave that filly away to save her keep  he was rather pleased to find somebody whod take her  bentman must have won a ppot  she was at thirtythrees a fortnight ago  st erth  all the money goes to fellows who dont know a horse from a haystack  canynge  profoundly  and care less  yes  we want men racing to whom a horse means something  borring  i thought the horse mmeant the same to everyone general chance to get the bbetter of ones neighbour  canynge  with feeling  the horse is a noble animal sir as youd know if youd owed your life to them as often as i have  borring  they always try to take mine general  i shall never belong to the noble ffellowship of the horse  st erth  drily  evidently  deal       as borring begins to deal the door is opened and major colford      appearsa lean and moustached cavalryman  borring  hallo ccolford  colford  general       something in the tone of his voice brings them all to a standstill  colford  i want your advice  young de levis in there  he points to the billiardroom from which he has just come  has started a blasphemous story  canynge  one moment  mr borring dyou mind  colford  it makes no odds general  four of us in there heard him hes saying it was ronald dancy robbed him down at winsors  the fellows mad over losing the price of that filly now shes won the cambridgeshire  borring  all ears  dancy  great sscott  colford  dancys in the club  if he hadnt been id have taken it on myself to wring the bounders neck       winsor and borring have risen  st erth alone remains seated  canynge  after consulting st erth with a look  ask de levis to be good enough to come in here  borring you might see that dancy doesnt leave the club  we shall want him  dont say anything to him and use your tact to keep people off       borring goes out followed by colford  winsor  result of hearing      he was blackballedpretty slippy  canynge  st erth i told you there was good reason when i asked you to back young de levis  winsor and i knew of this insinuation i wanted to keep his tongue quiet  its just wild assertion to have it bandied about was unfair to dancy  the duel used to keep peoples tongues in order  st erth  hm  it  never  settled  anything except who could shoot straightest  colford  reappearing  de levis says hes nothing to add to what he said to you before on the subject  canynge  kindly tell him that if he wishes to remain a member of this club he must account to the committee for such a charge against a fellowmember  four of us are here and form a quorum       colford goes out again  st erth  did kentman ever give the police the numbers of those notes winsor  winsor  he only had the numbers of twothe hundred and one of the fifties  st erth  and they havent traced em  winsor  not yet       as he speaks de levis comes in  he is in a highlycoloured not to      say excited state  colford follows him  de levis  well general canynge  its a little too strong all this a little too strong  under emotion his voice is slightly more exotic  canynge  calmly  it is obvious mr de levis that you and captain dancy cant both remain members of this club  we ask you for an explanation before requesting one resignation or the other  de levis  youve let me down  canynge  what  de levis  well i shall tell people that you and lord st erth backed me up for one club and asked me to resign from another  canynge  its a matter of indifference to me sir what you tell people  st erth  drily  you seem a venomous young man  de levis  ill tell you what seems to me venomous my lordchasing a man like a pack of hounds because he isnt your breed  canynge  you appear to have your breed on the brain sir  nobody else does so far as i know  de levis  suppose i had robbed dancy would you chase him out for complaining of it  colford  my god  if you repeat that  canynge  steady colford  winsor  you make this accusation that dancy stole your money in my house on no proofno proof and you expect dancys friends to treat you as if you were a gentleman  thats too strong if you like  de levis  no proof  bentman told me at newmarket yesterday that dancy did know of the sale  he told goole and goole says that he himself spoke of it to dancy  winsor  wellif he did  de levis  dancy told you he didnt know of it in general canynges presence and mine  to canynge you cant deny that if you want to  canynge  choose your expressions more nicely please  de levis  proof  did they find any footmarks in the grounds below that torn creeper  not a sign  you saw how he can jump he won ten pounds from me that same evening betting on what he knew was a certainty thats your dancya common sharper  canynge  nodding towards the billiardroom  are those fellows still in there colford  colford  yes  canynge  then bring dancy up will you  but dont say anything to him  colford  to de levis you may think yourself damned lucky if he doesnt break your neck       he goes out  the three who are left with de levis avert their eyes      from him  de levis  smouldering  i have a memory and a sting too  yes my lordsince you are good enough to call me venomous  to canynge  i quite understandim marked for coventry now whatever happens  well ill take dancy with me  st erth  to himself  this club has always had a decent quiet name  winsor  are you going to retract and apologise in front of dancy and the members who heard you  de levis  no fear  st erth  you must be a very rich man sir  a jury is likely to take the view that money can hardly compensate for an accusation of that sort       de levis stands silent  canynge  courts of law require proof  st erth  he can make it a criminal action  winsor  unless you stop this at once you may find yourself in prison if you can stop it that is  st erth  if i were young dancy nothing should induce me  de levis  but you didnt steal my money lord st erth  st erth  youre deuced positive sir  so far as i could understand it there were a dozen ways you could have been robbed  it seems to me you value other mens reputations very lightly  de levis  confront me with dancy and give me fair play  winsor  aside to canynge  is it fair to dancy not to let him know  canynge  our duty is to the club now winsor  we must have this cleared up       colford comes in followed by borring and dancy  st erth  captain dancy a serious accusation has been made against you by this gentleman in the presence of several members of the club  dancy  what is it  st erth  that you robbed him of that money at winsors  dancy  hard and tense  indeed  on what grounds is he good enough to say that  de levis  tense too  you gave me that filly to save yourself her keep and youve been mad about it ever since you knew from goole that i had sold her to kentman and been paid in cash yet i heard you myself deny that you knew it  you had the next room to me and you can jump like a cat as we saw that evening i found some creepers crushed by a weight on my balcony on that side  when i went to the bath your door was open and when i came back it was shut  canynge  thats the first we have heard about the door  de levis  i remembered it afterwards  st erth  well dancy  dancy  with intense deliberation  ill settle this matter with any weapons when and where he likes  st erth  drily  it cant be settled that wayyou know very well you must take it to the courts unless he retracts  dancy  will you retract  de levis  why did you tell general canynge you didnt know kentman had paid me in cash  dancy  because i didnt  de levis  then kentman and goole liedfor no reason  dancy  thats nothing to do with me  de levis  if you were downstairs all the time as you say why was your door first open and then shut  dancy  being downstairs how should i know  the wind probably  de levis  i should like to hear what your wife says about it  dancy  leave my wife alone you damned jew  st erth  captain dancy  de levis  white with rage thief  dancy  will you fight  de levis  youre very smartdead men tell no tales  no  bring your action and we shall see       dancy takes a step towards him but canynge and winsor interpose  st erth  thatll do mr de levis we wont keep you  he looks round kindly consider your membership suspended till this matter has been threshed out  de levis  tremulous with anger  dont trouble yourselves about my membership  i resign it  to dancy  you called me a damned jew  my race was old when you were all savages  i am proud to be a jew  au revoir in the courts       he goes out and silence follows his departure  st erth  well captain dancy  dancy  if the brute wont fight what am i to do sir  st erth  weve told youtake action to clear your name  dancy  colford you saw me in the hall writing letters after our game  colford  certainly i did you were there when i went to the smokingroom  canynge  how long after you left the billiardroom  colford  about five minutes  dancy  its impossible for me to prove that i was there all the time  canynge  its for de levis to prove what he asserts  you heard what he said about goole  dancy  if he told me i didnt take it in  st erth  this concerns the honour of the club  are you going to take action  dancy  slowly  that is a very expensive business lord st erth and im hard up  i must think it over  he looks round from face to face am i to take it that there is a doubt in your minds gentlemen  colford  emphatically  no  canynge  thats not the question dancy  this accusation was overheard by various members and we represent the club  if you dont take action judgment will naturally go by default  dancy  i might prefer to look on the whole thing as beneath contempt       he turns and goes out  when he is gone there is an even longer      silence than after de leviss departure  st erth  abruptly i dont like it  winsor  ive known him all his life  colford  you may have my head if he did it lord st erth  he and i have been in too many holes together  by gad  my toe itches for that fellows butt end  borring  im sorry but has he ttaken it in quite the right way  i should have thoughthearing it ssuddenly  colford  bosh  winsor  its perfectly damnable for him  st erth  more damnable if he did it winsor  borring  the courts are bbeastly distrustful dont you know  colford  his words good enough for me  canynge  were as anxious to believe dancy as you colford for the honour of the army and the club  winsor  of course hell bring a case when hes thought it over  st erth  what are we to do in the meantime  colford  if dancys asked to resign you may take my resignation too  borring  i thought his wanting to ffight him a bit screeny  colford  wouldnt you have wanted a shot at the brute  a law court pah  winsor  yes  whatll be his position even if he wins  borring  damages and a stain on his ccharacter  winsor  quite so unless they find the real thief  people always believe the worst  colford  glaring at borring  they do  canynge  there is no decent way out of a thing of this sort  st erth  no  rising  it leaves a bad taste  im sorry for young mrs dancypoor woman  borring  are you going to play any more  st erth  abruptly  no sir  good night to you  canynge can i give you a lift       he goes out followed by canynge  borring  after a slight pause  well i shall go and take the ttemperature of the club       he goes out  colford  damn that effeminate stammering chap  what can we do for dancy winsor  winsor  colford  a slight pause  the general felt his coat sleeve that night and it was wet  colford  well  what proofs that  no by george  an old schoolfellow a brother officer and a pal  winsor  if he did do it  colford  he didnt  but if he did id stick to him and see him through it if i could       winsor walks over to the fire stares into it turns round and      stares at colford who is standing motionless  colford  yes by god                                 curtain     scene ii      notethis should be a small set capable of being set quickly      within that of the previous scene       morning of the following day  the dancys flat  in the      sittingroom of this small abode mabel dancy and margaret orme      are sitting full face to the audience on a couch in the centre      of the room in front of the imaginary window  there is a      fireplace left with fire burning a door below it left and a      door on the right facing the audience leads to a corridor and      the outer door of the flat which is visible  their voices are      heard in rapid exchange then as the curtain rises so does      mabel  mabel  but its monstrous  margaret  of course  she lights a cigarette and hands the case to mabel who however sees nothing but her own thoughts  de levis might just as well have pitched on me except that i cant jump more than six inches in these skirts  mabel  its wicked  yesterday afternoon at the club did you say ronny hasnt said a word to me  why  margaret  with a long puff of smoke  doesnt want you bothered  mabel  butgood heavensme  margaret  havent you found out mabel that he isnt exactly communicative  no desperate character is

its for him they ought  margaret  again handing the cigarette case  do smoke old thing       mabel takes a cigarette this time but does not light it  it isnt altogether simple  general canynge was there last night  you dont mind my being beastly frank do you  mabel  no  i want it  margaret  well hes all for esprit de corps and that  but he was awfully silent  mabel  i hate halfhearted friends

rather not       mabel goes out by the door left  poor kid       she curls herself into a corner of the sofa as if trying to get      away from life  the bell rings  margaret stirs gets up and goes      out into the corridor where she opens the door to lady adela      winsor whom she precedes into the sittingroom  enter the second murderer  dyou know that child knew nothing  lady a  where is she

very good when her husband is in danger  mabel  in other words im lying  de levis  no  your wish is mother to your thought thats all  mabel  after staring again with a sort of horror turns to get control of herself  then turning back to him mr de levis i appeal to you as a gentleman to behave to us as you would we should behave to you  withdraw this wicked charge and write an apology that ronald can show  de levis  mrs dancy i am not a gentleman i am only adamned jew yesterday i might possibly have withdrawn to spare you  but when my race is insulted i have nothing to say to your husband but as he wishes to see me ive come  please let him know  mabel  regarding him again with that look of horrorslowly  i think what you are doing is too horrible for words       de levis gives her a slight bow and as he does so dancy comes      quickly in left  the two men stand with the length of the sofa      between them  mabel behind the sofa turns her eyes on her      husband who has a paper in his right hand  de levis  you came to see me  dancy  yes  i want you to sign this  de levis  i will sign nothing  dancy  let me read it i apologise to captain dancy for the reckless and

mabel  no no  de levis  quite right mrs dancy  black and tan swashbuckling will only make things worse for him  dancy  so you shelter behind a woman do you you skulking cur       de levis takes a step with fists clenched and eyes blazing  dancy      too stands ready to springthe moment is cut short by mabel going      quickly to her husband  mabel  dont ronny  its undignified  he isnt worth it       dancy suddenly tears the paper in two and flings it into the fire  dancy  get out of here you swine       de levis stands a moment irresolute then turning to the door he      opens it stands again for a moment with a smile on his face then      goes  mabel crosses swiftly to the door and shuts it as the outer      door closes  then she stands quite still looking at her husband      her face expressing a sort of startled suspense  dancy  turning and looking at her  well  do you agree with him  mabel  what do you mean  dancy  that i wouldnt be playing this game unless  mabel  dont  you hurt me  dancy  yes  you dont know much of me mabel  mabel  ronny  dancy  what did you say to that swine  mabel  her face averted that he was robbing us  turning to him suddenly  ronnyyoudidnt  id

above her head is contorted for a moment then hardens into a mask well what shall we do  lets go to that lawyerlets go  mabel  oh at once  dancy  all right  get your hat on       mabel passes him and goes into the bedroom left  dancy left      alone stands quite still staring before him  with a sudden shrug      of his shoulders he moves quickly to his hat and takes it up just as      mabel returns ready to go out  he opens the door and crossing      him she stops in the doorway looking up with a clear and trustful      gaze as                               the curtain falls     act iii  scene i       three months later  old mr jacob twisdens room at the offices of      twisden  graviter in lincolns inn fields is spacious with two      large windows at back a fine old fireplace right a door below it      and two doors left  between the windows is a large table sideways      to the window wall with a chair in the middle on the righthand      side a chair against the wall and a clients chair on the      lefthand side       graviter twisdens much younger partner is standing in front of      the righthand window looking out on to the fields where the lamps      are being lighted and a taxis engine is running down below  he      turns his sanguine shrewd face from the window towards a      grandfather dock between the doors left which is striking four      the door left forward is opened  young clerk  entering  a mr gilman sir to see mr twisden  graviter  by appointment  young clerk  no sir  but important he says  graviter  ill see him       the clerk goes  graviter sits right of table  the clerk returns      ushering in an oldish man who looks what he is the proprietor of a      large modern grocery store  he wears a dark overcoat and carries a      pot hat  his gingerygrey moustache and muttonchop whiskers give      him the expression of a cat  graviter  sizing up his social standing  mr gilman  yes  gilman  doubtfully  mr jacob twisden  graviter  smiling his partner  graviter my name is  gilman  mr twisdens not in then  graviter  no  hes at the courts  theyre just up he should be in directly  but hell be busy  gilman  old mr jacob twisdenive heard of him  graviter  most people have  gilman  its this dancyde levis case thats keepin him at the courts i suppose       graviter nods  wont be finished for a day or two       graviter shakes his head  no  astonishin the interest taken in it  graviter  as you say  gilman  the smart set  eh  this captain dancy got the dso didnt he       graviter nods  sad to have a thing like that said about you  i thought he gave his evidence well and his wife too  looks as if this de levis had got some private spite  searchy la femme i said to mrs gilman only this morning before i  graviter  by the way sir what is your business  gilman  well my business hereno if youll excuse me id rather wait and see old mr jacob twisden  its delicate and id like his experience  graviter with a shrug  very well then perhaps youll go in there he moves towards the door left back  gilman  thank you  following  you see ive never been mixed up with the law  graviter  opening the door no  gilman  and i dont want to begin  when you do you dont know where youll stop do you  you see ive only come from a sense of duty and other reasons  graviter  not uncommon  gilman  producing card this is my card  gilmansseveral branches but this is the ead  graviter  scrutinising card  exactly  gilman  groceryi daresay you know me or your wife does  they say old mr jacob twisden refused a knighthood  if its not a rude question why was that  graviter  ask him sir ask him  gilman  i said to my wife at the time hes holdin out for a baronetcy       graviter closes the door with an exasperated smile  young clerk  opening the door left forward  mr winsor sir and miss orme       they enter and the clerk withdraws  graviter  how dyou do miss orme  how do you do winsor  winsor  twisden not back graviter  graviter  not yet  winsor  well theyve got through de leviss witnesses  sir frederick was at the very top of his form  its looking quite well  but i hear theyve just subpoenaed canynge after all  his evidence is to be taken tomorrow  graviter  oho  winsor  i said dancy ought to have called him  graviter  we considered it  sir frederic decided that he could use him better in crossexamination  winsor  well  i dont know that  can i go and see him before he gives evidence tomorrow  graviter  i should like to hear mr jacob on that winsor  hell be in directly  winsor  they had kentman and goole the inspector the other bobby my footman dancys banker and his tailor  graviter  did we shake kentman or goole  winsor  very little  oh by the way the numbers of those two notes were given and i see theyre published in the evening papers  i suppose the police wanted that  i tell you what i find gravitera general feeling that theres something behind it all that doesnt come out  graviter  the public wants its moneys worthalways does in these society cases they brew so long beforehand you see  winsor  theyre looking for something lurid  margaret  when i was in the bog i thought they were looking for me taking out her cigarette case i suppose i mustnt smoke mr graviter  graviter  do  margaret  wont mr jacob have a fit  graviter  yes but not till youve gone  margaret  just a whiff  she lights a cigarette  winsor  suddenly  its becoming a sort of dreyfus casepeople taking sides quite outside the evidence  margaret  there are more of the chosen in court every day  mr graviter have you noticed the two on the jury  graviter  with a smile no i cant say  margaret  oh but quite distinctly  dont you think they ought to have been challenged  graviter  de levis might have challenged the other ten miss orme  margaret  dear me now  i never thought of that       as she speaks the door left forward is opened and old mr jacob      twisden comes in  he is tallish and narrow sixtyeight years old      grey with narrow little whiskers curling round his narrow ears and      a narrow bowribbon curling round his collar  he wears a long      narrowtailed coat and strapped trousers on his narrow legs  his      nose and face are narrow shrewd and kindly  he has a way of      narrowing his shrewd and kindly eyes  his nose is seen to twitch      and snig  twisden  ah  how are you charles  how do you do my dear  margaret  dear mr jacob im smoking  isnt it disgusting  but they dont allow it in court you know  such a pity  the judge might have a hookah  oh wouldnt he look sweetthe darling  twisden  with a little oldfashioned bow it does not become everybody as it becomes you margaret  margaret  mr jacob how charming  with a slight grimace she puts out her cigarette  graviter  man called gilman waiting in there to see you specially  twisden  directly  turn up the light would you graviter  graviter  turning up the light  excuse me       he goes  winsor  look here mr twisden  twisden  sit down sit down my dear       and he himself sits behind the table as a cup of tea is brought in      to him by the young clerk with two marie biscuits in the saucer  will you have some margaret  margaret  no dear mr jacob  twisden  charles  winsor  no thanks  the door is closed  twisden  dipping a biscuit in the tea now then  winsor  the general knows something which on the face of it looks rather queer  now that hes going to be called oughtnt dancy to be told of it so that he may be ready with his explanation in case it comes out  twisden  pouring some tea into the saucer  without knowing i cant tell you       winsor and margaret exchange looks and twisden drinks from the      saucer  margaret  tell him charles  winsor  well  it rained that evening at meldon  the general happened to put his hand on dancys shoulder and it was damp       twisden puts the saucer down and replaces the cup in it  they both      look intently at him  twisden  i take it that general canynge wont say anything hes not compelled to say  margaret  no of course but mr jacob they might ask they know it rained  and he is such a george washington  twisden  toying with a pair of tortoiseshell glasses  they didnt ask either of you  stillno harm in your telling dancy  winsor  id rather you did it margaret  margaret  i daresay  she mechanically takes out her cigarettecase catches the lift of twisdens eyebrows and puts it back  winsor  well well go together  i dont want mrs dancy to hear  margaret  do tell me mr jacob is he going to win  twisden  i think so margaret i think so  margaret  itll be toofrightful if he doesnt get a verdict after all this  but i dont know what we shall do when its over  ive been sitting in that court all these three days watching and its made me feel theres nothing we like better than seeing people skinned  well byebye bless you       twisden rises and pats her hand  winsor  half a second margaret  wait for me  she nods and goes out mr twisden what do you really think  twisden  i am dancys lawyer my dear charles as well as yours  winsor  well can i go and see canynge  twisden  better not  winsor  if they get that out of him and recall me am i to say he told me of it at the time  twisden  you didnt feel the coat yourself  and dancy wasnt present then what canynge told you is not evidencehell stop your being asked  winsor  thank goodness  goodbye       winsor goes out       twisden behind his table motionless taps his teeth with the      eyeglasses in his narrow wellkept hand  after a long shake of his      head and a shrug of his rather high shoulders he snips goes to the      window and opens it  then crossing to the door left back he      throws it open and says  twisden  at your service sir       gilman comes forth nursing his pot hat  be seated       twisden closes the window behind him and takes his seat  gilman  taking the clients chair to the left of the table mr twisden i believe  my names gilman head of gilmans department stores  you have my card  twisden  looking at the card yes  what can we do for you  gilman  well ive come to you from a sense of duty sir and also a feelin of embarrassment  he takes from his breast pocket an evening paper you see ive been followin this dancy caseits a good deal talked of in putneyand i read this at halfpast two this afternoon  to be precise at 225  he rises and hands the paper to twisden and with a thick gloved forefinger indicates a passage when i read these numbers i appened to remember givin change for a fiftypound notedont often ave one in you knowso

they tell me there that hes at his business shop in the city so off i go in the cab again and there i find him  well sir i showed this paper to him and i produced the note  here i said you brought this to me and you got value for it  well that man was taken aback if im a judge mr twisden he was taken aback not to speak in a guilty way but he was as you might say flummoxed  now i said to him where did you get itthats the point  he took his time to answer and then he said well mr gilman he said you know me i am an honourable man  i cant tell you offhand but i am above the board hes foreign you know in his expressions  yes i said thats all very well i said but here ive got a stolen note and youve got the value for it  now i tell you i said what im going to do im going straight with this

youand ive got him in the cab below i want to tell you everything before he comes up  on the way i tried to get something out of him but i couldnti could not  this is very awkward i said at last  it is mr gilman was his reply and he began to talk about his sicilian clareta very good wine mind you but under the circumstances it seemed to me uncalled for  have i made it clear to you  twisden  who has listened with extreme attention perfectly mr gilman ill send down for him  he touches a handbell       the young clerk appears at the door left forward  a gentleman in a taxiwaiting  ask him to be so good as to step up  oh and send mr graviter here again       the young clerk goes out  gilman  as i told you sir ive been followin this case  its what you might call piquant  and i should be very glad if it came about that this helped captain dancy  i take an interest because to tell you the truth confidentially i dont likewell not to put too fine a point upon it ebrews  they work harder theyre more sober theyre honest and theyre everywhere  ive nothing against them but the fact isthey get on so  twisden  cocking an eye  a thorn in the flesh mr gilman  gilman  well i prefer my own countrymen and thats the truth of it       as he speaks graviter comes in by the door left forward  twisden  pointing to the newspaper and the note  mr gilman has brought this of which he is holder for value  his customer who changed it three days ago is coming up  graviter  the fiftypounder  i see  his face is long and reflective  young clerk  entering  mr ricardos sir       he goes out  ricardos is a personable italianlooking man in a      frock coat with a dark moustachioed face and dark hair a little      grizzled  he looks anxious and bows  twisden  mr ricardos  my name is jacob twisden  my partner  holding up a finger as ricardos would speak  mr gilman has told us about this note  you took it to him he says three days ago that is on monday and received cash for it  ricardos  yes sare  twisden  you were not aware that it was stolen  ricardos  with his hand to his breast  oh no sare  twisden  you received it from  ricardos  a minute sare  i would weesh to explainwith an expressive shrug in private  twisden  nodding mr gilman your conduct has been most prompt  you may safely leave the matter in our hands now  kindly let us retain this note and ask for my cashier as you go out and give him he writes this  he will reimburse you  we will take any necessary steps ourselves  gilman  in slight surprise with modest pride  well sir im in your ands  i must be guided by

im very appy to have made your acquaintance sir  its a wellknown name  twisden  thank you       gilman retreats glances at ricardos and turns again  gilman  i suppose theres nothing else i ought to do in the interests of the law  im a careful man  twisden  if there is mr gilman we will let you know  we have your address  you may make your mind easy but dont speak of this  it might interfere with justice  gilman  oh i shouldnt dream of it  ive no wish to be mixed up in anything conspicuous  thats not my principle at all  goodday gentlemen       he goes  twisden  seating himself now sir will you sit down       but ricardos does not sit he stands looking uneasily across the      table at graviter  you may speak out  ricardos  well mr tweesden and sare this matter is very serious for me and very delicateit concairns my honour  i am in a great difficulty  twisden  when in difficultycomplete frankness sir  ricardos  it is a family matter sare i  twisden  let me be frank with you  telling his points off on his fingers  we have your admission that you changed this stopped note for value  it will be our duty to inform the bank of england that it has been traced to you  you will have to account to them for your possession of it  i suggest to you that it will be far better to account frankly to us  ricardos  taking out a handkerchief and quite openly wiping his hands and forehead  i received this note sare with others from a gentleman sare in settlement of a debt of honour and i know nothing of where he got them  twisden  hm that is very vague  if that is all you can tell us im afraid  ricardos  gentlemen this is very painful for me  it is my daughters good namehe again wipes his brow  twisden  come sir speak out  ricardos  desperately  the notes were a settlement to her from this gentleman of whom she was a great friend  twisden  suddenly  i am afraid we must press you for the name of the gentleman  ricardos  sare if i give it to you and it does im arm what will my daughter say  this is a bad matter for me  he behaved well to her and she is attached to him still sometimes she is crying yet because she lost him  and now we betray him perhaps who knows  this is very unpleasant for me  taking up the paper  here it gives the number of another notea undredpound note  i ave that too  he takes a note from his breast pocket  graviter  how much did he give you in all  ricardos  for my daughters settlement one thousand pounds  i understand he did not wish to give a cheque because of his marriage so i did not think anything about it being in notes you see  twisden  when did he give you this money  ricardos  the middle of octobare last  twisden  suddenly looking up mr ricardos was it captain dancy  ricardos  again wiping his forehead gentlemen i am so fond of my daughter  i have only the one and no wife  twisden  with an effort yes yes but i must know  ricardos  sare if i tell you will you give me your good word that my daughter shall not hear of it  twisden  so far as we are able to prevent itcertainly  ricardos  sare i trust youit was captain dancy       a long pause  graviter suddenly were you blackmailing him  twisden  holding up his hand  my partner means did you press him for this settlement  ricardos  i did think it my duty to my daughter to ask that he make compensation to her  twisden  with threats that you would tell his wife  ricardos  with a shrug  captain dancy was a man of honour  he said of course i will do this  i trusted him  and a month later i did remind him and he gave me this money for her  i do not know where he got iti do not know  gentlemen i have invested it all on herevery pennyexcept this note for which i had the purpose to buy her a necklace  that is the sweared truth  twisden  i must keep this note  he touches the hundredpound note you will not speak of this to anyone  i may recognise that you were a holder for value receivedothers might take a different view  goodday sir  graviter see mr ricardos out and take his address  ricardos  pressing his hands over the breast of his frock coatwith a sigh  gentlemen i beg youremember what i said  with a roll of his eyes my daughteri am not happee  goodday       he turns and goes out slowly left forward followed by graviter  twisden  to himself  young dancy  he pins the two notes together and places them in an envelope then stands motionless except for his eyes and hands which restlessly express the disturbance within him       graviter returns carefully shuts the door and going up to him      hands him ricardos card  looking at the card villa benvenuto  this will have to be verified but im afraid its true  that man was not acting  graviter  whats to be done about dancy  twisden  can you understand a gentleman  graviter  i dont know

 what time is that train  he bends over the abc                                curtain     scene ii       the same room on the following morning at tentwentyfive by the      grandfather clock       the young clerk is ushering in dancy whose face is perceptibly      harder than it was three months ago like that of a man who has      lived under great restraint  dancy  he wanted to see me before the court sat  young clerk  yes sir  mr twisden will see you in one minute  he had to go out of town last night  he prepares to open the waitingroom door  dancy  were you in the war  young clerk  yes  dancy  how can you stick this  young clerk  with a smile  my trouble was to stick that sir  dancy  but you get no excitement from years end to years end  itd drive me mad  young clerk  shyly  a case like this is pretty exciting  id give a lot to see us win it  dancy  staring at him  why  what is it to you  young clerk  i dont know sir  itsits like footballyou want your side to win  he opens the waitingroom door  expanding  you see some rum starts too in a lawyers office in a quiet way       dancy enters the waitingroom and the young clerk shutting the      door meets twisden as he comes in left forward and takes from him      overcoat top hat and a small bag  young clerk  captain dancys waiting sir  he indicates the waitingroom  twisden  narrowing his lips very well  mr graviter gone to the courts  young clerk  yes sir  twisden  did he leave anything for me  young clerk  on the table sir  twisden  taking up an envelope  thank you       the clerk goes   twisden  opening the envelope and reading all corroborates  hm he puts it in his pocket and takes out of an envelope the two notes lays them on the table and covers them with a sheet of blottingpaper stands a moment preparing himself then goes to the door of the waitingroom opens it and says  now captain dancy  sorry to have kept you waiting  dancy  entering winsor came to me yesterday about general canynges evidence  is that what you wanted to speak to me about  twisden  no  it isnt that  dancy  looking at his wrist watch  by me its just on the halfhour sir  twisden  yes  i dont want you to go to the court  dancy  not  twisden  i have very serious news for you  dancy  wincing and collecting himself  oh  twisden  these two notes  he uncovers the notes  after the court rose yesterday we had a man called ricardos here  a pause is there any need for me to say more  dancy  unflinching no  what now  twisden  our duty was plain we could not go on with the case  i have consulted sir frederic  he felthe felt that he must throw up his brief and he will do that the moment the court sits  now i want to talk to you about what youre going to do  dancy  thats very good of you considering  twisden  i dont pretend to understand but i imagine you may have done this in a moment of reckless bravado feeling perhaps that as you gave the mare to de levis the money was by rights as much yours as his       stopping dancy who is about to speak with a gesture  to satisfy a debt of honour to thislady and no doubt to save your wife from hearing of it from the man ricardos  is that so  dancy  to the life  twisden  it was mad captain dancy mad  but the question now is  what do you owe to your wife  she doesnt dreami suppose  dancy  with a twitching face  no  twisden  we cant tell what the result of this collapse will be  the police have the theft in hand  they may issue a warrant  the money could be refunded and the costs paidsomehow that can all be managed but it may not help  in any case what end is served by your staying in the country  you cant save your honourthats gone  you cant save your wifes peace of mind  if she sticks to youdo you think she will  dancy  not if shes wise  twisden  better go  theres a war in morocco  dancy  with a bitter smile  good old morocco  twisden  will you go then at once and leave me to break it to your wife  dancy  i dont know yet  twisden  you must decide quickly to catch a boat train  many a man has made good  youre a fine soldier  dancy  there are alternatives  twisden  now go straight from this office  youve a passport i suppose you wont need a visa for france and from there you can find means to slip over  have you got money on you  dancy nods  we will see what we can do to stop or delay proceedings  dancy  its all damned kind of you  with difficulty  but i must think of my wife  give me a few minutes  twisden  yes yes go in there and think it out       he goes to the door right and opens it  dancy passes him and goes      out  twisden rings a bell and stands waiting  clerk  entering  yes sir  twisden  tell them to call a taxi  clerk  who has a startled look yes sir  mr graviter has come in air with general canynge  are you disengaged  twisden  yes       the clerk goes out and almost immediately graviter and canynge      enter  goodmorning general  to graviter  well  graviter  sir frederic got up at once and said that since the publication of the numbers of those notes information had reached him which forced him to withdraw from the case  great sensation of course i left bromley in charge  therell be a formal verdict for the defendant with costs  have you told dancy  twisden  yes  hes in there deciding what hell do  canynge  grave and vexed  this is a dreadful thing twisden  ive been afraid of it all along  a soldier  a gallant fellow

message for you twisden  if moneys wanted quickly to save proceedings draw on him is there anything i can do  twisden  ive advised him to go straight off to morocco  canynge  i dont know that an asylum isnt the place for him  he must be off his head at moments  that jumpcrazy  hed have got a verdict on that aloneif theyd seen those balconies  i was looking at them when i was down there last sunday  daring thing twisden  very few men on a dark nighthe risked his life twice  thats a shrewd fellowyoung de levis  he spotted dancys nature       the young clerk enters  clerk  the taxis here

couldnt feel it more  butdamn it  what right had that fellow to chuck up the casewithout letting him know too  i came down with dancy this morning and he knew nothing about it  twisden  coldly  that was unfortunately unavoidable  colford  guilty or not you ought to have stuck to himits not playing the game mr twisden  twisden  you must allow me to judge where my duty lay in a very hard case  colford  i thought a man was safe with his solicitor  canynge  colford you dont understand professional etiquette  colford  no thank god  twisden  when you have been as long in your profession as i

cant stand commiseration and let me have some air       twisden motions to colford and margaret to go and as he turns to      dancy they go out  graviter also moves towards the door  the      general sits motionless  graviter goes out  twisden  well  dancy  im going home to clear up things with my wife  general canynge i dont quite know why i did the damned thing  but i did and theres an end of it  canynge  dancy for the honour of the army avoid further scandal if you can  ive written a letter to a friend of mine in the spanish war office  it will get you a job in their war  canynge closes the envelope  dancy  very good of you  i dont know if i can make use of it       canynge stretches out the letter which twisden hands to dancy who      takes it  graviter reopens the door  twisden  what is it  graviter  de levis is here  twisden  de levis  cant see him  dancy  let him in       after a moments hesitation twisden nods and graviter goes out      the three wait in silence with their eyes fixed on the door the      general sitting at the table twisden by his chair dancy between      him and the door right  de levis comes in and shuts the door  he      is advancing towards twisden when his eyes fall on dancy and he      stops  twisden  you wanted to see me  de levis  moistening his lips  yes  i came to say thatthat i overheardi am afraid a warrant is to be issued  i wanted you to realiseits not my doing  ill give it no support  im content  i dont want my money  i dont even want costs  dancy do you understand       dancy does not answer but looks at him with nothing alive in his      face but his eyes  twisden  we are obliged to you sir  it was good of you to come  de levis  with a sort of darting pride dont mistake me  i didnt come because i feel christian i am a jew  i will take no moneynot even that which was stolen  give it to a charity  im proved right and now im done with the damned thing  goodmorning       he makes a little bow to canynge and twisden and turns to face      dancy who has never moved  the two stand motionless looking at      each other then de levis shrugs his shoulders and walks out  when      he is gone there is a silence  canynge  suddenly  you heard what he said dancy  you have no time to lose       but dancy does not stir  twisden  captain dancy       slowly without turning his head rather like a man in a dream      dancy walks across the room and goes out                              curtain     scene iii       the dancys sittingroom a few minutes later  mabel dancy is      sitting alone on the sofa with a newspaper on her lap  she is only      just up and has a bottle of smellingsalts in her hand  two or      three other newspapers are dumped on the arm of the sofa  she      topples the one off her lap and takes up another as if she couldnt      keep away from them drops it in turn and sits staring before her      sniffing at the salts  the door right is opened and dancy comes      in  mabel  utterly  surprised  ronny

walks over to the hearth       mabel too gets up  she presses her hands to her forehead then      walks blindly round to behind the sofa and stands looking straight      in front of her  mabel  coldly  what has happened exactly  dancy  sir frederic chucked up the case  ive seen twisden they want me to run for it to morocco  mabel  to the war there  dancy  yes  theres to be a warrant out  mabel  a

her hand and puts it to his lips  the bell rings  mabel  in terror  whos that       the bell rings again  dancy moves towards the door  no  let me       she passes him and steals out to the outer door of the flat where      she stands listening  the bell rings again  she looks through the      slit of the letterbox  while she is gone dancy stands quite still      till she comes back  mabel  through

  he opens the bedroom door left and stands waiting for her to go      summoning up her courage she goes to open the outer door  a sudden      change comes over dancys face from being stony it grows almost      maniacal  dancy  under his breath  no  no  by god  no  he goes out into the bedroom closing the door behind him       mabel has now opened the outer door and disclosed inspector dede      and the young constable who were summoned to meldon court on the      night of the theft and have been witnesses in the case  their      voices are heard  mabel  yes  inspector  captain dancy in madam

 inspector  what lady and  stand by grover  dancys voice  all right  you can come in now       there is the noise of a lock being turned  and almost immediately      the sound of a pistol shot in the bedroom  mabel rushes to the      door tears it open and disappears within followed by the      inspector just as margaret orme and colford come in from the      passage pursued by the constable  they too all hurry to the      bedroom door and disappear for a moment then colford and margaret      reappear supporting mabel who faints as they lay her on the sofa      colford takes from her hand an envelope and tears it open  colford  its addressed to me  he reads it aloud to margaret in a low voice  dear colfordthis is the only decent thing i can do  its too damned unfair to her  its only another jump  a pistol keeps faith  look after her colfordmy love to her and you  margaret gives a sort of choking sob then seeing the smelling bottle she snatches it up and turns to revive mabel

by the inspector      margaret remains kneeling beside mabel       colford comes quickly back  margaret looks up at him  he stands      very still  colford  neatlythrough the heart  margaret wildly  keeps faith  weve all done that  its not enough  colford  looking down at mabel  all right old boy                            the curtain falls       windows  from the 5th series of plays  by john galsworthy    persons of the play  geoffrey march freelance in literature joan march his wife mary march their daughter johnny march their son cook their cook mr bly their window cleaner faith bly his daughter blunter a strange young man mr barnadas in plain clothes    the action passes in geofrey marchs house highgatespringtime  act   i  thursday morning  the diningroomafter breakfast  act  ii  thursday a fortnight later  the diningroom after lunch  act iii  the same day  the diningroomafter dinner     act i       the marchs diningroom opens through french windows on one of those      gardens which seem infinite till they are seen to be coterminous      with the side walls of the house and finite at the far end because      only the thick screen of acacias and sumachs prevents another house      from being seen  the french and other windows form practically all      the outer wall of that diningroom and between them and the screen      of trees lies the difference between the characters of mr and mrs      march with dots and dashes of mary and johnny thrown in  for      instance it has been formalised by mrs march but the grass has not      been cut by mr march and daffodils have sprung up there which mrs      march desires for the diningroom but of which mr march says for      gods sake joan let them grow  about half therefore are now in a      bowl on the breakfast table and the other half still in the grass      in the compromise essential to lasting domesticity  a hammock under      the acacias shows that mary lies there sometimes with her eyes on      the gleam of sunlight that comes through and a trail in the longish      grass bordered with cigarette ends proves that johnny tramps there      with his eyes on the ground or the stars according  but all this      is by the way because except for a yard or two of gravel terrace      outside the windows it is all painted on the backcloth  the      marches have been at breakfast and the round table covered with      blue linen is thick with remains seven baskets full  the room is      gifted with old oak furniture there is a door stage left forward      a hearth where a fire is burning and a high fender on which one      can sit stage right middle  and in the wall below the fireplace      a service hatch covered with a sliding shutter for the passage of      dishes into the adjoining pantry  against the wall stage left is      an old oak dresser and a small writing table across the left back      corner  mrs march still sits behind the coffee pot making up her      daily list on tablets with a little gold pencil fastened to her      wrist  she is personable fortyeight trim welldressed and more      matteroffact than seems plausible  mr march is sitting in an      armchair sideways to the windows smoking his pipe and reading his      newspaper with little explosions to which no one pays any      attention because it is his daily habit  he is a finelooking man      of fifty odd with redgrey moustaches and hair both of which      stiver partly by nature and partly because his hands often push them      up  mary and johnny are close to the fireplace stage right      johnny sits on the fender smoking a cigarette and warming his back      he is a commonplace looking young man with a decided jaw tall      neat soulful who has been in the war and writes poetry  mary is      less ordinary you cannot tell exactly what is the matter with her      she too is tall a little absent fair and welllooking  she has a      small china dog in her hand taken from the mantelpiece and faces      the audience  as the curtain rises she is saying in her soft and      pleasant voice  well what is the matter with us all johnny  johnny  stuck as we were in the trencheslike china dogs  he points to the ornament in her hand  mr march  into his newspaper  damn these people  mary  if there isnt an ideal left johnny its no good pretending one  johnny  thats what im saying bankrupt  mary  what do you want  mrs march  to herself  mutton cutlets  johnny will you be in to lunch  johnny shakes his head mary  mary nods  geof  mr march  into his paper swine  mrs march  thatll be three  to herself  spinach  johnny  if youd just missed being killed for three blooming years for no spiritual result whatever youd want something to bite on mary  mrs march  jotting soap  johnny  what price the little and weak now  freedom and selfdetermination and all that  mary  forty to oneno takers  johnny  it doesnt seem to worry you  mary  well whats the good  johnny  oh youre a looker on mary  mr march  to his newspaper  of all godforsaken timeservers       mary is moved so lar as to turn and look over his shoulder a minute  johnny  who  mary  only the oldun  mr march  this is absolutely prussian  mrs march  soup lobster chicken salad  go to mrs hunts  mr march  and this fellow hasnt the nous to see that if ever there were a moment when it would pay us to take risks and be generousmy hat he ought to beknighted  resumes his paper  johnny  muttering  you see even dad cant suggest chivalry without talking of payment for it  that shows how weve sunk  mary  contemptuously  chivalry  pouf  chivalry was off even before the war johnny  who wants chivalry  johnny  of all shallowpated humbugthat sneering at chivalrys the worst  civilisationsuch as weve gotis built on it  mary  airily  then its built on sand  she sits beside him on the fender  johnny  sneering and smartness  pah  mary  roused  ill tell you what johnny its mucking about with chivalry that makes your poetry rotten  johnny seizes her arm and twists it  shut upthat hurts  johnny twists it more you brute johnny lets her arm go  johnny  ha  so you dont mind taking advantage of the fact that you can cheek me with impunity because youre weaker  youve given the whole show away mary  abolish chivalry and ill make you sit up  mrs march  what are you two quarrelling about  will you bring home cigarettes johnnynot bogdogunovs mamelukessomething more angloamerican  johnny  all right  dyou want any more illustrations mary  mary  pig  she has risen and stands rubbing her arm and recovering her placidity which is considerable  mrs march  geof can you eat preserved peaches  mr march  hell  what a policy  um  mrs march  can you eat preserved peaches  mr march  yes  to his paper  making the country stink in the eyes of the world  mary  nostrils dad nostrils       mr march wriggles half hearing  johnny  muttering shallow idiots  thinking we can do without chivalry  mrs march  im doing my best to get a parlourmaid today mary but these breakfast things wont clear themselves  mary  ill clear them mother  mrs march  good  she gets up  at the door  knitting silk       she goes out  johnny  mother hasnt an ounce of idealism  you might make her see stars but never in the singular  mr march  to his paper if god doesnt open the earth soon  mary  is there anything special dad  mr march  this sulphurous government  he drops the paper  give me a match mary       as soon as the paper is out of his hands he becomes a differentan      affable man  mary  giving him a match  dyou mind writing in here this morning dad  your study hasnt been done  theres nobody but cook  mr march  lighting his pipe  anywhere       he slews the armchair towards the fire  mary  ill get your things then       she goes out  johnny  still on the fender  what do you say dad  is civilisation built on chivalry or on selfinterest  mr march  the question is considerable johnny  i should say it was built on contract and jerrybuilt at that  johnny  yes but why do we keep contracts when we can break them with advantage and impunity  mr march  but do we keep them  johnny  wellsay we do otherwise youll admit there isnt such a thing as civilisation at all  but why do we keep them  for instance why dont we make mary and mother work for us like kafir women  we could lick them into it  why did we give women the vote  why free slaves why anything decent for the little and weak  mr march  well you might say it was convenient for people living in communities  johnny  i dont think its convenient at all  i should like to make mary sweat  why not jungle law if theres nothing in chivalry  mr march  chivalry is altruism johnny  of course its quite a question whether altruism isnt enlightened selfinterest  johnny  oh  damn       the lank and shirtsleeved figure of mr bly with a pail of water      and cloths has entered and stands near the window left  bly  beg pardon mr march dyou mind me cleanin the winders here  mr march  not a bit  johnny  bankrupt of ideals  thats it       mr bly stares at him and puts his pail down by the window       mary has entered with her fathers writing materials which she puts      on a stool beside him  mary  here you are dad  ive filled up the ink pot  do be careful come on johnny       she looks curiously at mr bly who has begun operations at the      bottom of the lefthand window and goes followed by johnny  mr march  relighting his pipe and preparing his materials  what do you think of things mr bly  bly  not much sir  mr march  ah  he looks up at mr bly

embodiment of the pathetic      watchful prison faculty of adapting itself to whatever may be best      for its owner at the moment  at this moment it is obviously best      for her to look at the ground and yet to take in the faces of mr      march and mary without their taking her face in  a moment for all      of considerable embarrassment  mr march  suddenly  well here we are       the

i ever met  mr march  perhaps in giving rein he didnt strike you  bly  with a big wipe following his thought  he said to me once joe he said if i was to hold meself in i should be a devil theres where

march shakes with the feeling      that he is always shaking mr blys hand  mr march  but apropos of your daughter mr bly  i suppose none of us ever change our natures  bly  again responding to the appeal that he senses to his philosophical vein ah  but oo can see what our natures are  why ive known people that could see nothin but theirselves and their own families unless they was drunk  at my daughters trial i see right into the lawyers judge and all  there she was hub of the whole thing and all they could see of her was ow far she affected em personallyone tryin to get er guilty the other

still looking at herself when she      sees in the mirror a reflection of johnny who has come in  her      face grows just a little scared as if she had caught the eye of a      warder peering through the peephole of her cell door then brazens      and slowly sweetens as she turns round to him  johnny  sorry  he has a pipe in his hand and wears a norfolk jacket fond of flowers  faith  yes  she puts

darkening of a shower its raining  father says windows never stay clean       they stand dose together unaware that cook has thrown up the      service shutter to see  why the clearing takes so long  her      astounded head and shoulders pass into view just as faith suddenly      puts up her face  johnnys lips hesitate then move towards her      forehead  but her face shifts and they find themselves upon her      lips  once there the emphasis cannot help but be considerable      cooks mouth falls open  cook  oh       she closes the shutter vanishing  faith  what was that  johnny

of the table  she is interrupted by the      entrance through the french windows of mr march and mary struggling      with one small wet umbrella  mary  feeling his sleeve go and change dad  mr march  womens shoes  we could have made the tube but for your shoes  mary  it was your cold feet not mine dear  looking at faith and nudging him  now       she goes towards the door turns to look at faith

she has paused and is again smelling at the      flower when she hears the door and quickly resumes her work  it is      mrs march who comes in and goes to the writing table left back      without

thats the first step towards seeing reason       he pours brandy into a liqueur glass from the decanter which stands      between them  mrs march puts the brandy to her lips and makes a      little face then swallows it down manfully  mary gets up with the      walnuts and goes  silence  gloom  mrs march  horrid stuff  mr march  havent you begun to see that your policys hopeless joan come  tell

affection and respect for you       mrs march nervously refills the little brandy glass and again      empties it with a grimacing shudder  mr march  noticing  thats better  youll begin to see things presently       mary reenters  mary  hes been digging himself in  hes put a screen across the head of the stairs and got cooks blankets  hes going to sleep there  mrs march  did he take the walnuts

mrs march  there is no halfway  mary  well for goodness sake think of a plan which will make you both look victorious  thats always done in the end  why not let her stay and make johnny promise only to see her in the presence of a third party  mrs march  because shed see him every day while he was looking for the third party  shed help him look for it  mary  with a gurgle  mother id no idea you

remains seated  mary is on her      right       mr march leads into the room and stands next his daughter then      faith in hat and coat to the left of the table and johnny pale but      determined last  assembled thus in a half fan of which mrs march      is the apex so to speak they are all extremely embarrassed and no      wonder       suddenly mary gives a little gurgle  johnny  youd think
