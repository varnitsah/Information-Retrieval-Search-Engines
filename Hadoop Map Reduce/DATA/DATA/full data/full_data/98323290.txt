that ugly devil of crime with which it is your glory to have contended  it were a waste of ink to do so in a serious spirit  let us dedicate our horror to acts of a more mingled strain where crime preserves some features of nobility and where reason and humanity can still relish the temptation  horror in this case is due to mr parnell he sits before posterity silent mr forster’s appeal echoing down the ages  horror is due to ourselves in that we have so long coquetted with political crime not seriously weighing not acutely following it from cause to consequence but with a generous unfounded heat of sentiment like the schoolboy with the penny tale applauding what was specious  when it touched ourselves truly in a vile shape we proved false to the imaginations discovered in a clap that crime was no less cruel and no less ugly under sounding names and recoiled from our false deities  but seriousness comes most in place when we are to speak of our defenders  whoever be in the right in this great and confused war of politics whatever elements of greed whatever traits of the bully dishonour both parties in this inhuman contest—your side your part is at least pure of doubt  yours is the side of the child of the breeding woman of individual pity and public trust  if our society were the mere kingdom of the devil as indeed it wears some of his colours it yet embraces many precious elements and many innocent persons whom it is a glory to defend  courage and devotion so common in the ranks of the police so little recognised so meagrely rewarded have at length found their commemoration in an historical act  history which will represent mr parnell sitting silent under the appeal of mr forster and gordon setting forth upon his tragic enterprise will not forget mr cole carrying the dynamite in his defenceless hands nor mr cox coming coolly to his aid                                                    robert louis stevenson

new arabian nights  the loss is yours—and mine or to be more exact my publishers’  but if you are thus unlucky the least i can do is to pass you a hint  when you shall find a reference in the following pages to one theophilus godall of the bohemian cigar divan in rupert street soho you must be prepared to recognise under his features no less a person than prince florizel of bohemia formerly one of the magnates of europe now dethroned exiled impoverished and embarked in the tobacco trade                                                                    r l s     prologue of the cigar divan   in the city of encounters the bagdad of the west and to be more precise on the broad northern pavement of leicester square two young men of five or sixandtwenty met after years of separation  the first who was of a very smooth address and clothed in the best fashion hesitated to recognise the pinched and shabby air of his companion  ‘what’ he cried ‘paul somerset’  ‘i am indeed paul somerset’ returned the other ‘or what remains of him after a welldeserved experience of poverty and law  but in you challoner i can perceive no change and time may be said without hyperbole to write no wrinkle on your azure brow’  ‘all’ replied challoner ‘is not gold that glitters  but we are here in an ill posture for confidences and interrupt the movement of these ladies  let us if you please find a more private corner’  ‘if you will allow me to guide you’ replied somerset ‘i will offer you the best cigar in london’  and taking the arm of his companion he led him in silence and at a brisk pace to the door of a quiet establishment in rupert street soho  the entrance was adorned with one of those gigantic highlanders of wood which have almost risen to the standing of antiquities and across the windowglass which sheltered the usual display of pipes tobacco and cigars there ran the gilded legend ‘bohemian cigar divan by t godall’  the interior of the shop was small but commodious and ornate the salesman grave smiling and urbane and the two young men each puffing a select regalia had soon taken their places on a sofa of mousecoloured plush and proceeded to exchange their stories  ‘i am now’ said somerset ‘a barrister but providence and the attorneys have hitherto denied me the opportunity to shine  a select society at the cheshire cheese engaged my evenings my afternoons as mr godall could testify have been generally passed in this divan and my mornings i have taken the precaution to abbreviate by not rising before twelve at this rate my little patrimony was very rapidly and i am proud to remember most agreeably expended  since then a gentleman who has really nothing else to recommend him beyond the fact of being my maternal uncle deals me the small sum of ten shillings a week and if you behold me once more revisiting the glimpses of the street lamps in my favourite quarter you will readily divine that i have come into a fortune’  ‘i should not have supposed so’ replied challoner  ‘but doubtless i met you on the way to your tailors’  ‘it is a visit that i purpose to delay’ returned somerset with a smile ‘my fortune has definite limits  it consists or rather this morning it consisted of one hundred pounds’  ‘that is certainly odd’ said challoner ‘yes certainly the coincidence is strange  i am myself reduced to the same margin’  ‘you’ cried somerset  ‘and yet solomon in all his glory—’  ‘such is the fact  i am dear boy on my last legs’ said challoner ‘besides the clothes in which you see me i have scarcely a decent trouser in my wardrobe and if i knew how i would this instant set about some sort of work or commerce  with a hundred pounds for capital a man should push his way’  ‘it may be’ returned somerset ‘but what to do with mine is more than i can fancy  mr godall’ he added addressing the salesman ‘you are a man who knows the world what can a young fellow of reasonable education do with a hundred pounds’  ‘it depends’ replied the salesman withdrawing his cheroot  ‘the power of money is an article of faith in which i profess myself a sceptic  a hundred pounds will with difficulty support you for a year with somewhat more difficulty you may spend it in a night and without any difficulty at all you may lose it in five minutes on the stock exchange  if you are of that stamp of man that rises a penny would be as useful if you belong to those that fall a penny would be no more useless  when i was myself thrown unexpectedly upon the world it was my fortune to possess an art i knew a good cigar  do you know nothing mr somerset’  ‘not even law’ was the reply  ‘the answer is worthy of a sage’ returned mr godall  ‘and you sir’ he continued turning to challoner ‘as the friend of mr somerset may i be allowed to address you the same question’  ‘well’ replied challoner ‘i play a fair hand at whist’  ‘how many persons are there in london’ returned the salesman ‘who have twoandthirty teeth  believe me young gentleman there are more still who play a fair hand at whist  whist sir is wide as the world ’tis an accomplishment like breathing  i once knew a youth who announced that he was studying to be chancellor of england the design was certainly ambitious but i find it less excessive than that of the man who aspires to make a livelihood by whist’  ‘dear me’ said challoner ‘i am afraid i shall have to fall to be a working man’  ‘fall to be a working man’ echoed mr godall  ‘suppose a rural dean to be unfrocked does he fall to be a major suppose a captain were cashiered would he fall to be a puisne judge  the ignorance of your middle class surprises me  outside itself it thinks the world to lie quite ignorant and equal sunk in a common degradation but to the eye of the observer all ranks are seen to stand in ordered hierarchies and each adorned with its particular aptitudes and knowledge  by the defects of your education you are more disqualified to be a working man than to be the ruler of an empire  the gulf sir is below and the true learned arts—those which alone are safe from the competition of insurgent laymen—are those which give his title to the artisan’  ‘this is a very pompous fellow’ said challoner in the ear of his companion  ‘he is immense’ said somerset  just then the door of the divan was opened and a third young fellow made his appearance and rather bashfully requested some tobacco  he was younger than the others and in a somewhat meaningless and altogether english way he was a handsome lad  when he had been served and had lighted his pipe and taken his place upon the sofa he recalled himself to challoner by the name of desborough  ‘desborough to be sure’ cried challoner  ‘well desborough and what do you do’  ‘the fact is’ said desborough ‘that i am doing nothing’  ‘a private fortune possibly’ inquired the other  ‘well no’ replied desborough rather sulkily  ‘the fact is that i am waiting for something to turn up’  ‘all in the same boat’ cried somerset  ‘and have you too one hundred pounds’  ‘worse luck’ said mr desborough  ‘this is a very pathetic sight mr godall’ said somerset ‘three futiles’  ‘a character of this crowded age’ returned the salesman  ‘sir’ said somerset ‘i deny that the age is crowded i will admit one fact and one fact only that i am futile that he is futile and that we are all three as futile as the devil  what am i  i have smattered law smattered letters smattered geography smattered mathematics i have even a working knowledge of judicial astrology and here i stand all london roaring by at the street’s end as impotent as any baby  i have a prodigious contempt for my maternal uncle but without him it is idle to deny it i should simply resolve into my elements like an unstable mixture  i begin to perceive that it is necessary to know some one thing to the bottom—were it only literature  and yet sir the man of the world is a great feature of this age he is possessed of an extraordinary mass and variety of knowledge he is everywhere at home he has seen life in all its phases and it is impossible but that this great habit of existence should bear fruit  i count myself a man of the world accomplished capàpie  so do you challoner  and you mr desborough’  ‘oh yes’ returned the young man  ‘well then mr godall here we stand three men of the world without a trade to cover us but planted at the strategic centre of the universe for so you will allow me to call rupert street in the midst of the chief mass of people and within earshot of the most continuous chink of money on the surface of the globe  sir as civilised men what do we do i will show you  you take in a paper’  ‘i take’ said mr godall solemnly ‘the best paper in the world the standard’  ‘good’ resumed somerset  ‘i now hold it in my hand the voice of the world a telephone repeating all men’s wants  i open it and where my eye first falls—well no not morrison’s pills—but here sure enough and but a little above i find the joint that i was seeking here is the weak spot in the armour of society  here is a want a plaint an offer of substantial gratitude “two hundred pounds reward—the above reward will be paid to any person giving information as to the identity and whereabouts of a man observed yesterday in the neighbourhood of the green park  he was over six feet in height with shoulders disproportionately broad close shaved with black moustaches and wearing a sealskin greatcoat”  there gentlemen our fortune if not made is founded’  ‘do you then propose dear boy that we should turn detectives’ inquired challoner  ‘do i propose it  no sir’ cried somerset  ‘it is reason destiny the plain face of the world that commands and imposes it  here all our merits tell our manners habit of the world powers of conversation vast stores of unconnected knowledge all that we are and have builds up the character of the complete detective  it is in short the only profession for a gentleman’  ‘the proposition is perhaps excessive’ replied challoner ‘for hitherto i own i have regarded it as of all dirty sneaking and ungentlemanly trades the least and lowest’  ‘to defend society’ asked somerset ‘to stake one’s life for others to deracinate occult and powerful evil  i appeal to mr godall  he at least as a philosophic lookeron at life will spit upon such philistine opinions  he knows that the policeman as he is called upon continually to face greater odds and that both worse equipped and for a better cause is in form and essence a more noble hero than the soldier  do you by any chance deceive yourself into supposing that a general would either ask or expect from the best army ever marshalled and on the most momentous battlefield the conduct of a common constable at peckham rye’ 9  ‘i did not understand we were to join the force’ said challoner  ‘nor shall we  these are the hands but here—here sir is the head’ cried somerset  ‘enough it is decreed  we shall hunt down this miscreant in the sealskin coat’  ‘suppose that we agreed’ retorted challoner ‘you have no plan no knowledge you know not where to seek for a beginning’  ‘challoner’ cried somerset ‘is it possible that you hold the doctrine of free will  and are you devoid of any tincture of philosophy that you should harp on such exploded fallacies  chance the blind madonna of the pagan rules this terrestrial bustle and in chance i place my sole reliance  chance has brought us three together when we next separate and go forth our several ways chance will continually drag before our careless eyes a thousand eloquent clues not to this mystery only but to the countless mysteries by which we live surrounded  then comes the part of the man of the world of the detective born and bred  this clue which the whole town beholds without comprehension swift as a cat he leaps upon it makes it his follows it with craft and passion and from one trifling circumstance divines a world’  ‘just so’ said challoner ‘and i am delighted that you should recognise these virtues in yourself  but in the meanwhile dear boy i own myself incapable of joining  i was neither born nor bred as a detective but as a placable and very thirsty gentleman and for my part i begin to weary for a drink  as for clues and adventures the only adventure that is ever likely to occur to me will be an adventure with a bailiff’  ‘now there is the fallacy’ cried somerset  ‘there i catch the secret of your futility in life  the world teems and bubbles with adventure it besieges you along the street hands waving out of windows swindlers coming up and swearing they knew you when you were abroad affable and doubtful people of all sorts and conditions begging and truckling for your notice  but not you you turn away you walk your seedy mill round you must go the dullest way  now here i beg of you the next adventure that offers itself embrace it in with both your arms whatever it looks grimy or romantic grasp it  i will do the like the devil is in it but at least we shall have fun and each in turn we shall narrate the story of our fortunes to my philosophic friend of the divan the great godall now hearing me with inward joy  come is it a bargain  will you indeed both promise to welcome every chance that offers to plunge boldly into every opening and keeping the eye wary and the head composed to study and piece together all that happens  come promise let me open to you the doors of the great profession of intrigue’  ‘it is not much in my way’ said challoner ‘but since you make a point of it amen’  ‘i don’t mind promising’ said desborough ‘but nothing will happen to me’  ‘o faithless ones’ cried somerset  ‘but at least i have your promises and godall i perceive is transported with delight’  ‘i promise myself at least much pleasure from your various narratives’ said the salesman with the customary calm polish of his manner  ‘and now gentlemen’ concluded somerset ‘let us separate  i hasten to put myself in fortune’s way  hark how in this quiet corner london roars like the noise of battle four million destinies are here concentred and in the strong panoply of one hundred pounds payable to the bearer i am about to plunge into that web’     challoner’s adventure   the squire of dames   mr edward challoner had set up lodgings in the suburb of putney where he enjoyed a parlour and bedroom and the sincere esteem of the people of the house  to this remote home he found himself at a very early hour in the morning of the next day condemned to set forth on foot  he was a young man of a portly habit no lover of the exercises of the body bland sedentary patient of delay a prop of omnibuses  in happier days he would have chartered a cab but these luxuries were now denied him and with what courage he could muster he addressed himself to walk  it was then the height of the season and the summer the weather was serene and cloudless and as he paced under the blinded houses and along the vacant streets the chill of the dawn had fled and some of the warmth and all the brightness of the july day already shone upon the city  he walked at first in a profound abstraction bitterly reviewing and repenting his performances at whist but as he advanced into the labyrinth of the southwest his ear was gradually mastered by the silence  street after street looked down upon his solitary figure house after house echoed upon his passage with a ghostly jar shop after shop displayed its shuttered front and its commercial legend and meanwhile he steered his course under day’s effulgent dome and through this encampment of diurnal sleepers lonely as a ship  ‘here’ he reflected ‘if i were like my scatterbrained companion here were indeed the scene where i might look for an adventure  here in broad day the streets are secret as in the blackest night of january and in the midst of some four million sleepers solitary as the woods of yucatan  if i but raise my voice i could summon up the number of an army and yet the grave is not more silent than this city of sleep’  he was still following these quaint and serious musings when he came into a street of more mingled ingredients than was common in the quarter here on the one hand framed in walls and the green tops of trees were several of those discreet bijou residences on which propriety is apt to look askance  here too were many of the brickfronted barracks of the poor a plaster cow perhaps serving as ensign to a dairy or a ticket announcing the business of the mangler  before one such house that stood a little separate among walled gardens a cat was playing with a straw and challoner paused a moment looking on this sleek and solitary creature who seemed an emblem of the neighbouring peace  with the cessation of the sound of his own steps the silence fell dead the house stood smokeless the blinds down the whole machinery of life arrested and it seemed to challoner that he should hear the breathing of the sleepers  as he so stood he was startled by a dull and jarring detonation from within  this was followed by a monstrous hissing and simmering as from a kettle of the bigness of st paul’s and at the same time from every chink of door and window spirted an illsmelling vapour  the cat disappeared with a cry  within the lodginghouse feet pounded on the stairs the door flew back emitting clouds of smoke and two men and an elegantly dressed young lady tumbled forth into the street and fled without a word  the hissing had already ceased the smoke was melting in the air the whole event had come and gone as in a dream and still challoner was rooted to the spot  at last his reason and his fear awoke together and with the most unwonted energy he fell to running  little by little this first dash relaxed and presently he had resumed his sober gait and begun to piece together out of the confused report of his senses some theory of the occurrence  but the occasion of the sounds and stench that had so suddenly assailed him and the strange conjunction of fugitives whom he had seen to issue from the house were mysteries beyond his plummet  with an obscure awe he considered them in his mind continuing meanwhile to thread the web of streets and once more alone in morning sunshine  in his first retreat he had entirely wandered and now steering vaguely west it was his luck to light upon an unpretending street which presently widened so as to admit a strip of gardens in the midst  here was quite a stir of birds even at that hour the shadow of the leaves was grateful instead of the burnt atmosphere of cities there was something brisk and rural in the air and challoner paced forward his eyes upon the pavement and his mind running upon distant scenes till he was recalled upon a sudden by a wall that blocked his further progress this street whose name i have forgotten is no thoroughfare  he was not the first who had wandered there that morning for as he raised his eyes with an agreeable deliberation they alighted on the figure of a girl in whom he was struck to recognise the third of the incongruous fugitives  she had run there seemingly blindfold the wall had checked her career and being entirely wearied she had sunk upon the ground beside the garden railings soiling her dress among the summer dust  each saw the other in the same instant of time and she with one wild look sprang to her feet and began to hurry from the scene  challoner was doubly startled to meet once more the heroine of his adventure and to observe the fear with which she shunned him  pity and alarm in nearly equal forces contested the possession of his mind and yet in spite of both he saw himself condemned to follow in the lady’s wake  he did so gingerly as fearing to increase her terrors but tread as lightly as he might his footfalls eloquently echoed in the empty street  their sound appeared to strike in her some strong emotion for scarce had he begun to follow ere she paused  a second time she addressed herself to flight and a second time she paused  then she turned about and with doubtful steps and the most attractive appearance of timidity drew near to the young man  he on his side continued to advance with similar signals of distress and bashfulness  at length when they were but some steps apart he saw her eyes brim over and she reached out both her hands in eloquent appeal  ‘are you an english gentleman’ she cried  the unhappy challoner regarded her with consternation  he was the spirit of fine courtesy and would have blushed to fail in his devoirs to any lady but in the other scale he was a man averse from amorous adventures  he looked east and west but the houses that looked down upon this interview remained inexorably shut and he saw himself though in the full glare of the day’s eye cut off from any human intervention his looks returned at last upon the suppliant  he remarked with irritation that she was charming both in face and figure elegantly dressed and gloved a lady undeniable the picture of distress and innocence weeping and lost in the city of diurnal sleep  ‘madam’ he said ‘i protest you have no cause to fear intrusion and if i have appeared to follow you the fault is in this street which has deceived us both’  an unmistakable relief appeared upon the lady’s face ‘i might have guessed it’ she exclaimed  ‘thank you a thousand times but at this hour in this appalling silence and among all these staring windows i am lost in terrors—oh lost in them’ she cried her face blanching at the words  ‘i beg you to lend me your arm’ she added with the loveliest suppliant inflection  ‘i dare not go alone my nerve is gone—i had a shock oh what a shock  i beg of you to be my escort’  ‘my dear madam’ responded challoner heavily ‘my arm is at your service’  ‘she took it and clung to it for a moment struggling with her sobs and the next with feverish hurry began to lead him in the direction of the city  one thing was plain among so much that was obscure it was plain her fears were genuine  still as she went she spied around as if for dangers and now she would shiver like a person in a chill and now clutch his arm in hers  to challoner her terror was at once repugnant and infectious it gained and mastered while it still offended him and he wailed in spirit and longed for release  ‘madam’ he said at last ‘i am of course charmed to be of use to any lady but i confess i was bound in a direction opposite to that you follow and a word of explanation—’  ‘hush’ she sobbed ‘not here—not here’  the blood of challoner ran cold  he might have thought the lady mad but his memory was charged with more perilous stuff and in view of the detonation the smoke and the flight of the illassorted trio his mind was lost among mysteries  so they continued to thread the maze of streets in silence with the speed of a guilty flight and both thrilling with incommunicable terrors  in time however and above all by their quick pace of walking the pair began to rise to firmer spirits the lady ceased to peer about the corners and challoner emboldened by the resonant tread and distant figure of a constable returned to the charge with more of spirit and directness  ‘i thought’ said he in the tone of conversation ‘that i had indistinctly perceived you leaving a villa in the company of two gentlemen’  ‘oh’ she said ‘you need not fear to wound me by the truth  you saw me flee from a common lodginghouse and my companions were not gentlemen in such a case the best of compliments is to be frank’  ‘i thought’ resumed challoner encouraged as much as he was surprised by the spirit of her reply ‘to have perceived besides a certain odour  a noise too—i do not know to what i should compare it—’  ‘silence’ she cried  ‘you do not know the danger you invoke  wait only wait and as soon as we have left those streets and got beyond the reach of listeners all shall be explained  meanwhile avoid the topic what a sight is this sleeping city’ she exclaimed and then with a most thrilling voice ‘“dear god” she quoted “the very houses seem asleep and all that mighty heart is lying still”’  ‘i perceive madam’ said he ‘you are a reader’  ‘i am more than that’ she answered with a sigh  ‘i am a girl condemned to thoughts beyond her age and so untoward is my fate that this walk upon the arm of a stranger is like an interlude of peace’  they had come by this time to the neighbourhood of the victoria station and here at a street corner the young lady paused withdrew her arm from challoner’s and looked up and down as though in pain or indecision then with a lovely change of countenance and laying her gloved hand upon his arm—  ‘what you already think of me’ she said ‘i tremble to conceive yet i must here condemn myself still further  here i must leave you and here i beseech you to wait for my return  do not attempt to follow me or spy upon my actions  suspend yet awhile your judgment of a girl as innocent as your own sister and do not above all desert me  stranger as you are i have none else to look to  you see me in sorrow and great fear you are a gentleman courteous and kind and when i beg for a few minutes’ patience i make sure beforehand you will not deny me’  challoner grudgingly promised and the young lady with a grateful eyeshot vanished round the corner  but the force of her appeal had been a little blunted for the young man was not only destitute of sisters but of any female relative nearer than a greataunt in wales now he was alone besides the spell that he had hitherto obeyed began to weaken he considered his behaviour with a sneer and plucking up the spirit of revolt he started in pursuit  the reader if he has ever plied the fascinating trade of the noctambulist will not be unaware that in the neighbourhood of the great railway centres certain early taverns inaugurate the business of the day  it was into one of these that challoner coming round the corner of the block beheld his charming companion disappear  to say he was surprised were inexact for he had long since left that sentiment behind him  acute disgust and disappointment seized upon his soul and with silent oaths he damned this commonplace enchantress  she had scarce been gone a second ere the swingdoors reopened and she appeared again in company with a young man of mean and slouching attire  for some five or six exchanges they conversed together with an animated air then the fellow shouldered again into the tap and the young lady with something swifter than a walk retraced her steps towards challoner  he saw her coming a miracle of grace her ankle as she hurried flashing from her dress her movements eloquent of speed and youth and though he still entertained some thoughts of flight they grew miserably fainter as the distance lessened against mere beauty he was proof it was her unmistakable gentility that now robbed him of the courage of his cowardice  with a proved adventuress he had acted strictly on his right with one who in spite of all he could not quite deny to be a lady he found himself disarmed  at the very corner from whence he had spied upon her interview she came upon him still transfixed and—‘ah’ she cried with a bright flush of colour  ‘ah  ungenerous’  the sharpness of the attack somewhat restored the squire of dames to the possession of himself  ‘madam’ he returned with a fair show of stoutness ‘i do not think that hitherto you can complain of any lack of generosity i have suffered myself to be led over a considerable portion of the metropolis and if i now request you to discharge me of my office of protector you have friends at hand who will be glad of the succession’  she stood a moment dumb  ‘it is well’ she said  ‘go go and may god help me  you have seen me—me an innocent girl fleeing from a dire catastrophe and haunted by sinister men and neither pity curiosity nor honour move you to await my explanation or to help in my distress  go’ she repeated  ‘i am lost indeed’  and with a passionate gesture she turned and fled along the street  challoner observed her retreat and disappear an almost intolerable sense of guilt contending with the profound sense that he was being gulled she was no sooner gone than the first of these feelings took the upper hand he felt if he had done her less than justice that his conduct was a perfect model of the ungracious the cultured tone of her voice her choice of language and the elegant decorum of her movements cried out aloud against a harsh construction and between penitence and curiosity he began slowly to follow in her wake  at the corner he had her once more full in view  her speed was failing like a stricken bird’s  even as he looked she threw her arm out gropingly and fell and leaned against the wall  at the spectacle challoner’s fortitude gave way  in a few strides he overtook her and for the first time removing his hat assured her in the most moving terms of his entire respect and firm desire to help her  he spoke at first unheeded but gradually it appeared that she began to comprehend his words she moved a little and drew herself upright and finally as with a sudden movement of forgiveness turned on the young man a countenance in which reproach and gratitude were mingled  ‘ah madam’ he cried ‘use me as you will’ and once more but now with a great air of deference he offered her the conduct of his arm  she took it with a sigh that struck him to the heart and they began once more to trace the deserted streets  but now her steps as though exhausted by emotion began to linger on the way she leaned the more heavily upon his arm and he like the parent bird stooped fondly above his drooping convoy  her physical distress was not accompanied by any failing of her spirits and hearing her strike so soon into a playful and charming vein of talk challoner could not sufficiently admire the elasticity of his companion’s nature  ‘let me forget’ she had said ‘for one half hour let me forget’ and sure enough with the very word her sorrows appeared to be forgotten  before every house she paused invented a name for the proprietor and sketched his character here lived the old general whom she was to marry on the fifth of the next month there was the mansion of the rich widow who had set her heart on challoner and though she still hung wearily on the young man’s arm her laughter sounded low and pleasant in his ears ‘ah’ she sighed by way of commentary ‘in such a life as mine i must seize tight hold of any happiness that i can find’  when they arrived in this leisurely manner at the head of grosvenor place the gates of the park were opening and the bedraggled company of nightwalkers were being at last admitted into that paradise of lawns challoner and his companion followed the movement and walked for awhile in silence in that tatterdemalion crowd but as one after another weary with the night’s patrolling of the city pavement sank upon the benches or wandered into separate paths the vast extent of the park had soon utterly swallowed up the last of these intruders and the pair proceeded on their way alone in the grateful quiet of the morning  presently they came in sight of a bench standing very open on a mound of turf  the young lady looked about her with relief  ‘here’ she said ‘here at last we are secure from listeners  here then you shall learn and judge my history  i could not bear that we should part and that you should still suppose your kindness squandered upon one who was unworthy’  thereupon she sat down upon the bench and motioning challoner to take a place immediately beside her began in the following words and with the greatest appearance of enjoyment to narrate the story of her life    story of the destroying angel   my father was a native of england son of a cadet of a great ancient but untitled family and by some event fault or misfortune he was driven to flee from the land of his birth and to lay aside the name of his ancestors  he sought the states and instead of lingering in effeminate cities pushed at once into the far west with an exploring party of frontiersmen  he was no ordinary traveller for he was not only brave and impetuous by character but learned in many sciences and above all in botany which he particularly loved  thus it fell that before many months fremont himself the nominal leader of the troop courted and bowed to his opinion  they had pushed as i have said into the still unknown regions of the west  for some time they followed the track of mormon caravans guiding themselves in that vast and melancholy desert by the skeletons of men and animals  then they inclined their route a little to the north and losing even these dire memorials came into a country of forbidding stillness  i have often heard my father dwell upon the features of that ride rock cliff and barren moor alternated the streams were very far between and neither beast nor bird disturbed the solitude  on the fortieth day they had already run so short of food that it was judged advisable to call a halt and scatter upon all sides to hunt  a great fire was built that its smoke might serve to rally them and each man of the party mounted and struck off at a venture into the surrounding desert  my father rode for many hours with a steep range of cliffs upon the one hand very black and horrible and upon the other an unwatered vale dotted with boulders like the site of some subverted city  at length he found the slot of a great animal and from the clawmarks and the hair among the brush judged that he was on the track of a cinnamon bear of most unusual size  he quickened the pace of his steed and still following the quarry came at last to the division of two watersheds  on the far side the country was exceeding intricate and difficult heaped with boulders and dotted here and there with a few pines which seemed to indicate the neighbourhood of water  here then he picketed his horse and relying on his trusty rifle advanced alone into that wilderness  presently in the great silence that reigned he was aware of the sound of running water to his right and leaning in that direction was rewarded by a scene of natural wonder and human pathos strangely intermixed  the stream ran at the bottom of a narrow and winding passage whose walllike sides of rock were sometimes for miles together unscalable by man  the water when the stream was swelled with rains must have filled it from side to side the sun’s rays only plumbed it in the hour of noon the wind in that narrow and damp funnel blew tempestuously  and yet in the bottom of this den immediately below my father’s eyes as he leaned over the margin of the cliff a party of some half a hundred men women and children lay scattered uneasily among the rocks  they lay some upon their backs some prone and not one stirring their upturned faces seemed all of an extraordinary paleness and emaciation and from time to time above the washing of the stream a faint sound of moaning mounted to my father’s ears  while he thus looked an old man got staggering to his feet unwound his blanket and laid it with great gentleness on a young girl who sat hard by propped against a rock  the girl did not seem to be conscious of the act and the old man after having looked upon her with the most engaging pity returned to his former bed and lay down again uncovered on the turf  but the scene had not passed without observation even in that starving camp  from the very outskirts of the party a man with a white beard and seemingly of venerable years rose upon his knees and came crawling stealthily among the sleepers towards the girl and judge of my father’s indignation when he beheld this cowardly miscreant strip from her both the coverings and return with them to his original position here he lay down for a while below his spoils and as my father imagined feigned to be asleep but presently he had raised himself again upon one elbow looked with sharp scrutiny at his companions and then swiftly carried his hand into his bosom and thence to his mouth  by the movement of his jaws he must be eating in that camp of famine he had reserved a store of nourishment and while his companions lay in the stupor of approaching death secretly restored his powers  my father was so incensed at what he saw that he raised his rifle and but for an accident he has often declared he would have shot the fellow dead upon the spot  how different would then have been my history  but it was not to be even as he raised the barrel his eye lighted on the bear as it crawled along a ledge some way below him and ceding to the hunters instinct it was at the brute not at the man that he discharged his piece  the bear leaped and fell into a pool of the river the canyon reechoed the report and in a moment the camp was afoot  with cries that were scarce human stumbling falling and throwing each other down these starving people rushed upon the quarry and before my father climbing down by the ledge had time to reach the level of the stream many were already satisfying their hunger on the raw flesh and a fire was being built by the more dainty  his arrival was for some time unremarked  he stood in the midst of these tottering and clayfaced marionettes he was surrounded by their cries but their whole soul was fixed on the dead carcass even those who were too weak to move lay halfturned over with their eyes riveted upon the bear and my father seeing himself stand as though invisible in the thick of this dreary hubbub was seized with a desire to weep  a touch upon the arm restrained him  turning about he found himself face to face with the old man he had so nearly killed and yet at the second glance recognised him for no old man at all but one in the full strength of his years and of a strong speaking and intellectual countenance stigmatised by weariness and famine  he beckoned my father near the cliff and there in the most private whisper begged for brandy  my father looked at him with scorn ‘you remind me’ he said ‘of a neglected duty  here is my flask it contains enough i trust to revive the women of your party and i will begin with her whom i saw you robbing of her blankets’  and with that not heeding his appeals my father turned his back upon the egoist  the girl still lay reclined against the rock she lay too far sunk in the first stage of death to have observed the bustle round her couch but when my father had raised her head put the flask to her lips and forced or aided her to swallow some drops of the restorative she opened her languid eyes and smiled upon him faintly  never was there a smile of a more touching sweetness never were eyes more deeply violet more honestly eloquent of the soul  i speak with knowledge for these were the same eyes that smiled upon me in the cradle  from her who was to be his wife my father still jealously watched and followed by the man with the grey beard carried his attentions to all the women of the party and gave the last drainings of his flask to those among the men who seemed in the most need  ‘is there none left not a drop for me’ said the man with the beard  ‘not one drop’ replied my father ‘and if you find yourself in want let me counsel you to put your hand into the pocket of your coat’  ‘ah’ cried the other ‘you misjudge me  you think me one who clings to life for selfish and commonplace considerations  but let me tell you that were all this caravan to perish the world would but be lightened of a weight  these are but human insects pullulating thick as mayflies in the slums of european cities whom i myself have plucked from degradation and misery from the dungheap and ginpalace door  and you compare their lives with mine’  ‘you are then a mormon missionary’ asked my father  ‘oh’ cried the man with a strange smile ‘a mormon missionary if you will  i value not the title  were i no more than that i could have died without a murmur  but with my life as a physician is bound up the knowledge of great secrets and the future of man  this it was when we missed the caravan tried for a short cut and wandered to this desolate ravine that ate into my soul and in five days has changed my beard from ebony to silver’  ‘and you are a physician’ mused my father looking on his face ‘bound by oath to succour man in his distresses’  ‘sir’ returned the mormon ‘my name is grierson you will hear that name again and you will then understand that my duty was not to this caravan of paupers but to mankind at large’  my father turned to the remainder of the party who were now sufficiently revived to hear told them that he would set off at once to bring help from his own party ‘and’ he added ‘if you be again reduced to such extremities look round you and you will see the earth strewn with assistance  here for instance growing on the under side of fissures in this cliff you will perceive a yellow moss  trust me it is both edible and excellent’  ‘ha’ said doctor grierson ‘you know botany’  ‘not i alone’ returned my father lowering his voice ‘for see where these have been scraped away  am i right  was that your secret store’  my father’s comrades he found when he returned to the signalfire had made a good day’s hunting  they were thus the more easily persuaded to extend assistance to the mormon caravan and the next day beheld both parties on the march for the frontiers of utah  the distance to be traversed was not great but the nature of the country and the difficulty of procuring food extended the time to nearly three weeks and my father had thus ample leisure to know and appreciate the girl whom he had succoured  i will call my mother lucy  her family name i am not at liberty to mention it is one you would know well  by what series of undeserved calamities this innocent flower of maidenhood lovely refined by education ennobled by the finest taste was thus cast among the horrors of a mormon caravan i must not stay to tell you  let it suffice that even in these untoward circumstances she found a heart worthy of her own  the ardour of attachment which united my father and mother was perhaps partly due to the strange manner of their meeting it knew at least no bounds either divine or human my father for her sake determined to renounce his ambitions and abjure his faith and a week had not yet passed upon the march before he had resigned from his party accepted the mormon doctrine and received the promise of my mother’s hand on the arrival of the party at salt lake  the marriage took place and i was its only offspring  my father prospered exceedingly in his affairs remained faithful to my mother and though you may wonder to hear it i believe there were few happier homes in any country than that in which i saw the light and grew to girlhood we were indeed and in spite of all our wealth avoided as heretics and halfbelievers by the more precise and pious of the faithful young himself that formidable tyrant was known to look askance upon my father’s riches but of this i had no guess  i dwelt indeed under the mormon system with perfect innocence and faith  some of our friends had many wives but such was the custom and why should it surprise me more than marriage itself  from time to time one of our rich acquaintances would disappear his family be broken up his wives and houses shared among the elders of the church and his memory only recalled with bated breath and dreadful headshakings  when i had been very still and my presence perhaps was forgotten some such topic would arise among my elders by the evening fire i would see them draw the closer together and look behind them with scared eyes and i might gather from their whisperings how some one rich honoured healthy and in the prime of his days some one perhaps who had taken me on his knees a week before had in one hour been spirited from home and family and vanished like an image from a mirror leaving not a print behind  it was terrible indeed but so was death the universal law  and even if the talk should wax still bolder full of ominous silences and nods and i should hear named in a whisper the destroying angels how was a child to understand these mysteries  i heard of a destroying angel as some more happy child might hear in england of a bishop or a rural dean with vague respect and without the wish for further information  life anywhere in society as in nature rests upon dread foundations i beheld safe roads a garden blooming in the desert pious people crowding to worship i was aware of my parents’ tenderness and all the harmless luxuries of my existence and why should i pry beneath this honest seeming surface for the mysteries on which it stood  we dwelt originally in the city but at an early date we moved to a beautiful house in a green dingle musical with splashing water and surrounded on almost every side by twenty miles of poisonous and rocky desert  the city was thirty miles away there was but one road which went no further than my father’s door the rest were bridletracks impassable in winter and we thus dwelt in a solitude inconceivable to the european  our only neighbour was dr grierson  to my young eyes after the hairoiled chinbearded elders of the city and the illfavoured and mentally stunted women of their harems there was something agreeable in the correct manner the fine bearing the thin white hair and beard and the piercing looks of the old doctor  yet though he was almost our only visitor i never wholly overcame a sense of fear in his presence and this disquietude was rather fed by the awful solitude in which he lived and the obscurity that hung about his occupations  his house was but a mile or two from ours but very differently placed  it stood overlooking the road on the summit of a steep slope and planted close against a range of overhanging bluffs nature you would say had here desired to imitate the works of man for the slope was even like the glacis of a fort and the cliffs of a constant height like the ramparts of a city  not even spring could change one feature of that desolate scene and the windows looked down across a plain snowy with alkali to ranges of cold stone sierras on the north  twice or thrice i remember passing within view of this forbidding residence and seeing it always shuttered smokeless and deserted i remarked to my parents that some day it would certainly be robbed  ‘ah no’ said my father ‘never robbed’ and i observed a strange conviction in his tone  at last and not long before the blow fell on my unhappy family i chanced to see the doctor’s house in a new light  my father was ill my mother confined to his bedside and i was suffered to go under the charge of our driver to the lonely house some twenty miles away where our packages were left for us  the horse cast a shoe night overtook us halfway home and it was well on for three in the morning when the driver and i alone in a light waggon came to that part of the road which ran below the doctor’s house  the moon swam clear the cliffs and mountains in this strong light lay utterly deserted but the house from its station on the top of the long slope and close under the bluff not only shone abroad from every window like a place of festival but from the great chimney at the west end poured forth a coil of smoke so thick and so voluminous that it hung for miles along the windless night air and its shadow lay far abroad in the moonlight upon the glittering alkali as we continued to draw near besides a regular and panting throb began to divide the silence  first it seemed to me like the beating of a heart and next it put into my mind the thought of some giant smothered under mountains and still with incalculable effort fetching breath  i had heard of the railway though i had not seen it and i turned to ask the driver if this resembled it  but some look in his eye some pallor whether of fear or moonlight on his face caused the words to die upon my lips  we continued therefore to advance in silence till we were close below the lighted house when suddenly without one premonitory rustle there burst forth a report of such a bigness that it shook the earth and set the echoes of the mountains thundering from cliff to cliff  a pillar of amber flame leaped from the chimneytop and fell in multitudes of sparks and at the same time the lights in the windows turned for one instant ruby red and then expired  the driver had checked his horse instinctively and the echoes were still rumbling farther off among the mountains when there broke from the now darkened interior a series of yells—whether of man or woman it was impossible to guess—the door flew open and there ran forth into the moonlight at the top of the long slope a figure clad in white which began to dance and leap and throw itself down and roll as if in agony before the house  i could no more restrain my cries the driver laid his lash about the horse’s flank and we fled up the rough track at the peril of our lives and did not draw rein till turning the corner of the mountain we beheld my father’s ranch and deep green groves and gardens sleeping in the tranquil light  this was the one adventure of my life until my father had climbed to the very topmost point of material prosperity and i myself had reached the age of seventeen  i was still innocent and merry like a child tended my garden or ran upon the hills in glad simplicity gave not a thought to coquetry or to material cares and if my eye rested on my own image in a mirror or some sylvan spring it was to seek and recognise the features of my parents  but the fears which had long pressed on others were now to be laid on my youth  i had thrown myself one sultry cloudy afternoon on a divan the windows stood open on the verandah where my mother sat with her embroidery and when my father joined her from the garden their conversation clearly audible to me was of so startling a nature that it held me enthralled where i lay  ‘the blow has come’ my father said after a long pause  i could hear my mother start and turn but in words she made no reply  ‘yes’ continued my father ‘i have received today a list of all that i possess of all i say of what i have lent privately to men whose lips are sealed with terror of what i have buried with my own hand on the bare mountain when there was not a bird in heaven  does the air then carry secrets  are the hills of glass  do the stones we tread upon preserve the footprint to betray us  oh lucy lucy that we should have come to such a country’  ‘but this’ returned my mother ‘is no very new or very threatening event  you are accused of some concealment  you will pay more taxes in the future and be mulcted in a fine  it is disquieting indeed to find our acts so spied upon and the most private known  but is this new have we not long feared and suspected every blade of grass’  ‘ay and our shadows’ cried my father  ‘but all this is nothing  here is the letter that accompanied the list’  i heard my mother turn the pages and she was some time silent  ‘i see’ she said at last and then with the tone of one reading ‘“from a believer so largely blessed by providence with this world’s goods”’ she continued ‘“the church awaits in confidence some signal mark of piety”  there lies the sting  am i not right  these are the words you fear’  ‘these are the words’ replied my father  ‘lucy you remember priestley two days before he disappeared he carried me to the summit of an isolated butte we could see around us for ten miles sure if in any quarter of this land a man were safe from spies it were in such a station but it was in the very aguefit of terror that he told me and that i heard his story  he had received a letter such as this and he submitted to my approval an answer in which he offered to resign a third of his possessions  i conjured him as he valued life to raise his offering and before we parted he had doubled the amount  well two days later he was gone—gone from the chief street of the city in the hour of noon—and gone for ever  o god’ cried my father ‘by what art do they thus spirit out of life the solid body  what death do they command that leaves no traces that this material structure these strong arms this skeleton that can resist the grave for centuries should be thus reft in a moment from the world of sense  a horror dwells in that thought more awful than mere death’  ‘is there no hope in grierson’ asked my mother  ‘dismiss the thought’ replied my father  ‘he now knows all that i can teach and will do naught to save me  his power besides is small his own danger not improbably more imminent than mine for he too lives apart he leaves his wives neglected and unwatched he is openly cited for an unbeliever and unless he buys security at a more awful price—but no i will not believe it i have no love for him but i will not believe it’  ‘believe what’ asked my mother and then with a change of note ‘but oh what matters it’ she cried  ‘abimelech there is but one way open we must fly’  ‘it is in vain’ returned my father  ‘i should but involve you in my fate  to leave this land is hopeless we are closed in it as men are closed in life and there is no issue but the grave’  ‘we can but die then’ replied my mother  ‘let us at least die together let not asenath 43 and myself survive you  think to what a fate we should be doomed’  my father was unable to resist her tender violence and though i could see he nourished not one spark of hope he consented to desert his whole estate beyond some hundreds of dollars that he had by him at the moment and to flee that night which promised to be dark and cloudy  as soon as the servants were asleep he was to load two mules with provisions two others were to carry my mother and myself and striking through the mountains by an unfrequented trail we were to make a fair stroke for liberty and life  as soon as they had thus decided i showed myself at the window and owning that i had heard all assured them that they could rely on my prudence and devotion  i had no fear indeed but to show myself unworthy of my birth i held my life in my hand without alarm and when my father weeping upon my neck had blessed heaven for the courage of his child it was with a sentiment of pride and some of the joy that warriors take in war that i began to look forward to the perils of our flight  before midnight under an obscure and starless heaven we had left far behind us the plantations of the valley and were mounting a certain canyon in the hills narrow encumbered with great rocks and echoing with the roar of a tumultuous torrent  cascade after cascade thundered and hung up its flag of whiteness in the night or fanned our faces with the wet wind of its descent  the trail was breakneck and led to famineguarded deserts it had been long since deserted for more practicable routes and it was now a part of the world untrod from year to year by human footing judge of our dismay when turning suddenly an angle of the cliffs we found a bright bonfire blazing by itself under an impending rock and on the face of the rock drawn very rudely with charred wood the great open eye which is the emblem of the mormon faith we looked upon each other in the firelight my mother broke into a passion of tears but not a word was said  the mules were turned about and leaving that great eye to guard the lonely canyon we retraced our steps in silence  day had not yet broken ere we were once more at home condemned beyond reprieve  what answer my father sent i was not told but two days later a little before sundown i saw a plain honestlooking man ride slowly up the road in a great pother of dust  he was clad in homespun with a broad straw hat wore a patriarchal beard and had an air of a simple rustic farmer that was in my eyes very reassuring  he was indeed a very honest man and pious mormon with no liking for his errand though neither he nor any one in utah dared to disobey and it was with every mark of diffidence that he had had himself announced as mr aspinwall and entered the room where our unhappy family was gathered  my mother and me he awkwardly enough dismissed and as soon as he was alone with my father laid before him a blank signature of president young’s and offered him a choice of services either to set out as a missionary to the tribes about the white sea or to join the next day with a party of destroying angels in the massacre of sixty german immigrants  the last of course my father could not entertain and the first he regarded as a pretext even if he could consent to leave his wife defenceless and to collect fresh victims for the tyranny under which he was himself oppressed he felt sure he would never be suffered to return  he refused both and aspinwall he said betrayed sincere emotion part religious at the spectacle of such disobedience but part human in pity for my father and his family  he besought him to reconsider his decision and at length finding he could not prevail gave him till the moon rose to settle his affairs and say farewell to wife and daughter  ‘for’ said he ‘then at the latest you must ride with me’  i dare not dwell upon the hours that followed they fled all too fast and presently the moon outtopped the eastern range and my father and mr aspinwall set forth side by side on their nocturnal journey  my mother though still bearing an heroic countenance had hastened to shut herself in her apartment thenceforward solitary and i alone in the dark house and consumed by grief and apprehension made haste to saddle my indian pony to ride up to the corner of the mountain and to enjoy one farewell sight of my departing father  the two men had set forth at a deliberate pace nor was i long behind them when i reached the point of view  i was the more amazed to see no moving creature in the landscape  the moon as the saying is shone bright as day and nowhere under the whole arch of night was there a growing tree a bush a farm a patch of tillage or any evidence of man but one  from the corner where i stood a rugged bastion of the line of bluffs concealed the doctor’s house and across the top of that projection the soft night wind carried and unwound about the hills a coil of sable smoke  what fuel could produce a vapour so sluggish to dissipate in that dry air or what furnace pour it forth so copiously i was unable to conceive but i knew well enough that it came from the doctor’s chimney i saw well enough that my father had already disappeared and in despite of reason i connected in my mind the loss of that dear protector with the ribbon of foul smoke that trailed along the mountains  days passed and still my mother and i waited in vain for news a week went by a second followed but we heard no word of the father and husband  as smoke dissipates as the image glides from the mirror so in the ten or twenty minutes that i had spent in getting my horse and following upon his trail had that strong and brave man vanished out of life  hope if any hope we had fled with every hour the worst was now certain for my father the worst was to be dreaded for his defenceless family  without weakness with a desperate calm at which i marvel when i look back upon it the widow and the orphan awaited the event  on the last day of the third week we rose in the morning to find ourselves alone in the house alone so far as we searched on the estate all our attendants with one accord had fled and as we knew them to be gratefully devoted we drew the darkest intimations from their flight the day passed indeed without event but in the fall of the evening we were called at last into the verandah by the approaching clink of horse’s hoofs  the doctor mounted on an indian pony rode into the garden dismounted and saluted us  he seemed much more bent and his hair more silvery than ever but his demeanour was composed serious and not unkind  ‘madam’ said he ‘i am come upon a weighty errand and i would have you recognise it as an effect of kindness in the president that he should send as his ambassador your only neighbour and your husband’s oldest friend in utah’  ‘sir’ said my mother ‘i have but one concern one thought  you know well what it is  speak my husband’  ‘madam’ returned the doctor taking a chair on the verandah ‘if you were a silly child my position would now be painfully embarrassing  you are on the other hand a woman of great intelligence and fortitude you have by my forethought been allowed three weeks to draw your own conclusions and to accept the inevitable  farther words from me are i conceive superfluous’  my mother was as pale as death and trembled like a reed i gave her my hand and she kept it in the folds of her dress and wrung it till i could have cried aloud  ‘then sir’ said she at last ‘you speak to deaf ears  if this be indeed so what have i to do with errands  what do i ask of heaven but to die’  ‘come’ said the doctor ‘command yourself  i bid you dismiss all thoughts of your late husband and bring a clear mind to bear upon your own future and the fate of that young girl’  ‘you bid me dismiss—’ began my mother  ‘then you know’ she cried  ‘i know’ replied the doctor  ‘you know’ broke out the poor woman  ‘then it was you who did the deed i tear off the mask and with dread and loathing see you as you are—you whom the poor fugitive beholds in nightmares and awakes raving—you the destroying angel’  ‘well madam and what then’ returned the doctor  ‘have not my fate and yours been similar  are we not both immured in this strong prison of utah  have you not tried to flee and did not the open eye confront you in the canyon  who can escape the watch of that unsleeping eye of utah not i at least  horrible tasks have indeed been laid upon me and the most ungrateful was the last but had i refused my offices would that have spared your husband  you know well it would not  i too had perished along with him nor would i have been able to alleviate his last moments nor could i today have stood between his family and the hand of brigham young’  ‘ah’ cried i ‘and could you purchase life by such concessions’  ‘young lady’ answered the doctor ‘i both could and did and you will live to thank me for that baseness  you have a spirit asenath that it pleases me to recognise  but we waste time  mr fonblanque’s estate reverts as you doubtless imagine to the church but some part of it has been reserved for him who is to marry the family and that person i should perhaps tell you without more delay is no other than myself’  at this odious proposal my mother and i cried out aloud and clung together like lost souls  ‘it is as i supposed’ resumed the doctor with the same measured utterance  ‘you recoil from this arrangement  do you expect me to convince you  you know very well that i have never held the mormon view of women  absorbed in the most arduous studies i have left the slatterns whom they call my wives to scratch and quarrel among themselves of me they have had nothing but my purse such was not the union i desired even if i had the leisure to pursue it  no you need not madam and my old friend’—and here the doctor rose and bowed with something of gallantry—‘you need not apprehend my importunities  on the contrary i am rejoiced to read in you a roman spirit and if i am obliged to bid you follow me at once and that in the name not of my wish but of my orders i hope it will be found that we are of a common mind’  so bidding us dress for the road he took a lamp for the night had now fallen and set off to the stable to prepare our horses  ‘what does it mean—what will become of us’ i cried  ‘not that at least’ replied my mother shuddering  ‘so far we can trust him  i seem to read among his words a certain tragic promise asenath if i leave you if i die you will not forget your miserable parents’  thereupon we fell to crosspurposes i beseeching her to explain her words she putting me by and continuing to recommend the doctor for a friend  ‘the doctor’ i cried at last ‘the man who killed my father’  ‘nay’ said she ‘let us be just  i do believe before heaven he played the friendliest part  and he alone asenath can protect you in this land of death’  at this the doctor returned leading our two horses and when we were all in the saddle he bade me ride on before as he had matter to discuss with mrs fonblanque  they came at a foot’s pace eagerly conversing in a whisper and presently after the moon rose and showed them looking eagerly in each other’s faces as they went my mother laying her hand upon the doctor’s arm and the doctor himself against his usual custom making vigorous gestures of protest or asseveration  at the foot of the track which ascended the talus of the mountain to his door the doctor overtook me at a trot  ‘here’ he said ‘we shall dismount and as your mother prefers to be alone you and i shall walk together to my house’  ‘shall i see her again’ i asked  ‘i give you my word’ he said and helped me to alight  ‘we leave the horses here’ he added  ‘there are no thieves in this stone wilderness’  the track mounted gradually keeping the house in view  the windows were once more bright the chimney once more vomited smoke but the most absolute silence reigned and but for the figure of my mother very slowly following in our wake i felt convinced there was no human soul within a range of miles  at the thought i looked upon the doctor gravely walking by my side with his bowed shoulders and white hair and then once more at his house lit up and pouring smoke like some industrious factory  and then my curiosity broke forth  ‘in heaven’s name’ i cried ‘what do you make in this inhuman desert’  he looked at me with a peculiar smile and answered with an evasion—  ‘this is not the first time’ said he ‘that you have seen my furnaces alight  one morning in the small hours i saw you driving past a delicate experiment miscarried and i cannot acquit myself of having startled either your driver or the horse that drew you’  ‘what’ cried i beholding again in fancy the antics of the figure ‘could that be you’  ‘it was i’ he replied ‘but do not fancy that i was mad  i was in agony  i had been scalded cruelly’  we were now near the house which unlike the ordinary houses of the country was built of hewn stone and very solid  stone too was its foundation stone its background  not a blade of grass sprouted among the broken mineral about the walls not a flower adorned the windows over the door by way of sole adornment the mormon eye was rudely sculptured i had been brought up to view that emblem from my childhood but since the night of our escape it had acquired a new significance and set me shrinking  the smoke rolled voluminously from the chimney top its edges ruddy with the fire and from the far corner of the building near the ground angry puffs of steam shone snowwhite in the moon and vanished  the doctor opened the door and paused upon the threshold  ‘you ask me what i make here’ he observed  ‘two things life and death’  and he motioned me to enter  ‘i shall await my mother’ said i  ‘child’ he replied ‘look at me am i not old and broken  of us two which is the stronger the young maiden or the withered man’  i bowed and passing by him entered a vestibule or kitchen lit by a good fire and a shaded readinglamp  it was furnished only with a dresser a rude table and some wooden benches and on one of these the doctor motioned me to take a seat and passing by another door into the interior of the house he left me to myself  presently i heard the jar of iron from the far end of the building and this was followed by the same throbbing noise that had startled me in the valley but now so near at hand as to be menacing by loudness and even to shake the house with every recurrence of the stroke  i had scarce time to master my alarm when the doctor returned and almost in the same moment my mother appeared upon the threshold  but how am i to describe to you the peace and ravishment of that face  years seemed to have passed over her head during that brief ride and left her younger and fairer her eyes shone her smile went to my heart she seemed no more a woman but the angel of ecstatic tenderness  i ran to her in a kind of terror but she shrank a little back and laid her finger on her lips with something arch and yet unearthly  to the doctor on the contrary she reached out her hand as to a friend and helper and so strange was the scene that i forgot to be offended  ‘lucy’ said the doctor ‘all is prepared  will you go alone or shall your daughter follow us’  ‘let asenath come’ she answered ‘dear asenath  at this hour when i am purified of fear and sorrow and already survive myself and my affections it is for your sake and not for mine that i desire her presence  were she shut out dear friend it is to be feared she might misjudge your kindness’  ‘mother’ i cried wildly ‘mother what is this’  but my mother with her radiant smile said only ‘hush’ as though i were a child again and tossing in some feverfit and the doctor bade me be silent and trouble her no more  ‘you have made a choice’ he continued addressing my mother ‘that has often strangely tempted me  the two extremes all or else nothing never or this very hour upon the clock—these have been my incongruous desires  but to accept the middle term to be content with a halfgift to flicker awhile and to burn out—never for an hour never since i was born has satisfied the appetite of my ambition’  he looked upon my mother fixedly much of admiration and some touch of envy in his eyes then with a profound sigh he led the way into the inner room  it was very long  from end to end it was lit up by many lamps which by the changeful colour of their light and by the incessant snapping sounds with which they burned i have since divined to be electric  at the extreme end an open door gave us a glimpse into what must have been a leanto shed beside the chimney and this in strong contrast to the room was painted with a red reverberation as from furnacedoors  the walls were lined with books and glazed cases the tables crowded with the implements of chemical research great glass accumulators glittered in the light and through a hole in the gable near the shed door a heavy drivingbelt entered the apartment and ran overhead upon steel pulleys with clumsy activity and many ghostly and fluttering sounds  in one corner i perceived a chair resting upon crystal feet and curiously wreathed with wire  to this my mother advanced with a decisive swiftness  ‘is this it’ she asked  the doctor bowed in silence  ‘asenath’ said my mother ‘in this sad end of my life i have found one helper  look upon him it is doctor grierson  be not oh my daughter be not ungrateful to that friend’  she sate upon the chair and took in her hands the globes that terminated the arms  ‘am i right’ she asked and looked upon the doctor with such a radiancy of face that i trembled for her reason  once more the doctor bowed but this time leaning hard against the wall  he must have touched a spring the least shock agitated my mother where she sat the least passing jar appeared to cross her features and she sank back in the chair like one resigned to weariness  i was at her knees that moment but her hands fell loosely in my grasp her face still beatified with the same touching smile sank forward on her bosom her spirit had for ever fled  i do not know how long may have elapsed before raising for a moment my tearful face i met the doctor’s eyes  they rested upon mine with such a depth of scrutiny pity and interest that even from the freshness of my sorrow i was startled into attention  ‘enough’ he said ‘to lamentation  your mother went to death as to a bridal dying where her husband died  it is time asenath to think of the survivors  follow me to the next room’  i followed him like a person in a dream he made me sit by the fire he gave me wine to drink and then pacing the stone floor he thus began to address me—  ‘you are now my child alone in the world and under the immediate watch of brigham young  it would be your lot in ordinary circumstances to become the fiftieth bride of some ignoble elder or by particular fortune as fortune is counted in this land to find favour in the eyes of the president himself  such a fate for a girl like you were worse than death better to die as your mother died than to sink daily deeper in the mire of this pit of woman’s degradation  but is escape conceivable  your father tried and you beheld yourself with what security his jailers acted and how a dumb drawing on a rock was counted a sufficient sentry over the avenues of freedom  where your father failed will you be wiser or more fortunate or are you too helpless in the toils’  i had followed his words with changing emotion but now i believed i understood  ‘i see’ i cried ‘you judge me rightly  i must follow where my parents led and oh i am not only willing i am eager’  ‘no’ replied the doctor ‘not death for you  the flawed vessel we may break but not the perfect  no your mother cherished a different hope and so do i  i see’ he cried ‘the girl develop to the completed woman the plan reach fulfilment the promise—ay outdone  i could not bear to arrest so lively so comely a process  it was your mother’s thought’ he added with a change of tone ‘that i should marry you myself’  i fear i must have shown a perfect horror of aversion from this fate for he made haste to quiet me  ‘reassure yourself asenath’ he resumed  ‘old as i am i have not forgotten the tumultuous fancies of youth  i have passed my days indeed in laboratories but in all my vigils i have not forgotten the tune of a young pulse  age asks with timidity to be spared intolerable pain youth taking fortune by the beard demands joy like a right  these things i have not forgotten none rather has more keenly felt none more jealously considered them i have but postponed them to their day  see then you stand without support the only friend left to you this old investigator old in cunning young in sympathy  answer me but one question are you free from the entanglement of what the world calls love  do you still command your heart and purposes or are you fallen in some bondslavery of the eye and ear’  i answered him in broken words my heart i think i must have told him lay with my dead parents  ‘it is enough’ he said  ‘it has been my fate to be called on often too often for those services of which we spoke tonight none in utah could carry them so well to a conclusion hence there has fallen into my hands a certain share of influence which i now lay at your service partly for the sake of my dead friends your parents partly for the interest i bear you in your own right  i shall send you to england to the great city of london there to await the bridegroom i have selected  he shall be a son of mine a young man suitable in age and not grossly deficient in that quality of beauty that your years demand  since your heart is free you may well pledge me the sole promise that i ask in return for much expense and still more danger to await the arrival of that bridegroom with the delicacy of a wife’  i sat awhile stunned  the doctor’s marriages i remembered to have heard had been unfruitful and this added perplexity to my distress but i was alone as he had said alone in that dark land the thought of escape of any equal marriage was already enough to revive in me some dawn of hope and in what words i know not i accepted the proposal  he seemed more moved by my consent than i could reasonably have looked for  ‘you shall see’ he cried ‘you shall judge for yourself’  and hurrying to the next room he returned with a small portrait somewhat coarsely done in oils  it showed a man in the dress of nearly forty years before young indeed but still recognisable to be the doctor  ‘do you like it’ he asked  ‘that is myself when i was young  my—my boy will be like that like but nobler with such health as angels might condescend to envy and a man of mind asenath of commanding mind  that should be a man i think that should be one among ten thousand  a man like that—one to combine the passions of youth with the restraint the force the dignity of age—one to fill all the parts and faculties one to be man’s epitome—say will that not satisfy the needs of an ambitious girl  say is not that enough’  and as he held the picture close before my eyes his hands shook  i told him briefly i would ask no better for i was transpierced with this display of fatherly emotion but even as i said the words the most insolent revolt surged through my arteries  i held him in horror him his portrait and his son and had there been any choice but death or a mormon marriage i declare before heaven i had embraced it  ‘it is well’ he replied ‘and i had rightly counted on your spirit eat then for you have far to go’  so saying he set meat before me and while i was endeavouring to obey he left the room and returned with an armful of coarse raiment  ‘there’ said he ‘is your disguise  i leave you to your toilet’  the clothes had probably belonged to a somewhat lubberly boy of fifteen and they hung about me like a sack and cruelly hampered my movements but what filled me with uncontrollable shudderings was the problem of their origin and the fate of the lad to whom they had belonged  i had scarcely effected the exchange when the doctor returned opened a back window helped me out into the narrow space between the house and the overhanging bluffs and showed me a ladder of iron footholds mortised in the rock  ‘mount’ he said ‘swiftly  when you are at the summit walk so far as you are able in the shadow of the smoke  the smoke will bring you sooner or later to a canyon follow that down and you will find a man with two horses  him you will implicitly obey  and remember silence  that machinery which i now put in motion for your service may by one word be turned against you  go heaven prosper you’  the ascent was easy  arrived at the top of the cliff i saw before me on the other side a vast and gradual declivity of stone lying bare to the moon and the surrounding mountains  nowhere was any vantage or concealment and knowing how these deserts were beset with spies i made haste to veil my movements under the blowing trail of smoke  sometimes it swam high rising on the night wind and i had no more substantial curtain than its moonthrown shadow sometimes again it crawled upon the earth and i would walk in it no higher than to my shoulders like some mountain fog  but one way or another the smoke of that illomened furnace protected the first steps of my escape and led me unobserved to the canyon  there sure enough i found a taciturn and sombre man beside a pair of saddlehorses and thenceforward all night long we wandered in silence by the most occult and dangerous paths among the mountains  a little before the dayspring we took refuge in a wet and gusty cavern at the bottom of a gorge lay there all day concealed and the next night before the glow had faded out of the west resumed our wanderings  about noon we stopped again in a lawn upon a little river where was a screen of bushes and here my guide handing me a bundle from his pack bade me change my dress once more  the bundle contained clothing of my own taken from our house with such necessaries as a comb and soap  i made my toilet by the mirror of a quiet pool and as i was so doing and smiling with some complacency to see myself restored to my own image the mountains rang with a scream of far more than human piercingness and while i still stood astonished there sprang up and swiftly increased a storm of the most awful and earthrending sounds  shall i own to you that i fell upon my face and shrieked  and yet this was but the overland train winding among the near mountains the very means of my salvation the strong wings that were to carry me from utah  when i was dressed the guide gave me a bag which contained he said both money and papers and telling me that i was already over the borders in the territory of wyoming bade me follow the stream until i reached the railway station half a mile below  ‘here’ he added ‘is your ticket as far as council bluffs  the east express will pass in a few hours’  with that he took both horses and without further words or any salutation rode off by the way that we had come  three hours afterwards i was seated on the end platform of the train as it swept eastward through the gorges and thundered in tunnels of the mountain  the change of scene the sense of escape the still throbbing terror of pursuit—above all the astounding magic of my new conveyance kept me from any logical or melancholy thought  i had gone to the doctor’s house two nights before prepared to die prepared for worse than death what had passed terrible although it was looked almost bright compared to my anticipations and it was not till i had slept a full night in the flying palace car that i awoke to the sense of my irreparable loss and to some reasonable alarm about the future  in this mood i examined the contents of the bag  it was well supplied with gold it contained tickets and complete directions for my journey as far as liverpool and a long letter from the doctor supplying me with a fictitious name and story recommending the most guarded silence and bidding me to await faithfully the coming of his son  all then had been arranged beforehand he had counted upon my consent and what was tenfold worse upon my mother’s voluntary death  my horror of my only friend my aversion for this son who was to marry me my revolt against the whole current and conditions of my life were now complete  i was sitting stupefied by my distress and helplessness when to my joy a very pleasant lady offered me her conversation  i clutched at the relief and i was soon glibly telling her the story in the doctor’s letter how i was a miss gould of nevada city going to england to an uncle what money i had what family my age and so forth until i had exhausted my instructions and as the lady still continued to ply me with questions began to embroider on my own account  this soon carried one of my inexperience beyond her depth and i had already remarked a shadow on the lady’s face when a gentleman drew near and very civilly addressed me  ‘miss gould i believe’ said he and then excusing himself to the lady by the authority of my guardian drew me to the fore platform of the pullman car  ‘miss gould’ he said in my ear ‘is it possible that you suppose yourself in safety  let me completely undeceive you  one more such indiscretion and you return to utah  and in the meanwhile if this woman should again address you you are to reply with these words “madam i do not like you and i will be obliged if you will suffer me to choose my own associates”’  alas i had to do as i was bid this lady to whom i already felt myself drawn with the strongest cords of sympathy i dismissed with insult and thenceforward through all that day i sat in silence gazing on the bare plains and swallowing my tears  let that suffice it was the pattern of my journey  whether on the train at the hotels or on board the ocean steamer i never exchanged a friendly word with any fellowtraveller but i was certain to be interrupted  in every place on every side the most unlikely persons man or woman rich or poor became protectors to forward me upon my journey or spies to observe and regulate my conduct thus i crossed the states thus passed the ocean the mormon eye still following my movements and when at length a cab had set me down before that london lodginghouse from which you saw me flee this morning i had already ceased to struggle and ceased to hope  the landlady like every one else through all that journey was expecting my arrival  a fire was lighted in my room which looked upon the garden there were books on the table clothes in the drawers and there i had almost said with contentment and certainly with resignation i saw month follow month over my head  at times my landlady took me for a walk or an excursion but she would never suffer me to leave the house alone and i seeing that she also lived under the shadow of that widespread mormon terror felt too much pity to resist  to the child born on mormon soil as to the man who accepts the engagements of a secret order no escape is possible so i had clearly read and i was thankful even for this respite  meanwhile i tried honestly to prepare my mind for my approaching nuptials  the day drew near when my bridegroom was to visit me and gratitude and fear alike obliged me to consent  a son of doctor grierson’s be he what he pleased must still be young and it was even probable he should be handsome on more than that i felt i dared not reckon and in moulding my mind towards consent i dwelt the more carefully on these physical attractions which i felt i might expect and averted my eyes from moral or intellectual considerations  we have a great power upon our spirits and as time passed i worked myself into a frame of acquiescence nay and i began to grow impatient for the hour at night sleep forsook me i sat all day by the fire absorbed in dreams conjuring up the features of my husband and anticipating in fancy the touch of his hand and the sound of his voice  in the dead level and solitude of my existence this was the one eastern window and the one door of hope  at last i had so cultivated and prepared my will that i began to be besieged with fears upon the other side  how if it was i that did not please  how if this unseen lover should turn from me with disaffection  and now i spent hours before the glass studying and judging my attractions and was never weary of changing my dress or ordering my hair  when the day came i was long about my toilet but at last with a sort of hopeful desperation i had to own that i could do no more and must now stand or fall by nature  my occupation ended i fell a prey to the most sickening impatience mingled with alarms giving ear to the swelling rumour of the streets and at each change of sound or silence starting shrinking and colouring to the brow  love is not to be prepared i know without some knowledge of the object and yet when the cab at last rattled to the door and i heard my visitor mount the stairs such was the tumult of hopes in my poor bosom that love itself might have been proud to own their parentage  the door opened and it was doctor grierson that appeared  i believe i must have screamed aloud and i know at least that i fell fainting to the floor  when i came to myself he was standing over me counting my pulse  ‘i have startled you’ he said  ‘a difficulty unforeseen—the impossibility of obtaining a certain drug in its full purity—has forced me to resort to london unprepared  i regret that i should have shown myself once more without those poor attractions which are much perhaps to you but to me are no more considerable than rain that falls into the sea  youth is but a state as passing as that syncope from which you are but just awakened and if there be truth in science as easy to recall for i find asenath that i must now take you for my confidant  since my first years i have devoted every hour and act of life to one ambitious task and the time of my success is at hand  in these new countries where i was so long content to stay i collected indispensable ingredients i have fortified myself on every side from the possibility of error what was a dream now takes the substance of reality and when i offered you a son of mine i did so in a figure  that son—that husband asenath is myself—not as you now behold me but restored to the first energy of youth  you think me mad  it is the customary attitude of ignorance  i will not argue i will leave facts to speak  when you behold me purified invigorated renewed restamped in the original image—when you recognise in me what i shall be the first perfect expression of the powers of mankind—i shall be able to laugh with a better grace at your passing and natural incredulity  to what can you aspire—fame riches power the charm of youth the dearbought wisdom of age—that i shall not be able to afford you in perfection  do not deceive yourself  i already excel you in every human gift but one when that gift also has been restored to me you will recognise your master’  hereupon consulting his watch he told me he must now leave me to myself and bidding me consult reason and not girlish fancies he withdrew  i had not the courage to move the night fell and found me still where he had laid me during my faint my face buried in my hands my soul drowned in the darkest apprehensions  late in the evening he returned carrying a candle and with a certain irritable tremor bade me rise and sup  ‘is it possible’ he added ‘that i have been deceived in your courage  a cowardly girl is no fit mate for me’  i flung myself before him on my knees and with floods of tears besought him to release me from this engagement assuring him that my cowardice was abject and that in every point of intellect and character i was his hopeless and derisible inferior  ‘why certainly’ he replied  ‘i know you better than yourself and i am well enough acquainted with human nature to understand this scene  it is addressed to me’ he added with a smile ‘in my character of the still untransformed  but do not alarm yourself about the future  let me but attain my end and not you only asenath but every woman on the face of the earth becomes my willing slave’  thereupon he obliged me to rise and eat sat down with me to table helped and entertained me with the attentions of a fashionable host and it was not till a late hour that bidding me courteously goodnight he once more left me alone to my misery  in all this talk of an elixir and the restoration of his youth i scarce knew from which hypothesis i should the more eagerly recoil  if his hopes reposed on any base of fact if indeed by some abhorrent miracle he should discard his age death were my only refuge from that most unnatural that most ungodly union  if on the other hand these dreams were merely lunatic the madness of a life waxed suddenly acute my pity would become a load almost as heavy to bear as my revolt against the marriage  so passed the night in alternations of rebellion and despair of hate and pity and with the next morning i was only to comprehend more fully my enslaved position  for though he appeared with a very tranquil countenance he had no sooner observed the marks of grief upon my brow than an answering darkness gathered on his own  ‘asenath’ he said ‘you owe me much already with one finger i still hold you suspended over death my life is full of labour and anxiety and i choose’ said he with a remarkable accent of command ‘that you shall greet me with a pleasant face’  he never needed to repeat the recommendation from that day forward i was always ready to receive him with apparent cheerfulness and he rewarded me with a good deal of his company and almost more than i could bear of his confidence  he had set up a laboratory in the back part of the house where he toiled day and night at his elixir and he would come thence to visit me in my parlour now with passing humours of discouragement now and far more often radiant with hope  it was impossible to see so much of him and not to recognise that the sands of his life were running low and yet all the time he would be laying out vast fields of future and planning with all the confidence of youth the most unbounded schemes of pleasure and ambition  how i replied i know not but i found a voice and words to answer even while i wept and raged to hear him  a week ago the doctor entered my room with the marks of great exhilaration contending with pitiful bodily weakness  ‘asenath’ said he ‘i have now obtained the last ingredient  in one week from now the perilous moment of the last projection will draw nigh  you have once before assisted although unconsciously at the failure of a similar experiment  it was the elixir which so terribly exploded one night when you were passing my house and it is idle to deny that the conduct of so delicate a process among the million jars and trepidations of so great a city presents a certain element of danger  from this point of view i cannot but regret the perfect stillness of my house among the deserts but on the other hand i have succeeded in proving that the singularly unstable equilibrium of the elixir at the moment of projection is due rather to the impurity than to the nature of the ingredients and as all are now of an equal and exquisite nicety i have little fear for the result  in a week then from today my dear asenath this period of trial will be ended’  and he smiled upon me in a manner unusually paternal  i smiled back with my lips but at my heart there raged the blackest and most unbridled terror  what if he failed  and oh tenfold worse what if he succeeded  what detested and unnatural changeling would appear before me to claim my hand  and could there i asked myself with a dreadful sinking be any truth in his boasts of an assured victory over my reluctance  i knew him indeed to be masterful to lead my life at a sign  suppose then this experiment to succeed suppose him to return to me hideously restored like a vampire in a legend and suppose that by some devilish fascination    my head turned all former fears deserted me and i felt i could embrace the worst in preference to this  my mind was instantly made up  the doctor’s presence in london was justified by the affairs of the mormon polity  often in our conversation he would gloat over the details of that great organisation which he feared even while yet he wielded it and would remind me that even in the humming labyrinth of london we were still visible to that unsleeping eye in utah  his visitors indeed who were of every sort from the missionary to the destroying angel and seemed to belong to every rank of life had up to that moment filled me with unmixed repulsion and alarm  i knew that if my secret were to reach the ear of any leader my fate were sealed beyond redemption and yet in my present pass of horror and despair it was to these very men that i turned for help  i waylaid upon the stair one of the mormon missionaries a man of a low class but not inaccessible to pity told him i scarce remember what elaborate fable to explain my application and by his intermediacy entered into correspondence with my father’s family  they recognised my claim for help and on this very day i was to begin my escape  last night i sat up fully dressed awaiting the result of the doctor’s labours and prepared against the worst  the nights at this season and in this northern latitude are short and i had soon the company of the returning daylight  the silence in and around the house was only broken by the movements of the doctor in the laboratory to these i listened watch in hand awaiting the hour of my escape and yet consumed by anxiety about the strange experiment that was going forward overhead indeed now that i was conscious of some protection for myself my sympathies had turned more directly to the doctor’s side i caught myself even praying for his success and when some hours ago a low peculiar cry reached my ears from the laboratory i could no longer control my impatience but mounted the stairs and opened the door  the doctor was standing in the middle of the room in his hand a large roundbellied crystal flask some three parts full of a bright ambercoloured liquid on his face a rapture of gratitude and joy unspeakable  as he saw me he raised the flask at arm’s length ‘victory’ he cried  ‘victory asenath’  and then—whether the flask escaped his trembling fingers or whether the explosion were spontaneous i cannot tell—enough that we were thrown i against the doorpost the doctor into the corner of the room enough that we were shaken to the soul by the same explosion that must have startled you upon the street and that in the brief space of an indistinguishable instant there remained nothing of the labours of the doctor’s lifetime but a few shards of broken crystal and those voluminous and illsmelling vapours that pursued me in my flight     the squire of dames concluded   what with the lady’s animated manner and dramatic conduct of her voice challoner had thrilled to every incident with genuine emotion  his fancy which was not perhaps of a very lively character applauded both the matter and the style but the more judicial functions of his mind refused assent  it was an excellent story and it might be true but he believed it was not  miss fonblanque was a lady and it was doubtless possible for a lady to wander from the truth but how was a gentleman to tell her so  his spirits for some time had been sinking but they now fell to zero and long after her voice had died away he still sat with a troubled and averted countenance and could find no form of words to thank her for her narrative  his mind indeed was empty of everything beyond a dull longing for escape  from this pause which grew the more embarrassing with every second he was roused by the sudden laughter of the lady  his vanity was alarmed he turned and faced her their eyes met and he caught from hers a spark of such frank merriment as put him instantly at ease  ‘you certainly’ he said ‘appear to bear your calamities with excellent spirit’  ‘do i not’ she cried and fell once more into delicious laughter  but from this access she more speedily recovered  ‘this is all very well’ said she nodding at him gravely ‘but i am still in a most distressing situation from which if you deny me your help i shall find it difficult indeed to free myself’  at this mention of help challoner fell back to his original gloom  ‘my sympathies are much engaged with you’ he said ‘and i should be delighted i am sure  but our position is most unusual and circumstances over which i have i can assure you no control deprive me of the power—the pleasure—unless indeed’ he added somewhat brightening at the thought ‘i were to recommend you to the care of the police’  she laid her hand upon his arm and looked hard into his eyes and he saw with wonder that for the first time since the moment of their meeting every trace of colour had faded from her cheek  ‘do so’ she said ‘and—weigh my words well—you kill me as certainly as with a knife’  ‘god bless me’ exclaimed challoner  ‘oh’ she cried ‘i can see you disbelieve my story and make light of the perils that surround me but who are you to judge  my family share my apprehensions they help me in secret and you saw yourself by what an emissary and in what a place they have chosen to supply me with the funds for my escape  i admit that you are brave and clever and have impressed me most favourably but how are you to prefer your opinion before that of my uncle an exminister of state a man with the ear of the queen and of a long political experience  if i am mad is he  and you must allow me besides a special claim upon your help  strange as you may think my story you know that much of it is true and if you who heard the explosion and saw the mormon at victoria refuse to credit and assist me to whom am i to turn’  ‘he gave you money then’ asked challoner who had been dwelling singly on that fact  ‘i begin to interest you’ she cried  ‘but frankly you are condemned to help me  if the service i had to ask of you were serious were suspicious were even unusual i should say no more  but what is it  to take a pleasure trip for which if you will suffer me i propose to pay and to carry from one lady to another a sum of money  what can be more simple’  ‘is the sum’ asked challoner ‘considerable’  she produced a packet from her bosom and observing that she had not yet found time to make the count tore open the cover and spread upon her knees a considerable number of bank of england notes  it took some time to make the reckoning for the notes were of every degree of value but at last and counting a few loose sovereigns she made out the sum to be a little under £710 sterling  the sight of so much money worked an immediate revolution in the mind of challoner  ‘and you propose madam’ he cried ‘to intrust that money to a perfect stranger’  ‘ah’ said she with a charming smile ‘but i no longer regard you as a stranger’  ‘madam’ said challoner ‘i perceive i must make you a confession although of a very good family—through my mother indeed a lineal descendant of the patriot bruce—i dare not conceal from you that my affairs are deeply very deeply involved  i am in debt my pockets are practically empty and in short i am fallen to that state when a considerable sum of money would prove to many men an irresistible temptation’  ‘do you not see’ returned the young lady ‘that by these words you have removed my last hesitation  take them’  and she thrust the notes into the young man’s hand  he sat so long holding them like a baby at the font that miss fonblanque once more bubbled into laughter  ‘pray’ she said ‘hesitate no further put them in your pocket and to relieve our position of any shadow of embarrassment tell me by what name i am to address my knighterrant for i find myself reduced to the awkwardness of the pronoun’  had borrowing been in question the wisdom of our ancestors had come lightly to the young man’s aid but upon what pretext could he refuse so generous a trust  upon none he saw that was not unpardonably wounding and the bright eyes and the high spirits of his companion had already made a breach in the rampart of challoner’s caution  the whole thing he reasoned might be a mere mystification which it were the height of solemn folly to resent  on the other hand the explosion the interview at the publichouse and the very money in his hands seemed to prove beyond denial the existence of some serious danger and if that were so could he desert her  there was a choice of risks the risk of behaving with extraordinary incivility and unhandsomeness to a lady and the risk of going on a fool’s errand  the story seemed false but then the money was undeniable  the whole circumstances were questionable and obscure but the lady was charming and had the speech and manners of society while he still hung in the wind a recollection returned upon his mind with some of the dignity of prophecy  had he not promised somerset to break with the traditions of the commonplace and to accept the first adventure offered  well here was the adventure  he thrust the money into his pocket  ‘my name is challoner’ said he  ‘mr challoner’ she replied ‘you have come very generously to my aid when all was against me  though i am myself a very humble person my family commands great interest and i do not think you will repent this handsome action’  challoner flushed with pleasure  ‘i imagine that perhaps a consulship’ she added her eyes dwelling on him with a judicial admiration ‘a consulship in some great town or capital—or else—but we waste time let us set about the work of my delivery’  she took his arm with a frank confidence that went to his heart and once more laying by all serious thoughts she entertained him as they crossed the park with her agreeable gaiety of mind  near the marble arch they found a hansom which rapidly conveyed them to the terminus at euston square and here in the hotel they sat down to an excellent breakfast the young lady’s first step was to call for writing materials and write upon one corner of the table a hasty note still as she did so glancing with smiles at her companion  ‘here’ said she ‘here is the letter which will introduce you to my cousin’  she began to fold the paper  ‘my cousin although i have never seen her has the character of a very charming woman and a recognised beauty of that i know nothing but at least she has been very kind to me so has my lord her father so have you—kinder than all—kinder than i can bear to think of’  she said this with unusual emotion and at the same time sealed the envelope ‘ah’ she cried ‘i have shut my letter  it is not quite courteous and yet as between friends it is perhaps better so  i introduce you after all into a family secret and though you and i are already old comrades you are still unknown to my uncle  you go then to this address richard street glasgow go please as soon as you arrive and give this letter with your own hands into those of miss fonblanque for that is the name by which she is to pass  when we next meet you will tell me what you think of her’ she added with a touch of the provocative  ‘ah’ said challoner almost tenderly ‘she can be nothing to me’  ‘you do not know’ replied the young lady with a sigh  ‘bythebye i had forgotten—it is very childish and i am almost ashamed to mention it—but when you see miss fonblanque you will have to make yourself a little ridiculous and i am sure the part in no way suits you  we had agreed upon a watchword  you will have to address an earl’s daughter in these words “nigger nigger never die” but reassure yourself’ she added laughing ‘for the fair patrician will at once finish the quotation  come now say your lesson’  ‘“nigger nigger never die”’ repeated challoner with undisguised reluctance  miss fonblanque went into fits of laughter  ‘excellent’ said she ‘it will be the most humorous scene’  and she laughed again  ‘and what will be the counterword’ asked challoner stiffly  ‘i will not tell you till the last moment’ said she ‘for i perceive you are growing too imperious’  breakfast over she accompanied the young man to the platform bought him the graphic the athenæum and a papercutter and stood on the step conversing till the whistle sounded  then she put her head into the carriage  ‘black face and shining eye’ she whispered and instantly leaped down upon the platform with a thrill of gay and musical laughter as the train steamed out of the great arch of glass the sound of that laughter still rang in the young man’s ears  challoner’s position was too unusual to be long welcome to his mind  he found himself projected the whole length of england on a mission beset with obscure and ridiculous circumstances and yet by the trust he had accepted irrevocably bound to persevere  how easy it appeared in the retrospect to have refused the whole proposal returned the money and gone forth again upon his own affairs a free and happy man  and it was now impossible the enchantress who had held him with her eye had now disappeared taking his honour in pledge and as she had failed to leave him an address he was denied even the inglorious safety of retreat  to use the paperknife or even to read the periodicals with which she had presented him was to renew the bitterness of his remorse and as he was alone in the compartment he passed the day staring at the landscape in impotent repentance and long before he was landed on the platform of st enoch’s had fallen to the lowest and coldest zones of selfcontempt  as he was hungry and elegant in his habits he would have preferred to dine and to remove the stains of travel but the words of the young lady and his own impatient eagerness would suffer no delay  in the late luminous and lampstarred dusk of the summer evening he accordingly set forward with brisk steps  the street to which he was directed had first seen the day in the character of a row of small suburban villas on a hillside but the extension of the city had long since and on every hand surrounded it with miles of streets  from the top of the hill a range of very tall buildings densely inhabited by the poorest classes of the population and variegated by dryingpoles from every second window overplumbed the villas and their little gardens like a seaboard cliff  but still under the grime of years of city smoke these antiquated cottages with their venetian blinds and rural porticoes retained a somewhat melancholy savour of the past  the street when challoner entered it was perfectly deserted  from hard by indeed the sound of a thousand footfalls filled the ear but in richard street itself there was neither light nor sound of human habitation  the appearance of the neighbourhood weighed heavily on the mind of the young man once more as in the streets of london he was impressed with the sense of city deserts and as he approached the number indicated and somewhat falteringly rang the bell his heart sank within him  the bell was ancient like the house it had a thin and garrulous note and it was some time before it ceased to sound from the rear quarters of the building  following upon this an inner door was stealthily opened and careful and catlike steps drew near along the hall  challoner supposing he was to be instantly admitted produced his letter and as well as he was able prepared a smiling face  to his indescribable surprise however the footsteps ceased and then after a pause and with the like stealthiness withdrew once more and died away in the interior of the house  a second time the young man rang violently at the bell a second time to his keen hearkening a certain bustle of discreet footing moved upon the hollow boards of the old villa and again the fainthearted garrison only drew near to retreat  the cup of the visitor’s endurance was now full to overflowing and committing the whole family of fonblanque to every mood and shade of condemnation he turned upon his heel and redescended the steps  perhaps the mover in the house was watching from a window and plucked up courage at the sight of this desistance or perhaps where he lurked trembling in the back parts of the villa reason in its own right had conquered his alarms  challoner at least had scarce set foot upon the pavement when he was arrested by the sound of the withdrawal of an inner bolt one followed another rattling in their sockets the key turned harshly in the lock the door opened and there appeared upon the threshold a man of a very stalwart figure in his shirt sleeves  he was a person neither of great manly beauty nor of a refined exterior he was not the man in ordinary moods to attract the eyes of the observer but as he now stood in the doorway he was marked so legibly with the extreme passion of terror that challoner stood wonderstruck  for a fraction of a minute they gazed upon each other in silence and then the man of the house with ashen lips and gasping voice inquired the business of his visitor  challoner replied in tones from which he strove to banish his surprise that he was the bearer of a letter to a certain miss fonblanque  at this name as at a talisman the man fell back and impatiently invited him to enter and no sooner had the adventurer crossed the threshold than the door was closed behind him and his retreat cut off  it was already long past eight at night and though the late twilight of the north still lingered in the streets in the passage it was already groping dark  the man led challoner directly to a parlour looking on the garden to the back  here he had apparently been supping for by the light of a tallow dip the table was seen to be covered with a napkin and set out with a quart of bottled ale and the heel of a gouda cheese  the room on the other hand was furnished with faded solidity and the walls were lined with scholarly and costly volumes in glazed cases  the house must have been taken furnished for it had no congruity with this man of the shirt sleeves and the mean supper  as for the earl’s daughter the earl and the visionary consulships in foreign cities they had long ago begun to fade in challoner’s imagination  like doctor grierson and the mormon angels they were plainly woven of the stuff of dreams  not an illusion remained to the knighterrant not a hope was left him but to be speedily relieved from this disreputable business  the man had continued to regard his visitor with undisguised anxiety and began once more to press him for his errand  ‘i am here’ said challoner ‘simply to do a service between two ladies and i must ask you without further delay to summon miss fonblanque into whose hands alone i am authorised to deliver the letter that i bear’  a growing wonder began to mingle on the man’s face with the lines of solicitude  ‘i am miss fonblanque’ he said and then perceiving the effect of this communication ‘good god’ he cried ‘what are you staring at  i tell you i am miss fonblanque’  seeing the speaker wore a chinbeard of considerable length and the remainder of his face was blue with shaving challoner could only suppose himself the subject of a jest  he was no longer under the spell of the young lady’s presence and with men and above all with his inferiors he was capable of some display of spirit  ‘sir’ said he pretty roundly ‘i have put myself to great inconvenience for persons of whom i know too little and i begin to be weary of the business  either you shall immediately summon miss fonblanque or i leave this house and put myself under the direction of the police’  ‘this is horrible’ exclaimed the man  ‘i declare before heaven i am the person meant but how shall i convince you  it must have been clara i perceive that sent you on this errand—a madwoman who jests with the most deadly interests and here we are incapable perhaps of an agreement and heaven knows what may depend on our delay’  he spoke with a really startling earnestness and at the same time there flashed upon the mind of challoner the ridiculous jingle which was to serve as password  ‘this may perhaps assist you’ he said and then with some embarrassment ‘“nigger nigger never die”’  a light of relief broke upon the troubled countenance of the man with the chinbeard  ‘“black face and shining eye”—give me the letter’ he panted in one gasp  ‘well’ said challoner though still with some reluctance ‘i suppose i must regard you as the proper recipient and though i may justly complain of the spirit in which i have been treated i am only too glad to be done with all responsibility  here it is’ and he produced the envelope  the man leaped upon it like a beast and with hands that trembled in a manner painful to behold tore it open and unfolded the letter  as he read terror seemed to mount upon him to the pitch of nightmare  he struck one hand upon his brow while with the other as if unconsciously he crumpled the paper to a ball  ‘my gracious powers’ he cried and then dashing to the window which stood open on the garden he clapped forth his head and shoulders and whistled long and shrill  challoner fell back into a corner and resolutely grasping his staff prepared for the most desperate events but the thoughts of the man with the chinbeard were far removed from violence  turning again into the room and once more beholding his visitor whom he appeared to have forgotten he fairly danced with trepidation  ‘impossible’ he cried  ‘oh quite impossible  o lord i have lost my head’  and then once more striking his hand upon his brow ‘the money’ he exclaimed  ‘give me the money’  ‘my good friend’ replied challoner ‘this is a very painful exhibition and until i see you reasonably master of yourself i decline to proceed with any business’  ‘you are quite right’ said the man  ‘i am of a very nervous habit a long course of the dumb ague has undermined my constitution  but i know you have money it may be still the saving of me and oh dear young gentleman in pity’s name be expeditious’  challoner sincerely uneasy as he was could scarce refrain from laughter but he was himself in a hurry to be gone and without more delay produced the money  ‘you will find the sum i trust correct’ he observed ‘and let me ask you to give me a receipt’  but the man heeded him not  he seized the money and disregarding the sovereigns that rolled loose upon the floor thrust the bundle of notes into his pocket  ‘a receipt’ repeated challoner with some asperity  ‘i insist on a receipt’  ‘receipt’ repeated the man a little wildly  ‘a receipt  immediately await me here’  challoner in reply begged the gentleman to lose no unnecessary time as he was himself desirous of catching a particular train  ‘ah by god and so am i’ exclaimed the man with the chinbeard and with that he was gone out of the room and had rattled upstairs four at a time to the upper story of the villa  ‘this is certainly a most amazing business’ thought challoner ‘certainly a most disquieting affair and i cannot conceal from myself that i have become mixed up with either lunatics or malefactors  i may truly thank my stars that i am so nearly and so creditably done with it’ thus thinking and perhaps remembering the episode of the whistle he turned to the open window  the garden was still faintly clear he could distinguish the stairs and terraces with which the small domain had been adorned by former owners and the blackened bushes and dead trees that had once afforded shelter to the country birds beyond these he saw the strong retaining wall some thirty feet in height which enclosed the garden to the back and again above that the pile of dingy buildings rearing its frontage high into the night  a peculiar object lying stretched upon the lawn for some time baffled his eyesight but at length he had made it out to be a long ladder or series of ladders bound into one and he was still wondering of what service so great an instrument could be in such a scant enclosure when he was recalled to himself by the noise of some one running violently down the stairs  this was followed by the sudden clamorous banging of the house door and that again by rapid and retreating footsteps in the street  challoner sprang into the passage  he ran from room to room upstairs and downstairs and in that old dingy and wormeaten house he found himself alone  only in one apartment looking to the front were there any traces of the late inhabitant a bed that had been recently slept in and not made a chest of drawers disordered by a hasty search and on the floor a roll of crumpled paper  this he picked up  the light in this upper story looking to the front was considerably brighter than in the parlour and he was able to make out that the paper bore the mark of the hotel at euston and even by peering closely to decipher the following lines in a very elegant and careful female hand      ‘dear m‘guire—it is certain your retreat is known  we have just had     another failure clockwork thirty hours too soon with the usual     humiliating result  zero is quite disheartened  we are all     scattered and i could find no one but the solemn ass who brings     you this and the money  i would love to see your meeting—ever     yours                                                               shining eye’  challoner was stricken to the heart  he perceived by what facility by what unmanly fear of ridicule he had been brought down to be the gull of this intriguer and his wrath flowed forth in almost equal measure against himself against the woman and against somerset whose idle counsels had impelled him to embark on that adventure  at the same time a great and troubled curiosity and a certain chill of fear possessed his spirit  the conduct of the man with the chinbeard the terms of the letter and the explosion of the early morning fitted together like parts in some obscure and mischievous imbroglio  evil was certainly afoot evil secrecy terror and falsehood were the conditions and the passions of the people among whom he had begun to move like a blind puppet and he who began as a puppet his experience told him was often doomed to perish as a victim  from the stupor of deep thought into which he had glided with the letter in his hand he was awakened by the clatter of the bell  he glanced from the window and conceive his horror and surprise when he beheld clustered on the steps in the front garden and on the pavement of the street a formidable posse of police  he started to the full possession of his powers and courage  escape and escape at any cost was the one idea that possessed him  swiftly and silently he redescended the creaking stairs he was already in the passage when a second and more imperious summons from the door awoke the echoes of the empty house nor had the bell ceased to jangle before he had bestridden the windowsill of the parlour and was lowering himself into the garden  his coat was hooked upon the iron flowerbasket for a moment he hung dependent heels and head below and then with the noise of rending cloth and followed by several pots he dropped upon the sod  once more the bell was rung and now with furious and repeated peals  the desperate challoner turned his eyes on every side  they fell upon the ladder and he ran to it and with strenuous but unavailing effort sought to raise it from the ground suddenly the weight which was thus resisting his whole strength began to lighten in his hands the ladder like a thing of life reared its bulk from off the sod and challoner leaping back with a cry of almost superstitious terror beheld the whole structure mount foot by foot against the face of the retaining wall  at the same time two heads were dimly visible above the parapet and he was hailed by a guarded whistle something in its modulation recalled like an echo the whistle of the man with the chinbeard  had he chanced upon a means of escape prepared beforehand by those very miscreants whose messenger and gull he had become  was this indeed a means of safety or but the startingpoint of further complication and disaster  he paused not to reflect  scarce was the ladder reared to its full length than he had sprung already on the rounds hand over hand swift as an ape he scaled the tottering stairway  strong arms received embraced and helped him he was lifted and set once more upon the earth and with the spasm of his alarm yet unsubsided found himself in the company of two roughlooking men in the paved back yard of one of the tall houses that crowned the summit of the hill  meanwhile from below the note of the bell had been succeeded by the sound of vigorous and redoubling blows  ‘are you all out’ asked one of his companions and as soon as he had babbled an answer in the affirmative the rope was cut from the top round and the ladder thrust roughly back into the garden where it fell and broke with clattering reverberations  its fall was hailed with many broken cries for the whole of richard street was now in high emotion the people crowding to the windows or clambering on the garden walls the same man who had already addressed challoner seized him by the arm whisked him through the basement of the house and across the street upon the other side and before the unfortunate adventurer had time to realise his situation a door was opened and he was thrust into a low and dark compartment  ‘bedad’ observed his guide ‘there was no time to lose  is m’guire gone or was it you that whistled  ‘m’guire is gone’ said challoner  the guide now struck a light  ‘ah’ said he ‘this will never do  you dare not go upon the streets in such a figure  wait quietly here and i will bring you something decent’  with that the man was gone and challoner his attention thus rudely awakened began ruefully to consider the havoc that had been worked in his attire  his hat was gone his trousers were cruelly ripped and the best part of one tail of his very elegant frockcoat had been left hanging from the iron crockets of the window  he had scarce had time to measure these disasters when his host reentered the apartment and proceeded without a word to envelop the refined and urbane challoner in a long ulster of the cheapest material and of a pattern so gross and vulgar that his spirit sickened at the sight  this calumnious disguise was crowned and completed by a soft felt hat of the tyrolese design and several sizes too small  at another moment challoner would simply have refused to issue forth upon the world thus travestied but the desire to escape from glasgow was now too strongly and too exclusively impressed upon his mind  with one haggard glance at the spotted tails of his new coat he inquired what was to pay for this accoutrement  the man assured him that the whole expense was easily met from funds in his possession and begged him instead of wasting time to make his best speed out of the neighbourhood  the young man was not loath to take the hint  true to his usual courtesy he thanked the speaker and complimented him upon his taste in greatcoats and leaving the man somewhat abashed by these remarks and the manner of their delivery he hurried forth into the lamplit city  the last train was gone ere after many deviations he had reached the terminus  attired as he was he dared not present himself at any reputable inn and he felt keenly that the unassuming dignity of his demeanour would serve to attract attention perhaps mirth and possibly suspicion in any humbler hostelry  he was thus condemned to pass the solemn and uneventful hours of a whole night in pacing the streets of glasgow supperless a figure of fun for all beholders waiting the dawn with hope indeed but with unconquerable shrinkings and above all things filled with a profound sense of the folly and weakness of his conduct  it may be conceived with what curses he assailed the memory of the fair narrator of hyde park her parting laughter rang in his ears all night with damning mockery and iteration and when he could spare a thought from this chief artificer of his confusion it was to expend his wrath on somerset and the career of the amateur detective  with the coming of day he found in a shy milkshop the means to appease his hunger  there were still many hours to wait before the departure of the south express these he passed wandering with indescribable fatigue in the obscurer bystreets of the city and at length slipped quietly into the station and took his place in the darkest corner of a thirdclass carriage  here all day long he jolted on the bare boards distressed by heat and continually reawakened from uneasy slumbers  by the half return ticket in his purse he was entitled to make the journey on the easy cushions and with the ample space of the firstclass but alas in his absurd attire he durst not for decency commingle with his equals and this small annoyance coming last in such a series of disasters cut him to the heart  that night when in his putney lodging he reviewed the expense anxiety and weariness of his adventure when he beheld the ruins of his last good trousers and his last presentable coat and above all when his eye by any chance alighted on the tyrolese hat or the degrading ulster his heart would overflow with bitterness and it was only by a serious call on his philosophy that he maintained the dignity of his demeanour     somerset’s adventure   the superfluous mansion   mr paul somerset was a young gentleman of a lively and fiery imagination with very small capacity for action  he was one who lived exclusively in dreams and in the future the creature of his own theories and an actor in his own romances  from the cigar divan he proceeded to parade the streets still heated with the fire of his eloquence and scouting upon every side for the offer of some fortunate adventure  in the continual stream of passersby on the sealed fronts of houses on the posters that covered the hoardings and in every lineament and throb of the great city he saw a mysterious and hopeful hieroglyph  but although the elements of adventure were streaming by him as thick as drops of water in the thames it was in vain that now with a beseeching now with something of a braggadocio air he courted and provoked the notice of the passengers in vain that putting fortune to the touch he even thrust himself into the way and came into direct collision with those of the more promising demeanour  persons brimful of secrets persons pining for affection persons perishing for lack of help or counsel he was sure he could perceive on every side but by some contrariety of fortune each passed upon his way without remarking the young gentleman and went farther surely to fare worse in quest of the confidant the friend or the adviser  to thousands he must have turned an appealing countenance and yet not one regarded him  a light dinner eaten to the accompaniment of his impetuous aspirations broke in upon the series of his attempts on fortune and when he returned to the task the lamps were already lighted and the nocturnal crowd was dense upon the pavement  before a certain restaurant whose name will readily occur to any student of our babylon people were already packed so closely that passage had grown difficult and somerset standing in the kennel watched with a hope that was beginning to grow somewhat weary the faces and the manners of the crowd  suddenly he was startled by a gentle touch upon the shoulder and facing about he was aware of a very plain and elegant brougham drawn by a pair of powerful horses and driven by a man in sober livery  there were no arms upon the panel the window was open but the interior was obscure the driver yawned behind his palm and the young man was already beginning to suppose himself the dupe of his own fancy when a hand no larger than a child’s and smoothly gloved in white appeared in a corner of the window and privily beckoned him to approach  he did so and looked in  the carriage was occupied by a single small and very dainty figure swathed head and shoulders in impenetrable folds of white lace and a voice speaking low and silvery addressed him in these words—  ‘open the door and get in’  ‘it must be’ thought the young man with an almost unbearable thrill ‘it must be that duchess at last’  yet although the moment was one to which he had long looked forward it was with a certain share of alarm that he opened the door and mounting into the brougham took his seat beside the lady of the lace  whether or no she had touched a spring or given some other signal the young man had hardly closed the door before the carriage with considerable swiftness and with a very luxurious and easy movement on its springs turned and began to drive towards the west  somerset as i have written was not unprepared it had long been his particular pleasure to rehearse his conduct in the most unlikely situations and this among others of the patrician ravisher was one he had familiarly studied  strange as it may seem however he could find no apposite remark and as the lady on her side vouchsafed no further sign they continued to drive in silence through the streets  except for alternate flashes from the passing lamps the carriage was plunged in obscurity and beyond the fact that the fittings were luxurious and that the lady was singularly small and slender in person and all but one gloved hand still swathed in her costly veil the young man could decipher no detail of an inspiring nature  the suspense began to grow unbearable  twice he cleared his throat and twice the whole resources of the language failed him  in similar scenes when he had forecast them on the theatre of fancy his presence of mind had always been complete his eloquence remarkable and at this disparity between the rehearsal and the performance he began to be seized with a panic of apprehension here on the very threshold of adventure suppose him ignominiously to fail suppose that after ten twenty or sixty seconds of still uninterrupted silence the lady should touch the checkstring and redeposit him weighed and found wanting on the common street thousands of persons of no mind at all he reasoned would be found more equal to the part could that very instant by some decisive step prove the lady’s choice to have been well inspired and put a stop to this intolerable silence  his eye at this point lighted on the hand  it was better to fall by desperate councils than to continue as he was and with one tremulous swoop he pounced on the gloved fingers and drew them to himself  one overt step it had appeared to him would dissolve the spell of his embarrassment in act he found it otherwise he found himself no less incapable of speech or further progress and with the lady’s hand in his sat helpless  but worse was in store  a peculiar quivering began to agitate the form of his companion the hand that lay unresistingly in somerset’s trembled as with ague and presently there broke forth in the shadow of the carriage the bubbling and musical sound of laughter resisted but triumphant  the young man dropped his prize had it been possible he would have bounded from the carriage  the lady meanwhile lying back upon the cushions passed on from trill to trill of the most heartfelt highpitched clear and fairysounding merriment  ‘you must not be offended’ she said at last catching an opportunity between two paroxysms  ‘if you have been mistaken in the warmth of your attentions the fault is solely mine it does not flow from your presumption but from my eccentric manner of recruiting friends and believe me i am the last person in the world to think the worse of a young man for showing spirit  as for tonight it is my intention to entertain you to a little supper and if i shall continue to be as much pleased with your manners as i was taken with your face i may perhaps end by making you an advantageous offer’  somerset sought in vain to find some form of answer but his discomfiture had been too recent and complete  ‘come’ returned the lady ‘we must have no display of temper that is for me the one disqualifying fault and as i perceive we are drawing near our destination i shall ask you to descend and offer me your arm’  indeed at that very moment the carriage drew up before a stately and severe mansion in a spacious square and somerset who was possessed of an excellent temper with the best grace in the world assisted the lady to alight  the door was opened by an old woman of a grim appearance who ushered the pair into a diningroom somewhat dimly lighted but already laid for supper and occupied by a prodigious company of large and valuable cats  here as soon as they were alone the lady divested herself of the lace in which she was enfolded and somerset was relieved to find that although still bearing the traces of great beauty and still distinguished by the fire and colour of her eye her hair was of a silvery whiteness and her face lined with years  ‘and now mon preux’ said the old lady nodding at him with a quaint gaiety ‘you perceive that i am no longer in my first youth  you will soon find that i am all the better company for that’  as she spoke the maid reentered the apartment with a light but tasteful supper  they sat down accordingly to table the cats with savage pantomime surrounding the old lady’s chair and what with the excellence of the meal and the gaiety of his entertainer somerset was soon completely at his ease  when they had well eaten and drunk the old lady leaned back in her chair and taking a cat upon her lap subjected her guest to a prolonged but evidently mirthful scrutiny  ‘i fear madam’ said somerset ‘that my manners have not risen to the height of your preconceived opinion’  ‘my dear young man’ she replied ‘you were never more mistaken in your life  i find you charming and you may very well have lighted on a fairy godmother  i am not one of those who are given to change their opinions and short of substantial demerit those who have once gained my favour continue to enjoy it but i have a singular swiftness of decision read my fellow men and women with a glance and have acted throughout life on first impressions  yours as i tell you has been favourable and if as i suppose you are a young fellow of somewhat idle habits i think it not improbable that we may strike a bargain’  ‘ah madam’ returned somerset ‘you have divined my situation  i am a man of birth parts and breeding excellent company or at least so i find myself but by a peculiar iniquity of fate destitute alike of trade or money  i was indeed this evening upon the quest of an adventure resolved to close with any offer of interest emolument or pleasure and your summons which i profess i am still at some loss to understand jumped naturally with the inclination of my mind  call it if you will impudence i am here at least prepared for any proposition you can find it in your heart to make and resolutely determined to accept’  ‘you express yourself very well’ replied the old lady ‘and are certainly a droll and curious young man  i should not care to affirm that you were sane for i have never found any one entirely so besides myself but at least the nature of your madness entertains me and i will reward you with some description of my character and life’  thereupon the old lady still fondling the cat upon her lap proceeded to narrate the following particulars    narrative of the spirited old lady   i was the eldest daughter of the reverend bernard fanshawe who held a valuable living in the diocese of bath and wells  our family a very large one was noted for a sprightly and incisive wit and came of a good old stock where beauty was an heirloom  in christian grace of character we were unhappily deficient  from my earliest years i saw and deplored the defects of those relatives whose age and position should have enabled them to conquer my esteem and while i was yet a child my father married a second wife in whom strange to say the fanshawe failings were exaggerated to a monstrous and almost laughable degree  whatever may be said against me it cannot be denied i was a pattern daughter but it was in vain that with the most touching patience i submitted to my stepmother’s demands and from the hour she entered my father’s house i may say that i met with nothing but injustice and ingratitude  i stood not alone however in the sweetness of my disposition for one other of the family besides myself was free from any violence of character  before i had reached the age of sixteen this cousin john by name had conceived for me a sincere but silent passion and although the poor lad was too timid to hint at the nature of his feelings i had soon divined and begun to share them  for some days i pondered on the odd situation created for me by the bashfulness of my admirer and at length perceiving that he began in his distress rather to avoid than seek my company i determined to take the matter into my own hands  finding him alone in a retired part of the rectory garden i told him that i had divined his amiable secret that i knew with what disfavour our union was sure to be regarded and that under the circumstances i was prepared to flee with him at once  poor john was literally paralysed with joy such was the force of his emotions that he could find no words in which to thank me and that i seeing him thus helpless was obliged to arrange myself the details of our flight and of the stolen marriage which was immediately to crown it  john had been at that time projecting a visit to the metropolis  in this i bade him persevere and promised on the following day to join him at the tavistock hotel  true on my side to every detail of our arrangement i arose on the day in question before the servants packed a few necessaries in a bag took with me the little money i possessed and bade farewell for ever to the rectory  i walked with good spirits to a town some thirty miles from home and was set down the next morning in this great city of london  as i walked from the coachoffice to the hotel i could not help exulting in the pleasant change that had befallen me beholding meanwhile with innocent delight the traffic of the streets and depicting in all the colours of fancy the reception that awaited me from john  but alas when i inquired for mr fanshawe the porter assured me there was no such gentleman among the guests  by what channel our secret had leaked out or what pressure had been brought to bear on the too facile john i could never fathom  enough that my family had triumphed that i found myself alone in london tender in years smarting under the most sensible mortification and by every sentiment of pride and selfrespect debarred for ever from my father’s house  i rose under the blow and found lodgings in the neighbourhood of euston road where for the first time in my life i tasted the joys of independence  three days afterwards an advertisement in the times directed me to the office of a solicitor whom i knew to be in my father’s confidence  there i was given the promise of a very moderate allowance and a distinct intimation that i must never look to be received at home i could not but resent so cruel a desertion and i told the lawyer it was a meeting i desired as little as themselves  he smiled at my courageous spirit paid me the first quarter of my income and gave me the remainder of my personal effects which had been sent to me under his care in a couple of rather ponderous boxes  with these i returned in triumph to my lodgings more content with my position than i should have thought possible a week before and fully determined to make the best of the future  all went well for several months and indeed it was my own fault alone that ended this pleasant and secluded episode of life  i have i must confess the fatal trick of spoiling my inferiors  my landlady to whom i had as usual been overkind impertinently called me in fault for some particular too small to mention and i annoyed that i had allowed her the freedom upon which she thus presumed ordered her to leave my presence  she stood a moment dumb and then recalling her selfpossession ‘your bill’ said she ‘shall be ready this evening and tomorrow madam you shall leave my house  see’ she added ‘that you are able to pay what you owe me for if i do not receive the uttermost farthing no box of yours shall pass my threshold’  i was confounded at her audacity but as a whole quarter’s income was due to me not otherwise affected by the threat  that afternoon as i left the solicitor’s door carrying in one hand and done up in a paper parcel the whole amount of my fortune there befell me one of those decisive incidents that sometimes shape a life  the lawyer’s office was situate in a street that opened at the upper end upon the strand and was closed at the lower at the time of which i speak by a row of iron railings looking on the thames  down this street then i beheld my stepmother advancing to meet me and doubtless bound to the very house i had just left  she was attended by a maid whose face was new to me but her own was too clearly printed on my memory and the sight of it even from a distance filled me with generous indignation  flight was impossible  there was nothing left but to retreat against the railing and with my back turned to the street pretend to be admiring the barges on the river or the chimneys of transpontine london  i was still so standing and had not yet fully mastered the turbulence of my emotions when a voice at my elbow addressed me with a trivial question  it was the maid whom my stepmother with characteristic hardness had left to await her on the street while she transacted her business with the family solicitor  the girl did not know who i was the opportunity too golden to be lost and i was soon hearing the latest news of my father’s rectory and parish  it did not surprise me to find that she detested her employers and yet the terms in which she spoke of them were hard to bear hard to let pass unchallenged  i heard them however without dissent for my selfcommand is wonderful and we might have parted as we met had she not proceeded in an evil hour to criticise the rector’s missing daughter and with the most shocking perversions to narrate the story of her flight  my nature is so essentially generous that i can never pause to reason  i flung up my hand sharply by way as well as i remember of indignant protest and in the act the packet slipped from my fingers glanced between the railings and fell and sunk in the river  i stood a moment petrified and then struck by the drollery of the incident gave way to peals of laughter  i was still laughing when my stepmother reappeared and the maid who doubtless considered me insane ran off to join her nor had i yet recovered my gravity when i presented myself before the lawyer to solicit a fresh advance  his answer made me serious enough for it was a flat refusal and it was not until i had besought him even with tears that he consented to lend me ten pounds from his own pocket  ‘i am a poor man’ said he ‘and you must look for nothing farther at my hands’  the landlady met me at the door  ‘here madam’ said she with a curtsey insolently low ‘here is my bill  would it inconvenience you to settle it at once’  ‘you shall be paid madam’ said i ‘in the morning in the proper course’  and i took the paper with a very high air but inwardly quaking  i had no sooner looked at it than i perceived myself to be lost  i had been short of money and had allowed my debt to mount and it had now reached the sum which i shall never forget of twelve pounds thirteen and fourpence halfpenny  all evening i sat by the fire considering my situation  i could not pay the bill my landlady would not suffer me to remove my boxes and without either baggage or money how was i to find another lodging  for three months unless i could invent some remedy i was condemned to be without a roof and without a penny  it can surprise no one that i decided on immediate flight but even here i was confronted by a difficulty for i had no sooner packed my boxes than i found i was not strong enough to move far less to carry them  in this strait i did not hesitate a moment but throwing on a shawl and bonnet and covering my face with a thick veil i betook myself to that great bazaar of dangerous and smiling chances the pavement of the city it was already late at night and the weather being wet and windy there were few abroad besides policemen  these on my present mission i had wit enough to know for enemies and wherever i perceived their moving lanterns i made haste to turn aside and choose another thoroughfare  a few miserable women still walked the pavement here and there were young fellows returning drunk or ruffians of the lowest class lurking in the mouths of alleys but of any one to whom i might appeal in my distress i began almost to despair  at last at the corner of a street i ran into the arms of one who was evidently a gentleman and who in all his appointments from his furred greatcoat to the fine cigar which he was smoking comfortably breathed of wealth  much as my face has changed from its original beauty i still retain or so i tell myself some traces of the youthful lightness of my figure  even veiled as i then was i could perceive the gentleman was struck by my appearance and this emboldened me for my adventure  ‘sir’ said i with a quickly beating heart ‘sir are you one in whom a lady can confide’  ‘why my dear’ said he removing his cigar ‘that depends on circumstances  if you will raise your veil—’  ‘sir’ i interrupted ‘let there be no mistake  i ask you as a gentleman to serve me but i offer no reward’  ‘that is frank’ said he ‘but hardly tempting  and what may i inquire is the nature of the service’  but i knew well enough it was not my interest to tell him on so short an interview  ‘if you will accompany me’ said i ‘to a house not far from here you can see for yourself’  he looked at me awhile with hesitating eyes and then tossing away his cigar which was not yet a quarter smoked ‘here goes’ said he and with perfect politeness offered me his arm  i was wise enough to take it to prolong our walk as far as possible by more than one excursion from the shortest line and to beguile the way with that sort of conversation which should prove to him indubitably from what station in society i sprang  by the time we reached the door of my lodging i felt sure i had confirmed his interest and might venture before i turned the passkey to beseech him to moderate his voice and to tread softly  he promised to obey me and i admitted him into the passage and thence into my sittingroom which was fortunately next the door  ‘and now’ said he when with trembling fingers i had lighted a candle ‘what is the meaning of all this’  ‘i wish you’ said i speaking with great difficulty ‘to help me out with these boxes—and i wish nobody to know’  he took up the candle  ‘and i wish to see your face’ said he  i turned back my veil without a word and looked at him with every appearance of resolve that i could summon up  for some time he gazed into my face still holding up the candle  ‘well’ said he at last ‘and where do you wish them taken’  i knew that i had gained my point and it was with a tremor in my voice that i replied  ‘i had thought we might carry them between us to the corner of euston road’ said i ‘where even at this late hour we may still find a cab’  ‘very good’ was his reply and he immediately hoisted the heavier of my trunks upon his shoulder and taking one handle of the second signed to me to help him at the other end  in this order we made good our retreat from the house and without the least adventure drew pretty near to the corner of euston road  before a house where there was a light still burning my companion paused  ‘let us here’ said he ‘set down our boxes while we go forward to the end of the street in quest of a cab by doing so we can still keep an eye upon their safety and we avoid the very extraordinary figure we should otherwise present—a young man a young lady and a mass of baggage standing castaway at midnight on the streets of london’  so it was done and the event proved him to be wise for long before there was any word of a cab a policeman appeared upon the scene turned upon us the full glare of his lantern and hung suspiciously behind us in a doorway  ‘there seem to be no cabs about policeman’ said my champion with affected cheerfulness  but the constable’s answer was ungracious and as for the offer of a cigar with which this rebuff was most unwisely followed up he refused it pointblank and without the least civility the young gentleman looked at me with a warning grimace and there we continued to stand on the edge of the pavement in the beating rain and with the policeman still silently watching our movements from the doorway  at last and after a delay that seemed interminable a fourwheeler appeared lumbering along in the mud and was instantly hailed by my companion  ‘just pull up here will you’ he cried  ‘we have some baggage up the street’  and now came the hitch of our adventure for when the policeman still closely following us beheld my two boxes lying in the rain he arose from mere suspicion to a kind of certitude of something evil  the light in the house had been extinguished the whole frontage of the street was dark there was nothing to explain the presence of these unguarded trunks and no two innocent people were ever i believe detected in such questionable circumstances  ‘where have these things come from’ asked the policeman flashing his light full into my champion’s face  ‘why from that house of course’ replied the young gentleman hastily shouldering a trunk  the policeman whistled and turned to look at the dark windows he then took a step towards the door as though to knock a course which had infallibly proved our ruin but seeing us already hurrying down the street under our double burthen thought better or worse of it and followed in our wake  ‘for god’s sake’ whispered my companion ‘tell me where to drive to’  ‘anywhere’ i replied with anguish  ‘i have no idea  anywhere you like’  thus it befell that when the boxes had been stowed and i had already entered the cab my deliverer called out in clear tones the address of the house in which we are now seated  the policeman i could see was staggered  this neighbourhood so retired so aristocratic was far from what he had expected  for all that he took the number of the cab and spoke for a few seconds and with a decided manner in the cabman’s ear  ‘what can he have said’ i gasped as soon as the cab had rolled away  ‘i can very well imagine’ replied my champion ‘and i can assure you that you are now condemned to go where i have said for should we attempt to change our destination by the way the jarvey will drive us straight to a policeoffice  let me compliment you on your nerves’ he added  ‘i have had i believe the most horrible fright of my existence’  but my nerves which he so much misjudged were in so strange a disarray that speech was now become impossible and we made the drive thenceforward in unbroken silence  when we arrived before the door of our destination the young gentleman alighted opened it with a passkey like one who was at home bade the driver carry the trunks into the hall and dismissed him with a handsome fee  he then led me into this diningroom looking nearly as you behold it but with certain marks of bachelor occupancy and hastened to pour out a glass of wine which he insisted on my drinking  as soon as i could find my voice ‘in god’s name’ i cried ‘where am i’  he told me i was in his house where i was very welcome and had no more urgent business than to rest myself and recover my spirits  as he spoke he offered me another glass of wine of which indeed i stood in great want for i was faint and inclined to be hysterical  then he sat down beside the fire lit another cigar and for some time observed me curiously in silence  ‘and now’ said he ‘that you have somewhat restored yourself will you be kind enough to tell me in what sort of crime i have become a partner are you murderer smuggler thief or only the harmless and domestic moonlight flitter’  i had been already shocked by his lighting a cigar without permission for i had not forgotten the one he threw away on our first meeting and now at these explicit insults i resolved at once to reconquer his esteem  the judgment of the world i have consistently despised but i had already begun to set a certain value on the good opinion of my entertainer  beginning with a note of pathos but soon brightening into my habitual vivacity and humour i rapidly narrated the circumstances of my birth my flight and subsequent misfortunes  he heard me to an end in silence gravely smoking  ‘miss fanshawe’ said he when i had done ‘you are a very comical and most enchanting creature and i can see nothing for it but that i should return tomorrow morning and satisfy your landlady’s demands’  ‘you strangely misinterpret my confidence’ was my reply ‘and if you had at all appreciated my character you would understand that i can take no money at your hands’  ‘your landlady will doubtless not be so particular’ he returned ‘nor do i at all despair of persuading even your unconquerable self  i desire you to examine me with critical indulgence  my name is henry luxmore lord southwark’s second son  i possess nine thousand a year the house in which we are now sitting and seven others in the best neighbourhoods in town  i do not believe i am repulsive to the eye and as for my character you have seen me under trial  i think you simply the most original of created beings i need not tell you what you know very well that you are ravishingly pretty and i have nothing more to add except that foolish as it may appear i am already head over heels in love with you’  ‘sir’ said i ‘i am prepared to be misjudged but while i continue to accept your hospitality that fact alone should be enough to protect me from insult’  ‘pardon me’ said he ‘i offer you marriage’  and leaning back in his chair he replaced his cigar between his lips  i own i was confounded by an offer not only so unprepared but couched in terms so singular  but he knew very well how to obtain his purposes for he was not only handsome in person but his very coolness had a charm and to make a long story short a fortnight later i became the wife of the honourable henry luxmore  for nearly twenty years i now led a life of almost perfect quiet  my henry had his weaknesses i was twice driven to flee from his roof but not for long for though he was easily overexcited his nature was placable below the surface and with all his faults i loved him tenderly  at last he was taken from me and such is the power of selfdeception and so strange are the whims of the dying he actually assured me with his latest breath that he forgave the violence of my temper  there was but one pledge of the marriage my daughter clara  she had indeed inherited a shadow of her father’s failing but in all things else unless my partial eyes deceived me she derived her qualities from me and might be called my moral image  on my side whatever else i may have done amiss as a mother i was above reproach  here then was surely every promise for the future here at last was a relation in which i might hope to taste repose  but it was not to be  you will hardly credit me when i inform you that she ran away from home yet such was the case  some whim about oppressed nationalities—ireland poland and the like—has turned her brain and if you should anywhere encounter a young lady i must say of remarkable attractions answering to the name of luxmore lake or fonblanque for i am told she uses these indifferently as well as many others tell her from me that i forgive her cruelty and though i will never more behold her face i am at any time prepared to make her a liberal allowance  on the death of mr luxmore i sought oblivion in the details of business  i believe i have mentioned that seven mansions besides this formed part of mr luxmore’s property i have found them seven white elephants  the greed of tenants the dishonesty of solicitors and the incapacity that sits upon the bench have combined together to make these houses the burthen of my life  i had no sooner indeed begun to look into these matters for myself than i discovered so many injustices and met with so much studied incivility that i was plunged into a long series of lawsuits some of which are pending to this day  you must have heard my name already i am the mrs luxmore of the law reports a strange destiny indeed for one born with an almost cowardly desire for peace  but i am of the stamp of those who when they have once begun a task will rather die than leave their duty unfulfilled  i have met with every obstacle insolence and ingratitude from my own lawyers in my adversaries that fault of obstinacy which is to me perhaps the most distasteful in the calendar from the bench civility indeed—always i must allow civility—but never a spark of independence never that knowledge of the law and love of justice which we have a right to look for in a judge the most august of human officers  and still against all these odds i have undissuadably persevered  it was after the loss of one of my innumerable cases a subject on which i will not dwell that it occurred to me to make a melancholy pilgrimage to my various houses  four were at that time tenantless and closed like pillars of salt commemorating the corruption of the age and the decline of private virtue  three were occupied by persons who had wearied me by every conceivable unjust demand and legal subterfuge—persons whom at that very hour i was moving heaven and earth to turn into the street this was perhaps the sadder spectacle of the two and my heart grew hot within me to behold them occupying in my very teeth and with an insolent ostentation these handsome structures which were as much mine as the flesh upon my body  one more house remained for me to visit that in which we now are  i had let it for at that period i lodged in a hotel the life that i have always preferred to a colonel geraldine a gentleman attached to prince florizel of bohemia whom you must certainly have heard of and i had supposed from the character and position of my tenant that here at least i was safe against annoyance  what was my surprise to find this house also shuttered and apparently deserted  i will not deny that i was offended i conceived that a house like a yacht was better to be kept in commission and i promised myself to bring the matter before my solicitor the following morning  meanwhile the sight recalled my fancy naturally to the past and yielding to the tender influence of sentiment i sat down opposite the door upon the garden parapet  it was august and a sultry afternoon but that spot is sheltered as you may observe by daylight under the branches of a spreading chestnut the square too was deserted there was a sound of distant music in the air and all combined to plunge me into that most agreeable of states which is neither happiness nor sorrow but shares the poignancy of both  from this i was recalled by the arrival of a large van very handsomely appointed drawn by valuable horses mounted by several men of an appearance more than decent and bearing on its panels instead of a trader’s name a coatofarms too modest to be deciphered from where i sat  it drew up before my house the door of which was immediately opened by one of the men  his companions—i counted seven of them in all—proceeded with disciplined activity to take from the van and carry into the house a variety of hampers bottlebaskets and boxes such as are designed for plate and napery  the windows of the diningroom were thrown widely open as though to air it and i saw some of those within laying the table for a meal  plainly i concluded my tenant was about to return and while still determined to submit to no aggression on my rights i was gratified by the number and discipline of his attendants and the quiet profusion that appeared to reign in his establishment  i was still so thinking when to my extreme surprise the windows and shutters of the diningroom were once more closed the men began to reappear from the interior and resume their stations on the van the last closed the door behind his exit the van drove away and the house was once more left to itself looking blindly on the square with shuttered windows as though the whole affair had been a vision  it was no vision however for as i rose to my feet and thus brought my eyes a little nearer to the level of the fanlight over the door i saw that though the day had still some hours to run the hall lamps had been lighted and left burning  plainly then guests were expected and were not expected before night  for whom i asked myself with indignation were such secret preparations likely to be made  although no prude i am a woman of decided views upon morality if my house to which my husband had brought me was to serve in the character of a petite maison i saw myself forced however unwillingly into a new course of litigation and determined to return and know the worst i hastened to my hotel for dinner  i was at my post by ten  the night was clear and quiet the moon rode very high and put the lamps to shame and the shadow below the chestnut was black as ink  here then i ensconced myself on the low parapet with my back against the railings face to face with the moonlit front of my old home and ruminating gently on the past  time fled eleven struck on all the city clocks and presently after i was aware of the approach of a gentleman of stately and agreeable demeanour  he was smoking as he walked his light paletôt which was open did not conceal his evening clothes and he bore himself with a serious grace that immediately awakened my attention  before the door of this house he took a passkey from his pocket quietly admitted himself and disappeared into the lamplit hall  he was scarcely gone when i observed another and a much younger man approaching hastily from the opposite side of the square  considering the season of the year and the genial mildness of the night he was somewhat closely muffled up and as he came for all his hurry he kept looking nervously behind him  arrived before my door he halted and set one foot upon the step as though about to enter then with a sudden change he turned and began to hurry away halted a second time as if in painful indecision and lastly with a violent gesture wheeled about returned straight to the door and rapped upon the knocker  he was almost immediately admitted by the first arrival  my curiosity was now broad awake  i made myself as small as i could in the very densest of the shadow and waited for the sequel  nor had i long to wait  from the same side of the square a second young man made his appearance walking slowly and softly and like the first muffled to the nose  before the house he paused looked all about him with a swift and comprehensive glance and seeing the square lie empty in the moon and lamplight leaned far across the area railings and appeared to listen to what was passing in the house  from the diningroom there came the report of a champagne cork and following upon that the sound of rich and manly laughter  the listener took heart of grace produced a key unlocked the area gate shut it noiselessly behind him and descended the stair  just when his head had reached the level of the pavement he turned half round and once more raked the square with a suspicious eyeshot  the mufflings had fallen lower round his neck the moon shone full upon him and i was startled to observe the pallor and passionate agitation of his face  i could remain no longer passive  persuaded that something deadly was afoot i crossed the roadway and drew near the area railings  there was no one below the man must therefore have entered the house with what purpose i dreaded to imagine  i have at no part of my career lacked courage and now finding the area gate was merely laid to i pushed it gently open and descended the stairs  the kitchen door of the house like the area gate was closed but not fastened  it flashed upon me that the criminal was thus preparing his escape and the thought as it confirmed the worst of my suspicions lent me new resolve  i entered the house and being now quite reckless of my life i shut and locked the door  from the diningroom above i could hear the pleasant tones of a voice in easy conversation  on the ground floor all was not only profoundly silent but the darkness seemed to weigh upon my eyes  here then i stood for some time having thrust myself uncalled into the utmost peril and being destitute of any power to help or interfere  nor will i deny that fear had begun already to assail me when i became aware all at once and as though by some immediate but silent incandescence of a certain glimmering of light upon the passage floor  towards this i groped my way with infinite precaution and having come at length as far as the angle of the corridor beheld the door of the butler’s pantry standing just ajar and a narrow thread of brightness falling from the chink  creeping still closer i put my eye to the aperture  the man sat within upon a chair listening i could see with the most rapt attention  on a table before him he had laid a watch a pair of steel revolvers and a bull’seye lantern  for one second many contradictory theories and projects whirled together in my head the next i had slammed the door and turned the key upon the malefactor  surprised at my own decision i stood and panted leaning on the wall  from within the pantry not a sound was to be heard the man whatever he was had accepted his fate without a struggle and now as i hugged myself to fancy sat frozen with terror and looking for the worst to follow  i promised myself that he should not be disappointed and the better to complete my task i turned to ascend the stairs  the situation as i groped my way to the first floor appealed to me suddenly by my strong sense of humour  here was i the owner of the house burglariously present in its walls and there in the diningroom were two gentlemen unknown to me seated complacently at supper and only saved by my promptitude from some surprising or deadly interruption it were strange if i could not manage to extract the matter of amusement from so unusual a situation  behind this diningroom there is a small apartment intended for a library  it was to this that i cautiously groped my way and you will see how fortune had exactly served me  the weather i have said was sultry in order to ventilate the diningroom and yet preserve the uninhabited appearance of the mansion to the front the window of the library had been widely opened and the door of communication between the two apartments left ajar  to this interval i now applied my eye  wax tapers set in silver candlesticks shed their chastened brightness on the damask of the tablecloth and the remains of a cold collation of the rarest delicacy  the two gentlemen had finished supper and were now trifling with cigars and maraschino while in a silver spirit lamp coffee of the most captivating fragrance was preparing in the fashion of the east  the elder of the two he who had first arrived was placed directly facing me the other was set on his left hand  both like the man in the butler’s pantry seemed to be intently listening and on the face of the second i thought i could perceive the marks of fear  oddly enough however when they came to speak the parts were found to be reversed  ‘i assure you’ said the elder gentleman ‘i not only heard the slamming of a door but the sound of very guarded footsteps’  ‘your highness was certainly deceived’ replied the other  ‘i am endowed with the acutest hearing and i can swear that not a mouse has rustled’ yet the pallor and contraction of his features were in total discord with the tenor of his words  his highness whom of course i readily divined to be prince florizel looked at his companion for the least fraction of a second and though nothing shook the easy quiet of his attitude i could see that he was far from being duped  ‘it is well’ said he ‘let us dismiss the topic  and now sir that i have very freely explained the sentiments by which i am directed let me ask you according to your promise to imitate my frankness’  ‘i have heard you’ replied the other ‘with great interest’  ‘with singular patience’ said the prince politely  ‘ay your highness and with unlookedfor sympathy’ returned the young man  ‘i know not how to tell the change that has befallen me  you have i must suppose a charm to which even your enemies are subject’  he looked at the clock on the mantelpiece and visibly blanched  ‘so late’ he cried  ‘your highness—god knows i am now speaking from the heart—before it be too late leave this house’  the prince glanced once more at his companion and then very deliberately shook the ash from his cigar  ‘that is a strange remark’ said he ‘and á propos de bottes i never continue a cigar when once the ash is fallen the spell breaks the soul of the flavour flies away and there remains but the dead body of tobacco and i make it a rule to throw away that husk and choose another’  he suited the action to the words  ‘do not trifle with my appeal’ resumed the young man in tones that trembled with emotion  ‘it is made at the price of my honour and to the peril of my life  go—go now lose not a moment and if you have any kindness for a young man miserably deceived indeed but not devoid of better sentiments look not behind you as you leave’  ‘sir’ said the prince ‘i am here upon your honour assure you upon mine that i shall continue to rely upon that safeguard  the coffee is ready i must again trouble you i fear’  and with a courteous movement of the hand he seemed to invite his companion to pour out the coffee  the unhappy young man rose from his seat  ‘i appeal to you’ he cried ‘by every holy sentiment in mercy to me if not in pity to yourself begone before it is too late’  ‘sir’ replied the prince ‘i am not readily accessible to fear and if there is one defect to which i must plead guilty it is that of a curious disposition  you go the wrong way about to make me leave this house in which i play the part of your entertainer and suffer me to add young man if any peril threaten us it was of your contriving not of mine’  ‘alas you do not know to what you condemn me’ cried the other  ‘but i at least will have no hand in it’  with these words he carried his hand to his pocket hastily swallowed the contents of a phial and with the very act reeled back and fell across his chair upon the floor  the prince left his place and came and stood above him where he lay convulsed upon the carpet  ‘poor moth’ i heard his highness murmur ‘alas poor moth must we again inquire which is the more fatal—weakness or wickedness  and can a sympathy with ideas surely not ignoble in themselves conduct a man to this dishonourable death’  by this time i had pushed the door open and walked into the room  ‘your highness’ said i ‘this is no time for moralising with a little promptness we may save this creature’s life and as for the other he need cause you no concern for i have him safely under lock and key’  the prince had turned about upon my entrance and regarded me certainly with no alarm but with a profundity of wonder which almost robbed me of my selfpossession  ‘my dear madam’ he cried at last ‘and who the devil are you’  i was already on the floor beside the dying man  i had of course no idea with what drug he had attempted his life and i was forced to try him with a variety of antidotes  here were both oil and vinegar for the prince had done the young man the honour of compounding for him one of his celebrated salads and of each of these i administered from a quarter to half a pint with no apparent efficacy  i next plied him with the hot coffee of which there may have been near upon a quart  ‘have you no milk’ i inquired  ‘i fear madam that milk has been omitted’ returned the prince  ‘salt then’ said i ‘salt is a revulsive  pass the salt’  ‘and possibly the mustard’ asked his highness as he offered me the contents of the various saltcellars poured together on a plate  ‘ah’ cried i ‘the thought is excellent  mix me about half a pint of mustard drinkably dilute’  whether it was the salt or the mustard or the mere combination of so many subversive agents as soon as the last had been poured over his throat the young sufferer obtained relief  ‘there’ i exclaimed with natural triumph ‘i have saved a life’  ‘and yet madam’ returned the prince ‘your mercy may be cruelty disguised  where the honour is lost it is at least superfluous to prolong the life’  ‘if you had led a life as changeable as mine your highness’ i replied ‘you would hold a very different opinion  for my part and after whatever extremity of misfortune or disgrace i should still count tomorrow worth a trial’  ‘you speak as a lady madam’ said the prince ‘and for such you speak the truth  but to men there is permitted such a field of license and the good behaviour asked of them is at once so easy and so little that to fail in that is to fall beyond the reach of pardon  but will you suffer me to repeat a question put to you at first i am afraid with some defect of courtesy and to ask you once more who you are and how i have the honour of your company’  ‘i am the proprietor of the house in which we stand’ said i  ‘and still i am at fault’ returned the prince  but at that moment the timepiece on the mantelshelf began to strike the hour of twelve and the young man raising himself upon one elbow with an expression of despair and horror that i have never seen excelled cried lamentably ‘midnight oh just god’  we stood frozen to our places while the tingling hammer of the timepiece measured the remaining strokes nor had we yet stirred so tragic had been the tones of the young man when the various bells of london began in turn to declare the hour  the timepiece was inaudible beyond the walls of the chamber where we stood but the second pulsation of big ben had scarcely throbbed into the night before a sharp detonation rang about the house  the prince sprang for the door by which i had entered but quick as he was i yet contrived to intercept him  ‘are you armed’ i cried  ‘no madam’ replied he  ‘you remind me appositely i will take the poker’  ‘the man below’ said i ‘has two revolvers  would you confront him at such odds’  he paused as though staggered in his purpose  ‘and yet madam’ said he ‘we cannot continue to remain in ignorance of what has passed’  ‘no’ cried i  ‘and who proposes it  i am as curious as yourself but let us rather send for the police or if your highness dreads a scandal for some of your own servants’  ‘nay madam’ he replied smiling ‘for so brave a lady you surprise me would you have me then send others where i fear to go myself’  ‘you are perfectly right’ said i ‘and i was entirely wrong  go in god’s name and i will hold the candle’  together therefore we descended to the lower story he carrying the poker i the light and together we approached and opened the door of the butler’s pantry  in some sort i believe i was prepared for the spectacle that met our eyes i was prepared that is to find the villain dead but the rude details of such a violent suicide i was unable to endure  the prince unshaken by horror as he had remained unshaken by alarm assisted me with the most respectful gallantry to regain the diningroom  there we found our patient still indeed deadly pale but vastly recovered and already seated on a chair  he held out both his hands with a most pitiful gesture of interrogation  ‘he is dead’ said the prince  ‘alas’ cried the young man ‘and it should be i  what do i do thus lingering on the stage i have disgraced while he my sure comrade blameworthy indeed for much but yet the soul of fidelity has judged and slain himself for an involuntary fault  ah sir’ said he ‘and you too madam without whose cruel help i should be now beyond the reach of my accusing conscience you behold in me the victim equally of my own faults and virtues  i was born a hater of injustice from my most tender years my blood boiled against heaven when i beheld the sick and against men when i witnessed the sorrows of the poor the pauper’s crust stuck in my throat when i sat down to eat my dainties and the cripple child has set me weeping  what was there in that but what was noble and yet observe to what a fall these thoughts have led me  year after year this passion for the lost besieged me closer  what hope was there in kings what hope in these wellfeathered classes that now roll in money  i had observed the course of history i knew the burgess our ruler of today to be base cowardly and dull i saw him in every age combine to pull down that which was immediately above and to prey upon those that were below his dulness i knew would ultimately bring about his ruin i knew his days were numbered and yet how was i to wait how was i to let the poor child shiver in the rain  the better days indeed were coming but the child would die before that  alas your highness in surely no ungenerous impatience i enrolled myself among the enemies of this unjust and doomed society in surely no unnatural desire to keep the fires of my philanthropy alight i bound myself by an irrevocable oath  ‘that oath is all my history  to give freedom to posterity i had forsworn my own  i must attend upon every signal and soon my father complained of my irregular hours and turned me from his house  i was engaged in betrothal to an honest girl from her also i had to part for she was too shrewd to credit my inventions and too innocent to be entrusted with the truth  behold me then alone with conspirators alas as the years went on my illusions left me  surrounded as i was by the fervent disciples and apologists of revolution i beheld them daily advance in confidence and desperation i beheld myself upon the other hand and with an almost equal regularity decline in faith  i had sacrificed all to further that cause in which i still believed and daily i began to grow in doubts if we were advancing it indeed  horrible was the society with which we warred but our own means were not less horrible  ‘i will not dwell upon my sufferings i will not pause to tell you how when i beheld young men still free and happy married fathers of children cheerfully toiling at their work my heart reproached me with the greatness and vanity of my unhappy sacrifice  i will not describe to you how worn by poverty poor lodging scanty food and an unquiet conscience my health began to fail and in the long nights as i wandered bedless in the rainy streets the most cruel sufferings of the body were added to the tortures of my mind  these things are not personal to me they are common to all unfortunates in my position  an oath so light a thing to swear so grave a thing to break an oath taken in the heat of youth repented with what sobbings of the heart but yet in vain repented as the years go on an oath that was once the very utterance of the truth of god but that falls to be the symbol of a meaningless and empty slavery such is the yoke that many young men joyfully assume and under whose dead weight they live to suffer worse than death  ‘it is not that i was patient  i have begged to be released but i knew too much and i was still refused  i have fled ay and for the time successfully  i reached paris  i found a lodging in the rue st jacques almost opposite the val de grâce  my room was mean and bare but the sun looked into it towards evening it commanded a peep of a green garden a bird hung by a neighbour’s window and made the morning beautiful and i who was sick might lie in bed and rest myself i who was in full revolt against the principles that i had served was now no longer at the beck of the council and was no longer charged with shameful and revolting tasks  oh what an interval of peace was that  i still dream at times that i can hear the note of my neighbour’s bird  ‘my money was running out and it became necessary that i should find employment  scarcely had i been three days upon the search ere i thought that i was being followed  i made certain of the features of the man which were quite strange to me and turned into a small café where i whiled away an hour pretending to read the papers but inwardly convulsed with terror  when i came forth again into the street it was quite empty and i breathed again but alas i had not turned three corners when i once more observed the human hound pursuing me  not an hour was to be lost timely submission might yet preserve a life which otherwise was forfeit and dishonoured and i fled with what speed you may conceive to the paris agency of the society i served  ‘my submission was accepted  i took up once more the hated burthen of that life once more i was at the call of men whom i despised and hated while yet i envied and admired them  they at least were wholehearted in the things they purposed but i who had once been such as they had fallen from the brightness of my faith and now laboured like a hireling for the wages of a loathed existence  ay sir to that i was condemned i obeyed to continue to live and lived but to obey  ‘the last charge that was laid upon me was the one which has tonight so tragically ended  boldly telling who i was i was to request from your highness on behalf of my society a private audience where it was designed to murder you  if one thing remained to me of my old convictions it was the hate of kings and when this task was offered me i took it gladly  alas sir you triumphed  as we supped you gained upon my heart  your character your talents your designs for our unhappy country all had been misrepresented  i began to forget you were a prince i began all too feelingly to remember that you were a man as i saw the hour approach i suffered agonies untold and when at last we heard the slamming of the door which announced in my unwilling ears the arrival of the partner of my crime you will bear me out with what instancy i besought you to depart  you would not alas and what could i  kill you i could not my heart revolted my hand turned back from such a deed  yet it was impossible that i should suffer you to stay for when the hour struck and my companion came true to his appointment and he at least true to our design i could neither suffer you to be killed nor yet him to be arrested  from such a tragic passage death and death alone could save me and it is no fault of mine if i continue to exist  ‘but you madam’ continued the young man addressing himself more directly to myself ‘were doubtless born to save the prince and to confound our purposes  my life you have prolonged and by turning the key on my companion you have made me the author of his death  he heard the hour strike he was impotent to help and thinking himself forfeit to honour thinking that i should fall alone upon his highness and perish for lack of his support he has turned his pistol on himself’  ‘you are right’ said prince florizel ‘it was in no ungenerous spirit that you brought these burthens on yourself and when i see you so nobly to blame so tragically punished i stand like one reproved  for is it not strange madam that you and i by practising accepted and inconsiderable virtues and commonplace but still unpardonable faults should stand here in the sight of god with what we call clean hands and quiet consciences while this poor youth for an error that i could almost envy him should be sunk beyond the reach of hope  ‘sir’ resumed the prince turning to the young man ‘i cannot help you my help would but unchain the thunderbolt that overhangs you and i can but leave you free’  ‘and sir’ said i ‘as this house belongs to me i will ask you to have the kindness to remove the body  you and your conspirators it appears to me can hardly in civility do less’  ‘it shall be done’ said the young man with a dismal accent  ‘and you dear madam’ said the prince ‘you to whom i owe my life how can i serve you’  ‘your highness’ i said ‘to be very plain this is my favourite house being not only a valuable property but endeared to me by various associations  i have endless troubles with tenants of the ordinary class and at first applauded my good fortune when i found one of the station of your master of the horse  i now begin to think otherwise dangers set a siege about great personages and i do not wish my tenement to share these risks  procure me the resiliation of the lease and i shall feel myself your debtor’  ‘i must tell you madam’ replied his highness ‘that colonel geraldine is but a cloak for myself and i should be sorry indeed to think myself so unacceptable a tenant’  ‘your highness’ said i ‘i have conceived a sincere admiration for your character but on the subject of house property i cannot allow the interference of my feelings  i will however to prove to you that there is nothing personal in my request here solemnly engage my word that i will never put another tenant in this house’  ‘madam’ said florizel ‘you plead your cause too charmingly to be refused’  thereupon we all three withdrew  the young man still reeling in his walk departed by himself to seek the assistance of his fellowconspirators and the prince with the most attentive gallantry lent me his escort to the door of my hotel  the next day the lease was cancelled nor from that hour to this though sometimes regretting my engagement have i suffered a tenant in this house     the superfluous mansion continued   as soon as the old lady had finished her relation somerset made haste to offer her his compliments  ‘madam’ said he ‘your story is not only entertaining but instructive and you have told it with infinite vivacity  i was much affected towards the end as i held at one time very liberal opinions and should certainly have joined a secret society if i had been able to find one but the whole tale came home to me and i was the better able to feel for you in your various perplexities as i am myself of somewhat hasty temper’  ‘i do not understand you’ said mrs luxmore with some marks of irritation  ‘you must have strangely misinterpreted what i have told you  you fill me with surprise’  somerset alarmed by the old lady’s change of tone and manner hurried to recant  ‘dear mrs luxmore’ said he ‘you certainly misconstrue my remark  as a man of somewhat fiery humour my conscience repeatedly pricked me when i heard what you had suffered at the hands of persons similarly constituted’  ‘oh very well indeed’ replied the old lady ‘and a very proper spirit i regret that i have met with it so rarely’  ‘but in all this’ resumed the young man ‘i perceive nothing that concerns myself’  ‘i am about to come to that’ she returned  ‘and you have already before you in the pledge i gave prince florizel one of the elements of the affair  i am a woman of the nomadic sort and when i have no case before the courts i make it a habit to visit continental spas not that i have ever been ill but then i am no longer young and i am always happy in a crowd  well to come more shortly to the point i am now on the wing for evian this incubus of a house which i must leave behind and dare not let hangs heavily upon my hands and i propose to rid myself of that concern and do you a very good turn into the bargain by lending you the mansion with all its fittings as it stands  the idea was sudden it appealed to me as humorous and i am sure it will cause my relatives if they should ever hear of it the keenest possible chagrin  here then is the key and when you return at two tomorrow afternoon you will find neither me nor my cats to disturb you in your new possession’  so saying the old lady arose as if to dismiss her visitor but somerset looking somewhat blankly on the key began to protest  ‘dear mrs luxmore’ said he ‘this is a most unusual proposal  you know nothing of me beyond the fact that i displayed both impudence and timidity  i may be the worst kind of scoundrel i may sell your furniture—’  ‘you may blow up the house with gunpowder for what i care’ cried mrs luxmore  ‘it is in vain to reason  such is the force of my character that when i have one idea clearly in my head i do not care two straws for any side consideration  it amuses me to do it and let that suffice on your side you may do what you please—let apartments or keep a private hotel on mine i promise you a full month’s warning before i return and i never fail religiously to keep my promises’  the young man was about to renew his protest when he observed a sudden and significant change in the old lady’s countenance  ‘if i thought you capable of disrespect’ she cried  ‘madam’ said somerset with the extreme fervour of asseveration ‘madam i accept  i beg you to understand that i accept with joy and gratitude’  ‘ah well’ returned mrs luxmore ‘if i am mistaken let it pass  and now since all is comfortably settled i wish you a goodnight’  thereupon as if to leave him no room for repentance she hurried somerset out of the front door and left him standing key in hand upon the pavement  the next day about the hour appointed the young man found his way to the square which i will here call golden square though that was not its name  what to expect he knew not for a man may live in dreams and yet be unprepared for their realisation  it was already with a certain pang of surprise that he beheld the mansion standing in the eye of day a solid among solids  the key upon trial readily opened the front door he entered that great house a privileged burglar and escorted by the echoes of desertion rapidly reviewed the empty chambers  cats servant old lady the very marks of habitation like writing on a slate had been in these few hours obliterated  he wandered from floor to floor and found the house of great extent the kitchen offices commodious and well appointed the rooms many and large and the drawingroom in particular an apartment of princely size and tasteful decoration  although the day without was warm genial and sunny with a ruffling wind from the quarter of torquay a chill as it were of suspended animation inhabited the house  dust and shadows met the eye and but for the ominous procession of the echoes and the rumour of the wind among the garden trees the ear of the young man was stretched in vain  behind the diningroom that pleasant library referred to by the old lady in her tale looked upon the flat roofs and netted cupolas of the kitchen quarters and on a second visit this room appeared to greet him with a smiling countenance  he might as well he thought avoid the expense of lodging the library fitted with an iron bedstead which he had remarked in one of the upper chambers would serve his purpose for the night while in the diningroom which was large airy and lightsome looking on the square and garden he might very agreeably pass his days cook his meals and study to bring himself to some proficiency in that art of painting which he had recently determined to adopt  it did not take him long to make the change he had soon returned to the mansion with his modest kit and the cabman who brought him was readily induced by the young man’s pleasant manner and a small gratuity to assist him in the installation of the iron bed  by six in the evening when somerset went forth to dine he was able to look back upon the mansion with a sense of pride and property  foursquare it stood of an imposing frontage and flanked on either side by family hatchments  his eye from where he stood whistling in the key with his back to the garden railings reposed on every feature of reality and yet his own possession seemed as flimsy as a dream  in the course of a few days the genteel inhabitants of the square began to remark the customs of their neighbour  the sight of a young gentleman discussing a clay pipe about four o’clock of the afternoon in the drawingroom balcony of so discreet a mansion and perhaps still more his periodical excursion to a decent tavern in the neighbourhood and his unabashed return nursing the full tankard had presently raised to a high pitch the interest and indignation of the liveried servants of the square  the disfavour of some of these gentlemen at first proceeded to the length of insult but somerset knew how to be affable with any class of men and a few rude words merrily accepted and a few glasses amicably shared gained for him the right of toleration  the young man had embraced the art of raphael partly from a notion of its ease partly from an inborn distrust of offices  he scorned to bear the yoke of any regular schooling and proceeded to turn one half of the diningroom into a studio for the reproduction of still life  there he amassed a variety of objects indiscriminately chosen from the kitchen the drawingroom and the back garden and there spent his days in smiling assiduity  meantime the great bulk of empty building overhead lay like a load upon his imagination  to hold so great a stake and to do nothing argued some defect of energy and he at length determined to act upon the hint given by mrs luxmore herself and to stick with wafers in the window of the diningroom a small handbill announcing furnished lodgings  at halfpast six of a fine july morning he affixed the bill and went forth into the square to study the result  it seemed to his eye promising and unpretentious and he returned to the drawingroom balcony to consider over a studious pipe the knotty problem of how much he was to charge  thereupon he somewhat relaxed in his devotion to the art of painting indeed from that time forth he would spend the best part of the day in the front balcony like the attentive angler poring on his float and the better to support the tedium he would frequently console himself with his clay pipe  on several occasions passersby appeared to be arrested by the ticket and on several others ladies and gentlemen drove to the very doorstep by the carriageful but it appeared there was something repulsive in the appearance of the house for with one accord they would cast but one look upward and hastily resume their onward progress or direct the driver to proceed  somerset had thus the mortification of actually meeting the eye of a large number of lodgingseekers and though he hastened to withdraw his pipe and to compose his features to an air of invitation he was never rewarded by so much as an inquiry  ‘can there’ he thought ‘be anything repellent in myself’  but a candid examination in one of the pierglasses of the drawingroom led him to dismiss the fear  something however was amiss  his vast and accurate calculations on the flyleaves of books or on the backs of playbills appeared to have been an idle sacrifice of time  by these he had variously computed the weekly takings of the house from sums as modest as fiveandtwenty shillings up to the more majestic figure of a hundred pounds and yet in despite of the very elements of arithmetic here he was making literally nothing  this incongruity impressed him deeply and occupied his thoughtful leisure on the balcony and at last it seemed to him that he had detected the error of his method  ‘this’ he reflected ‘is an age of generous display the age of the sandwichman of griffiths of pears’ legendary soap and of eno’s fruit salt which by sheer brass and notoriety and the most disgusting pictures i ever remember to have seen has overlaid that comforter of my childhood lamplough’s pyretic saline  lamplough was genteel eno was omnipresent lamplough was trite eno original and abominably vulgar and here have i a man of some pretensions to knowledge of the world contented myself with half a sheet of notepaper a few cold words which do not directly address the imagination and the adornment if adornment it may be called of four red wafers  am i then to sink with lamplough or to soar with eno  am i to adopt that modesty which is doubtless becoming in a duke or to take hold of the red facts of life with the emphasis of the tradesman and the poet’  pursuant upon these meditations he procured several sheets of the very largest size of drawingpaper and laying forth his paints proceeded to compose an ensign that might attract the eye and at the same time in his own phrase directly address the imagination of the passenger something taking in the way of colour a good savoury choice of words and a realistic design setting forth the life a lodger might expect to lead within the walls of that palace of delight these he perceived must be the elements of his advertisement  it was possible upon the one hand to depict the sober pleasures of domestic life the evening fire blondheaded urchins and the hissing urn but on the other it was possible and he almost felt as if it were more suited to his muse to set forth the charms of an existence somewhat wider in its range or boldly say the paradise of the mohammedan  so long did the artist waver between these two views that before he arrived at a conclusion he had finally conceived and completed both designs  with the proverbially tender heart of the parent he found himself unable to sacrifice either of these offsprings of his art and decided to expose them on alternate days  ‘in this way’ he thought ‘i shall address myself indifferently to all classes of the world’  the tossing of a penny decided the only remaining point and the more imaginative canvas received the suffrages of fortune and appeared first in the window of the mansion  it was of a high fancy the legend eloquently writ the scheme of colour taking and bold and but for the imperfection of the artist’s drawing it might have been taken for a model of its kind  as it was however when viewed from his favourite point against the garden railings and with some touch of distance it caused a pleasurable rising of the artist’s heart  ‘i have thrown away’ he ejaculated ‘an invaluable motive and this shall be the subject of my first academy picture’  the fate of neither of these works was equal to its merit  a crowd would certainly from time to time collect before the arearailings but they came to jeer and not to speculate and those who pushed their inquiries further were too plainly animated by the spirit of derision  the racier of the two cartoons displayed indeed no symptom of attractive merit and though it had a certain share of that success called scandalous failed utterly of its effect  on the day however of the second appearance of the companion work a real inquirer did actually present himself before the eyes of somerset  this was a gentlemanly man with some marks of recent merriment and his voice under inadequate control  ‘i beg your pardon’ said he ‘but what is the meaning of your extraordinary bill’  ‘i beg yours’ returned somerset hotly  ‘its meaning is sufficiently explicit’  and being now from dire experience fearful of ridicule he was preparing to close the door when the gentleman thrust his cane into the aperture  ‘not so fast i beg of you’ said he  ‘if you really let apartments here is a possible tenant at your door and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see the accommodation and to learn your terms’  his heart joyously beating somerset admitted the visitor showed him over the various apartments and with some return of his persuasive eloquence expounded their attractions  the gentleman was particularly pleased by the elegant proportions of the drawingroom  ‘this’ he said ‘would suit me very well  what may i ask would be your terms a week for this floor and the one above it’  ‘i was thinking’ returned somerset ‘of a hundred pounds’  ‘surely not’ exclaimed the gentleman  ‘well then’ returned somerset ‘fifty’  the gentleman regarded him with an air of some amazement  ‘you seem to be strangely elastic in your demands’ said he  ‘what if i were to proceed on your own principle of division and offer twentyfive’  ‘done’ cried somerset and then overcome by a sudden embarrassment ‘you see’ he added apologetically ‘it is all found money for me’  ‘really’ said the stranger looking at him all the while with growing wonder  ‘without extras then’  ‘i—i suppose so’ stammered the keeper of the lodginghouse  ‘service included’ pursued the gentleman  ‘service’ cried somerset  ‘do you mean that you expect me to empty your slops’  the gentleman regarded him with a very friendly interest  ‘my dear fellow’ said he ‘if you take my advice you will give up this business’  and thereupon he resumed his hat and took himself away  this smarting disappointment produced a strong effect on the artist of the cartoons and he began with shame to eat up his rosier illusions first one and then the other of his great works was condemned withdrawn from exhibition and relegated as a mere wallpicture to the decoration of the diningroom  their place was taken by a replica of the original wafered announcement to which in particularly large letters he had added the pithy rubric ‘no service’  meanwhile he had fallen into something as nearly bordering on low spirits as was consistent with his disposition depressed at once by the failure of his scheme the laughable turn of his late interview and the judicial blindness of the public to the merit of the twin cartoons  perhaps a week had passed before he was again startled by the note of the knocker  a gentleman of a somewhat foreign and somewhat military air yet closely shaven and wearing a soft hat desired in the politest terms to visit the apartments  he had he explained a friend a gentleman in tender health desirous of a sedate and solitary life apart from interruptions and the noises of the common lodginghouse  ‘the unusual clause’ he continued ‘in your announcement particularly struck me “this” i said “is the place for mr jones”  you are yourself sir a professional gentleman’ concluded the visitor looking keenly in somerset’s face  ‘i am an artist’ replied the young man lightly  ‘and these’ observed the other taking a side glance through the open door of the diningroom which they were then passing ‘these are some of your works  very remarkable’  and he again and still more sharply peered into the countenance of the young man  somerset unable to suppress a blush made the more haste to lead his visitor upstairs and to display the apartments  ‘excellent’ observed the stranger as he looked from one of the back windows  ‘is that a mews behind sir  very good  well sir see here my friend will take your drawingroom floor he will sleep in the back drawingroom his nurse an excellent irish widow will attend on all his wants and occupy a garret he will pay you the round sum of ten dollars a week and you on your part will engage to receive no other lodger  i think that fair’  somerset had scarcely words in which to clothe his gratitude and joy  ‘agreed’ said the other ‘and to spare you trouble my friend will bring some men with him to make the changes  you will find him a retiring inmate sir receives but few and rarely leaves the house except at night’  ‘since i have been in this house’ returned somerset ‘i have myself unless it were to fetch beer rarely gone abroad except in the evening but a man’ he added ‘must have some amusement’  an hour was then agreed on the gentleman departed and somerset sat down to compute in english money the value of the figure named  the result of this investigation filled him with amazement and disgust but it was now too late nothing remained but to endure and he awaited the arrival of his tenant still trying by various arithmetical expedients to obtain a more favourable quotation for the dollar  with the approach of dusk however his impatience drove him once more to the front balcony  the night fell mild and airless the lamps shone around the central darkness of the garden and through the tall grove of trees that intervened many warmly illuminated windows on the farther side of the square told their tale of white napery choice wine and genial hospitality  the stars were already thickening overhead when the young man’s eyes alighted on a procession of three fourwheelers coasting round the garden railing and bound for the superfluous mansion  they were laden with formidable boxes moved in a military order one following another and by the extreme slowness of their advance inspired somerset with the most serious ideas of his tenant’s malady  by the time he had the door open the cabs had drawn up beside the pavement and from the two first there had alighted the military gentleman of the morning and two very stalwart porters  these proceeded instantly to take possession of the house with their own hands and firmly rejecting somerset’s assistance they carried in the various crates and boxes with their own hands dismounted and transferred to the back drawingroom the bed in which the tenant was to sleep and it was not until the bustle of arrival had subsided and the arrangements were complete that there descended from the third of the three vehicles a gentleman of great stature and broad shoulders leaning on the shoulder of a woman in a widow’s dress and himself covered by a long cloak and muffled in a coloured comforter  somerset had but a glimpse of him in passing he was soon shut into the back drawingroom the other men departed silence redescended on the house and had not the nurse appeared a little before halfpast ten and with a strong brogue asked if there were a decent publichouse in the neighbourhood somerset might have still supposed himself to be alone in the superfluous mansion  day followed day and still the young man had never come by speech or sight of his mysterious lodger  the doors of the drawingroom flat were never open and although somerset could hear him moving to and fro the tall man had never quitted the privacy of his apartments  visitors indeed arrived sometimes in the dusk sometimes at intempestuous hours of night or morning men for the most part some meanly attired some decently some loud some cringing and yet all in the eyes of somerset displeasing  a certain air of fear and secrecy was common to them all they were all voluble he thought and ill at ease even the military gentleman proved on a closer inspection to be no gentleman at all and as for the doctor who attended the sick man his manners were not suggestive of a university career  the nurse again was scarcely a desirable housefellow  since her arrival the fall of whisky in the young man’s private bottle was much accelerated and though never communicative she was at times unpleasantly familiar  when asked about the patient’s health she would dolorously shake her head and declare that the poor gentleman was in a pitiful condition  yet somehow somerset had early begun to entertain the notion that his complaint was other than bodily  the illlooking birds that gathered to the house the strange noises that sounded from the drawingroom in the dead hours of night the careless attendance and intemperate habits of the nurse the entire absence of correspondence the entire seclusion of mr jones himself whose face up to that hour he could not have sworn to in a court of justice—all weighed unpleasantly upon the young man’s mind  a sense of something evil irregular and underhand haunted and depressed him and this uneasy sentiment was the more firmly rooted in his mind when in the fulness of time he had an opportunity of observing the features of his tenant  it fell in this way  the young landlord was awakened about four in the morning by a noise in the hall leaping to his feet and opening the door of the library he saw the tall man candle in hand in earnest conversation with the gentleman who had taken the rooms  the faces of both were strongly illuminated and in that of his tenant somerset could perceive none of the marks of disease but every sign of health energy and resolution  while he was still looking the visitor took his departure and the invalid having carefully fastened the front door sprang upstairs without a trace of lassitude  that night upon his pillow somerset began to kindle once more into the hot fit of the detective fever and the next morning resumed the practice of his art with careless hand and an abstracted mind  the day was destined to be fertile in surprises nor had he long been seated at the easel ere the first of these occurred  a cab laden with baggage drew up before the door and mrs luxmore in person rapidly mounted the steps and began to pound upon the knocker  somerset hastened to attend the summons  ‘my dear fellow’ she said with the utmost gaiety ‘here i come dropping from the moon  i am delighted to find you faithful and i have no doubt you will be equally pleased to be restored to liberty’  somerset could find no words whether of protest or welcome and the spirited old lady pushed briskly by him and paused on the threshold of the diningroom  the sight that met her eyes was one well calculated to inspire astonishment  the mantelpiece was arrayed with saucepans and empty bottles on the fire some chops were frying the floor was littered from end to end with books clothes walkingcanes and the materials of the painter’s craft but what far outstripped the other wonders of the place was the corner which had been arranged for the study of stilllife this formed a sort of rockery conspicuous upon which according to the principles of the art of composition a cabbage was relieved against a copper kettle and both contrasted with the mail of a boiled lobster  ‘my gracious goodness’ cried the lady of the house and then turning in wrath on the young man ‘from what rank in life are you sprung’ she demanded  ‘you have the exterior of a gentleman but from the astonishing evidences before me i should say you can only be a greengrocer’s man  pray gather up your vegetables and let me see no more of you’  ‘madam’ babbled somerset ‘you promised me a month’s warning’  ‘that was under a misapprehension’ returned the old lady  ‘i now give you warning to leave at once’  ‘madam’ said the young man ‘i wish i could and indeed as far as i am concerned it might be done  but then my lodger’  ‘your lodger’ echoed mrs luxmore  ‘my lodger why should i deny it’ returned somerset  ‘he is only by the week’  the old lady sat down upon a chair  ‘you have a lodger—you’ she cried ‘and pray how did you get him’  ‘by advertisement’ replied the young man ‘o madam i have not lived unobservantly  i adopted’—his eyes involuntarily shifted to the cartoons—‘i adopted every method’  her eyes had followed his for the first time in somerset’s experience she produced a double eyeglass and as soon as the full merit of the works had flashed upon her she gave way to peal after peal of her trilling and soprano laughter  ‘oh i think you are perfectly delicious’ she cried  ‘i do hope you had them in the window  m’pherson’ she continued crying to her maid who had been all this time grimly waiting in the hall ‘i lunch with mr somerset  take the cellar key and bring some wine’  in this gay humour she continued throughout the luncheon presented somerset with a couple of dozen of wine which she made m’pherson bring up from the cellar—‘as a present my dear’ she said with another burst of tearful merriment ‘for your charming pictures which you must be sure to leave me when you go’ and finally protesting that she dared not spoil the absurdest houseful of madmen in the whole of london departed as she vaguely phrased it for the continent of europe  she was no sooner gone than somerset encountered in the corridor the irish nurse sober to all appearance and yet a prey to singularly strong emotion  it was made to appear from her account that mr jones had already suffered acutely in his health from mrs luxmore’s visit and that nothing short of a full explanation could allay the invalid’s uneasiness  somerset somewhat staring told what he thought fit of the affair  ‘is that all’ cried the woman  ‘as god sees you is that all’  ‘my good woman’ said the young man ‘i have no idea what you can be driving at  suppose the lady were my friend’s wife suppose she were my fairy godmother suppose she were the queen of portugal and how should that affect yourself or mr jones’  ‘blessed mary’ cried the nurse ‘it’s he that will be glad to hear it’  and immediately she fled upstairs  somerset on his part returned to the diningroom and with a very thoughtful brow and ruminating many theories disposed of the remainder of the bottle  it was port and port is a wine sole among its equals and superiors that can in some degree support the competition of tobacco  sipping smoking and theorising somerset moved on from suspicion to suspicion from resolve to resolve still growing braver and rosier as the bottle ebbed  he was a sceptic none prouder of the name he had no horror at command whether for crimes or vices but beheld and embraced the world with an immoral approbation the frequent consequence of youth and health  at the same time he felt convinced that he dwelt under the same roof with secret malefactors and the unregenerate instinct of the chase impelled him to severity  the bottle had run low the summer sun had finally withdrawn and at the same moment night and the pangs of hunger recalled him from his dreams  he went forth and dined in the criterion a dinner in consonance not so much with his purse as with the admirable wine he had discussed  what with one thing and another it was long past midnight when he returned home  a cab was at the door and entering the hall somerset found himself face to face with one of the most regular of the few who visited mr jones a man of powerful figure strong lineaments and a chinbeard in the american fashion  this person was carrying on one shoulder a black portmanteau seemingly of considerable weight  that he should find a visitor removing baggage in the dead of night recalled some odd stories to the young man’s memory he had heard of lodgers who thus gradually drained away not only their own effects but the very furniture and fittings of the house that sheltered them and now in a mood between pleasantry and suspicion and aping the manner of a drunkard he roughly bumped against the man with the chinbeard and knocked the portmanteau from his shoulder to the floor  with a face struck suddenly as white as paper the man with the chinbeard called lamentably on the name of his maker and fell in a mere heap on the mat at the foot of the stairs  at the same time though only for a single instant the heads of the sick lodger and the irish nurse popped out like rabbits over the banisters of the first floor and on both the same scare and pallor were apparent  the sight of this incredible emotion turned somerset to stone and he continued speechless while the man gathered himself together and with the help of the handrail and audibly thanking god scrambled once more upon his feet  ‘what in heaven’s name ails you’ gasped the young man as soon as he could find words and utterance  ‘have you a drop of brandy’ returned the other  ‘i am sick’  somerset administered two drams one after the other to the man with the chinbeard who then somewhat restored began to confound himself in apologies for what he called his miserable nervousness the result he said of a long course of dumb ague and having taken leave with a hand that still sweated and trembled he gingerly resumed his burthen and departed  somerset retired to bed but not to sleep  what he asked himself had been the contents of the black portmanteau  stolen goods the carcase of one murdered or—and at the thought he sat upright in bed—an infernal machine  he took a solemn vow that he would set these doubts at rest and with the next morning installed himself beside the diningroom window vigilant with eye and ear to await and profit by the earliest opportunity  the hours went heavily by  within the house there was no circumstance of novelty unless it might be that the nurse more frequently made little journeys round the corner of the square and before afternoon was somewhat loose of speech and gait  a little after six however there came round the corner of the gardens a very handsome and elegantly dressed young woman who paused a little way off and for some time and with frequent sighs contemplated the front of the superfluous mansion it was not the first time that she had thus stood afar and looked upon it like our common parents at the gates of eden and the young man had already had occasion to remark the lively slimness of her carriage and had already been the butt of a chance arrow from her eye  he hailed her coming then with pleasant feelings and moved a little nearer to the window to enjoy the sight  what was his surprise however when as if with a sensible effort she drew near mounted the steps and tapped discreetly at the door  he made haste to get before the irish nurse who was not improbably asleep and had the satisfaction to receive this gracious visitor in person  she inquired for mr jones and then without transition asked the young man if he were the person of the house and at the words he thought he could perceive her to be smiling ‘because’ she added ‘if you are i should like to see some of the other rooms’  somerset told her he was under an engagement to receive no other lodgers but she assured him that would be no matter as these were friends of mr jones’s  ‘and’ she continued moving suddenly to the diningroom door ‘let us begin here’ somerset was too late to prevent her entering and perhaps he lacked the courage to essay  ‘ah’ she cried ‘how changed it is’  ‘madam’ cried the young man ‘since your entrance it is i who have the right to say so’  she received this inane compliment with a demure and conscious droop of the eyelids and gracefully steering her dress among the mingled litter now with a smile now with a sigh reviewed the wonders of the two apartments  she gazed upon the cartoons with sparkling eyes and a heightened colour and in a somewhat breathless voice expressed a high opinion of their merits  she praised the effective disposition of the rockery and in the bedroom of which somerset had vainly endeavoured to defend the entry she fairly broke forth in admiration  ‘how simple and manly’ she cried ‘none of that effeminacy of neatness which is so detestable in a man’  hard upon this telling him before he had time to reply that she very well knew her way and would trouble him no further she took her leave with an engaging smile and ascended the staircase alone  for more than an hour the young lady remained closeted with mr jones and at the end of that time the night being now come completely they left the house in company  this was the first time since the arrival of his lodger that somerset had found himself alone with the irish widow and without the loss of any more time than was required by decency he stepped to the foot of the stairs and hailed her by her name  she came instantly wreathed in weak smiles and with a nodding head and when the young man politely offered to introduce her to the treasures of his art she swore that nothing could afford her greater pleasure for though she had never crossed the threshold she had frequently observed his beautiful pictures through the door  on entering the diningroom the sight of a bottle and two glasses prepared her to be a gentle critic and as soon as the pictures had been viewed and praised she was easily persuaded to join the painter in a single glass  ‘here’ she said ‘are my respects and a pleasure it is in this horrible house to see a gentleman like yourself so affable and free and a very nice painter i am sure’  one glass so agreeably prefaced was sure to lead to the acceptance of a second at the third somerset was free to cease from the affectation of keeping her company and as for the fourth she asked it of her own accord  ‘for indeed’ said she ‘what with all these clocks and chemicals without a drop of the creature life would be impossible entirely  and you seen yourself that even m’guire was glad to beg for it  and even himself when he is downhearted with all these cruel disappointments though as temperate a man as any child will be sometimes crying for a glass of it  and i’ll thank you for a thimbleful to settle what i got’  soon after she began with tears to narrate the deathbed dispositions and lament the trifling assets of her husband then she declared she heard ‘the master’ calling her rose to her feet made but one lurch of it into the stilllife rockery and with her head upon the lobster fell into stertorous slumbers  somerset mounted at once to the first story and opened the door of the drawingroom which was brilliantly lit by several lamps  it was a great apartment looking on the square with three tall windows and joined by a pair of ample foldingdoors to the next room elegant in proportion papered in seagreen furnished in velvet of a delicate blue and adorned with a majestic mantelpiece of variously tinted marbles  such was the room that somerset remembered that which he now beheld was changed in almost every feature the furniture covered with a figured chintz the walls hung with a rhubarbcoloured paper and diversified by the curtained recesses for no less than seven windows  it seemed to himself that he must have entered without observing the transition into the adjoining house  presently from these more specious changes his eye condescended to the many curious objects with which the floor was littered  here were the locks of dismounted pistols clocks and clockwork in every stage of demolition some still busily ticking some reduced to their dainty elements a great company of carboys jars and bottles a carpenter’s bench and a laboratorytable  the back drawingroom to which somerset proceeded had likewise undergone a change  it was transformed to the exact appearance of a common lodginghouse bedroom a bed with green curtains occupied one corner and the window was blocked by the regulation table and mirror the door of a small closet here attracted the young man’s attention and striking a vesta he opened it and entered  on a table several wigs and beards were lying spread about the walls hung an incongruous display of suits and overcoats and conspicuous among the last the young man observed a large overall of the most costly sealskin  in a flash his mind reverted to the advertisement in the standard newspaper  the great height of his lodger the disproportionate breadth of his shoulders and the strange particulars of his instalment all pointed to the same conclusion  the vesta had now burned to his fingers and taking the coat upon his arm somerset hastily returned to the lighted drawingroom  there with a mixture of fear and admiration he pored upon its goodly proportions and the regularity and softness of the pile  the sight of a large pierglass put another fancy in his head  he donned the furcoat and standing before the mirror in an attitude suggestive of a russian prince he thrust his hands into the ample pockets  there his fingers encountered a folded journal  he drew it out and recognised the type and paper of the standard and at the same instant his eyes alighted on the offer of two hundred pounds  plainly then his lodger now no longer mysterious had laid aside his coat on the very day of the appearance of the advertisement  he was thus standing the telltale coat upon his back the incriminating paper in his hand when the door opened and the tall lodger with a firm but somewhat pallid face stepped into the room and closed the door again behind him  for some time the two looked upon each other in perfect silence then mr jones moved forward to the table took a seat and still without once changing the direction of his eyes addressed the young man  ‘you are right’ he said  ‘it is for me the blood money is offered  and now what will you do’  it was a question to which somerset was far from being able to reply taken as he was at unawares masquerading in the man’s own coat and surrounded by a whole arsenal of diabolical explosives the keeper of the lodginghouse was silenced  ‘yes’ resumed the other ‘i am he  i am that man whom with impotent hate and fear they still hunt from den to den from disguise to disguise  yes my landlord you have it in your power if you be poor to lay the basis of your fortune if you be unknown to capture honour at one snatch  you have hocussed an innocent widow and i find you here in my apartment for whose use i pay you in stamped money searching my wardrobe and your hand—shame sir—your hand in my very pocket  you can now complete the cycle of your ignominious acts by what will be at once the simplest the safest and the most remunerative’  the speaker paused as if to emphasise his words and then with a great change of tone and manner thus resumed ‘and yet sir when i look upon your face i feel certain that i cannot be deceived certain that in spite of all i have the honour and pleasure of speaking to a gentleman  take off my coat sir—which but cumbers you  divest yourself of this confusion that which is but thought upon thank god need be no burthen to the conscience we have all harboured guilty thoughts and if it flashed into your mind to sell my flesh and blood my anguish in the dock and the sweat of my death agony—it was a thought dear sir you were as incapable of acting on as i of any further question of your honour’  at these words the speaker with a very open smiling countenance like a forgiving father offered somerset his hand  it was not in the young man’s nature to refuse forgiveness or dissect generosity  he instantly and almost without thought accepted the proffered grasp  ‘and now’ resumed the lodger ‘now that i hold in mine your loyal hand i lay by my apprehensions i dismiss suspicion i go further—by an effort of will i banish the memory of what is past  how you came here i care not enough that you are here—as my guest  sit ye down and let us with your good permission improve acquaintance over a glass of excellent whisky’  so speaking he produced glasses and a bottle and the pair pledged each other in silence  ‘confess’ observed the smiling host ‘you were surprised at the appearance of the room’  ‘i was indeed’ said somerset ‘nor can i imagine the purpose of these changes’  ‘these’ replied the conspirator ‘are the devices by which i continue to exist  conceive me now accused before one of your unjust tribunals conceive the various witnesses appearing and the singular variety of their reports  one will have visited me in this drawingroom as it originally stood a second finds it as it is tonight and tomorrow or next day all may have been changed  if you love romance as artists do few lives are more romantic than that of the obscure individual now addressing you  obscure yet famous  mine is an anonymous infernal glory  by infamous means i work towards my bright purpose  i found the liberty and peace of a poor country desperately abused the future smiles upon that land yet in the meantime i lead the existence of a hunted brute work towards appalling ends and practice hell’s dexterities’  somerset glass in hand contemplated the strange fanatic before him and listened to his heated rhapsody with indescribable bewilderment  he looked him in the face with curious particularity saw there the marks of education and wondered the more profoundly  ‘sir’ he said—‘for i know not whether i should still address you as mr jones—’  ‘jones breitman higginbotham pumpernickel daviot henderland by all or any of these you may address me’ said the plotter ‘for all i have at some time borne  yet that which i most prize that which is most feared hated and obeyed is not a name to be found in your directories it is not a name current in postoffices or banks and indeed like the celebrated clan m’gregor i may justly describe myself as being nameless by day  but’ he continued rising to his feet ‘by night and among my desperate followers i am the redoubted zero’  somerset was unacquainted with the name but he politely expressed surprise and gratification  ‘i am to understand’ he continued ‘that under this alias you follow the profession of a dynamiter’ 176  the plotter had resumed his seat and now replenished the glasses  ‘i do’ he said  ‘in this dark period of time a star—the star of dynamite—has risen for the oppressed and among those who practise its use so thick beset with dangers and attended by such incredible difficulties and disappointments few have been more assiduous and not many—’  he paused and a shade of embarrassment appeared upon his face—‘not many have been more successful than myself’  ‘i can imagine’ observed somerset ‘that from the sweeping consequences looked for the career is not devoid of interest  you have besides some of the entertainment of the game of hide and seek  but it would still seem to me—i speak as a layman—that nothing could be simpler or safer than to deposit an infernal machine and retire to an adjacent county to await the painful consequences’  ‘you speak indeed’ returned the plotter with some evidence of warmth ‘you speak indeed most ignorantly  do you make nothing then of such a peril as we share this moment  do you think it nothing to occupy a house like this one mined menaced and in a word literally tottering to its fall’  ‘good god’ ejaculated somerset  ‘and when you speak of ease’ pursued zero ‘in this age of scientific studies you fill me with surprise  are you not aware that chemicals are proverbially fickle as woman and clockwork as capricious as the very devil  do you see upon my brow these furrows of anxiety  do you observe the silver threads that mingle with my hair  clockwork clockwork has stamped them on my brow—chemicals have sprinkled them upon my locks  no mr somerset’ he resumed after a moment’s pause his voice still quivering with sensibility ‘you must not suppose the dynamiter’s life to be all gold  on the contrary you cannot picture to yourself the bloodshot vigils and the staggering disappointments of a life like mine i have toiled let us say for months up early and down late my bag is ready my clock set a daring agent has hurried with white face to deposit the instrument of ruin we await the fall of england the massacre of thousands the yell of fear and execration and lo a snap like that of a child’s pistol an offensive smell and the entire loss of so much time and plant  if’ he concluded musingly ‘we had been merely able to recover the lost bags i believe with but a touch or two i could have remedied the peccant engine  but what with the loss of plant and the almost insuperable scientific difficulties of the task our friends in france are almost ready to desert the chosen medium  they propose instead to break up the drainage system of cities and sweep off whole populations with the devastating typhoid pestilence a tempting and a scientific project a process indiscriminate indeed but of idyllical simplicity  i recognise its elegance but sir i have something of the poet in my nature something possibly of the tribune  and for my small part i shall remain devoted to that more emphatic more striking and if you please more popular method of the explosive bomb  yes’ he cried with unshaken hope ‘i will still continue and i feel it in my bosom i shall yet succeed’  ‘two things i remark’ said somerset  ‘the first somewhat staggers me have you then—in all this course of life which you have sketched so vividly—have you not once succeeded’  ‘pardon me’ said zero  ‘i have had one success  you behold in me the author of the outrage of red lion court’  ‘but if i remember right’ objected somerset ‘the thing was a fiasco a scavenger’s barrow and some copies of the weekly budget—these were the only victims’  ‘you will pardon me again’ returned zero with positive asperity ‘a child was injured’  ‘and that fitly brings me to my second point’ said somerset  ‘for i observed you to employ the word “indiscriminate”  now surely a scavenger’s barrow and a child if child there were represent the very acme and top pinpoint of indiscriminate and pardon me of ineffectual reprisal’  ‘did i employ the word’ asked zero  ‘well i will not defend it  but for efficiency you touch on graver matters and before entering upon so vast a subject permit me once more to fill our glasses  disputation is dry work’ he added with a charming gaiety of manner  once more accordingly the pair pledged each other in a stalwart grog and zero leaning back with an air of some complacency proceeded more largely to develop his opinions  ‘the indiscriminate’ he began  ‘war my dear sir is indiscriminate war spares not the child it spares not the barrow of the harmless scavenger  no more’ he concluded beaming ‘no more do i  whatever may strike fear whatever may confound or paralyse the activities of the guilty nation barrow or child imperial parliament or excursion steamer is welcome to my simple plans  you are not’ he inquired with a shade of sympathetic interest ‘you are not i trust a believer’  ‘sir i believe in nothing’ said the young man  ‘you are then’ replied zero ‘in a position to grasp my argument  we agree that humanity is the object the glorious triumph of humanity and being pledged to labour for that end and face to face with the banded opposition of kings parliaments churches and the members of the force who am i—who are we dear sir—to affect a nicety about the tools employed  you might perhaps expect us to attack the queen the sinister gladstone the rigid derby or the dexterous granville but there you would be in error  our appeal is to the body of the people it is these that we would touch and interest  now sir have you observed the english housemaid’  ‘i should think i had’ cried somerset  ‘from a man of taste and a votary of art i had expected it’ returned the conspirator politely  ‘a type apart a very charming figure and thoroughly adapted to our ends  the neat cap the clean print the comely person the engaging manner her position between classes parents in one employers in another the probability that she will have at least one sweetheart whose feelings we shall address—yes i have a leaning—call it if you will a weakness—for the housemaid  not that i would be understood to despise the nurse  for the child is a very interesting feature i have long since marked out the child as the sensitive point in society’  he wagged his head with a wise pensive smile  ‘and talking sir of children and of the perils of our trade let me now narrate to you a little incident of an explosive bomb that fell out some weeks ago under my own observation  it fell out thus’  and zero leaning back in his chair narrated the following simple tale    zero’s tale of the explosive bomb 182   i dined by appointment with one of our most trusted agents in a private chamber at st james’s hall  you have seen the man it was m’guire the most chivalrous of creatures but not himself expert in our contrivances hence the necessity of our meeting for i need not remind you what enormous issues depend upon the nice adjustment of the engine  i set our little petard for half an hour the scene of action being hard by and the better to avert miscarriage employed a device a recent invention of my own by which the opening of the gladstone bag in which the bomb was carried should instantly determine the explosion  m’guire was somewhat dashed by this arrangement which was new to him and pointed out with excellent clear good sense that should he be arrested it would probably involve him in the fall of our opponents  but i was not to be moved made a strong appeal to his patriotism gave him a good glass of whisky and despatched him on his glorious errand  our objective was the effigy of shakespeare in leicester square a spot i think admirably chosen not only for the sake of the dramatist still very foolishly claimed as a glory by the english race in spite of his disgusting political opinions but from the fact that the seats in the immediate neighbourhood are often thronged by children errandboys unfortunate young ladies of the poorer class and infirm old men—all classes making a direct appeal to public pity and therefore suitable with our designs  as m’guire drew near his heart was inflamed by the most noble sentiment of triumph  never had he seen the garden so crowded children still stumbling in the impotence of youth ran to and fro shouting and playing round the pedestal an old sick pensioner sat upon the nearest bench a medal on his breast a stick with which he walked for he was disabled by wounds reclining on his knee  guilty england would thus be stabbed in the most delicate quarters the moment had indeed been well selected and m’guire with a radiant provision of the event drew merrily nearer  suddenly his eye alighted on the burly form of a policeman standing hard by the effigy in an attitude of watch my bold companion paused he looked about him closely here and there at different points of the enclosure other men stood or loitered affecting an abstraction feigning to gaze upon the shrubs feigning to talk feigning to be weary and to rest upon the benches  m’guire was no child in these affairs he instantly divined one of the plots of the machiavellian gladstone  a chief difficulty with which we have to deal is a certain nervousness in the subaltern branches of the corps as the hour of some design draws near these chickensouled conspirators appear to suffer some revulsion of intent and frequently despatch to the authorities not indeed specific denunciations but vague anonymous warnings  but for this purely accidental circumstance england had long ago been an historical expression  on the receipt of such a letter the government lay a trap for their adversaries and surround the threatened spot with hirelings my blood sometimes boils in my veins when i consider the case of those who sell themselves for money in such a cause  true thanks to the generosity of our supporters we patriots receive a very comfortable stipend i myself of course touch a salary which puts me quite beyond the reach of any peddling mercenary thoughts m’guire again ere he joined our ranks was on the brink of starving and now thank god receives a decent income  that is as it should be the patriot must not be diverted from his task by any base consideration and the distinction between our position and that of the police is too obvious to be stated  plainly however our leicester square design had been divulged the government had craftily filled the place with minions even the pensioner was not improbably a hireling in disguise and our emissary without other aid or protection than the simple apparatus in his bag found himself confronted by force brutal force that strong hand which was a character of the ages of oppression  should he venture to deposit the machine it was almost certain that he would be observed and arrested a cry would arise and there was just a fear that the police might not be present in sufficient force to protect him from the savagery of the mob the scheme must be delayed  he stood with his bag on his arm pretending to survey the front of the alhambra when there flashed into his mind a thought to appal the bravest  the machine was set at the appointed hour it must explode and how in the interval was he to be rid of it  put yourself i beseech you into the body of that patriot  there he was friendless and helpless a man in the very flower of life for he is not yet forty with long years of happiness before him and now condemned in one moment to a cruel and revolting death by dynamite the square he said went round him like a thaumatrope he saw the alhambra leap into the air like a balloon and reeled against the railing  it is probable he fainted  when he came to himself a constable had him by the arm  ‘my god’ he cried  ‘you seem to be unwell sir’ said the hireling  ‘i feel better now’ cried poor m’guire and with uneven steps for the pavement of the square seemed to lurch and reel under his footing he fled from the scene of this disaster  fled  alas from what was he fleeing  did he not carry that from which he fled along with him and had he the wings of the eagle had he the swiftness of the ocean winds could he have been rapt into the uttermost quarters of the earth how should he escape the ruin that he carried  we have heard of living men who have been fettered to the dead the grievance soberly considered is no more than sentimental the case is but a fleabite to that of him who should be linked like poor m’guire to an explosive bomb  a thought struck him in green street like a dart through his liver suppose it were the hour already  he stopped as though he had been shot and plucked his watch out  there was a howling in his ears as loud as a winter tempest his sight was now obscured as if by a cloud now as by a lightning flash would show him the very dust upon the street  but so brief were these intervals of vision and so violently did the watch vibrate in his hands that it was impossible to distinguish the numbers on the dial  he covered his eyes for a few seconds and in that space it seemed to him that he had fallen to be a man of ninety  when he looked again the watchplate had grown legible he had twenty minutes twenty minutes and no plan  green street at that time was very empty and he now observed a little girl of about six drawing near to him and as she came kicking in front of her as children will a piece of wood  she sang too and something in her accent recalling him to the past produced a sudden clearness in his mind  here was a godsent opportunity  ‘my dear’ said he ‘would you like a present of a pretty bag’  the child cried aloud with joy and put out her hands to take it  she had looked first at the bag like a true child but most unfortunately before she had yet received the fatal gift her eyes fell directly on m’guire and no sooner had she seen the poor gentleman’s face than she screamed out and leaped backward as though she had seen the devil almost at the same moment a woman appeared upon the threshold of a neighbouring shop and called upon the child in anger  ‘come here colleen’ she said ‘and don’t be plaguing the poor old gentleman’  with that she reentered the house and the child followed her sobbing aloud  with the loss of this hope m’guire’s reason swooned within him  when next he awoke to consciousness he was standing before st martin’sinthefields wavering like a drunken man the passersby regarding him with eyes in which he read as in a glass an image of the terror and horror that dwelt within his own  ‘i am afraid you are very ill sir’ observed a woman stopping and gazing hard in his face  ‘can i do anything to help you’  ‘ill’ said m’guire  ‘o god’  and then recovering some shadow of his selfcommand ‘chronic madam’ said he ‘a long course of the dumb ague but since you are so compassionate—an errand that i lack the strength to carry out’ he gasped—‘this bag to portman square  oh compassionate woman as you hope to be saved as you are a mother in the name of your babes that wait to welcome you at home oh take this bag to portman square  i have a mother too’ he added with a broken voice  ‘number 19 portman square’  i suppose he had expressed himself with too much energy of voice for the woman was plainly taken with a certain fear of him  ‘poor gentleman’ said she  ‘if i were you i would go home’  and she left him standing there in his distress  ‘home’ thought m’guire ‘what a derision’  what home was there for him the victim of philanthropy  he thought of his old mother of his happy youth of the hideous rending pang of the explosion of the possibility that he might not be killed that he might be cruelly mangled crippled for life condemned to lifelong pains blinded perhaps and almost surely deafened  ah you spoke lightly of the dynamiter’s peril but even waiving death have you realised what it is for a fine brave young man of forty to be smitten suddenly with deafness cut off from all the music of life and from the voice of friendship and love  how little do we realise the sufferings of others  even your brutal government in the heyday of its lust for cruelty though it scruples not to hound the patriot with spies to pack the corrupt jury to bribe the hangman and to erect the infamous gallows would hesitate to inflict so horrible a doom not i am well aware from virtue not from philanthropy but with the fear before it of the withering scorn of the good  but i wander from m’guire  from this dread glance into the past and future his thoughts returned at a bound upon the present  how had he wandered there and how long—oh heavens how long had he been about it he pulled out his watch and found that but three minutes had elapsed it seemed too bright a thing to be believed  he glanced at the church clock and sure enough it marked an hour four minutes faster than the watch  of all that he endured m’guire declares that pang was the most desolate till then he had had one friend one counsellor in whom he plenarily trusted by whose advertisement he numbered the minutes that remained to him of life on whose sure testimony he could tell when the time was come to risk the last adventure to cast the bag away from him and take to flight  and now in what was he to place reliance  his watch was slow it might be losing time if so in what degree  what limit could he set to its derangement and how much was it possible for a watch to lose in thirty minutes  five ten fifteen  it might be so already it seemed years since he had left st james’s hall on this so promising enterprise at any moment then the blow was to be looked for  in the face of this new distress the wild disorder of his pulses settled down and a broken weariness succeeded as though he had lived for centuries and for centuries been dead  the buildings and the people in the street became incredibly small and faraway and bright london sounded in his ears stilly like a whisper and the rattle of the cab that nearly charged him down was like a sound from africa  meanwhile he was conscious of a strange abstraction from himself and heard and felt his footfalls on the ground as those of a very old small debile and tragically fortuned man whom he sincerely pitied  as he was thus moving forward past the national gallery in a medium it seemed of greater rarity and quiet than ordinary air there slipped into his mind the recollection of a certain entry in whitcomb street hard by where he might perhaps lay down his tragic cargo unremarked  thither then he bent his steps seeming as he went to float above the pavement and there in the mouth of the entry he found a man in a sleeved waistcoat gravely chewing a straw  he passed him by and twice patrolled the entry scouting for the barest chance but the man had faced about and continued to observe him curiously  another hope was gone  m’guire reissued from the entry still followed by the wondering eyes of the man in the sleeved waistcoat  he once more consulted his watch there were but fourteen minutes left to him  at that it seemed as if a sudden genial heat were spread about his brain for a second or two he saw the world as red as blood and thereafter entered into a complete possession of himself with an incredible cheerfulness of spirits prompting him to sing and chuckle as he walked and yet this mirth seemed to belong to things external and within like a black and leadenheavy kernel he was conscious of the weight upon his soul      i care for nobody no not i     and nobody cares for me  he sang and laughed at the appropriate burthen so that the passengers stared upon him on the street  and still the warmth seemed to increase and to become more genial  what was life he considered and what he m’guire  what even erin our green erin  all seemed so incalculably little that he smiled as he looked down upon it  he would have given years had he possessed them for a glass of spirits but time failed and he must deny himself this last indulgence  at the corner of the haymarket he very jauntily hailed a hansom cab jumped in bade the fellow drive him to a part of the embankment which he named and as soon as the vehicle was in motion concealed the bag as completely as he could under the vantage of the apron and once more drew out his watch  so he rode for five interminable minutes his heart in his mouth at every jolt scarce able to possess his terrors yet fearing to wake the attention of the driver by too obvious a change of plan and willing if possible to leave him time to forget the gladstone bag  at length at the head of some stairs on the embankment he hailed the cab was stopped and he alighted—with how glad a heart  he thrust his hand into his pocket  all was now over he had saved his life nor that alone but he had engineered a striking act of dynamite for what could be more pictorial what more effective than the explosion of a hansom cab as it sped rapidly along the streets of london  he felt in one pocket then in another  the most crushing seizure of despair descended on his soul and struck into abject dumbness he stared upon the driver he had not one penny  ‘hillo’ said the driver ‘don’t seem well’  ‘lost my money’ said m’guire in tones so faint and strange that they surprised his hearing  the man looked through the trap  ‘i dessay’ said he ‘you’ve left your bag’  m’guire half unconsciously fetched it out and looking on that black continent at arm’s length withered inwardly and felt his features sharpen as with mortal sickness  ‘this is not mine’ said he  ‘your last fare must have left it  you had better take it to the station’  ‘now look here’ returned the cabman ‘are you off your chump or am i’  ‘well then i’ll tell you what’ exclaimed m’guire ‘you take it for your fare’  ‘oh i dessay’ replied the driver  ‘anything else  what’s in your bag  open it and let me see’  ‘no no’ returned m’guire  ‘oh no not that  it’s a surprise it’s prepared expressly a surprise for honest cabmen’  ‘no you don’t’ said the man alighting from his perch and coming very close to the unhappy patriot  ‘you’re either going to pay my fare or get in again and drive to the office’  it was at this supreme hour of his distress that m’guire spied the stout figure of one godall a tobacconist of rupert street drawing near along the embankment  the man was not unknown to him he had bought of his wares and heard him quoted for the soul of liberality and such was now the nearness of his peril that even at such a straw of hope he clutched with gratitude  ‘thank god’ he cried  ‘here comes a friend of mine  i’ll borrow’  and he dashed to meet the tradesman  ‘sir’ said he ‘mr godall i have dealt with you—you doubtless know my face—calamities for which i cannot blame myself have overwhelmed me  oh sir for the love of innocence for the sake of the bonds of humanity and as you hope for mercy at the throne of grace lend me twoandsix’  ‘i do not recognise your face’ replied mr godall ‘but i remember the cut of your beard which i have the misfortune to dislike  here sir is a sovereign which i very willingly advance to you on the single condition that you shave your chin’  m’guire grasped the coin without a word cast it to the cabman calling out to him to keep the change bounded down the steps flung the bag far forth into the river and fell headlong after it  he was plucked from a watery grave it is believed by the hands of mr godall  even as he was being hoisted dripping to the shore a dull and choked explosion shook the solid masonry of the embankment and far out in the river a momentary fountain rose and disappeared     the superfluous mansion continued   somerset in vain strove to attach a meaning to these words  he had in the meanwhile applied himself assiduously to the flagon the plotter began to melt in twain and seemed to expand and hover on his seat and with a vague sense of nightmare the young man rose unsteadily to his feet and refusing the proffer of a third grog insisted that the hour was late and he must positively get to bed  ‘dear me’ observed zero ‘i find you very temperate  but i will not be oppressive  suffice it that we are now fast friends and my dear landlord au revoir’  so saying the plotter once more shook hands and with the politest ceremonies and some necessary guidance conducted the bewildered young gentleman to the top of the stair  precisely how he got to bed was a point on which somerset remained in utter darkness but the next morning when at a blow he started broad awake there fell upon his mind a perfect hurricane of horror and wonder that he should have suffered himself to be led into the semblance of intimacy with such a man as his abominable lodger appeared in the cold light of day a mystery of human weakness  true he was caught in a situation that might have tested the aplomb of talleyrand  that was perhaps a palliation but it was no excuse  for so wholesale a capitulation of principle for such a fall into criminal familiarity no excuse indeed was possible nor any remedy but to withdraw at once from the relation  as soon as he was dressed he hurried upstairs determined on a rupture zero hailed him with the warmth of an old friend  ‘come in’ he cried ‘dear mr somerset  come in sit down and without ceremony join me at my morning meal’  ‘sir’ said somerset ‘you must permit me first to disengage my honour last night i was surprised into a certain appearance of complicity but once for all let me inform you that i regard you and your machinations \with unmingled horror and disgust and i will leave no stone unturned to crush your vile conspiracy’  ‘my dear fellow’ replied zero with an air of some complacency ‘i am well accustomed to these human weaknesses  disgust  i have felt it myself it speedily wears off  i think none the worse i think the more of you for this engaging frankness  and in the meanwhile what are you to do  you find yourself if i interpret rightly in very much the same situation as charles the second possibly the least degraded of your british sovereigns when he was taken into the confidence of the thief to denounce me is out of the question and what else can you attempt no dear mr somerset your hands are tied and you find yourself condemned under pain of behaving like a cad to be that same charming and intellectual companion who delighted me last night’  ‘at least’ cried somerset ‘i can and do order you to leave this house’  ‘ah’ cried the plotter ‘but there i fail to follow you  you may if you please enact the part of judas but if as i suppose you recoil from that extremity of meanness i am on my side far too intelligent to leave these lodgings in which i please myself exceedingly and from which you lack the power to drive me  no no dear sir here i am and here i propose to stay’  ‘i repeat’ cried somerset beside himself with a sense of his own weakness ‘i repeat that i give you warning  i am the master of this house and i emphatically give you warning’  ‘a week’s warning’ said the imperturbable conspirator  ‘very well we will talk of it a week from now  that is arranged and in the meanwhile i observe my breakfast growing cold  do dear mr somerset since you find yourself condemned for a week at least to the society of a very interesting character display some of that open favour some of that interest in life’s obscurer sides which stamp the character of the true artist  hang me if you will tomorrow but today show yourself divested of the scruples of the burgess and sit down pleasantly to share my meal’  ‘man’ cried somerset ‘do you understand my sentiments’  ‘certainly’ replied zero ‘and i respect them  would you be outdone in such a contest will you alone be partial and in this nineteenth century cannot two gentlemen of education agree to differ on a point of politics  come sir all your hard words have left me smiling judge then which of us is the philosopher’  somerset was a young man of a very tolerant disposition and by nature easily amenable to sophistry  he threw up his hands with a gesture of despair and took the seat to which the conspirator invited him  the meal was excellent the host not only affable but primed with curious information  he seemed indeed like one who had too long endured the torture of silence to exult in the most wholesale disclosures  the interest of what he had to tell was great his character besides developed step by step and somerset as the time fled not only outgrew some of the discomfort of his false position but began to regard the conspirator with a familiarity that verged upon contempt  in any circumstances he had a singular inability to leave the society in which he found himself company even if distasteful held him captive like a limed sparrow and on this occasion he suffered hour to follow hour was easily persuaded to sit down once more to table and did not even attempt to withdraw till on the approach of evening zero with many apologies dismissed his guest  his fellowconspirators the dynamiter handsomely explained as they were unacquainted with the sterling qualities of the young man would be alarmed at the sight of a strange face  as soon as he was alone somerset fell back upon the humour of the morning  he raged at the thought of his facility he paced the diningroom forming the sternest resolutions for the future he wrung the hand which had been dishonoured by the touch of an assassin and among all these whirling thoughts there flashed in from time to time and ever with a chill of fear the thought of the confounded ingredients with which the house was stored  a powder magazine seemed a secure smokingroom alongside of the superfluous mansion  he sought refuge in flight in locomotion in the flowing bowl  as long as the bars were open he travelled from one to another seeking light safety and the companionship of human faces when these resources failed him he fell back on the belated bakedpotato man and at length still pacing the streets he was goaded to fraternise with the police  alas with what a sense of guilt he conversed with these guardians of the law how gladly had he wept upon their ample bosoms and how the secret fluttered to his lips and was still denied an exit  fatigue began at last to triumph over remorse and about the hour of the first milkman he returned to the door of the mansion looked at it with a horrid expectation as though it should have burst that instant into flames drew out his key and when his foot already rested on the steps once more lost heart and fled for repose to the grisly shelter of a coffeeshop  it was on the stroke of noon when he awoke  dismally searching in his pockets he found himself reduced to halfacrown and when he had paid the price of his distasteful couch saw himself obliged to return to the superfluous mansion  he sneaked into the hall and stole on tiptoe to the cupboard where he kept his money  yet half a minute he told himself and he would be free for days from his obseding lodger and might decide at leisure on the course he should pursue  but fate had otherwise designed there came a tap at the door and zero entered  ‘have i caught you’ he cried with innocent gaiety  ‘dear fellow i was growing quite impatient’  and on the speaker’s somewhat stolid face there came a glow of genuine affection  ‘i am so long unused to have a friend’ he continued ‘that i begin to be afraid i may prove jealous’ and he wrung the hand of his landlord  somerset was of all men least fit to deal with such a greeting  to reject these kind advances was beyond his strength  that he could not return cordiality for cordiality was already almost more than he could carry  that inequality between kind sentiments which to generous characters will always seem to be a sort of guilt oppressed him to the ground and he stammered vague and lying words  ‘that is all right’ cried zero—‘that is as it should be—say no more  i had a vague alarm i feared you had deserted me but i now own that fear to have been unworthy and apologise  to doubt of your forgiveness were to repeat my sin  come then dinner waits join me again and tell me your adventures of the night’  kindness still sealed the lips of somerset and he suffered himself once more to be set down to table with his innocent and criminal acquaintance once more the plotter plunged up to the neck in damaging disclosures now it would be the name and biography of an individual now the address of some important centre that rose as if by accident upon his lips and each word was like another turn of the thumbscrew to his unhappy guest  finally the course of zero’s bland monologue led him to the young lady of two days ago that young lady who had flashed on somerset for so brief a while but with so conquering a charm and whose engaging grace communicative eyes and admirable conduct of the sweeping skirt remained imprinted on his memory  ‘you saw her’ said zero  ‘beautiful is she not  she too is one of ours a true enthusiast nervous perhaps in presence of the chemicals but in matters of intrigue the very soul of skill and daring  lake fonblanque de marly valdevia such are some of the names that she employs her true name—but there perhaps i go too far  suffice it that it is to her i owe my present lodging and dear somerset the pleasure of your acquaintance  it appears she knew the house  you see dear fellow i make no concealment all that you can care to hear i tell you openly’  ‘for god’s sake’ cried the wretched somerset ‘hold your tongue  you cannot imagine how you torture me’  a shade of serious discomposure crossed the open countenance of zero  ‘there are times’ he said ‘when i begin to fancy that you do not like me  why why dear somerset this lack of cordiality  i am depressed the touchstone of my life draws near and if i fail’—he gloomily nodded—‘from all the height of my ambitious schemes i fall dear boy into contempt  these are grave thoughts and you may judge my need of your delightful company  innocent prattler you relieve the weight of my concerns  and yet    and yet   ’  the speaker pushed away his plate and rose from table  ‘follow me’ said he ‘follow me  my mood is on i must have air i must behold the plain of battle’  so saying he led the way hurriedly to the top flat of the mansion and thence by ladder and trap to a certain leaded platform sheltered at one end by a great stalk of chimneys and occupying the actual summit of the roof  on both sides it bordered without parapet or rail on the incline of slates and northward above all commanded an extensive view of housetops and rising through the smoke the distant spires of churches  ‘here’ cried zero ‘you behold this field of city rich crowded laughing with the spoil of continents but soon how soon to be laid low  some day some night from this coign of vantage you shall perhaps be startled by the detonation of the judgment gun—not sharp and empty like the crack of cannon but deepmouthed and unctuously solemn instantly thereafter you shall behold the flames break forth  ay’ he cried stretching forth his hand ‘ay that will be a day of retribution then shall the pallid constable flee side by side with the detected thief  blaze’ he cried ‘blaze derided city  fall flatulent monarchy fall like dagon’  with these words his foot slipped upon the lead and but for somerset’s quickness he had been instantly precipitated into space  pale as a sheet and limp as a pockethandkerchief he was dragged from the edge of downfall by one arm helped or rather carried down the ladder and deposited in safety on the attic landing  here he began to come to himself wiped his brow and at length seizing somerset’s hand in both of his began to utter his acknowledgments  ‘this seals it’ said he  ‘ours is a life and death connection  you have plucked me from the jaws of death and if i were before attracted by your character judge now of the ardour of my gratitude and love  but i perceive i am still greatly shaken  lend me i beseech you lend me your arm as far as my apartment’  a dram of spirits restored the plotter to something of his customary selfpossession and he was standing glass in hand and genially convalescent when his eye was attracted by the dejection of the unfortunate young man  ‘good heavens dear somerset’ he cried ‘what ails you  let me offer you a touch of spirits’  but somerset had fallen below the reach of this material comfort  ‘let me be’ he said  ‘i am lost you have caught me in the toils  up to this moment i have lived all my life in the most reckless manner and done exactly what i pleased with the most perfect innocence  and now—what am i  are you so blind and wooden that you do not see the loathing you inspire me with  is it possible you can suppose me willing to continue to exist upon such terms  to think’ he cried ‘that a young man guilty of no fault on earth but amiability should find himself involved in such a damned imbroglio’  and placing his knuckles in his eyes somerset rolled upon the sofa  ‘my god’ said zero ‘is this possible  and i so filled with tenderness and interest  can it be dear somerset that you are under the empire of these outworn scruples or that you judge a patriot by the morality of the religious tract  i thought you were a good agnostic’  ‘mr jones’ said somerset ‘it is in vain to argue  i boast myself a total disbeliever not only in revealed religion but in the data method and conclusions of the whole of ethics  well what matters it what signifies a form of words  i regard you as a reptile whom i would rejoice whom i long to stamp under my heel  you would blow up others well then understand i want with every circumstance of infamy and agony to blow up you’  ‘somerset somerset’ said zero turning very pale ‘this is wrong this is very wrong  you pain you wound me somerset’  ‘give me a match’ cried somerset wildly  ‘let me set fire to this incomparable monster  let me perish with him in his fall’  ‘for god’s sake’ cried zero clutching hold of the young man ‘for god’s sake command yourself  we stand upon the brink death yawns around us a man—a stranger in this foreign land—one whom you have called your friend—’  ‘silence’ cried somerset ‘you are no friend no friend of mine  i look on you with loathing like a toad my flesh creeps with physical repulsion my soul revolts against the sight of you’  zero burst into tears  ‘alas’ he sobbed ‘this snaps the last link that bound me to humanity  my friend disowns—he insults me  i am indeed accurst’  somerset stood for an instant staggered by this sudden change of front the next moment with a despairing gesture he fled from the room and from the house  the first dash of his escape carried him hard upon halfway to the next policeoffice but presently began to droop and before he reached the house of lawful intervention he fell once more among doubtful counsels  was he an agnostic had he a right to act away with such nonsense and let zero perish ran his thoughts  and then again had he not promised had he not shaken hands and broken bread and that with open eyes and if so how could he take action and not forfeit honour  but honour what was honour  a figment which in the hot pursuit of crime he ought to dash aside  ay but crime  a figment too which his enfranchised intellect discarded  all day he wandered in the parks a prey to whirling thoughts all night patrolled the city and at the peep of day he sat down by the wayside in the neighbourhood of peckham and bitterly wept  his gods had fallen  he who had chosen the broad daylit unencumbered paths of universal scepticism found himself still the bondslave of honour  he who had accepted life from a point of view as lofty as the predatory eagle’s though with no design to prey he who had clearly recognised the common moral basis of war of commercial competition and of crime he who was prepared to help the escaping murderer or to embrace the impenitent thief found to the overthrow of all his logic that he objected to the use of dynamite  the dawn crept among the sleeping villas and over the smokeless fields of city and still the unfortunate sceptic sobbed over his fall from consistency  at length he rose and took the rising sun to witness  ‘there is no question as to fact’ he cried ‘right and wrong are but figments and the shadow of a word but for all that there are certain things that i cannot do and there are certain others that i will not stand’ thereupon he decided to return to make one last effort of persuasion and if he could not prevail on zero to desist from his infernal trade throw delicacy to the winds give the plotter an hour’s start and denounce him to the police  fast as he went being winged by this resolution it was already well on in the morning when he came in sight of the superfluous mansion  tripping down the steps was the young lady of the various aliases and he was surprised to see upon her countenance the marks of anger and concern  ‘madam’ he began yielding to impulse and with no clear knowledge of what he was to add  but at the sound of his voice she seemed to experience a shock of fear or horror started back lowered her veil with a sudden movement and fled without turning from the square  here then we step aside a moment from following the fortunes of somerset and proceed to relate the strange and romantic episode of the brown box     desborough’s adventure   the brown box   mr harry desborough lodged in the fine and grave old quarter of bloomsbury roared about on every side by the high tides of london but itself rejoicing in romantic silences and city peace  it was in queen square that he had pitched his tent next door to the children’s hospital on your left hand as you go north queen square sacred to humane and liberal arts whence homes were made beautiful where the poor were taught where the sparrows were plentiful and loud and where groups of patient little ones would hover all day long before the hospital if by chance they might kiss their hand or speak a word to their sick brother at the window  desborough’s room was on the first floor and fronted to the square but he enjoyed besides a right by which he often profited to sit and smoke upon a terrace at the back which looked down upon a fine forest of back gardens and was in turn commanded by the windows of an empty room  on the afternoon of a warm day desborough sauntered forth upon this terrace somewhat out of hope and heart for he had been now some weeks on the vain quest of situations and prepared for melancholy and tobacco here at least he told himself that he would be alone for like most youths who are neither rich nor witty nor successful he rather shunned than courted the society of other men  even as he expressed the thought his eye alighted on the window of the room that looked upon the terrace and to his surprise and annoyance he beheld it curtained with a silken hanging  it was like his luck he thought his privacy was gone he could no longer brood and sigh unwatched he could no longer suffer his discouragement to find a vent in words or soothe himself with sentimental whistling and in the irritation of the moment he struck his pipe upon the rail with unnecessary force  it was an old sweet seasoned briarroot glossy and dark with long employment and justly dear to his fancy  what then was his chagrin when the head snapped from the stem leaped airily in space and fell and disappeared among the lilacs of the garden  he threw himself savagely into the garden chair pulled out the storypaper which he had brought with him to read tore off a fragment of the last sheet which contains only the answers to correspondents and set himself to roll a cigarette  he was no master of the art again and again the paper broke between his fingers and the tobacco showered upon the ground and he was already on the point of angry resignation when the window swung slowly inward the silken curtain was thrust aside and a lady somewhat strangely attired stepped forth upon the terrace  ‘señorito’ said she and there was a rich thrill in her voice like an organ note ‘señorito you are in difficulties  suffer me to come to your assistance’  with the words she took the paper and tobacco from his unresisting hands and with a facility that in desborough’s eyes seemed magical rolled and presented him a cigarette  he took it still seated still without a word staring with all his eyes upon that apparition  her face was warm and rich in colour in shape it was that piquant triangle so innocently sly so saucily attractive so rare in our more northern climates her eyes were large starry and visited by changing lights her hair was partly covered by a lace mantilla through which her arms bare to the shoulder gleamed white her figure full and soft in all the womanly contours was yet alive and active light with excess of life and slender by grace of some divine proportion  ‘you do not like my cigarrito señor’ she asked  ‘yet it is better made than yours’  at that she laughed and her laughter trilled in his ear like music but the next moment her face fell  ‘i see’ she cried  ‘it is my manner that repels you  i am too constrained too cold  i am not’ she added with a more engaging air ‘i am not the simple english maiden i appear’  ‘oh’ murmured harry filled with inexpressible thoughts  ‘in my own dear land’ she pursued ‘things are differently ordered there i must own a girl is bound by many and rigorous restrictions little is permitted her she learns to be distant she learns to appear forbidding  but here in free england—oh glorious liberty’ she cried and threw up her arms with a gesture of inimitable grace—‘here there are no fetters here the woman may dare to be herself entirely and the men the chivalrous men—is it not written on the very shield of your nation honi soit  ah it is hard for me to learn hard for me to dare to be myself  you must not judge me yet awhile i shall end by conquering this stiffness i shall end by growing english  do i speak the language well’  ‘perfectly—oh perfectly’ said harry with a fervency of conviction worthy of a graver subject  ‘ah then’ she said ‘i shall soon learn english blood ran in my father’s veins and i have had the advantage of some training in your expressive tongue  if i speak already without accent with my thorough english appearance there is nothing left to change except my manners’  ‘oh no’ said desborough  ‘oh pray not  i—madam—’  ‘i am’ interrupted the lady ‘the señorita teresa valdevia  the evening air grows chill  adios señorito’  and before harry could stammer out a word she had disappeared into her room  he stood transfixed the cigarette still unlighted in his hand  his thoughts had soared above tobacco and still recalled and beautified the image of his new acquaintance  her voice reechoed in his memory her eyes of which he could not tell the colour haunted his soul  the clouds had risen at her coming and he beheld a newcreated world  what she was he could not fancy but he adored her  her age he durst not estimate fearing to find her older than himself and thinking sacrilege to couple that fair favour with the thought of mortal changes  as for her character beauty to the young is always good  so the poor lad lingered late upon the terrace stealing timid glances at the curtained window sighing to the gold laburnums rapt into the country of romance and when at length he entered and sat down to dine on cold boiled mutton and a pint of ale he feasted on the food of gods  next day when he returned to the terrace the window was a little ajar and he enjoyed a view of the lady’s shoulder as she sat patiently sewing and all unconscious of his presence  on the next he had scarce appeared when the window opened and the señorita tripped forth into the sunlight in a morning disorder delicately neat and yet somehow foreign tropical and strange  in one hand she held a packet  ‘will you try’ she said ‘some of my father’s tobacco—from dear cuba there as i suppose you know all smoke ladies as well as gentlemen  so you need not fear to annoy me  the fragrance will remind me of home  my home señor was by the sea’  and as she uttered these few words desborough for the first time in his life realised the poetry of the great deep  ‘awake or asleep i dream of it dear home dear cuba’  ‘but some day’ said desborough with an inward pang ‘some day you will return’  ‘never’ she cried ‘ah never in heaven’s name’  ‘are you then resident for life in england’ he inquired with a strange lightening of spirit  ‘you ask too much for you ask more than i know’ she answered sadly and then resuming her gaiety of manner ‘but you have not tried my cuban tobacco’ she said  ‘señorita’ said he shyly abashed by some shadow of coquetry in her manner ‘whatever comes to me—you—i mean’ he concluded deeply flushing ‘that i have no doubt the tobacco is delightful’  ‘ah señor’ she said with almost mournful gravity ‘you seemed so simple and good and already you are trying to pay compliments—and besides’ she added brightening with a quick upward glance into a smile ‘you do it so badly  english gentlemen i used to hear could be fast friends respectful honest friends could be companions comforters if the need arose or champions and yet never encroach  do not seek to please me by copying the graces of my countrymen  be yourself the frank kindly honest english gentleman that i have heard of since my childhood and still longed to meet’  harry much bewildered and far from clear as to the manners of the cuban gentlemen strenuously disclaimed the thought of plagiarism  ‘your national seriousness of bearing best becomes you señor’ said the lady  ‘see’ marking a line with her dainty slippered foot ‘thus far it shall be common ground there at my windowsill begins the scientific frontier  if you choose you may drive me to my forts but if on the other hand we are to be real english friends i may join you here when i am not too sad or when i am yet more graciously inclined you may draw your chair beside the window and teach me english customs while i work  you will find me an apt scholar for my heart is in the task’  she laid her hand lightly upon harry’s arm and looked into his eyes  ‘do you know’ said she ‘i am emboldened to believe that i have already caught something of your english aplomb  do you not perceive a change señor  slight perhaps but still a change  is my deportment not more open more free more like that of the dear “british miss” than when you saw me first’  she gave a radiant smile withdrew her hand from harry’s arm and before the young man could formulate in words the eloquent emotions that ran riot through his brain—with an ‘adios señor goodnight my english friend’ she vanished from his sight behind the curtain  the next day harry consumed an ounce of tobacco in vain upon the neutral terrace neither sight nor sound rewarded him and the dinnerhour summoned him at length from the scene of disappointment  on the next it rained but nothing neither business nor weather neither prospective poverty nor present hardship could now divert the young man from the service of his lady and wrapt in a long ulster with the collar raised he took his stand against the balustrade awaiting fortune the picture of damp and discomfort to the eye but glowing inwardly with tender and delightful ardours  presently the window opened and the fair cuban with a smile imperfectly dissembled appeared upon the sill  ‘come here’ she said ‘here beside my window  the small verandah gives a belt of shelter’  and she graciously handed him a foldingchair  as he sat down visibly aglow with shyness and delight a certain bulkiness in his pocket reminded him that he was not come emptyhanded  ‘i have taken the liberty’ said he ‘of bringing you a little book  i thought of you when i observed it on the stall because i saw it was in spanish  the man assured me it was by one of the best authors and quite proper’  as he spoke he placed the little volume in her hand  her eyes fell as she turned the pages and a flush rose and died again upon her cheeks as deep as it was fleeting  ‘you are angry’ he cried in agony ‘i have presumed’  ‘no señor it is not that’ returned the lady  ‘i—’ and a flood of colour once more mounted to her brow—‘i am confused and ashamed because i have deceived you  spanish’ she began and paused—‘spanish is of course my native tongue’ she resumed as though suddenly taking courage ‘and this should certainly put the highest value on your thoughtful present but alas sir of what use is it to me  and how shall i confess to you the truth—the humiliating truth—that i cannot read’  as harry’s eyes met hers in undisguised amazement the fair cuban seemed to shrink before his gaze  ‘read’ repeated harry  ‘you’  she pushed the window still more widely open with a large and noble gesture  ‘enter señor’ said she  ‘the time has come to which i have long looked forward not without alarm when i must either fear to lose your friendship or tell you without disguise the story of my life’  it was with a sentiment bordering on devotion that harry passed the window  a semibarbarous delight in form and colour had presided over the studied disorder of the room in which he found himself  it was filled with dainty stuffs furs and rugs and scarves of brilliant hues and set with elegant and curious triflesfans on the mantelshelf an antique lamp upon a bracket and on the table a silvermounted bowl of cocoanut about half full of unset jewels  the fair cuban herself a gem of colour and the fit masterpiece for that rich frame motioned harry to a seat and sinking herself into another thus began her history    story of the fair cuban   i am not what i seem  my father drew his descent on the one hand from grandees of spain and on the other through the maternal line from the patriot bruce  my mother too was the descendant of a line of kings but alas these kings were african  she was fair as the day fairer than i for i inherited a darker strain of blood from the veins of my european father her mind was noble her manners queenly and accomplished and seeing her more than the equal of her neighbours and surrounded by the most considerate affection and respect i grew up to adore her and when the time came received her last sigh upon my lips still ignorant that she was a slave and alas my father’s mistress  her death which befell me in my sixteenth year was the first sorrow i had known it left our home bereaved of its attractions cast a shade of melancholy on my youth and wrought in my father a tragic and durable change  months went by with the elasticity of my years i regained some of the simple mirth that had before distinguished me the plantation smiled with fresh crops the negroes on the estate had already forgotten my mother and transferred their simple obedience to myself but still the cloud only darkened on the brows of señor valdevia  his absences from home had been frequent even in the old days for he did business in precious gems in the city of havana they now became almost continuous and when he returned it was but for the night and with the manner of a man crushed down by adverse fortune  the place where i was born and passed my days was an isle set in the caribbean sea some halfhour’s rowing from the coasts of cuba  it was steep rugged and except for my father’s family and plantation uninhabited and left to nature  the house a low building surrounded by spacious verandahs stood upon a rise of ground and looked across the sea to cuba  the breezes blew about it gratefully fanned us as we lay swinging in our silken hammocks and tossed the boughs and flowers of the magnolia  behind and to the left the quarter of the negroes and the waving fields of the plantation covered an eighth part of the surface of the isle  on the right and closely bordering on the garden lay a vast and deadly swamp densely covered with wood breathing fever dotted with profound sloughs and inhabited by poisonous oysters maneating crabs snakes alligators and sickly fishes  into the recesses of that jungle none could penetrate but those of african descent an invisible unconquerable foe lay there in wait for the european and the air was death  one morning from which i must date the beginning of my ruinous misfortune i left my room a little after day for in that warm climate all are early risers and found not a servant to attend upon my wants  i made the circuit of the house still calling and my surprise had almost changed into alarm when coming at last into a large verandahed court i found it thronged with negroes  even then even when i was amongst them not one turned or paid the least regard to my arrival  they had eyes and ears for but one person a woman richly and tastefully attired of elegant carriage and a musical speech not so much old in years as worn and marred by selfindulgence her face which was still attractive stamped with the most cruel passions her eye burning with the greed of evil  it was not from her appearance i believe but from some emanation of her soul that i recoiled in a kind of fainting terror as we hear of plants that blight and snakes that fascinate the woman shocked and daunted me  but i was of a brave nature trod the weakness down and forcing my way through the slaves who fell back before me in embarrassment as though in the presence of rival mistresses i asked in imperious tones ‘who is this person’  a slave girl to whom i had been kind whispered in my ear to have a care for that was madam mendizabal but the name was new to me  in the meanwhile the woman applying a pair of glasses to her eyes studied me with insolent particularity from head to foot  ‘young woman’ said she at last ‘i have had a great experience in refractory servants and take a pride in breaking them  you really tempt me and if i had not other affairs and these of more importance on my hand i should certainly buy you at your father’s sale’  ‘madam—’ i began but my voice failed me  ‘is it possible that you do not know your position’ she returned with a hateful laugh  ‘how comical  positively i must buy her accomplishments i suppose’ she added turning to the servants  several assured her that the young mistress had been brought up like any lady for so it seemed in their inexperience  ‘she would do very well for my place of business in havana’ said the señora mendizabal once more studying me through her glasses ‘and i should take a pleasure’ she pursued more directly addressing myself ‘in bringing you acquainted with a whip’  and she smiled at me with a savoury lust of cruelty upon her face  at this i found expression  calling by name upon the servants i bade them turn this woman from the house fetch her to the boat and set her back upon the mainland  but with one voice they protested that they durst not obey coming close about me pleading and beseeching me to be more wise and when i insisted rising higher in passion and speaking of this foul intruder in the terms she had deserved they fell back from me as from one who had blasphemed  a superstitious reverence plainly encircled the stranger i could read it in their changed demeanour and in the paleness that prevailed upon the natural colour of their faces and their fear perhaps reacted on myself  i looked again at madam mendizabal  she stood perfectly composed watching my face through her glasses with a smile of scorn and at the sight of her assured superiority to all my threats a cry broke from my lips a cry of rage fear and despair and i fled from the verandah and the house  i ran i knew not where but it was towards the beach  as i went my head whirled so strange so sudden were these events and insults  who was she what in heaven’s name the power she wielded over my obedient negroes  why had she addressed me as a slave why spoken of my father’s sale  to all these tumultuary questions i could find no answer and in the turmoil of my mind nothing was plain except the hateful leering image of the woman  i was still running mad with fear and anger when i saw my father coming to meet me from the landingplace and with a cry that i thought would have killed me leaped into his arms and broke into a passion of sobs and tears upon his bosom  he made me sit down below a tall palmetto that grew not far off comforted me but with some abstraction in his voice and as soon as i regained the least command upon my feelings asked me not without harshness what this grief betokened  i was surprised by his tone into a still greater measure of composure and in firm tones though still interrupted by sobs i told him there was a stranger in the island at which i thought he started and turned pale that the servants would not obey me that the stranger’s name was madam mendizabal and at that he seemed to me both troubled and relieved that she had insulted me treated me as a slave and here my father’s brow began to darken threatened to buy me at a sale and questioned my own servants before my face and that at last finding myself quite helpless and exposed to these intolerable liberties i had fled from the house in terror indignation and amazement  ‘teresa’ said my father with singular gravity of voice ‘i must make today a call upon your courage much must be told you there is much that you must do to help me and my daughter must prove herself a woman by her spirit  as for this mendizabal what shall i say or how am i to tell you what she is  twenty years ago she was the loveliest of slaves today she is what you see her—prematurely old disgraced by the practice of every vice and every nefarious industry but free rich married they say to some reputable man whom may heaven assist and exercising among her ancient mates the slaves of cuba an influence as unbounded as its reason is mysterious  horrible rites it is supposed cement her empire the rites of hoodoo  be that as it may i would have you dismiss the thought of this incomparable witch it is not from her that danger threatens us and into her hands i make bold to promise you shall never fall’  ‘father’ i cried  ‘fall  was there any truth then in her words  am i—o father tell me plain i can bear anything but this suspense’  ‘i will tell you’ he replied with merciful bluntness  ‘your mother was a slave it was my design so soon as i had saved a competence to sail to the free land of britain where the law would suffer me to marry her a design too long procrastinated for death at the last moment intervened  you will now understand the heaviness with which your mother’s memory hangs about my neck’  i cried out aloud in pity for my parents and in seeking to console the survivor i forgot myself  ‘it matters not’ resumed my father  ‘what i have left undone can never be repaired and i must bear the penalty of my remorse  but teresa with so cutting a reminder of the evils of delay i set myself at once to do what was still possible to liberate yourself’  i began to break forth in thanks but he checked me with a sombre roughness  ‘your mother’s illness’ he resumed ‘had engaged too great a portion of my time my business in the city had lain too long at the mercy of ignorant underlings my head my taste my unequalled knowledge of the more precious stones that art by which i can distinguish even on the darkest night a sapphire from a ruby and tell at a glance in what quarter of the earth a gem was disinterred—all these had been too long absent from the conduct of affairs  teresa i was insolvent’  ‘what matters that’ i cried  ‘what matters poverty if we be left together with our love and sacred memories’  ‘you do not comprehend’ he said gloomily  ‘slave as you are young—alas scarce more than child—accomplished beautiful with the most touching beauty innocent as an angel—all these qualities that should disarm the very wolves and crocodiles are in the eyes of those to whom i stand indebted commodities to buy and sell  you are a chattel a marketable thing and worth—heavens that i should say such words—worth money  do you begin to see  if i were to give you freedom i should defraud my creditors the manumission would be certainly annulled you would be still a slave and i a criminal’  i caught his hand in mine kissed it and moaned in pity for myself in sympathy for my father  ‘how i have toiled’ he continued ‘how i have dared and striven to repair my losses heaven has beheld and will remember  its blessing was denied to my endeavours or as i please myself by thinking but delayed to descend upon my daughter’s head  at length all hope was at an end i was ruined beyond retrieve a heavy debt fell due upon the morrow which i could not meet i should be declared a bankrupt and my goods my lands my jewels that i so much loved my slaves whom i have spoiled and rendered happy and oh tenfold worse you my beloved daughter would be sold and pass into the hands of ignorant and greedy traffickers  too long i saw had i accepted and profited by this great crime of slavery but was my daughter my innocent unsullied daughter was she to pay the price  i cried out—no—i took heaven to witness my temptation i caught up this bag and fled  close upon my track are the pursuers perhaps tonight perhaps tomorrow they will land upon this isle sacred to the memory of the dear soul that bore you to consign your father to an ignominious prison and yourself to slavery and dishonour  we have not many hours before us  off the north coast of our isle by strange good fortune an english yacht has for some days been hovering  it belongs to sir george greville whom i slightly know to whom ere now i have rendered unusual services and who will not refuse to help in our escape or if he did if his gratitude were in default i have the power to force him  for what does it mean my child—what means this englishman who hangs for years upon the shores of cuba and returns from every trip with new and valuable gems’  ‘he may have found a mine’ i hazarded  ‘so he declares’ returned my father ‘but the strange gift i have received from nature easily transpierced the fable  he brought me diamonds only which i bought at first in innocence at a second glance i started for of these stones my child some had first seen the day in africa some in brazil while others from their peculiar water and rude workmanship i divined to be the spoil of ancient temples  thus put upon the scent i made inquiries  oh he is cunning but i was cunninger than he  he visited i found the shop of every jeweller in town to one he came with rubies to one with emeralds to one with precious beryl to all with this same story of the mine  but in what mine what rich epitome of the earth’s surface were there conjoined the rubies of ispahan the pearls of coromandel and the diamonds of golconda  no child that man for all his yacht and title that man must fear and must obey me  tonight then as soon as it is dark we must take our way through the swamp by the path which i shall presently show you thence across the highlands of the isle a track is blazed which shall conduct us to the haven on the north and close by the yacht is riding  should my pursuers come before the hour at which i look to see them they will still arrive too late a trusty man attends on the mainland as soon as they appear we shall behold if it be dark the redness of a fire if it be day a pillar of smoke on the opposing headland and thus warned we shall have time to put the swamp between ourselves and danger  meantime i would conceal this bag i would before all things be seen to arrive at the house with empty hands a blabbing slave might else undo us  for see’ he added and holding up the bag which he had already shown me he poured into my lap a shower of unmounted jewels brighter than flowers of every size and colour and catching as they fell upon a million dainty facets the ardour of the sun  i could not restrain a cry of admiration  ‘even in your ignorant eyes’ pursued my father ‘they command respect yet what are they but pebbles passive to the tool cold as death ingrate’ he cried  ‘each one of these—miracles of nature’s patience conceived out of the dust in centuries of microscopical activity each one is for you and me a year of life liberty and mutual affection how then should i cherish them and why do i delay to place them beyond reach  teresa follow me’  he rose to his feet and led me to the borders of the great jungle where they overhung in a wall of poisonous and dusky foliage the declivity of the hill on which my father’s house stood planted  for some while he skirted with attentive eyes the margin of the thicket  then seeming to recognise some mark for his countenance became immediately lightened of a load of thought he paused and addressed me  ‘here’ said he ‘is the entrance of the secret path that i have mentioned and here you shall await me  i but pass some hundreds of yards into the swamp to bury my poor treasure as soon as that is safe i will return’  it was in vain that i sought to dissuade him urging the dangers of the place in vain that i begged to be allowed to follow pleading the black blood that i now knew to circulate in my veins to all my appeals he turned a deaf ear and bending back a portion of the screen of bushes disappeared into the pestilential silence of the swamp  at the end of a full hour the bushes were once more thrust aside and my father stepped from out the thicket and paused and almost staggered in the first shock of the blinding sunlight  his face was of a singular dusky red and yet for all the heat of the tropical noon he did not seem to sweat  ‘you are tired’ i cried springing to meet him  ‘you are ill’  ‘i am tired’ he replied ‘the air in that jungle stifles one my eyes besides have grown accustomed to its gloom and the strong sunshine pierces them like knives  a moment teresa give me but a moment  all shall yet be well  i have buried the hoard under a cypress immediately beyond the bayou on the lefthand margin of the path beautiful bright things they now lie whelmed in slime you shall find them there if needful  but come let us to the house it is time to eat against our journey of the night to eat and then to sleep my poor teresa then to sleep’  and he looked upon me out of bloodshot eyes shaking his head as if in pity  we went hurriedly for he kept murmuring that he had been gone too long and that the servants might suspect passed through the airy stretch of the verandah and came at length into the grateful twilight of the shuttered house  the meal was spread the house servants already informed by the boatmen of the master’s return were all back at their posts and terrified as i could see to face me  my father still murmuring of haste with weary and feverish pertinacity i hurried at once to take my place at table but i had no sooner left his arm than he paused and thrust forth both his hands with a strange gesture of groping ‘how is this’ he cried in a sharp unhuman voice  ‘am i blind’  i ran to him and tried to lead him to the table but he resisted and stood stiffly where he was opening and shutting his jaws as if in a painful effort after breath  then suddenly he raised both hands to his temples cried out ‘my head my head’ and reeled and fell against the wall  i knew too well what it must be  i turned and begged the servants to relieve him  but they with one accord denied the possibility of hope the master had gone into the swamp they said the master must die all help was idle  why should i dwell upon his sufferings  i had him carried to a bed and watched beside him  he lay still and at times ground his teeth and talked at times unintelligibly only that one word of hurry hurry coming distinctly to my ears and telling me that even in the last struggle with the powers of death his mind was still tortured by his daughter’s peril  the sun had gone down the darkness had fallen when i perceived that i was alone on this unhappy earth what thought had i of flight of safety of the impending dangers of my situation  beside the body of my last friend i had forgotten all except the natural pangs of my bereavement  the sun was some four hours above the eastern line when i was recalled to a knowledge of the things of earth by the entrance of the slavegirl to whom i have already referred  the poor soul was indeed devotedly attached to me and it was with streaming tears that she broke to me the import of her coming  with the first light of dawn a boat had reached our landingplace and set on shore upon our isle till now so fortunate a party of officers bearing a warrant to arrest my father’s person and a man of a gross body and low manners who declared the island the plantation and all its human chattels to be now his own  ‘i think’ said my slavegirl ‘he must be a politician or some very powerful sorcerer for madam mendizabal had no sooner seen them coming than she took to the woods’  ‘fool’ said i ‘it was the officers she feared and at any rate why does that beldam still dare to pollute the island with her presence  and o cora’ i exclaimed remembering my grief ‘what matter all these troubles to an orphan’  ‘mistress’ said she ‘i must remind you of two things  never speak as you do now of madam mendizabal or never to a person of colour for she is the most powerful woman in this world and her real name even if one durst pronounce it were a spell to raise the dead  and whatever you do speak no more of her to your unhappy cora for though it is possible she may be afraid of the police and indeed i think that i have heard she is in hiding and though i know that you will laugh and not believe yet it is true and proved and known that she hears every word that people utter in this whole vast world and your poor cora is already deep enough in her black books  she looks at me mistress till my blood turns ice that is the first i had to say and now for the second do pray for heaven’s sake bear in mind that you are no longer the poor señor’s daughter  he is gone dear gentleman and now you are no more than a common slavegirl like myself  the man to whom you belong calls for you oh my dear mistress go at once  with your youth and beauty you may still if you are winning and obedient secure yourself an easy life’  for a moment i looked on the creature with the indignation you may conceive the next it was gone she did but speak after her kind as the bird sings or cattle bellow  ‘go’ said i  ‘go cora  i thank you for your kind intentions  leave me alone one moment with my dead father and tell this man that i will come at once’  she went and i turning to the bed of death addressed to those deaf ears the last appeal and defence of my beleaguered innocence  ‘father’ i said ‘it was your last thought even in the pangs of dissolution that your daughter should escape disgrace  here at your side i swear to you that purpose shall be carried out by what means i know not by crime if need be and heaven forgive both you and me and our oppressors and heaven help my helplessness’  thereupon i felt strengthened as by long repose stepped to the mirror ay even in that chamber of the dead hastily arranged my hair refreshed my tearworn eyes breathed a dumb farewell to the originator of my days and sorrows and composing my features to a smile went forth to meet my master  he was in a great hot bustle reviewing that house once ours to which he had but now succeeded a corpulent sanguine man of middle age sensual vulgar humorous and if i judged rightly not illdisposed by nature  but the sparkle that came into his eye as he observed me enter warned me to expect the worst  ‘is this your late mistress’ he inquired of the slaves and when he had learnt it was so instantly dismissed them  ‘now my dear’ said he ‘i am a plain man none of your damned spaniards but a true blue hardworking honest englishman  my name is caulder’  ‘thank you sir’ said i and curtsied very smartly as i had seen the servants  ‘come’ said he ‘this is better than i had expected and if you choose to be dutiful in the station to which it has pleased god to call you you will find me a very kind old fellow  i like your looks’ he added calling me by my name which he scandalously mispronounced  ‘is your hair all your own’ he then inquired with a certain sharpness and coming up to me as though i were a horse he grossly satisfied his doubts  i was all one flame from head to foot but i contained my righteous anger and submitted  ‘that is very well’ he continued chucking me good humouredly under the chin  ‘you will have no cause to regret coming to old caulder eh  but that is by the way  what is more to the point is this your late master was a most dishonest rogue and levanted with some valuable property that belonged of rights to me  now considering your relation to him i regard you as the likeliest person to know what has become of it and i warn you before you answer that my whole future kindness will depend upon your honesty  i am an honest man myself and expect the same in my servants’  ‘do you mean the jewels’ said i sinking my voice into a whisper  ‘that is just precisely what i do’ said he and chuckled  ‘hush’ said i  ‘hush’ he repeated  ‘and why hush  i am on my own place i would have you to know and surrounded by my own lawful servants’  ‘are the officers gone’ i asked and oh how my hopes hung upon the answer  ‘they are’ said he looking somewhat disconcerted  ‘why do you ask’  ‘i wish you had kept them’ i answered solemnly enough although my heart at that same moment leaped with exultation  ‘master i must not conceal from you the truth  the servants on this estate are in a dangerous condition and mutiny has long been brewing’  ‘why’ he cried ‘i never saw a milderlooking lot of niggers in my life’  but for all that he turned somewhat pale  ‘did they tell you’ i continued ‘that madam mendizabal is on the island that since her coming they obey none but her that if this morning they have received you with even decent civility it was only by her orders—issued with what afterthought i leave you to consider’  ‘madam jezebel’ said he  ‘well she is a dangerous devil the police are after her besides for a whole series of murders but after all what then  to be sure she has a great influence with you coloured folk but what in fortune’s name can be her errand here’  ‘the jewels’ i replied  ‘ah sir had you seen that treasure sapphire and emerald and opal and the golden topaz and rubies red as the sunset—of what incalculable worth of what unequalled beauty to the eye—had you seen it as i have and alas as she has—you would understand and tremble at your danger’  ‘she has seen them’ he cried and i could see by his face that my audacity was justified by its success  i caught his hand in mine  ‘my master’ said i ‘i am now yours it is my duty it should be my pleasure to defend your interests and life hear my advice then and i conjure you be guided by my prudence follow me privily let none see where we are going i will lead you to the place where the treasure has been buried that once disinterred let us make straight for the boat escape to the mainland and not return to this dangerous isle without the countenance of soldiers’  what free man in a free land would have credited so sudden a devotion but this oppressor through the very arts and sophistries he had abused to quiet the rebellion of his conscience and to convince himself that slavery was natural fell like a child into the trap i laid for him  he praised and thanked me told me i had all the qualities he valued in a servant and when he had questioned me further as to the nature and value of the treasure and i had once more artfully inflamed his greed bade me without delay proceed to carry out my plan of action  from a shed in the garden i took a pick and shovel and thence by devious paths among the magnolias led my master to the entrance of the swamp  i walked first carrying as i was now in duty bound the tools and glancing continually behind me lest we should be spied upon and followed  when we were come as far as the beginning of the path it flashed into my mind i had forgotten meat and leaving mr caulder in the shadow of a tree i returned alone to the house for a basket of provisions  were they for him  i asked myself  and a voice within me answered no while we were face to face while i still saw before my eyes the man to whom i belonged as the hand belongs to the body my indignation held me bravely up  but now that i was alone i conceived a sickness at myself and my designs that i could scarce endure i longed to throw myself at his feet avow my intended treachery and warn him from that pestilential swamp to which i was decoying him to die but my vow to my dead father my duty to my innocent youth prevailed upon these scruples and though my face was pale and must have reflected the horror that oppressed my spirits it was with a firm step that i returned to the borders of the swamp and with smiling lips that i bade him rise and follow me  the path on which we now entered was cut like a tunnel through the living jungle  on either hand and overhead the mass of foliage was continuously joined the day sparingly filtered through the depth of superimpending wood and the air was hot like steam and heady with vegetable odours and lay like a load upon the lungs and brain underfoot a great depth of mould received our silent footprints on each side mimosas as tall as a man shrank from my passing skirts with a continuous hissing rustle and but for these sentient vegetables all in that den of pestilence was motionless and noiseless  we had gone but a little way in when mr caulder was seized with sudden nausea and must sit down a moment on the path  my heart yearned as i beheld him and i seriously begged the doomed mortal to return upon his steps  what were a few jewels in the scales with life i asked  but no he said that witch madam jezebel would find them out he was an honest man and would not stand to be defrauded and so forth panting the while like a sick dog  presently he got to his feet again protesting he had conquered his uneasiness but as we again began to go forward i saw in his changed countenance the first approaches of death  ‘master’ said i ‘you look pale deathly pale your pallor fills me with dread  your eyes are bloodshot they are red like the rubies that we seek’  ‘wench’ he cried ‘look before you look at your steps  i declare to heaven if you annoy me once again by looking back i shall remind you of the change in your position’  a little after i observed a worm upon the ground and told in a whisper that its touch was death  presently a great green serpent vivid as the grass in spring wound rapidly across the path and once again i paused and looked back at my companion with a horror in my eyes ‘the coffin snake’ said i ‘the snake that dogs its victim like a hound’  but he was not to be dissuaded  ‘i am an old traveller’ said he  ‘this is a foul jungle indeed but we shall soon be at an end’  ‘ay’ said i looking at him with a strange smile ‘what end’  thereupon he laughed again and again but not very heartily and then perceiving that the path began to widen and grow higher ‘there’ said he  ‘what did i tell you  we are past the worst’  indeed we had now come to the bayou which was in that place very narrow and bridged across by a fallen trunk but on either hand we could see it broaden out under a cavern of great arms of trees and hanging creepers sluggish putrid of a horrible and sickly stench floated on by the flat heads of alligators and its banks alive with scarlet crabs  ‘if we fall from that unsteady bridge’ said i ‘see where the caiman lies ready to devour us  if by the least divergence from the path we should be snared in a morass see where those myriads of scarlet vermin scour the border of the thicket  once helpless how they would swarm together to the assault  what could man do against a thousand of such mailed assailants  and what a death were that to perish alive under their claws’  ‘are you mad girl’ he cried  ‘i bid you be silent and lead on’  again i looked upon him half relenting and at that he raised the stick that was in his hand and cruelly struck me on the face  ‘lead on’ he cried again  ‘must i be all day catching my death in this vile slough and all for a prating slavegirl’  i took the blow in silence i took it smiling but the blood welled back upon my heart  something i know not what fell at that moment with a dull plunge in the waters of the lagoon and i told myself it was my pity that had fallen  on the farther side to which we now hastily scrambled the wood was not so dense the web of creepers not so solidly convolved  it was possible here and there to mark a patch of somewhat brighter daylight or to distinguish through the lighter web of parasites the proportions of some soaring tree  the cypress on the left stood very visibly forth upon the edge of such a clearing the path in that place widened broadly and there was a patch of open ground beset with horrible antheaps thick with their artificers  i laid down the tools and basket by the cypress root where they were instantly blackened over with the crawling ants and looked once more in the face of my unconscious victim mosquitoes and foul flies wove so close a veil between us that his features were obscured and the sound of their flight was like the turning of a mighty wheel  ‘here’ i said ‘is the spot  i cannot dig for i have not learned to use such instruments but for your own sake i beseech you to be swift in what you do’  he had sunk once more upon the ground panting like a fish and i saw rising in his face the same dusky flush that had mantled on my father’s ‘i feel ill’ he gasped ‘horribly ill the swamp turns around me the drone of these carrion flies confounds me  have you not wine’  i gave him a glass and he drank greedily  ‘it is for you to think’ said i ‘if you should further persevere  the swamp has an ill name’ and at the word i ominously nodded  ‘give me the pick’ said he  ‘where are the jewels buried’  i told him vaguely and in the sweltering heat and closeness and dim twilight of the jungle he began to wield the pickaxe swinging it overhead with the vigour of a healthy man  at first there broke forth upon him a strong sweat that made his face to shine and in which the greedy insects settled thickly  ‘to sweat in such a place’ said i  ‘o master is this wise  fever is drunk in through open pores’  ‘what do you mean’ he screamed pausing with the pick buried in the soil  ‘do you seek to drive me mad  do you think i do not understand the danger that i run’  ‘that is all i want’ said i ‘i only wish you to be swift’  and then my mind flitting to my father’s deathbed i began to murmur scarce above my breath the same vain repetition of words ‘hurry hurry hurry’  presently to my surprise the treasureseeker took them up and while he still wielded the pick but now with staggering and uncertain blows repeated to himself as it were the burthen of a song ‘hurry hurry hurry’ and then again ‘there is no time to lose the marsh has an ill name ill name’ and then back to ‘hurry hurry hurry’ with a dreadful mechanical hurried and yet wearied utterance as a sick man rolls upon his pillow  the sweat had disappeared he was now dry but all that i could see of him of the same dull brick red  presently his pick unearthed the bag of jewels but he did not observe it and continued hewing at the soil  ‘master’ said i ‘there is the treasure’  he seemed to waken from a dream  ‘where’ he cried and then seeing it before his eyes ‘can this be possible’ he added  ‘i must be lightheaded  girl’ he cried suddenly with the same screaming tone of voice that i had once before observed ‘what is wrong is this swamp accursed’  ‘it is a grave’ i answered  ‘you will not go out alive and as for me my life is in god’s hands’  he fell upon the ground like a man struck by a blow but whether from the effect of my words or from sudden seizure of the malady i cannot tell pretty soon he raised his head  ‘you have brought me here to die’ he said ‘at the risk of your own days you have condemned me  why’  ‘to save my honour’ i replied  ‘bear me out that i have warned you greed of these pebbles and not i has been your undoer’  he took out his revolver and handed it to me  ‘you see’ he said ‘i could have killed you even yet  but i am dying as you say nothing could save me and my bill is long enough already  dear me dear me’ he said looking in my face with a curious puzzled and pathetic look like a dull child at school ‘if there be a judgment afterwards my bill is long enough’  at that i broke into a passion of weeping crawled at his feet kissed his hands begged his forgiveness put the pistol back into his grasp and besought him to avenge his death for indeed if with my life i could have bought back his i had not balanced at the cost  but he was determined the poor soul that i should yet more bitterly regret my act  ‘i have nothing to forgive’ said he  ‘dear heaven what a thing is an old fool  i thought upon my word you had taken quite a fancy to me’  he was seized at the same time with a dreadful swimming dizziness clung to me like a child and called upon the name of some woman presently this spasm which i watched with choking tears lessened and died away and he came again to the full possession of his mind  ‘i must write my will’ he said  ‘get out my pocketbook’  i did so and he wrote hurriedly on one page with a pencil  ‘do not let my son know’ he said ‘he is a cruel dog is my son philip do not let him know how you have paid me out’ and then all of a sudden ‘god’ he cried ‘i am blind’ and clapped both hands before his eyes and then again and in a groaning whisper ‘don’t leave me to the crabs’  i swore i would be true to him so long as a pulse stirred and i redeemed my promise  i sat there and watched him as i had watched my father but with what different with what appalling thoughts  through the long afternoon he gradually sank  all that while i fought an uphill battle to shield him from the swarms of ants and the clouds of mosquitoes the prisoner of my crime  the night fell the roar of insects instantly redoubled in the dark arcades of the swamp and still i was not sure that he had breathed his last  at length the flesh of his hand which i yet held in mine grew chill between my fingers and i knew that i was free  i took his pocketbook and the revolver being resolved rather to die than to be captured and laden besides with the basket and the bag of gems set forward towards the north  the swamp at that hour of the night was filled with a continuous din animals and insects of all kinds and all inimical to life contributing their parts  yet in the midst of this turmoil of sound i walked as though my eyes were bandaged beholding nothing  the soil sank under my foot with a horrid slippery consistence as though i were walking among toads the touch of the thick wall of foliage by which alone i guided myself affrighted me like the touch of serpents the darkness checked my breathing like a gag indeed i have never suffered such extremes of fear as during that nocturnal walk nor have i ever known a more sensible relief than when i found the path beginning to mount and to grow firmer under foot and saw although still some way in front of me the silver brightness of the moon  presently i had crossed the last of the jungle and come forth amongst noble and lofty woods clean rock the clean dry dust the aromatic smell of mountain plants that had been baked all day in sunlight and the expressive silence of the night  my negro blood had carried me unhurt across that reeking and pestiferous morass by mere good fortune i had escaped the crawling and stinging vermin with which it was alive and i had now before me the easier portion of my enterprise to cross the isle and to make good my arrival at the haven and my acceptance on the english yacht  it was impossible by night to follow such a track as my father had described and i was casting about for any landmark and in my ignorance vainly consulting the disposition of the stars when there fell upon my ear from somewhere far in front the sound of many voices hurriedly singing  i scarce knew upon what grounds i acted but i shaped my steps in the direction of that sound and in a quarter of an hour’s walking came unperceived to the margin of an open glade  it was lighted by the strong moon and by the flames of a fire  in the midst there stood a little low and rude building surmounted by a cross a chapel as i then remembered to have heard long since desecrated and given over to the rites of hoodoo  hard by the steps of entrance was a black mass continually agitated and stirring to and fro as if with inarticulate life and this i presently perceived to be a heap of cocks hares dogs and other birds and animals still struggling but helplessly tethered and cruelly tossed one upon another  both the fire and the chapel were surrounded by a ring of kneeling africans both men and women  now they would raise their palms halfclosed to heaven with a peculiar passionate gesture of supplication now they would bow their heads and spread their hands before them on the ground  as the double movement passed and repassed along the line the heads kept rising and falling like waves upon the sea and still as if in time to these gesticulations the hurried chant continued  i stood spellbound knowing that my life depended by a hair knowing that i had stumbled on a celebration of the rites of hoodoo  presently the door of the chapel opened and there came forth a tall negro entirely nude and bearing in his hand the sacrificial knife  he was followed by an apparition still more strange and shocking madam mendizabal naked also and carrying in both hands and raised to the level of her face an open basket of wicker  it was filled with coiling snakes and these as she stood there with the uplifted basket shot through the osier grating and curled about her arms  at the sight of this the fervour of the crowd seemed to swell suddenly higher and the chant rose in pitch and grew more irregular in time and accent  then at a sign from the tall negro where he stood motionless and smiling in the moon and firelight the singing died away and there began the second stage of this barbarous and bloody celebration  from different parts of the ring one after another man or woman ran forth into the midst ducked with that same gesture of the thrownup hand before the priestess and her snakes and with various adjurations uttered aloud the blackest wishes of the heart  death and disease were the favours usually invoked the death or the disease of enemies or rivals some calling down these plagues upon the nearest of their own blood and one to whom i swear i had been never less than kind invoking them upon myself  at each petition the tall negro still smiling picked up some bird or animal from the heaving mass upon his left slew it with the knife and tossed its body on the ground  at length it seemed it reached the turn of the highpriestess  she set down the basket on the steps moved into the centre of the ring grovelled in the dust before the reptiles and still grovelling lifted up her voice between speech and singing and with so great with so insane a fervour of excitement as struck a sort of horror through my blood  ‘power’ she began ‘whose name we do not utter power that is neither good nor evil but below them both stronger than good greater than evil—all my life long i have adored and served thee  who has shed blood upon thine altars whose voice is broken with the singing of thy praises whose limbs are faint before their age with leaping in thy revels  who has slain the child of her body  i’ she cried ‘i metamnbogu  by my own name i name myself  i tear away the veil  i would be served or perish  hear me slime of the fat swamp blackness of the thunder venom of the serpent’s udder—hear or slay me  i would have two things o shapeless one o horror of emptiness—two things or die  the blood of my whitefaced husband oh give me that he is the enemy of hoodoo give me his blood  and yet another o racer of the blind winds o germinator in the ruins of the dead o root of life root of corruption  i grow old i grow hideous i am known i am hunted for my life let thy servant then lay by this outworn body let thy chief priestess turn again to the blossom of her days and be a girl once more and the desired of all men even as in the past  and o lord and master as i here ask a marvel not yet wrought since we were torn from the old land have i not prepared the sacrifice in which thy soul delighteth—the kid without the horns’  even as she uttered the words there was a great rumour of joy through all the circle of worshippers it rose and fell and rose again and swelled at last into rapture when the tall negro who had stepped an instant into the chapel reappeared before the door carrying in his arms the body of the slavegirl cora  i know not if i saw what followed when next my mind awoke to a clear knowledge cora was laid upon the steps before the serpents the negro with the knife stood over her the knife rose and at this i screamed out in my great horror bidding them in god’s name to pause  a stillness fell upon the mob of cannibals  a moment more and they must have thrown off this stupor and i infallibly have perished  but heaven had designed to save me  the silence of these wretched men was not yet broken when there arose in the empty night a sound louder than the roar of any european tempest swifter to travel than the wings of any eastern wind  blackness engulfed the world blackness stabbed across from every side by intricate and blinding lightning  almost in the same second at one worldswallowing stride the heart of the tornado reached the clearing  i heard an agonising crash and the light of my reason was overwhelmed  when i recovered consciousness the day was come  i was unhurt the trees close about me had not lost a bough and i might have thought at first that the tornado was a feature in a dream  it was otherwise indeed for when i looked abroad i perceived i had escaped destruction by a hand’sbreadth  right through the forest which here covered hill and dale the storm had ploughed a lane of ruin  on either hand the trees waved uninjured in the air of the morning but in the forthright course of its advance the hurricane had left no trophy standing everything in that line tree man or animal the desecrated chapel and the votaries of hoodoo had been subverted and destroyed in that brief spasm of anger of the powers of air  everything but a yard or two beyond the line of its passage humble flower lofty tree and the poor vulnerable maid who now knelt to pay her gratitude to heaven awoke unharmed in the crystal purity and peace of the new day  to move by the path of the tornado was a thing impossible to man so wildly were the wrecks of the tall forest piled together by that fugitive convulsion  i crossed it indeed with such labour and patience with so many dangerous slips and falls as left me at the further side bankrupt alike of strength and courage  there i sat down awhile to recruit my forces and as i ate how should i bless the kindliness of heaven my eye flitting to and fro in the colonnade of the great trees alighted on a trunk that had been blazed  yes by the directing hand of providence i had been conducted to the very track i was to follow  with what a light heart i now set forth and walking with how glad a step traversed the uplands of the isle  it was hard upon the hour of noon when i came all tattered and wayworn to the summit of a steep descent and looked below me on the sea  about all the coast the surf roused by the tornado of the night beat with a particular fury and made a fringe of snow  close at my feet i saw a haven set in precipitous and palmcrowned bluffs of rock  just outside a ship was heaving on the surge so trimly sparred so glossily painted so elegant and pointdevice in every feature that my heart was seized with admiration  the english colours blew from her masthead and from my high station i caught glimpses of her snowy planking as she rolled on the uneven deep and saw the sun glitter on the brass of her deck furniture  there then was my ship of refuge and of all my difficulties only one remained to get on board of her  half an hour later i issued at last out of the woods on the margin of a cove into whose jaws the tossing and blue billows entered and along whose shores they broke with a surprising loudness  a wooded promontory hid the yacht and i had walked some distance round the beach in what appeared to be a virgin solitude when my eye fell on a boat drawn into a natural harbour where it rocked in safety but deserted  i looked about for those who should have manned her and presently in the immediate entrance of the wood spied the red embers of a fire and stretched around in various attitudes a party of slumbering mariners to these i drew near most were black a few white but all were dressed with the conspicuous decency of yachtsmen and one from his peaked cap and glittering buttons i rightly divined to be an officer  him then i touched upon the shoulder  he started up the sharpness of his movement woke the rest and they all stared upon me in surprise  ‘what do you want’ inquired the officer  ‘to go on board the yacht’ i answered  i thought they all seemed disconcerted at this and the officer with something of sharpness asked me who i was  now i had determined to conceal my name until i met sir george and the first name that rose to my lips was that of the señora mendizabal  at the word there went a shock about the little party of seamen the negroes stared at me with indescribable eagerness the whites themselves with something of a scared surprise and instantly the spirit of mischief prompted me to add ‘and if the name is new to your ears call me metamnbogu’  i had never seen an effect so wonderful  the negroes threw their hands into the air with the same gesture i remarked the night before about the hoodoo campfire first one and then another ran forward and kneeled down and kissed the skirts of my torn dress and when the white officer broke out swearing and calling to know if they were mad the coloured seamen took him by the shoulders dragged him on one side till they were out of hearing and surrounded him with open mouths and extravagant pantomime  the officer seemed to struggle hard he laughed aloud and i saw him make gestures of dissent and protest but in the end whether overcome by reason or simply weary of resistance he gave in—approached me civilly enough but with something of a sneering manner underneath—and touching his cap ‘my lady’ said he ‘if that is what you are the boat is ready’  my reception on board the nemorosa for so the yacht was named partook of the same mingled nature  we were scarcely within hail of that great and elegant fabric where she lay rolling gunwale under and churning the blue sea to snow before the bulwarks were lined with the heads of a great crowd of seamen black white and yellow and these and the few who manned the boat began exchanging shouts in some lingua franca incomprehensible to me  all eyes were directed on the passenger and once more i saw the negroes toss up their hands to heaven but now as if with passionate wonder and delight  at the head of the gangway i was received by another officer a gentlemanly man with blond and bushy whiskers and to him i addressed my demand to see sir george  ‘but this is not—’ he cried and paused  ‘i know it’ returned the other officer who had brought me from the shore  ‘but what the devil can we do  look at all the niggers’  i followed his direction and as my eye lighted upon each the poor ignorant africans ducked and bowed and threw their hands into the air as though in the presence of a creature half divine  apparently the officer with the whiskers had instantly come round to the opinion of his subaltern for he now addressed me with every signal of respect  ‘sir george is at the island my lady’ said he ‘for which with your ladyship’s permission i shall immediately make all sail  the cabins are prepared  steward take lady greville below’  under this new name then and so captivated by surprise that i could neither think nor speak i was ushered into a spacious and airy cabin hung about with weapons and surrounded by divans  the steward asked for my commands but i was by this time so wearied bewildered and disturbed that i could only wave him to leave me to myself and sink upon a pile of cushions  presently by the changed motion of the ship i knew her to be under way my thoughts so far from clarifying grew the more distracted and confused dreams began to mingle and confound them and at length by insensible transition i sank into a dreamless slumber  when i awoke the day and night had passed and it was once more morning the world on which i reopened my eyes swam strangely up and down the jewels in the bag that lay beside me chinked together ceaselessly the clock and the barometer wagged to and fro like pendulums and overhead seamen were singing out at their work and coils of rope clattering and thumping on the deck  yet it was long before i had divined that i was at sea long before i had recalled one after another the tragical mysterious and inexplicable events that had brought me where was  when i had done so i thrust the jewels which i was surprised to find had been respected into the bosom of my dress and seeing a silver bell hard by upon a table rang it loudly  the steward instantly appeared i asked for food and he proceeded to lay the table regarding me the while with a disquieting and pertinacious scrutiny  to relieve myself of my embarrassment i asked him with as fair a show of ease as i could muster if it were usual for yachts to carry so numerous a crew  ‘madam’ said he ‘i know not who you are nor what mad fancy has induced you to usurp a name and an appalling destiny that are not yours  i warn you from the soul  no sooner arrived at the island—’  at this moment he was interrupted by the whiskered officer who had entered unperceived behind him and now laid a hand upon his shoulder the sudden pallor the deadly and sick fear that was imprinted on the steward’s face formed a startling addition to his words  ‘parker’ said the officer and pointed towards the door  ‘yes mr kentish’ said the steward  ‘for god’s sake mr kentish’ and vanished with a white face from the cabin  thereupon the officer bade me sit down and began to help me and join in the meal  ‘i fill your ladyship’s glass’ said he and handed me a tumbler of neat rum  ‘sir’ cried i ‘do you expect me to drink this’  he laughed heartily  ‘your ladyship is so much changed’ said he ‘that i no longer expect any one thing more than any other’  immediately after a white seaman entered the cabin saluted both mr kentish and myself and informed the officer there was a sail in sight which was bound to pass us very close and that mr harland was in doubt about the colours  ‘being so near the island’ asked mr kentish  ‘that was what mr harland said sir’ returned the sailor with a scrape  ‘better not i think’ said mr kentish  ‘my compliments to mr harland and if she seem a lively boat give her the stars and stripes but if she be dull and we can easily outsail her show john dutchman  that is always another word for incivility at sea so we can disregard a hail or a flag of distress without attracting notice’  as soon as the sailor had gone on deck i turned to the officer in wonder  ‘mr kentish if that be your name’ said i ‘are you ashamed of your own colours’  ‘your ladyship refers to the jolly roger’ he inquired with perfect gravity and immediately after went into peals of laughter  ‘pardon me’ said he ‘but here for the first time i recognise your ladyship’s impetuosity’  nor try as i pleased could i extract from him any explanation of this mystery but only oily and commonplace evasion  while we were thus occupied the movement of the nemorosa gradually became less violent its speed at the same time diminished and presently after with a sullen plunge the anchor was discharged into the sea kentish immediately rose offered his arm and conducted me on deck where i found we were lying in a roadstead among many low and rocky islets hovered about by an innumerable cloud of seafowl  immediately under our board a somewhat larger isle was green with trees set with a few low buildings and approached by a pier of very crazy workmanship and a little inshore of us a smaller vessel lay at anchor  i had scarce time to glance to the four quarters ere a boat was lowered i was handed in kentish took place beside me and we pulled briskly to the pier  a crowd of villainous armed loiterers both black and white looked on upon our landing and again the word passed about among the negroes and again i was received with prostrations and the same gesture of the flungup hand  by this what with the appearance of these men and the lawless seagirt spot in which i found myself my courage began a little to decline and clinging to the arm of mr kentish i begged him to tell me what it meant  ‘nay madam’ he returned ‘you know’  and leading me smartly through the crowd which continued to follow at a considerable distance and at which he still kept looking back i thought with apprehension he brought me to a low house that stood alone in an encumbered yard opened the door and begged me to enter  ‘but why’ said i  ‘i demand to see sir george’  ‘madam’ returned mr kentish looking suddenly as black as thunder ‘to drop all fence i know neither who nor what you are beyond the fact that you are not the person whose name you have assumed  but be what you please spy ghost devil or most illjudging jester if you do not immediately enter that house i will cut you to the earth’  and even as he spoke he threw an uneasy glance behind him at the following crowd of blacks  i did not wait to be twice threatened i obeyed at once and with a palpitating heart and the next moment the door was locked from the outside and the key withdrawn  the interior was long low and quite unfurnished but filled almost from end to end with sugarcane tarbarrels old tarry rope and other incongruous and highly inflammable material and not only was the door locked but the solitary window barred with iron  i was by this time so exceedingly bewildered and afraid that i would have given years of my life to be once more the slave of mr caulder  i still stood with my hands clasped the image of despair looking about me on the lumber of the room or raising my eyes to heaven when there appeared outside the window bars the face of a very black negro who signed to me imperiously to draw near  i did so and he instantly and with every mark of fervour addressed me a long speech in some unknown and barbarous tongue  ‘i declare’ i cried clasping my brow ‘i do not understand one syllable’  ‘not’ he said in spanish  ‘great great are the powers of hoodoo  her very mind is changed  but o chief priestess why have you suffered yourself to be shut into this cage why did you not call your slaves at once to your defence  do you not see that all has been prepared to murder you at a spark this flimsy house will go in flames and alas who shall then be the chief priestess and what shall be the profit of the miracle’  ‘heavens’ cried i ‘can i not see sir george  i must i must come by speech of him  oh bring me to sir george’  and my terror fairly mastering my courage i fell upon my knees and began to pray to all the saints  ‘lordy’ cried the negro ‘here they come’  and his black head was instantly withdrawn from the window  ‘i never heard such nonsense in my life’ exclaimed a voice  ‘why so we all say sir george’ replied the voice of mr kentish  ‘but put yourself in our place  the niggers were near two to one  and upon my word if you’ll excuse me sir considering the notion they have taken in their heads i regard it as precious fortunate for all of us that the mistake occurred’  ‘this is no question of fortune sir’ returned sir george  ‘it is a question of my orders and you may take my word for it kentish either harland or yourself or parker—or by george all three of you—shall swing for this affair  these are my sentiments  give me the key and be off’  immediately after the key turned in the lock and there appeared upon the threshold a gentleman between forty and fifty with a very open countenance and of a stout and personable figure  ‘my dear young lady’ said he ‘who the devil may you be’  i told him all my story in one rush of words  he heard me from the first with an amazement you can scarcely picture but when i came to the death of the señora mendizabal in the tornado he fairly leaped into the air  ‘my dear child’ he cried clasping me in his arms ‘excuse a man who might be your father  this is the best news i ever had since i was born for that hag of a mulatto was no less a person than my wife’  he sat down upon a tarbarrel as if unmanned by joy  ‘dear me’ said he ‘i declare this tempts me to believe in providence  and what’ he added ‘can i do for you’  ‘sir george’ said i ‘i am already rich all that i ask is your protection’  ‘understand one thing’ he said with great energy  ‘i will never marry’  ‘i had not ventured to propose it’ i exclaimed unable to restrain my mirth ‘i only seek to be conveyed to england the natural home of the escaped slave’  ‘well’ returned sir george ‘frankly i owe you something for this exhilarating news besides your father was of use to me  now i have made a small competence in business—a jewel mine a sort of naval agency et cætera and i am on the point of breaking up my company and retiring to my place in devonshire to pass a plain old age unmarried  one good turn deserves another if you swear to hold your tongue about this island these little bonfire arrangements and the whole episode of my unfortunate marriage why i’ll carry you home aboard the nemorosa’  i eagerly accepted his conditions  ‘one thing more’ said he  ‘my late wife was some sort of a sorceress among the blacks and they are all persuaded she has come alive again in your agreeable person  now you will have the goodness to keep up that fancy if you please and to swear to them on the authority of hoodoo or whatever his name may be that i am from this moment quite a sacred character’  ‘i swear it’ said i ‘by my father’s memory and that is a vow that i will never break’  ‘i have considerably better hold on you than any oath’ returned sir george with a chuckle ‘for you are not only an escaped slave but have by your own account a considerable amount of stolen property’  i was struck dumb i saw it was too true in a glance i recognised that these jewels were no longer mine with similar quickness i decided they should be restored ay if it cost me the liberty that i had just regained  forgetful of all else forgetful of sir george who sat and watched me with a smile i drew out mr caulder’s pocketbook and turned to the page on which the dying man had scrawled his testament  how shall i describe the agony of happiness and remorse with which i read it for my victim had not only set me free but bequeathed to me the bag of jewels  my plain tale draws towards a close  sir george and i in my character of his rejuvenated wife displayed ourselves arminarm among the negroes and were cheered and followed to the place of embarkation there sir george turning about made a speech to his old companions in which he thanked and bade them farewell with a very manly spirit and towards the end of which he fell on some expressions which i still remember  ‘if any of you gentry lose your money’ he said ‘take care you do not come to me for in the first place i shall do my best to have you murdered and if that fails i hand you over to the law  blackmail won’t do for me  i’ll rather risk all upon a cast than be pulled to pieces by degrees  i’ll rather be found out and hang than give a doit to one manjack of you’  that same night we got under way and crossed to the port of new orleans whence as a sacred trust i sent the pocketbook to mr caulder’s son  in a week’s time the men were all paid off new hands were shipped and the nemorosa weighed her anchor for old england  a more delightful voyage it were hard to fancy  sir george of course was not a conscientious man but he had an unaffected gaiety of character that naturally endeared him to the young and it was interesting to hear him lay out his projects for the future when he should be returned to parliament and place at the service of the nation his experience of marine affairs  i asked him if his notion of piracy upon a private yacht were not original  but he told me no  ‘a yacht miss valdevia’ he observed ‘is a chartered nuisance  who smuggles  who robs the salmon rivers of the west of scotland  who cruelly beats the keepers if they dare to intervene  the crews and the proprietors of yachts  all i have done is to extend the line a trifle and if you ask me for my unbiassed opinion i do not suppose that i am in the least alone’  in short we were the best of friends and lived like father and daughter though i still withheld from him of course that respect which is only due to moral excellence  we were still some days’ sail from england when sir george obtained from an outwardbound ship a packet of newspapers and from that fatal hour my misfortunes recommenced  he sat the same evening in the cabin reading the news and making savoury comments on the decline of england and the poor condition of the navy when i suddenly observed him to change countenance  ‘hullo’ said he ‘this is bad this is deuced bad miss valdevia  you would not listen to sound sense you would send that pocketbook to that man caulder’s son’  ‘sir george’ said i ‘it was my duty’  ‘you are prettily paid for it at least’ says he ‘and much as i regret it i for one am done with you  this fellow caulder demands your extradition’  ‘but a slave’ i returned ‘is safe in england’  ‘yes by george’ replied the baronet ‘but it’s not a slave miss valdevia it’s a thief that he demands  he has quietly destroyed the will and now accuses you of robbing your father’s bankrupt estate of jewels to the value of a hundred thousand pounds’  i was so much overcome by indignation at this hateful charge and concern for my unhappy fate that the genial baronet made haste to put me more at ease  ‘do not be cast down’ said he  ‘of course i wash my hands of you myself  a man in my position—baronet old family and all that—cannot possibly be too particular about the company he keeps  but i am a deuced goodhumoured old boy let me tell you when not ruffled and i will do the best i can to put you right  i will lend you a trifle of ready money give you the address of an excellent lawyer in london and find a way to set you on shore unsuspected’  he was in every particular as good as his word  four days later the nemorosa sounded her way under the cloak of a dark night into a certain haven of the coast of england and a boat rowing with muffled oars set me ashore upon the beach within a stone’s throw of a railway station  thither guided by sir george’s directions i groped a devious way and finding a bench upon the platform sat me down wrapped in a man’s fur greatcoat to await the coming of the day  it was still dark when a light was struck behind one of the windows of the building nor had the east begun to kindle to the warmer colours of the dawn before a porter carrying a lantern issued from the door and found himself face to face with the unfortunate teresa  he looked all about him in the grey twilight of the dawn the haven was seen to lie deserted and the yacht had long since disappeared  ‘who are you’ he cried  ‘i am a traveller’ said i  ‘and where do you come from’ he asked  ‘i am going by the first train to london’ i replied  in such manner like a ghost or a new creation was teresa with her bag of jewels landed on the shores of england in this silent fashion without history or name she took her place among the millions of a new country  since then i have lived by the expedients of my lawyer lying concealed in quiet lodgings dogged by the spies of cuba and not knowing at what hour my liberty and honour may be lost     the brown box concluded   the effect of this tale on the mind of harry desborough was instant and convincing  the fair cuban had been already the loveliest she now became in his eyes the most romantic the most innocent and the most unhappy of her sex  he was bereft of words to utter what he felt what pity what admiration what youthful envy of a career so vivid and adventurous  ‘o madam’ he began and finding no language adequate to that apostrophe caught up her hand and wrung it in his own  ‘count upon me’ he added with bewildered fervour and getting somehow or other out of the apartment and from the circle of that radiant sorceress he found himself in the strange outofdoors beholding dull houses wondering at dull passersby a fallen angel  she had smiled upon him as he left and with how significant how beautiful a smile  the memory lingered in his heart and when he found his way to a certain restaurant where music was performed flutes as it were of paradise accompanied his meal  the strings went to the melody of that parting smile they paraphrased and glossed it in the sense that he desired and for the first time in his plain and somewhat dreary life he perceived himself to have a taste for music  the next day and the next his meditations moved to that delectable air now he saw her and was favoured now saw her not at all now saw her and was put by  the fall of her foot upon the stair entranced him the books that he sought out and read were books on cuba and spoke of her indirectly nay and in the very landlady’s parlour he found one that told of precisely such a hurricane and down to the smallest detail confirmed had confirmation been required the truth of her recital presently he began to fall into that prettiest mood of a young love in which the lover scorns himself for his presumption  who was he the dull one the commonplace unemployed the man without adventure the impure the untruthful to aspire to such a creature made of fire and air and hallowed and adorned by such incomparable passages of life  what should he do to be more worthy by what devotion call down the notice of these eyes to so terrene a being as himself  he betook himself thereupon to the rural privacy of the square where being a lad of a kind heart he had made himself a circle of acquaintances among its shy frequenters the halfdomestic cats and the visitors that hung before the windows of the children’s hospital  there he walked considering the depth of his demerit and the height of the adored one’s superexcellence now lighting upon earth to say a pleasant word to the brother of some infant invalid now with a great heave of breath remembering the queen of women and the sunshine of his life  what was he to do  teresa he had observed was in the habit of leaving the house towards afternoon she might perchance run danger from some cuban emissary when the presence of a friend might turn the balance in her favour how then if he should follow her  to offer his company would seem like an intrusion to dog her openly were a manifest impertinence he saw himself reduced to a more stealthy part which though in some ways distasteful to his mind he did not doubt that he could practise with the skill of a detective  the next day he proceeded to put his plan in action  at the corner of tottenham court road however the señorita suddenly turned back and met him face to face with every mark of pleasure and surprise  ‘ah señor i am sometimes fortunate’ she cried  ‘i was looking for a messenger’ and with the sweetest of smiles she despatched him to the east end of london to an address which he was unable to find  this was a bitter pill to the knighterrant but when he returned at night worn out with fruitless wandering and dismayed by his fiasco the lady received him with a friendly gaiety protesting that all was for the best since she had changed her mind and long since repented of her message  next day he resumed his labours glowing with pity and courage and determined to protect teresa with his life  but a painful shock awaited him  in the narrow and silent hanway street she turned suddenly about and addressed him with a manner and a light in her eyes that were new to the young man’s experience  ‘do i understand that you follow me señor’ she cried  ‘are these the manners of the english gentleman’  harry confounded himself in the most abject apologies and prayers to be forgiven vowed to offend no more and was at length dismissed crestfallen and heavy of heart  the check was final he gave up that road to service and began once more to hang about the square or on the terrace filled with remorse and love admirable and idiotic a fit object for the scorn and envy of older men  in these idle hours while he was courting fortune for a sight of the beloved it fell out naturally that he should observe the manners and appearance of such as came about the house  one person alone was the occasional visitor of the young lady a man of considerable stature and distinguished only by the doubtful ornament of a chinbeard in the style of an american deacon something in his appearance grated upon harry this distaste grew upon him in the course of days and when at length he mustered courage to inquire of the fair cuban who this was he was yet more dismayed by her reply  ‘that gentleman’ said she a smile struggling to her face ‘that gentleman i will not attempt to conceal from you desires my hand in marriage and presses me with the most respectful ardour  alas what am i to say  i the forlorn teresa how shall i refuse or accept such protestations’  harry feared to say more a horrid pang of jealousy transfixed him and he had scarce the strength of mind to take his leave with decency  in the solitude of his own chamber he gave way to every manifestation of despair  he passionately adored the señorita but it was not only the thought of her possible union with another that distressed his soul it was the indefeasible conviction that her suitor was unworthy  to a duke a bishop a victorious general or any man adorned with obvious qualities he had resigned her with a sort of bitter joy he saw himself follow the wedding party from a great way off he saw himself return to the poor house then robbed of its jewel and while he could have wept for his despair he felt he could support it nobly  but this affair looked otherwise  the man was patently no gentleman he had a startled skulking guilty bearing his nails were black his eyes evasive his love perhaps was a pretext he was perhaps under this deep disguise a cuban emissary  harry swore that he would satisfy these doubts and the next evening about the hour of the usual visit he posted himself at a spot whence his eye commanded the three issues of the square  presently after a fourwheeler rumbled to the door and the man with the chinbeard alighted paid off the cabman and was seen by harry to enter the house with a brown box hoisted on his back  half an hour later he came forth again without the box and struck eastward at a rapid walk and desborough with the same skill and caution that he had displayed in following teresa proceeded to dog the steps of her admirer  the man began to loiter studying with apparent interest the wares of the small fruiterer or tobacconist twice he returned hurriedly upon his former course and then as though he had suddenly conquered a moment’s hesitation once more set forth with resolute and swift steps in the direction of lincoln’s inn  at length in a deserted bystreet he turned and coming up to harry with a countenance which seemed to have become older and whiter inquired with some severity of speech if he had not had the pleasure of seeing the gentleman before  ‘you have sir’ said harry somewhat abashed but with a good show of stoutness ‘and i will not deny that i was following you on purpose doubtless’ he added for he supposed that all men’s minds must still be running on teresa ‘you can divine my reason’  at these words the man with the chinbeard was seized with a palsied tremor  he seemed for some seconds to seek the utterance which his fear denied him and then whipping sharply about he took to his heels at the most furious speed of running  harry was at first so taken aback that he neglected to pursue and by the time he had recovered his wits his best expedition was only rewarded by a glimpse of the man with the chinbeard mounting into a hansom which immediately after disappeared into the moving crowds of holborn  puzzled and dismayed by this unusual behaviour harry returned to the house in queen square and ventured for the first time to knock at the fair cuban’s door  she bade him enter and he found her kneeling with rather a disconsolate air beside a brown wooden trunk  ‘señorita’ he broke out ‘i doubt whether that man’s character is what he wishes you to believe  his manner when he found and indeed when i admitted that i was following him was not the manner of an honest man’  ‘oh’ she cried throwing up her hands as in desperation ‘don quixote don quixote have you again been tilting against windmills’  and then with a laugh ‘poor soul’ she added ‘how you must have terrified him for know that the cuban authorities are here and your poor teresa may soon be hunted down  even yon humble clerk from my solicitor’s office may find himself at any moment the quarry of armed spies’  ‘a humble clerk’ cried harry ‘why you told me yourself that he wished to marry you’  ‘i thought you english like what you call a joke’ replied the lady calmly  ‘as a matter of fact he is my lawyer’s clerk and has been here tonight charged with disastrous news  i am in sore straits señor harry  will you help me’  at this most welcome word the young man’s heart exulted and in the hope pride and selfesteem that kindled with the very thought of service he forgot to dwell upon the lady’s jest  ‘can you ask’ he cried  ‘what is there that i can do  only tell me that’  with signs of an emotion that was certainly unfeigned the fair cuban laid her hand upon the box  ‘this box’ she said ‘contains my jewels papers and clothes all in a word that still connects me with cuba and my dreadful past  they must now be smuggled out of england or by the opinion of my lawyer i am lost beyond remedy  tomorrow on board the irish packet a sure hand awaits the box the problem still unsolved is to find some one to carry it as far as holyhead to see it placed on board the steamer and instantly return to town  will you be he  will you leave tomorrow by the first train punctually obey orders bear still in mind that you are surrounded by cuban spies and without so much as a look behind you or a single movement to betray your interest leave the box where you have put it and come straight on shore will you do this and so save your friend’  ‘i do not clearly understand   ’ began harry  ‘no more do i’ replied the cuban  ‘it is not necessary that we should so long as we obey the lawyer’s orders’  ‘señorita’ returned harry gravely ‘i think this of course a very little thing to do for you when i would willingly do all  but suffer me to say one word  if london is unsafe for your treasures it cannot long be safe for you and indeed if i at all fathom the plan of your solicitor i fear i may find you already fled on my return  i am not considered clever and can only speak out plainly what is in my heart that i love you and that i cannot bear to lose all knowledge of you  i hope no more than to be your servant i ask no more than just that i shall hear of you  oh promise me so much’  ‘you shall’ she said after a pause  ‘i promise you you shall’  but though she spoke with earnestness the marks of great embarrassment and a strong conflict of emotions appeared upon her face  ‘i wish to tell you’ resumed desborough ‘in case of accidents   ’  ‘accidents’ she cried ‘why do you say that’  ‘i do not know’ said he ‘you may be gone before my return and we may not meet again for long  and so i wished you to know this that since the day you gave me the cigarette you have never once not once been absent from my mind and if it will in any way serve you you may crumple me up like that piece of paper and throw me on the fire  i would love to die for you’  ‘go’ she said  ‘go now at once  my brain is in a whirl  i scarce know what we are talking  go and goodnight and oh may you come safe’  once back in his own room a fearful joy possessed the young man’s mind and as he recalled her face struck suddenly white and the broken utterance of her last words his heart at once exulted and misgave him love had indeed looked upon him with a tragic mask and yet what mattered since at least it was love—since at least she was commoved at their division  he got to bed with these particoloured thoughts passed from one dream to another all night long the white face of teresa still haunting him wrung with unspoken thoughts and in the grey of the dawn leaped suddenly out of bed in a kind of horror  it was already time for him to rise  he dressed made his breakfast on cold food that had been laid for him the night before and went down to the room of his idol for the box  the door was open a strange disorder reigned within the furniture all pushed aside and the centre of the room left bare of impediment as though for the pacing of a creature with a tortured mind there lay the box however and upon the lid a paper with these words ‘harry i hope to be back before you go  teresa’  he sat down to wait laying his watch before him on the table  she had called him harry that should be enough he thought to fill the day with sunshine and yet somehow the sight of that disordered room still poisoned his enjoyment  the door of the bedchamber stood gaping open and though he turned aside his eyes as from a sacrilege he could not but observe the bed had not been slept in  he was still pondering what this should mean still trying to convince himself that all was well when the moving needle of his watch summoned him to set forth without delay  he was before all things a man of his word ran round to southampton row to fetch a cab and taking the box on the front seat drove off towards the terminus  the streets were scarcely awake there was little to amuse the eye and the young man’s attention centred on the dumb companion of his drive  a card was nailed upon one side bearing the superscription ‘miss doolan passenger to dublin  glass  with care’  he thought with a sentimental shock that the fair idol of his heart was perhaps driven to adopt the name of doolan and as he still studied the card he was aware of a deadly black depression settling steadily upon his spirits  it was in vain for him to contend against the tide in vain that he shook himself or tried to whistle the sense of some impending blow was not to be averted  he looked out in the long empty streets the cab pursued its way without a trace of any follower  he gave ear and over and above the jolting of the wheels upon the road he was conscious of a certain regular and quiet sound that seemed to issue from the box  he put his ear to the cover at one moment he seemed to perceive a delicate ticking the next the sound was gone nor could his closest hearkening recapture it  he laughed at himself but still the gloom continued and it was with more than the common relief of an arrival that he leaped from the cab before the station  probably enough on purpose teresa had named an hour some thirty minutes earlier than needful and when harry had given the box into the charge of a porter who sat it on a truck he proceeded briskly to pace the platform  presently the bookstall opened and the young man was looking at the books when he was seized by the arm  he turned and though she was closely veiled at once recognised the fair cuban  ‘where is it’ she asked and the sound of her voice surprised him  ‘it’ he said  ‘what’  ‘the box  have it put on a cab instantly  i am in fearful haste’  he hurried to obey marvelling at these changes but not daring to trouble her with questions and when the cab had been brought round and the box mounted on the front she passed a little way off upon the pavement and beckoned him to follow  ‘now’ said she still in those mechanical and hushed tones that had at first affected him ‘you must go on to holyhead alone go on board the steamer and if you see a man in tartan trousers and a pink scarf say to him that all has been put off if not’ she added with a sobbing sigh ‘it does not matter  so goodbye’  ‘teresa’ said harry ‘get into your cab and i will go along with you you are in some distress perhaps some danger and till i know the whole not even you can make me leave you’  ‘you will not’ she asked  ‘o harry it were better’  ‘i will not’ said harry stoutly  she looked at him for a moment through her veil took his hand suddenly and sharply but more as if in fear than tenderness and still holding him walked to the cabdoor  ‘where are we to drive’ asked harry  ‘home quickly’ she answered ‘double fare’  and as soon as they had both mounted to their places the vehicle crazily trundled from the station  teresa leaned back in a corner  the whole way harry could perceive her tears to flow under her veil but she vouchsafed no explanation  at the door of the house in queen square both alighted and the cabman lowered the box which harry glad to display his strength received upon his shoulders  ‘let the man take it’ she whispered  ‘let the man take it’  ‘i will do no such thing’ said harry cheerfully and having paid the fare he followed teresa through the door which she had opened with her key  the landlady and maid were gone upon their morning errands the house was empty and still and as the rattling of the cab died away down gloucester street and harry continued to ascend the stair with his burthen he heard close against his shoulders the same faint and muffled ticking as before  the lady still preceding him opened the door of her room and helped him to lower the box tenderly in the corner by the window  ‘and now’ said harry ‘what is wrong’  ‘you will not go away’ she cried with a sudden break in her voice and beating her hands together in the very agony of impatience  ‘o harry harry go away  oh go and leave me to the fate that i deserve’  ‘the fate’ repeated harry  ‘what is this’  ‘no fate’ she resumed  ‘i do not know what i am saying  but i wish to be alone  you may come back this evening harry come again when you like but leave me now only leave me now’  and then suddenly ‘i have an errand’ she exclaimed ‘you cannot refuse me that’  ‘no’ replied harry ‘you have no errand  you are in grief or danger lift your veil and tell me what it is’  ‘then’ she said with a sudden composure ‘you leave but one course open to me’  and raising the veil she showed him a countenance from which every trace of colour had fled eyes marred with weeping and a brow on which resolve had conquered fear  ‘harry’ she began ‘i am not what i seem’  ‘you have told me that before’ said harry ‘several times’  ‘o harry harry’ she cried ‘how you shame me  but this is the god’s truth  i am a dangerous and wicked girl  my name is clara luxmore  i was never nearer cuba than penzance  from first to last i have cheated and played with you  and what i am i dare not even name to you in words indeed until today until the sleepless watches of last night i never grasped the depth and foulness of my guilt’  the young man looked upon her aghast  then a generous current poured along his veins  ‘that is all one’ he said  ‘if you be all you say you have the greater need of me’  ‘is it possible’ she exclaimed ‘that i have schemed in vain  and will nothing drive you from this house of death’  ‘of death’ he echoed  ‘death’ she cried ‘death  in that box that you have dragged about london and carried on your defenceless shoulders sleep at the trigger’s mercy the destroying energies of dynamite’  ‘my god’ cried harry  ‘ah’ she continued wildly ‘will you flee now  at any moment you may hear the click that sounds the ruin of this building  i was sure m’guire was wrong this morning before day i flew to zero he confirmed my fears i beheld you my beloved harry fall a victim to my own contrivances  i knew then i loved you—harry will you go now  will you not spare me this unwilling crime’  harry remained speechless his eyes fixed upon the box at last he turned to her  ‘is it’ he asked hoarsely ‘an infernal machine’  her lips formed the word ‘yes’ which her voice refused to utter  with fearful curiosity he drew near and bent above the box in that still chamber the ticking was distinctly audible and at the measured sound the blood flowed back upon his heart  ‘for whom’ he asked  ‘what matters it’ she cried seizing him by the arm  ‘if you may still be saved what matter questions’  ‘god in heaven’ cried harry  ‘and the children’s hospital  at whatever cost this damned contrivance must be stopped’  ‘it cannot’ she gasped  ‘the power of man cannot avert the blow  but you harry—you my beloved—you may still—’  and then from the box that lay so quietly in the corner a sudden catch was audible like the catch of a clock before it strikes the hour  for one second the two stared at each other with lifted brows and stony eyes then harry throwing one arm over his face with the other clutched the girl to his breast and staggered against the wall  a dull and startling thud resounded through the room their eyes blinked against the coming horror and still clinging together like drowning people they fell to the floor  then followed a prolonged and strident hissing as from the indignant pit an offensive stench seized them by the throat the room was filled with dense and choking fumes  presently these began a little to disperse and when at length they drew themselves all limp and shaken to a sitting posture the first object that greeted their vision was the box reposing uninjured in its corner but still leaking little wreaths of vapour round the lid  ‘oh poor zero’ cried the girl with a strange sobbing laugh  ‘alas poor zero  this will break his heart’     the superfluous mansion concluded   somerset ran straight upstairs the door of the drawingroom contrary to all custom was unlocked and bursting in the young man found zero seated on a sofa in an attitude of singular dejection  close beside him stood an untasted grog the mark of strong preoccupation  the room besides was in confusion boxes had been tumbled to and fro the floor was strewn with keys and other implements and in the midst of this disorder lay a lady’s glove  ‘i have come’ cried somerset ‘to make an end of this  either you will instantly abandon all your schemes or cost what it may i will denounce you to the police’  ‘ah’ replied zero slowly shaking his head  ‘you are too late dear fellow  i am already at the end of all my hopes and fallen to be a laughingstock and mockery  my reading’ he added with a gentle despondency of manner ‘has not been much among romances yet i recall from one a phrase that depicts my present state with critical exactitude and you behold me sitting here “like a burst drum”’  ‘what has befallen you’ cried somerset  ‘my last batch’ returned the plotter wearily ‘like all the others is a hollow mockery and a fraud  in vain do i combine the elements in vain adjust the springs and i have now arrived at such a pitch of disconsideration that except yourself dear fellow i do not know a soul that i can face  my subordinates themselves have turned upon me  what language have i heard today what illiberality of sentiment what pungency of expression  she came once i could have pardoned that for she was moved but she returned returned to announce to me this crushing blow and somerset she was very inhumane  yes dear fellow i have drunk a bitter cup the speech of females is remarkable for    well well  denounce me if you will you but denounce the dead  i am extinct  it is strange how at this supreme crisis of my life i should be haunted by quotations from works of an inexact and even fanciful description but here’ he added ‘is another “othello’s occupation’s gone”  yes dear somerset it is gone i am no more a dynamiter and how i ask you after having tasted of these joys am i to condescend to a less glorious life’  ‘i cannot describe how you relieve me’ returned somerset sitting down on one of several boxes that had been drawn out into the middle of the floor  ‘i had conceived a sort of maudlin toleration for your character i have a great distaste besides for anything in the nature of a duty and upon both grounds your news delights me  but i seem to perceive’ he added ‘a certain sound of ticking in this box’  ‘yes’ replied zero with the same slow weariness of manner ‘i have set several of them going’  ‘my god’ cried somerset bounding to his feet  ‘machines’  ‘machines’ returned the plotter bitterly  ‘machines indeed  i blush to be their author  alas’ he said burying his face in his hands ‘that i should live to say it’  ‘madman’ cried somerset shaking him by the arm  ‘what am i to understand  have you indeed set these diabolical contrivances in motion and do we stay here to be blown up’  ‘“hoist with his own petard”’ returned the plotter musingly  ‘one more quotation strange  but indeed my brain is struck with numbness  yes dear boy i have as you say put my contrivance in motion  the one on which you are sitting i have timed for half an hour  yon other—’  ‘half an hour—’ echoed somerset dancing with trepidation  ‘merciful heavens in half an hour’  ‘dear fellow why so much excitement’ inquired zero  ‘my dynamite is not more dangerous than toffy had i an only child i would give it him to play with  you see this brick’ he continued lifting a cake of the infernal compound from the laboratorytable  ‘at a touch it should explode and that with such unconquerable energy as should bestrew the square with ruins  well now behold  i dash it on the floor’  somerset sprang forward and with the strength of the very ecstasy of terror wrested the brick from his possession  ‘heavens’ he cried wiping his brow and then with more care than ever mother handled her firstborn withal gingerly transported the explosive to the far end of the apartment the plotter his arms once more fallen to his side dispiritedly watching him  ‘it was entirely harmless’ he sighed  ‘they describe it as burning like tobacco’  ‘in the name of fortune’ cried somerset ‘what have i done to you or what have you done to yourself that you should persist in this insane behaviour  if not for your own sake then for mine let us depart from this doomed house where i profess i have not the heart to leave you and then if you will take my advice and if your determination be sincere you will instantly quit this city where no further occupation can detain you’  ‘such dear fellow was my own design’ replied the plotter  ‘i have as you observe no further business here and once i have packed a little bag i shall ask you to share a frugal meal to go with me as far as to the station and see the last of a brokenhearted man  and yet’ he added looking on the boxes with a lingering regret ‘i should have liked to make quite certain  i cannot but suspect my underlings of some mismanagement it may be fond but yet i cherish that idea it may be the weakness of a man of science but yet’ he cried rising into some energy ‘i will never i cannot if i try believe that my poor dynamite has had fair usage’  ‘five minutes’ said somerset glancing with horror at the timepiece ‘if you do not instantly buckle to your bag i leave you’  ‘a few necessaries’ returned zero ‘only a few necessaries dear somerset and you behold me ready’  he passed into the bedroom and after an interval which seemed to draw out into eternity for his unfortunate companion he returned bearing in his hand an open gladstone bag  his movements were still horribly deliberate and his eyes lingered gloatingly on his dear boxes as he moved to and fro about the drawingroom gathering a few small trifles last of all he lifted one of the squares of dynamite  ‘put that down’ cried somerset  ‘if what you say be true you have no call to load yourself with that ungodly contraband’  ‘merely a curiosity dear boy’ he said persuasively and slipped the brick into his bag ‘merely a memento of the past—ah happy past bright past  you will not take a touch of spirits no  i find you very abstemious  well’ he added ‘if you have really no curiosity to await the event—’  ‘i’ cried somerset  ‘my blood boils to get away’  ‘well then’ said zero ‘i am ready i would i could say willing but thus to leave the scene of my sublime endeavours—’  without further parley somerset seized him by the arm and dragged him downstairs the halldoor shut with a clang on the deserted mansion and still towing his laggardly companion the young man sped across the square in the oxford street direction  they had not yet passed the corner of the garden when they were arrested by a dull thud of an extraordinary amplitude of sound accompanied and followed by a shattering fracas  somerset turned in time to see the mansion rend in twain vomit forth flames and smoke and instantly collapse into its cellars  at the same moment he was thrown violently to the ground  his first glance was towards zero  the plotter had but reeled against the garden rail he stood there the gladstone bag clasped tight upon his heart his whole face radiant with relief and gratitude and the young man heard him murmur to himself ‘nunc dimittis nunc dimittis’  the consternation of the populace was indescribable the whole of golden square was alive with men women and children running wildly to and fro and like rabbits in a warren dashing in and out of the house doors and under favour of this confusion somerset dragged away the lingering plotter  ‘it was grand’ he continued to murmur ‘it was indescribably grand  ah green erin green erin what a day of glory and oh my calumniated dynamite how triumphantly hast thou prevailed’  suddenly a shade crossed his face and pausing in the middle of the footway he consulted the dial of his watch  ‘good god’ he cried ‘how mortifying seven minutes too early  the dynamite surpassed my hopes but the clockwork fickle clockwork has once more betrayed me  alas can there be no success unmixed with failure and must even this redletter day be chequered by a shadow’  ‘incomparable ass’ said somerset ‘what have you done  blown up the house of an unoffending old lady and the whole earthly property of the only person who is fool enough to befriend you’  ‘you do not understand these matters’ replied zero with an air of great dignity  ‘this will shake england to the heart  gladstone the truculent old man will quail before the pointing finger of revenge  and now that my dynamite is proved effective—’  ‘heavens you remind me’ ejaculated somerset  ‘that brick in your bag must be instantly disposed of  but how  if we could throw it in the river—’  ‘a torpedo’ cried zero brightening ‘a torpedo in the thames  superb dear fellow  i recognise in you the marks of an accomplished anarch’  ‘true’ returned somerset  ‘it cannot so be done and there is no help but you must carry it away with you  come on then and let me at once consign you to a train’  ‘nay nay dear boy’ protested zero  ‘there is now no call for me to leave  my character is now reinstated my fame brightens this is the best thing i have done yet and i see from here the ovations that await the author of the golden square atrocity’  ‘my young friend’ returned the other ‘i give you your choice  i will either see you safe on board a train or safe in gaol’  ‘somerset this is unlike you’ said the chymist  ‘you surprise me somerset’  ‘i shall considerably more surprise you at the next police office’ returned somerset with something bordering on rage  ‘for on one point my mind is settled either i see you packed off to america brick and all or else you dine in prison’  ‘you have perhaps neglected one point’ returned the unoffended zero ‘for speaking as a philosopher i fail to see what means you can employ to force me  the will my dear fellow—’  ‘now see here’ interrupted somerset  ‘you are ignorant of anything but science which i can never regard as being truly knowledge i sir have studied life and allow me to inform you that i have but to raise my hand and voice—here in this street—and the mob—’  ‘good god in heaven somerset’ cried zero turning deadly white and stopping in his walk ‘great god in heaven what words are these  oh not in jest not even in jest should they be used  the brutal mob the savage passions    somerset for god’s sake a publichouse’  somerset considered him with freshly awakened curiosity  ‘this is very interesting’ said he  ‘you recoil from such a death’  ‘who would not’ asked the plotter  ‘and to be blown up by dynamite’ inquired the young man ‘doubtless strikes you as a form of euthanasia’  ‘pardon me’ returned zero ‘i own and since i have braved it daily in my professional career i own it even with pride it is a death unusually distasteful to the mind of man’  ‘one more question’ said somerset ‘you object to lynch law why’  ‘it is assassination’ said the plotter calmly but with eyebrows a little lifted as in wonder at the question  ‘shake hands with me’ cried somerset  ‘thank god i have now no illfeeling left and though you cannot conceive how i burn to see you on the gallows i can quite contentedly assist at your departure’  ‘i do not very clearly take your meaning’ said zero ‘but i am sure you mean kindly  as to my departure there is another point to be considered  i have neglected to supply myself with funds my little all has perished in what history will love to relate under the name of the golden square atrocity and without what is coarsely if vigorously called stamps you must be well aware it is impossible for me to pass the ocean’  ‘for me’ said somerset ‘you have now ceased to be a man  you have no more claim upon me than a door scraper but the touching confusion of your mind disarms me from extremities  until today i always thought stupidity was funny i now know otherwise and when i look upon your idiot face laughter rises within me like a deadly sickness and the tears spring up into my eyes as bitter as blood  what should this portend  i begin to doubt i am losing faith in scepticism  is it possible’ he cried in a kind of horror of himself—‘is it conceivable that i believe in right and wrong  already i have found myself with incredulous surprise to be the victim of a prejudice of personal honour and must this change proceed  have you robbed me of my youth  must i fall at my time of life into the common banker  but why should i address that head of wood  let this suffice  i dare not let you stay among women and children i lack the courage to denounce you if by any means i may avoid it you have no money well then take mine and go and if ever i behold your face after today that day will be your last’  ‘under the circumstances’ replied zero ‘i scarce see my way to refuse your offer  your expressions may pain they cannot surprise me i am aware our point of view requires a little training a little moral hygiene if i may so express it and one of the points that has always charmed me in your character is this delightful frankness  as for the small advance it shall be remitted you from philadelphia’  ‘it shall not’ said somerset  ‘dear fellow you do not understand’ returned the plotter  ‘i shall now be received with fresh confidence by my superiors and my experiments will be no longer hampered by pitiful conditions of the purse’  ‘what i am now about sir is a crime’ replied somerset ‘and were you to roll in wealth like vanderbilt i should scorn to be reimbursed of money i had so scandalously misapplied  take it and keep it  by george sir three days of you have transformed me to an ancient roman’  with these words somerset hailed a passing hansom and the pair were driven rapidly to the railway terminus  there an oath having been exacted the money changed hands  ‘and now’ said somerset ‘i have bought back my honour with every penny i possess  and i thank god though there is nothing before me but starvation i am free from all entanglement with mr zero pumpernickel jones’  ‘to starve’ cried zero  ‘dear fellow i cannot endure the thought’  ‘take your ticket’ returned somerset  ‘i think you display temper’ said zero  ‘take your ticket’ reiterated the young man  ‘well’ said the plotter as he returned ticket in hand ‘your attitude is so strange and painful that i scarce know if i should ask you to shake hands’  ‘as a man no’ replied somerset ‘but i have no objection to shake hands with you as i might with a pumpwell that ran poison or bellfire’  ‘this is a very cold parting’ sighed the dynamiter and still followed by somerset he began to descend the platform  this was now bustling with passengers the train for liverpool was just about to start another had but recently arrived and the double tide made movement difficult as the pair reached the neighbourhood of the bookstall however they came into an open space and here the attention of the plotter was attracted by a standard broadside bearing the words ‘second edition explosion in golden square’  his eye lighted groping in his pocket for the necessary coin he sprang forward—his bag knocked sharply on the corner of the stall—and instantly with a formidable report the dynamite exploded  when the smoke cleared away the stall was seen much shattered and the stall keeper running forth in terror from the ruins but of the irish patriot or the gladstone bag no adequate remains were to be found  in the first scramble of the alarm somerset made good his escape and came out upon the euston road his head spinning his body sick with hunger and his pockets destitute of coin  yet as he continued to walk the pavements he wondered to find in his heart a sort of peaceful exultation a great content a sense as it were of divine presence and the kindliness of fate and he was able to tell himself that even if the worst befell he could now starve with a certain comfort since zero was expunged  late in the afternoon he found himself at the door of mr godall’s shop and being quite unmanned by his long fast and scarce considering what he did he opened the glass door and entered  ‘ha’ said mr godall ‘mr somerset  well have you met with an adventure  have you the promised story  sit down if you please suffer me to choose you a cigar of my own special brand and reward me with a narrative in your best style’  ‘i must not take a cigar’ said somerset  ‘indeed’ said mr godall  ‘but now i come to look at you more closely i perceive that you are changed  my poor boy i hope there is nothing wrong’  somerset burst into tears     epilogue of the cigar divan   on a certain day of lashing rain in the december of last year and between the hours of nine and ten in the morning mr edward challoner pioneered himself under an umbrella to the door of the cigar divan in rupert street  it was a place he had visited but once before the memory of what had followed on that visit and the fear of somerset having prevented his return  even now he looked in before he entered but the shop was free of customers  the young man behind the counter was so intently writing in a penny versionbook that he paid no heed to challoner’s arrival  on a second glance it seemed to the latter that he recognised him  ‘by jove’ he thought ‘unquestionably somerset’  and though this was the very man he had been so sedulously careful to avoid his unexplained position at the receipt of custom changed distaste to curiosity  ‘“or opulent rotunda strike the sky”’ said the shopman to himself in the tone of one considering a verse  ‘i suppose it would be too much to say “orotunda” and yet how noble it were  “or opulent orotunda strike the sky”  but that is the bitterness of arts you see a good effect and some nonsense about sense continually intervenes’  ‘somerset my dear fellow’ said challoner ‘is this a masquerade’  ‘what  challoner’ cried the shopman  ‘i am delighted to see you  one moment till i finish the octave of my sonnet only the octave’  and with a friendly waggle of the hand he once more buried himself in the commerce of the muses  ‘i say’ he said presently looking up ‘you seem in wonderful preservation how about the hundred pounds’  ‘i have made a small inheritance from a great aunt in wales’ replied challoner modestly  ‘ah’ said somerset ‘i very much doubt the legitimacy of inheritance the state in my view should collar it  i am now going through a stage of socialism and poetry’ he added apologetically as one who spoke of a course of medicinal waters  ‘and are you really the person of the—establishment’ inquired challoner deftly evading the word ‘shop’  ‘a vendor sir a vendor’ returned the other pocketing his poesy  ‘i help old happy and glorious  can i offer you a weed’  ‘well i scarcely like    ’ began challoner  ‘nonsense my dear fellow’ cried the shopman  ‘we are very proud of the business and the old man let me inform you besides being the most egregious of created beings from the point of view of ethics is literally sprung from the loins of kings  “de godall je suis le fervent”  there is only one godall—by the way’ he added as challoner lit his cigar ‘how did you get on with the detective trade’  ‘i did not try’ said challoner curtly  ‘ah well i did’ returned somerset ‘and made the most incomparable mess of it lost all my money and fairly covered myself with odium and ridicule  there is more in that business challoner than meets the eye there is more in fact in all businesses  you must believe in them or get up the belief that you believe  hence’ he added ‘the recognised inferiority of the plumber for no one could believe in plumbing’  ‘a propos’ asked challoner ‘do you still paint’  ‘not now’ replied paul ‘but i think of taking up the violin’  challoner’s eye which had been somewhat restless since the trade of the detective had been named now rested for a moment on the columns of the morning paper where it lay spread upon the counter  ‘by jove’ he cried ‘that’s odd’  ‘what is odd’ asked paul  ‘oh nothing’ returned the other ‘only i once met a person called m’guire’  ‘so did i’ cried somerset  ‘is there anything about him’  challoner read as follows ‘mysterious death in stepney  an inquest was held yesterday on the body of patrick m’guire described as a carpenter  doctor dovering stated that he had for some time treated the deceased as a dispensary patient for sleeplessness loss of appetite and nervous depression  there was no cause of death to be found  he would say the deceased had sunk  deceased was not a temperate man which doubtless accelerated death  deceased complained of dumb ague but witness had never been able to detect any positive disease  he did not know that he had any family  he regarded him as a person of unsound intellect who believed himself a member and the victim of some secret society  if he were to hazard an opinion he would say deceased had died of fear’  ‘and the doctor would be right’ cried somerset ‘and my dear challoner i am so relieved to hear of his demise that i will—well after all’ he added ‘poor devil he was well served’  the door at this moment opened and desborough appeared upon the threshold  he was wrapped in a long waterproof imperfectly supplied with buttons his boots were full of water his hat greasy with service and yet he wore the air of one exceeding well content with life  he was hailed by the two others with exclamations of surprise and welcome  ‘and did you try the detective business’ inquired paul  ‘no’ returned harry  ‘oh yes by the way i did though twice and got caught out both times  but i thought i should find my—my wife here’ he added with a kind of proud confusion  ‘what are you married’ cried somerset  ‘oh yes’ said harry ‘quite a long time a month at least’  ‘money’ asked challoner  ‘that’s the worst of it’ desborough admitted  ‘we are deadly hard up but the pri mr godall is going to do something for us  that is what brings us here’  ‘who was mrs desborough’ said challoner in the tone of a man of society  ‘she was a miss luxmore’ returned harry  ‘you fellows will be sure to like her for she is much cleverer than i  she tells wonderful stories too better than a book’  and just then the door opened and mrs desborough entered  somerset cried out aloud to recognise the young lady of the superfluous mansion and challoner fell back a step and dropped his cigar as he beheld the sorceress of chelsea  ‘what’ cried harry ‘do you both know my wife’  ‘i believe i have seen her’ said somerset a little wildly  ‘i think i have met the gentleman’ said mrs desborough sweetly ‘but i cannot imagine where it was’  ‘oh no’ cried somerset fervently ‘i have no notion—i cannot conceive—where it could have been  indeed’ he continued growing in emphasis ‘i think it highly probable that it’s a mistake’  ‘and you challoner’ asked harry ‘you seemed to recognise her too’  ‘these are both friends of yours harry’ said the lady  ‘delighted i am sure  i do not remember to have met mr challoner’  challoner was very red in the face perhaps from having groped after his cigar  ‘i do not remember to have had the pleasure’ he responded huskily  ‘well and mr godall’ asked mrs desborough  ‘are you the lady that has an appointment with old—’ began somerset and paused blushing  ‘because if so’ he resumed ‘i was to announce you at once’  and the shopman raised a curtain opened a door and passed into a small pavilion which had been added to the back of the house  on the roof the rain resounded musically  the walls were lined with maps and prints and a few works of reference  upon a table was a largescale map of egypt and the soudan and another of tonkin on which by the aid of coloured pins the progress of the different wars was being followed day by day a light refreshing odour of the most delicate tobacco hung upon the air and a fire not of foul coal but of clearflaming resinous billets chattered upon silver dogs  in this elegant and plain apartment mr godall sat in a morning muse placidly gazing at the fire and hearkening to the rain upon the roof  ‘ha my dear mr somerset’ said he ‘and have you since last night adopted any fresh political principle’  ‘the lady sir’ said somerset with another blush  ‘you have seen her i believe’ returned mr godall and on somerset’s replying in the affirmative ‘you will excuse me my dear sir’ he resumed ‘if i offer you a hint  i think it not improbable this lady may desire entirely to forget the past  from one gentleman to another no more words are necessary’  a moment after he had received mrs desborough with that grave and touching urbanity that so well became him  ‘i am pleased madam to welcome you to my poor house’ he said ‘and shall be still more so if what were else a barren courtesy and a pleasure personal to myself shall prove to be of serious benefit to you and mr desborough’  ‘your highness’ replied clara ‘i must begin with thanks it is like what i have heard of you that you should thus take up the case of the unfortunate and as for my harry he is worthy of all that you can do’ she paused  ‘but for yourself’ suggested mr godall—‘it was thus you were about to continue i believe’  ‘you take the words out of my mouth’ she said  ‘for myself it is different’  ‘i am not here to be a judge of men’ replied the prince ‘still less of women  i am now a private person like yourself and many million others but i am one who still fights upon the side of quiet  now madam you know better than i and god better than you what you have done to mankind in the past i pause not to inquire it is with the future i concern myself it is for the future i demand security  i would not willingly put arms into the hands of a disloyal combatant and i dare not restore to wealth one of the levyers of a private and a barbarous war  i speak with some severity and yet i pick my terms  i tell myself continually that you are a woman and a voice continually reminds me of the children whose lives and limbs you have endangered  a woman’ he repeated solemnly—‘and children  possibly madam when you are yourself a mother you will feel the bite of that antithesis possibly when you kneel at night beside a cradle a fear will fall upon you heavier than any shame and when your child lies in the pain and danger of disease you shall hesitate to kneel before your maker’  ‘you look at the fault’ she said ‘and not at the excuse  has your own heart never leaped within you at some story of oppression  but alas no for you were born upon a throne’  ‘i was born of woman’ said the prince ‘i came forth from my mother’s agony helpless as a wren like other nurselings  this which you forgot i have still faithfully remembered  is it not one of your english poets that looked abroad upon the earth and saw vast circumvallations innumerable troops manoeuvring warships at sea and a great dust of battles on shore and casting anxiously about for what should be the cause of so many and painful preparations spied at last in the centre of all a mother and her babe  these madam are my politics and the verses which are by mr coventry patmore i have caused to be translated into the bohemian tongue  yes these are my politics to change what we can to better what we can but still to bear in mind that man is but a devil weakly fettered by some generous beliefs and impositions and for no word however nobly sounding and no cause however just and pious to relax the stricture of these bonds’  there was a silence of a moment  ‘i fear madam’ resumed the prince ‘that i but weary you  my views are formal like myself and like myself they also begin to grow old  but i must still trouble you for some reply’  ‘i can say but one thing’ said mrs desborough ‘i love my husband’  ‘it is a good answer’ returned the prince ‘and you name a good influence but one that need not be conterminous with life’  ‘i will not play at pride with such a man as you’ she answered  ‘what do you ask of me not protestations i am sure  what shall i say  i have done much that i cannot defend and that i would not do again  can i say more  yes i can say this i never abused myself with the muddleheaded fairy tales of politics  i was at least prepared to meet reprisals  while i was levying war myself—or levying murder if you choose the plainer term—i never accused my adversaries of assassination i never felt or feigned a righteous horror when a price was put upon my life by those whom i attacked  i never called the policeman a hireling i may have been a criminal in short but i never was a fool’  ‘enough madam’ returned the prince ‘more than enough  your words are most reviving to my spirits for in this age when even the assassin is a sentimentalist there is no virtue greater in my eyes than intellectual clarity  suffer me then to ask you to retire for by the signal of that bell i perceive my old friend your mother to be close at hand with her i promise you to do my utmost’  and as mrs desborough returned to the divan the prince opening a door upon the other side admitted mrs luxmore  ‘madam and my very good friend’ said he ‘is my face so much changed that you no longer recognise prince florizel in mr godall’  ‘to be sure’ she cried looking at him through her glasses  ‘i have always regarded your highness as a perfect man and in your altered circumstances of which i have already heard with deep regret i will beg you to consider my respect increased instead of lessened’  ‘i have found it so’ returned the prince ‘with every class of my acquaintance  but madam i pray you to be seated  my business is of a delicate order and regards your daughter’  ‘in that case’ said mrs luxmore ‘you may save yourself the trouble of speaking for i have fully made up my mind to have nothing to do with her  i will not hear one word in her defence but as i value nothing so particularly as the virtue of justice i think it my duty to explain to you the grounds of my complaint  she deserted me her natural protector for years she has consorted with the most disreputable persons and to fill the cup of her offence she has recently married  i refuse to see her or the being to whom she has linked herself  one hundred and twenty pounds a year i have always offered her i offer it again  it is what i had myself when i was her age’  ‘very well madam’ said the prince ‘and be that so  but to touch upon another matter what was the income of the reverend bernard fanshawe’  ‘my father’ asked the spirited old lady  ‘i believe he had seven hundred pounds in the year’  ‘you were one i think of several’ pursued the prince  ‘of four’ was the reply  ‘we were four daughters and painful as the admission is to make a more detestable family could scarce be found in england’  ‘dear me’ said the prince  ‘and you madam have an income of eight thousand’  ‘not more than five’ returned the old lady ‘but where on earth are you conducting me’  ‘to an allowance of one thousand pounds a year’ replied florizel smiling  ‘for i must not suffer you to take your father for a rule  he was poor you are rich  he had many calls upon his poverty there are none upon your wealth  and indeed madam if you will let me touch this matter with a needle there is but one point in common to your two positions that each had a daughter more remarkable for liveliness than duty’  ‘i have been entrapped into this house’ said the old lady getting to her feet  ‘but it shall not avail  not all the tobacconists in europe   ’  ‘ah madam’ interrupted florizel ‘before what is referred to as my fall you had not used such language  and since you so much object to the simple industry by which i live let me give you a friendly hint  if you will not consent to support your daughter i shall be constrained to place that lady behind my counter where i doubt not she would prove a great attraction and your soninlaw shall have a livery and run the errands  with such young blood my business might be doubled and i might be bound in common gratitude to place the name of luxmore beside that of godall’  ‘your highness’ said the old lady ‘i have been very rude and you are very cunning  i suppose the minx is on the premises  produce her’  ‘let us rather observe them unperceived’ said the prince and so saying he rose and quietly drew back the curtain  mrs desborough sat with her back to them on a chair somerset and harry were hanging on her words with extraordinary interest challoner alleging some affair had long ago withdrawn from the detested neighbourhood of the enchantress  ‘at that moment’ mrs desborough was saying ‘mr gladstone detected the features of his cowardly assailant  a cry rose to his lips a cry of mingled triumph   ’  ‘that is mr somerset’ interrupted the spirited old lady in the highest note of her register  ‘mr somerset what have you done with my houseproperty’  ‘madam’ said the prince ‘let it be mine to give the explanation and in the meanwhile welcome your daughter’  ‘well clara how do you do’ said mrs luxmore  ‘it appears i am to give you an allowance  so much the better for you  as for mr somerset i am very ready to have an explanation for the whole affair though costly was eminently humorous  and at any rate’ she added nodding to paul ‘he is a young gentleman for whom i have a great affection and his pictures were the funniest i ever saw’  ‘i have ordered a collation’ said the prince  ‘mr somerset as these are all your friends i propose if you please that you should join them at table  i will take the shop’     footnotes   9  hereupon the arabian author enters on one of his digressions fearing apparently that the somewhat eccentric views of mr somerset should throw discredit on a part of truth he calls upon the english people to remember with more gratitude the services of the police to what unobserved and solitary acts of heroism they are called against what odds of numbers and of arms and for how small a reward either in fame or money matter it has appeared to the translators too serious for this place  43  in this name the accent falls upon the e the s is sibilant  176  the arabian author of the original has here a long passage conceived in a style too oriental for the english reader  we subjoin a specimen and it seems doubtful whether it should be printed as prose or verse ‘any writard who writes dynamitard shall find in me a neverresting fightard’ and he goes on if we correctly gather his meaning to object to such elegant and obviously correct spellings as lamplightard corndealard applefilchard clearly justified by the parallel—pilchard and opera dancard  ‘dynamitist’ he adds ‘i could understand’  182  the arabian author with that quaint particularity of touch which our translation usually prætermits here registers a somewhat interesting detail  zero pronounced the word ‘boom’ and the reader if but for the nonce will possibly consent to follow him
