40967607	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                        the christmas banquet           from the unpublished allegories of the heart   i have here attempted said roderick unfolding a few sheets of manuscript as he sat with rosina and the sculptor in the summerhousei have attempted to seize hold of a personage who glides past me occasionally in my walk through life  my former sad experience as you know has gifted me with some degree of insight into the gloomy mysteries of the human heart through which i have wandered like one astray in a dark cavern with his torch fast flickering to extinction  but this man this class of men is a hopeless puzzle  well but propound him said the sculptor  let us have an idea of hint to begin with  why indeed replied roderick he is such a being as i could conceive you to carve out of marble and some yet unrealized perfection of human science to endow with an exquisite mockery of intellect but still there lacks the last inestimable touch of a divine creator  he looks like a man and perchance like a better specimen of man than you ordinarily meet  you might esteem him wise he is capable of cultivation and refinement and has at least an external conscience but the demands that spirit makes upon spirit are precisely those to which he cannot respond when at last you come close to him you find him chill and unsubstantiala mere vapor  i believe said rosina i have a glimmering idea of what you mean  then be thankful answered her husband smiling but do not anticipate any further illumination from what i am about to read i have here imagined such a man to bewhat probably he never isconscious of the deficiency in his spiritual organization methinks the result would be a sense of cold unreality wherewith he would go shivering through the world longing to exchange his load of ice for any burden of real grief that fate could fling upon a human being  contenting himself with this preface roderick began to read  in a certain old gentlemans last will and testament there appeared a bequest which as his final thought and deed was singularly in keeping with a long life of melancholy eccentricity  he devised a considerable sum for establishing a fund the interest of which was to be expended annually forever in preparing a christmas banquet for ten of the most miserable persons that could be found  it seemed not to be the testators purpose to make these half a score of sad hearts merry but to provide that the stern or fierce expression of human discontent should not be drowned even for that one holy and joyful day amid the acclamations of festal gratitude which all christendom sends up  and he desired likewise to perpetuate his own remonstrance against the earthly course of providence and his sad and sour dissent from those systems of religion or philosophy which either find sunshine in the world or draw it down from heaven  the task of inviting the guests or of selecting among such as might advance their claims to partake of this dismal hospitality was confided to the two trustees or stewards of the fund  these gentlemen like their deceased friend were sombre humorists who made it their principal occupation to number the sable threads in the web of human life and drop all the golden ones out of the reckoning  they performed their present office with integrity and judgment  the aspect of the assembled company on the day of the first festival might not it is true have satisfied every beholder that these were especially the individuals chosen forth from all the world whose griefs were worthy to stand as indicators of the mass of human suffering  yet after due consideration it could not be disputed that here was a variety of hopeless discomfort which if it sometimes arose from causes apparently inadequate was thereby only the shrewder imputation against the nature and mechanism of life  the arrangements and decorations of the banquet were probably intended to signify that death in life which had been the testators definition of existence  the hall illuminated by torches was hung round with curtains of deep and dusky purple and adorned with branches of cypress and wreaths of artificial flowers imitative of such as used to be strewn over the dead  a sprig of parsley was laid by every plate  the main reservoir of wine was a sepulchral urn of silver whence the liquor was distributed around the table in small vases accurately copied from those that held the tears of ancient mourners  neither had the stewardsif it were their taste that arranged these detailsforgotten the fantasy of the old egyptians who seated a skeleton at every festive board and mocked their own merriment with the imperturbable grin of a deathshead such a fearful guest shrouded in a black mantle sat now at the head of the table  it was whispered i know not with what truth that the testator himself had once walked the visible world with the machinery of that sane skeleton and that it was one of the stipulations of his will that he should thus be permitted to sit from year to year at the banquet which he had instituted if so it was perhaps covertly implied that he had cherished no hopes of bliss beyond the grave to compensate for the evils which he felt or imagined here  and if in their bewildered conjectures as to the purpose of earthly existence the banqueters should throw aside the veil and cast an inquiring glance at this figure of death as seeking thence the solution otherwise unattainable the only reply would be a stare of the vacant eyecaverns and a grin of the skeleton jaws  such was the response that the dead man had fancied himself to receive when he asked of death to solve the riddle of his life and it was his desire to repeat it when the guests of his dismal hospitality should find themselves perplexed with the same question  what means that wreath  asked several of the company while viewing the decorations of the table  they alluded to a wreath of cypress which was held on high by a skeleton arm protruding from within the black mantle  it is a crown said one of the stewards not for the worthiest but for the wofulest when he shall prove his claim to it  the guest earliest bidden to the festival was a man of soft and gentle character who had not energy to struggle against the heavy despondency to which his temperament rendered him liable and therefore with nothing outwardly to excuse him from happiness he had spent a life of quiet misery that made his blood torpid and weighed upon his breath and sat like a ponderous nightfiend upon every throb of his unresisting heart his wretchedness seemed as deep as his original nature if not identical with it  it was the misfortune of a second guest to cherish within his bosom a diseased heart which had become so wretchedly sore that the continual and unavoidable rubs of the world the blow of an enemy the careless jostle of a stranger and even the faithful and loving touch of a friend alike made ulcers in it  as is the habit of people thus afflicted he found his chief employment in exhibiting these miserable sores to any who would give themselves the pain of viewing them  a third guest was a hypochondriac whose imagination wrought necromancy in his outward and inward world and caused him to see monstrous faces in the household fire and dragons in the clouds of sunset and fiends in the guise of beautiful women and something ugly or wicked beneath all the pleasant surfaces of nature  his neighbor at table was one who in his early youth had trusted mankind too much and hoped too highly in their behalf and in meeting with many disappointments had become desperately soured for several years back this misanthrope bad employed himself in accumulating motives for hating and despising his racesuch as murder lust treachery ingratitude faithlessness of trusted friends instinctive vices of children impurity of women hidden guilt in men of saintlike aspectand in short all manner of black realities that sought to decorate themselves with outward grace or glory  but at every atrocious fact that was added to his catalogue at every increase of the sad knowledge which he spent his life to collect the native impulses of the poor mans loving and confiding heart made him groan with anguish  next with his heavy brow bent downward there stole into the hall a man naturally earnest and impassioned who from his immemorial infancy had felt the consciousness of a high message to the world but essaying to deliver it had found either no voice or form of speech or else no ears to listen  therefore his whole life was a bitter questioning of himself why have not men acknowledged my mission  am i not a selfdeluding fool  what business have i on earth  where is my grave  throughout the festival he quaffed frequent draughts from the sepulchral urn of wine hoping thus to quench the celestial fire that tortured his own breast and could not benefit his race  then there entered having flung away a ticket for a ball a gay gallant of yesterday who had found four or five wrinkles in his brow and more gray hairs than he could well number on his head endowed with sense and feeling he had nevertheless spent his youth in folly but had reached at last that dreary point in life where folly quits us of her own accord leaving us to make friends with wisdom if we can  thus cold and desolate he had come to seek wisdom at the banquet and wondered if the skeleton were she  to eke out the company the stewards had invited a distressed poet from his home in the almshouse and a melancholy idiot from the streetcorner  the latter had just the glimmering of sense that was sufficient to make him conscious of a vacancy which the poor fellow all his life long had mistily sought to fill up with intelligence wandering up and down the streets and groaning miserably because his attempts were ineffectual  the only lady in the hall was one who had fallen short of absolute and perfect beauty merely by the trifling defect of a slight cast in her left eye  but this blemish minute as it was so shocked the pure ideal of her soul rather than her vanity that she passed her life in solitude and veiled her countenance even from her own gaze  so the skeleton sat shrouded at one end of the table and this poor lady at the other  one other guest remains to be described  he was a young man of smooth brow fair cheek and fashionable mien  so far as his exterior developed him he might much more suitably have found a place at some merry christmas table than have been numbered among the blighted fatestricken fancytortured set of illstarred banqueters  murmurs arose among the guests as they noted the glance of general scrutiny which the intruder threw over his companions  what had he to do among them  why did not the skeleton of the dead founder of the feast unbend its rattling joints arise and motion the unwelcome stranger from the board  shameful said the morbid man while a new ulcer broke out in his heart  he comes to mock us we shall be the jest of his tavern friends ihe will make a farce of our miseries and bring it out upon the stage  o never mind him said the hypochondriac smiling sourly  he shall feast from yonder tureen of vipersoup and if there is a fricassee of scorpions on the table pray let him have his share of it  for the dessert he shall taste the apples of sodom then if he like our christmas fare let him return again next year  trouble him not murmured the melancholy man with gentleness what matters it whether the consciousness of misery come a few years sooner or later  if this youth deem himself happy now yet let him sit with us for the sake of the wretchedness to come  the poor idiot approached the young man with that mournful aspect of vacant inquiry which his face continually wore and which caused people to say that he was always in search of his missing wits after no little examination he touched the strangers hand but immediately drew back his own shaking his head and shivering  cold cold cold muttered the idiot  the young man shivered too and smiled  gentlemen and you madam said one of the stewards of the festival do not conceive so ill either of our caution or judgment as to imagine that we have admitted this young strangergervayse hastings by namewithout a full investigation and thoughtful balance of his claims  trust me not a guest at the table is better entitled to his seat  the stewards guaranty was perforce satisfactory  the company therefore took their places and addressed themselves to the serious business of the feast but were soon disturbed by the hypochondriac who thrust back his chair complaining that a dish of stewed toads and vipers was set before him and that there was green ditchwater in his cup of wine  this mistake being amended he quietly resumed his seat  the wine as it flowed freely from the sepulchral urn seemed to come imbued with all gloomy inspirations so that its influence was not to cheer but either to sink the revellers into a deeper melancholy or elevate their spirits to an enthusiasm of wretchedness  the conversation was various  they told sad stories about people who might have been worthy guests at such a festival as the present  they talked of grisly incidents in human history of strange crimes which if truly considered were but convulsions of agony of some lives that had been altogether wretched and of others which wearing a general semblance of happiness had yet been deformed sooner or later by misfortune as by the intrusion of a grim face at a banquet of deathbed scenes and what dark intimations might be gathered from the words of dying men of suicide and whether the more eligible mode were by halter knife poison drowning gradual starvation or the fumes of charcoal  the majority of the guests as is the custom with people thoroughly and profoundly sick at heart were anxious to make their own woes the theme of discussion and prove themselves most excellent in anguish  the misanthropist went deep into the philosophy of evil and wandered about in the darkness with now and then a gleam of discolored light hovering on ghastly shapes and horrid scenery  many a miserable thought such as men have stumbled upon from age to age did he now rake up again and gloat over it as an inestimable gem a diamond a treasure far preferable to those bright spiritual revelations of a better world which are like precious stones from heavens pavement  and then amid his lore of wretchedness he hid his face and wept  it was a festival at which the woful man of uz might suitably have been a guest together with all in each succeeding age who have tasted deepest of the bitterness of life  and be it said too that every son or daughter of woman however favored with happy fortune might at one sad moment or another have claimed the privilege of a stricken heart to sit down at this table but throughout the feast it was remarked that the young stranger gervayse hastings was unsuccessful in his attempts to catch its pervading spirit  at any deep strong thought that found utterance and which was torn out as it were from the saddest recesses of human consciousness he looked mystified and bewildered even more than the poor idiot who seemed to grasp at such things with his earnest heart and thus occasionally to comprehend them  the young mans conversation was of a colder and lighter kind often brilliant but lacking the powerful characteristics of a nature that had been developed by suffering  sir said the misanthropist bluntly in reply to some observation by gervayse hastings pray do not address me again we have no right to talk together  our minds have nothing in common  by what claim you appear at this banquet i cannot guess but methinks to a man who could say what you have just now said my companions and myself must seem no more than shadows flickering on the wall  and precisely such a shadow are you to us  the young man smiled and bowed but drawing himself back in his chair he buttoned his coat over his breast as if the banquetingball were growing chill  again the idiot fixed his melancholy stare upon the youth and murmured cold cold cold  the banquet drew to its conclusion and the guests departed scarcely had they stepped across the threshold of the hall when the scene that had there passed seemed like the vision of a sick fancy or an exhalation from a stagnant heart  now and then however during the year that ensued these melancholy people caught glimpses of one another transient indeed but enough to prove that they walked the earth with the ordinary allotment of reality  sometimes a pair of them came face to face while stealing through the evening twilight enveloped in their sable cloaks  sometimes they casually met in churchyards  once also it happened that two of the dismal banqueters mutually started at recognizing each other in the noonday sunshine of a crowded street stalking there like ghosts astray doubtless they wondered why the skeleton did not come abroad at noonday too  but whenever the necessity of their affairs compelled these christmas guests into the bustling world they were sure to encounter the young man who had so unaccountably been admitted to the festival  they saw him among the gay and fortunate they caught the sunny sparkle of his eye they heard the light and careless tones of his voice and muttered to themselves with such indignation as only the aristocracy of wretchedness could kindle the traitor the vile impostor  providence in its own good time may give him a right to feast among us  but the young mans unabashed eye dwelt upon their gloomy figures as they passed him seeming to say perchance with somewhat of a sneer first know my secret then measure your claims with mine  the step of time stole onward and soon brought merry christmas round again with glad and solemn worship in the churches and sports games festivals and everywhere the bright face of joy beside the household fire  again likewise the hall with its curtains of dusky purple was illuminated by the deathtorches gleaming on the sepulchral decorations of the banquet  the veiled skeleton sat in state lifting the cypresswreath above its head as the guerdon of some guest illustrious in the qualifications which there claimed precedence  as the stewards deemed the world inexhaustible in misery and were desirous of recognizing it in all its forms they had not seen fit to reassemble the company of the former year  new faces now threw their gloom across the table  there was a man of nice conscience who bore a bloodstain in his heartthe death of a fellowcreaturewhich for his more exquisite torture had chanced with such a peculiarity of circumstances that he could not absolutely determine whether his will had entered into the deed or not  therefore his whole life was spent in the agony of an inward trial for murder with a continual sifting of the details of his terrible calamity until his mind had no longer any thought nor his soul any emotion disconnected with it there was a mother tooa mother once but a desolation nowwho many years before had gone out on a pleasureparty and returning found her infant smothered in its little bed and ever since she has been tortured with the fantasy that her buried baby lay smothering in its coffin  then there was an aged lady who had lived from time immemorial with a constant tremor quivering through herframe  it was terrible to discern her dark shadow tremulous upon the wall her lips likewise were tremulous and the expression of her eye seemed to indicate that her soul was trembling too  owing to the bewilderment and confusion which made almost a chaos of her intellect it was impossible to discover what dire misfortune had thus shaken her nature to its depths so that the stewards had admitted her to the table not from any acquaintance with her history but on the safe testimony of her miserable aspect  some surprise was expressed at the presence of a bluff redfaced gentleman a certain mr smith who had evidently the fat of many a rich feast within him and the habitual twinkle of whose eye betrayed a disposition to break forth into uproarious laughter for little cause or none  it turned out however that with the best possible flow of spirits our poor friend was afflicted with a physical disease of the heart which threatened instant death on the slightest cachinnatory indulgence or even that titillation of the bodily frame produced by merry thoughts  in this dilemma he had sought admittance to the banquet on the ostensible plea of his irksome and miserable state but in reality with the hope of imbibing a lifepreserving melancholy  a married couple had been invited from a motive of bitter humor it being well understood that they rendered each other unutterably miserable whenever they chanced to meet and therefore must necessarily be fit associates at the festival  in contrast with these was another couple still unmarried who had interchanged their hearts in early life but had been divided by circumstances as impalpable as morning mist and kept apart so long that their spirits now found it impossible to meet therefore yearning for communion yet shrinking from one another and choosing none beside they felt themselves companionless in life and looked upon eternity as a boundless desert  next to the skeleton sat a mere son of eartha hunter of the exchangea gatherer of shining dusta man whose lifes record was in his ledger and whose souls prisonhouse the vaults of the bank where he kept his deposits  this person had been greatly perplexed at his invitation deeming himself one of the most fortunate men in the city but the stewards persisted in demanding his presence assuring him that he had no conception how miserable he was  and now appeared a figure which we must acknowledge as our acquaintance of the former festival  it was gervayse hastings whose presence had then caused so much question and criticism and who now took his place with the composure of one whose claims were satisfactory to himself and must needs be allowed by others yet his easy and unruffled face betrayed no sorrow  the wellskilled beholders gazed a moment into his eyes and shook their heads to miss the unuttered sympathythe countersign never to be falsifiedof those whose hearts are cavernmouths through which they descend into a region of illimitable woe and recognize other wanderers there  who is this youth asked the man with a bloodstain on his conscience  surely he has never gone down into the depths  i know all the aspects of those who have passed through the dark valley by what right is he among us  ah it is a sinful thing to come hither without a sorrow murmured the aged lady in accents that partook of the eternal tremor which pervaded her whole being depart young man  your soul has never been shaken and therefore i tremble so much the more to look at you  his soul shaken  no ill answer for it said bluff mr smith pressing his hand upon his heart and making himself as melancholy as he could for fear of a fatal explosion of laughter  i know the lad well he has as fair prospects as any young man about town and has no more right among us miserable creatures than the child unborn  he never was miserable and probably never will be  our honored guests interposed the stewards pray have patience with us and believe at least that our deep veneration for the sacredness of this solemnity would preclude any wilful violation of it  receive this young man to your table  it may not be too much to say that no guest here would exchange his own heart for the one that beats within that youthful bosom  id call it a bargain and gladly too muttered mr smith with a perplexing mixture of sadness and mirthful conceit  a plague upon their nonsense  my own heart is the only really miserable one in the company it will certainly be the death of me at last  nevertheless as on the former occasion the judgment of the stewards being without appeal the company sat down  the obnoxious guest made no more attempt to obtrude his conversation on those about him but appeared to listen to the tabletalk with peculiar assiduity as if some inestimable secret otherwise beyond his reach might be conveyed in a casual word  and in truth to those who could understand and value it there was rich matter in the upgushings and outpourings of these initiated souls to whom sorrow had been a talisman admitting them into spiritual depths which no other spell can open  sometimes out of the midst of densest gloom there flashed a momentary radiance pure as crystal bright as the flame of stars and shedding such a glow upon the mysteries of life that the guests were ready to exclaim surely the riddle is on the point of being solved  at such illuminated intervals the saddest mourners felt it to be revealed that mortal griefs are but shadowy and external no more than the sable robes voluminously shrouding a certain divine reality and thus indicating what might otherwise be altogether invisible to mortal eye  just now remarked the trembling old woman i seemed to see beyond the outside  and then my everlasting tremor passed away  would that i could dwell always in these momentary gleams of light said the man of stricken conscience  then the bloodstain in my heart would be washed clean away  this strain of conversation appeared so unintelligibly absurd to good mr smith that he burst into precisely the fit of laughter which his physicians had warned him against as likely to prove instantaneously fatal  in effect he fell back in his chair a corpse with a broad grin upon his face while his ghost perchance remained beside it bewildered at its unpremeditated exit  this catastrophe of course broke up the festival  how is this  you do not tremble observed the tremulous old woman to gervayse hastings who was gazing at the dead man with singular intentness  is it not awful to see him so suddenly vanish out of the midst of lifethis man of flesh and blood whose earthly nature was so warm and strong  there is a neverending tremor in my soul but it trembles afresh at this  and you are calm  would that he could teach me somewhat said gervayse hastings drawing a long breath  men pass before me like shadows on the wall their actions passions feelings are flickerings of the light and then they vanish  neither the corpse nor yonder skeleton nor this old womans everlasting tremor can give me what i seek  and then the company departed  we cannot linger to narrate in such detail more circumstances of these singular festivals which in accordance with the founders will continued to be kept with the regularity of an established institution  in process of time the stewards adopted the custom of inviting from far and near those individuals whose misfortunes were prominent above other mens and whose mental and moral development might therefore be supposed to possess a corresponding interest  the exiled noble of the french revolution and the broken soldier of the empire were alike represented at the table  fallen monarchs wandering about the earth have found places at that forlorn and miserable feast the statesman when his party flung him off might if he chose it be once more a great man for the space of a single banquet aaron burrs name appears on the record at a period when his ruinthe profoundest and most striking with more of moral circumstance in it than that of almost any other manwas complete in his lonely age  stephen guard when his wealth weighed upon him like a mountain once sought admittance of his own accord it is not probable however that these men had any lesson to teach in the lore of discontent and misery which might not equally well have been studied in the common walks of life illustrious unfortunates attract a wider sympathy not because their griefs are more intense but because being set on lofty pedestals they the better serve mankind as instances and bywords of calamity  it concerns our present purpose to say that at each successive festival gervayse hastings showed his face gradually changing from the smooth beauty of his youth to the thoughtful comeliness of manhood and thence to the bald impressive dignity of age he was the only individual invariably present  yet on every occasion there were murmurs both from those who knew his character and position and from them whose hearts shrank back as denying his companionship in their mystic fraternity  who is this impassive man had been asked a hundred times has he suffered  has he sinned  there are no traces of either then wherefore is he here  you must inquire of the stewards or of himself was the constant reply  we seem to know him well here in our city and know nothing of him but what is creditable and fortunate  yet hither he comes year after year to this gloomy banquet and sits among the guests like a marble statue  ask yonder skeleton perhaps that may solve the riddle  it was in truth a wonder  the life of gervayse hastings was not merely a prosperous but a brilliant one  everything had gone well with him  he was wealthy far beyond the expenditure that was required by habits of magnificence a taste of rare purity and cultivation a love of travel a scholars instinct to collect a splendid library and moreover what seemed a magnificent liberality to the distressed  he had sought happiness and not vainly if a lovely and tender wife and children of fair promise could insure it  he had besides ascended above the limit which separates the obscure from the distinguished and had won a stainless reputation in affairs of the widest public importance not that he was a popular character or had within him the mysterious attributes which are essential to that species of success  to the public he was a cold abstraction wholly destitute of those rich lines of personality that living warmth and the peculiar faculty of stamping his own hearts impression on a multitude of hearts by which the people recognize their favorites and it must be owned that after his most intimate associates had done their best to know him thoroughly and love him warmly they were startled to find how little hold he had upon their affections they approved they admired but still in those moments when the human spirit most craves reality they shrank back from gervayse hastings as powerless to give them what they sought  it was the feeling of distrustful regret with which we should draw back the hand after extending it in an illusive twilight to grasp the hand of a shadow upon the wall  as the superficial fervency of youth decayed this peculiar effect of gervayse hastingss character grew more perceptible his children when he extended his arms came coldly to his knees but never climbed them of their own accord  his wife wept secretly and almost adjudged herself a criminal because she shivered in the chill of his bosom  he too occasionally appeared not unconscious of the chillness of his moral atmosphere and willing if it might be so to warm himself at a kindly fire  but age stole onward and benumbed him snore and more  as the hoarfrost began to gather on him his wife went to her grave and was doubtless warmer there his children either died or were scattered to different homes of their own and old gervayse hastings unscathed by griefalone but needing no companionshipcontinued his steady walk through life and still one very christmas day attended at the dismal banquet  his privilege as a guest had become prescriptive now  had he claimed the head of the table even the skeleton would have been ejected from its seat  finally at the merry christmastide when he had numbered fourscore years complete this pale highbrowed marblefeatured old man once more entered the longfrequented hall with the same impassive aspect that had called forth so much dissatisfied remark at his first attendance  time except in matters merely external had done nothing for him either of good or evil  as he took his place he threw a calm inquiring glance around the table as if to ascertain whether any guest had yet appeared after so many unsuccessful banquets who might impart to him the mysterythe deep warm secretthe life within the lifewhich whether manifested in joy or sorrow is what gives substance to a world of shadows  my friends said gervayse hastings assuming a position which his long conversance with the festival caused to appear natural you are welcome  i drink to you all in this cup of sepulchral wine  the guests replied courteously but still in a manner that proved them unable to receive the old man as a member of their sad fraternity  it may be well to give the reader an idea of the present company at the banquet  one was formerly a clergyman enthusiastic in his profession and apparently of the genuine dynasty of those old puritan divines whose faith in their calling and stern exercise of it had placed them among the mighty of the earth  but yielding to the speculative tendency of the age he had gone astray from the firm foundation of an ancient faith and wandered into a cloudregion where everything was misty and deceptive ever mocking him with a semblance of reality but still dissolving when he flung himself upon it for support and rest  his instinct and early training demanded something steadfast but looking forward he beheld vapors piled on vapors and behind him an impassable gulf between the man of yesterday and today on the borders of which he paced to and fro sometimes wringing his hands in agony and often making his own woe a theme of scornful merriment  this surely was a miserable man next there was a theoristone of a numerous tribe although he deemed himself unique since the creationa theorist who had conceived a plan by which all the wretchedness of earth moral and physical might be done away and the bliss of the millennium at once accomplished  but the incredulity of mankind debarring him from action he was smitten with as much grief as if the whole mass of woe which he was denied the opportunity to remedy were crowded into his own bosom a plain old man in black attracted much of the companys notice on the supposition that he was no other than father miller who it seemed had given himself up to despair at the tedious delay of the final conflagration  then there was a man distinguished for native pride and obstinacy who a little while before had possessed immense wealth and held the control of a vast moneyed interest which he had wielded in the same spirit as a despotic monarch would wield the power of his empire carrying on a tremendous moral warfare the roar and tremor of which was felt at every fireside in the land  at length came a crushing ruina total overthrow of fortune power and characterthe effect of which on his imperious and in many respects noble and lofty nature might have entitled him to a place not merely at our festival but among the peers of pandemonium  there was a modern philanthropist who had become so deeply sensible of the calamities of thousands and millions of his fellowcreatures and of the impracticableness of any general measures for their relief that he had no heart to do what little good lay immediately within his power but contented himself with being miserable for sympathy  near him sat a gentleman in a predicament hitherto unprecedented but of which the present epoch probably affords numerous examples  ever since he was of capacity to read a newspaper this person had prided himself on his consistent adherence to one political party but in the confusion of these latter days had got bewildered and knew not whereabouts his party was  this wretched condition so morally desolate and disheartening to a man who has long accustomed himself to merge his individuality in the mass of a great body can only be conceived by such as have experienced it  his next companion was a popular orator who had lost his voice andas it was pretty much all that he had to losehad fallen into a state of hopeless melancholy  the table was likewise graced by two of the gentler sexone a halfstarved consumptive seamstress the representative of thousands just as wretched the other a woman of unemployed energy who found herself in the world with nothing to achieve nothing to enjoy and nothing even to suffer she had therefore driven herself to the verge of madness by dark breedings over the wrongs of her sex and its exclusion from a proper field of action  the roll of guests being thus complete a sidetable had been set for three or four disappointed officeseekers with hearts as sick as death whom the stewards had admitted partly because their calamities really entitled them to entrance here and partly that they were in especial need of a good dinner  there was likewise a homeless dog with his tail between his legs licking up the crumbs and gnawing the fragments of the feastsuch a melancholy cur as one sometimes sees about the streets without a master and willing to follow the first that will accept his service  in their own way these were as wretched a set of people as ever had assembled at the festival  there they sat with the veiled skeleton of the founder holding aloft the cypresswreath at one end of the table and at the other wrapped in furs the withered figure of gervayse hastings stately calm and cold impressing the company with awe yet so little interesting their sympathy that he might have vanished into thin air without their once exclaiming whither is he gone  sir said the philanthropist addressing the old man you have been so long a guest at this annual festival and have thus been conversant with so many varieties of human affliction that not improbably you have thence derived some great and important lessons  how blessed were your lot could you reveal a secret by which all this mass of woe might be removed  i know of but one misfortune answered gervayse hastings quietly and that is my own  your own rejoined the philanthropist  and looking back on your serene and prosperous life how can you claim to be the sole unfortunate of the human race  you will not understand it replied gervayse hastings feebly and with a singular inefficiency of pronunciation and sometimes putting one word for another  none have understood it not even those who experience the like  it is a chillness a want of earnestness a feeling as if what should be my heart were a thing of vapor a haunting perception of unreality  thus seeming to possess all that other men have all that men aim at i have really possessed nothing neither joy nor griefs  all things all personsas was truly said to me at this table long and long agohave been like shadows flickering on the wall  it was so with my wife and children with those who seemed my friends it is so with yourselves whom i see now before one  neither have i myself any real existence but am a shadow like the rest  and how is it with your views of a future life inquired the speculative clergyman  worse than with you said the old man in a hollow and feeble tone for i cannot conceive it earnestly enough to feel either hope or fear  minemine is the wretchedness  this cold heartthis unreal life  ah it grows colder still  it so chanced that at this juncture the decayed ligaments of the skeleton gave way and the dry hones fell together in a heap thus causing the dusty wreath of cypress to drop upon the table the attention of the company being thus diverted for a single instant from gervayse hastings they perceived on turning again towards him that the old man had undergone a change  his shadow had ceased to flicker on the wall   well rosina what is your criticism asked roderick as he rolled up the manuscript  frankly your success is by no means complete replied she it is true i have an idea of the character you endeavor to describe but it is rather by dint of my own thought than your expression  that is unavoidable observed the sculptor because the characteristics are all negative  if gervayse hastings could have imbibed one human grief at the gloomy banquet the task of describing him would have been infinitely easier  of such personsand we do meet with these moral monsters now and thenit is difficult to conceive how they came to exist here or what there is in them capable of existence hereafter  they seem to be on the outside of everything
