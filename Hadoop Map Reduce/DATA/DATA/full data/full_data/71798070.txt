71798070	two penniless princesses  by charlotte m yonge     chapter 1 dunbar        twas on a night an evening bright         when the dew began to fa       lady margaret was walking up and down         looking over her castle wa   the battlements of a castle were in disturbed times the only recreationground of the ladies and playplace of the young people dunbar castle standing on steep rocks above the north sea was not only inaccessible on that side but from its donjon tower commanded a magnificent view both of the expanse of waves taking purple tints from the shadows of the clouds with here and there a sail fleeting before the wind and of the rugged headlands of the coast point beyond point the nearer distinct and showing the green summits and below the tossing waves breaking white against the dark rocks and the distance becoming more and more hazy in spite of the bright sun which made a broken path of glory along the tossing whitecrested waters  the wind was a keen northeast breeze and might have been thought too severe by any but the hardy bold and wild children who were merrily playing on the top of the donjon tower round the staff whence fluttered the double treasured banner with the ruddy lion ramped in gold denoting the presence of the king  three little boys almost babies and a little girl not much older were presided over by a small elder sister who held the youngest in her lap and tried to amuse him with caresses and rhymes so as to prevent his interference with the castlebuilding of the others with their small hoard of pebbles and mussel and cockle shells  another maiden the wind tossing her long chestnutlocks uncovered but tied with the scottish snood sat on the battlement gazing far out over the waters with eyes of the same tint as the hair even the seabreeze failed to give more than a slight touch of colour to her somewhat freckled complexion and the limbs that rested in a careless attitude on the stone bench were long and languid though with years and favourable circumstances there might be a development of beauty and dignity her lips were crooning at intervals a mournful old scottish tune sometimes only humming sometimes uttering its melancholy burthen and she now and then touched a small harp that stood by her side on the seat  she did not turn round when a step approached till a hand was laid on her shoulder when she started and looked up into the face of another girl on a smaller scale with a complexion of the lilyandrose kind fair hair under her hood with a hawk upon her wrist and blue eyes dancing at the surprise of her sister  eleanor in a creel as usual she cried  i thought it was only one of the bairns was the answer  they might coup over the walls for aught thou seest returned the newcomer if it were not for little mary what would become of the poor weans  what will become of any of us said eleanor i was gazing out over the sea and wishing we could drift away upon it to some land of rest  the glenuskie folk are going to try another land said jean i was in the baileycourt even now playing at ball with jamie when in comes a laybrother with a letter from sir patrick to say that he is coming the night to crave permission from jamie to go with his wife to france annis as you know is betrothed to the son of his french friends malcolm is to study at the paris university and davie to be in the scottish guards to learn chivalry like his father and the leddy of glenuskieour cousin lilianis going with them  and she will see margaret said eleanor meg the dearie dost remember meg jeanie  well well do i remember her and how she used to let us nestle in her lap and sing to us she sang like thee elleen and was as motherlike as mary is to the weans but she was much blithesomerat least before our father was slain  sweetest meg my whole heart leaps after her cried eleanor with a fervent gesture  i loved her better than isabel though she was not so bonnie said jean  jeanie jeanie cried eleanor turning round with a vehemence strangely contrasting with her previous language wherefore should we not go with glenuskie to be with meg at bourges  jeanie opened her blue eyes wide  go to the french kings court she said  to the land of chivalry and song exclaimed eleanor where they have courts of love and poetry and tilts and tourneys and minstrelsy and the sun shines as it never does in this cold bleak north and above all there is margaret dear tender margaret almost a queen as a queen she will be one day oh i almost feel her embrace  it might be well said jean in the matteroffact tone of a practical young lady mewed up in these dismal castles we shall never get princely husbands like our sisters i might be queen of beauty i doubt me whether you are fair enough eleanor  oh that is not what i think of said eleanor it is to see our own margaret and to see and hear the minstrel knights instead of the rude savages here scarce one of whom knows what knighthood means  ay and they will lay hands on us and wed us one of these days returned jean unless we vow ourselves as nuns and i have no mind for that  nor would a convent always guard us said eleanor these reivers do not stick at sanctuary now in that happy land ladies meet with courtesy and there is a minstrel king like our father rene is his name uncle to margarets husband oh it would be a very paradise  let us go let us go exclaimed jean  go said mary who had drawn nearer to them while they spoke whither did ye say  to franceto sister margaret and peace and sunshine said eleanor  eh said the girl a pale fair child of twelve and what would poor jamie and the weans do wanting their titties  ye are but a bairn mary was jeans answer we shall do better for jamie by wedding some great lords in the far country than by waiting here at home  and james will soon have a queen of his own to guide him added eleanor  ill no quit jamie or the weans said little mary resolutely turning back as the threeyearold boy elicited a squall from the eighteenmonths one  johnnie johnnie what gars ye tak away wee andies claw here my mannie  and she was kneeling on the leads making peace over the precious crabs claw which with a few cockles and mussels was the choicest toy of these forlorn young stewarts for stewarts they all were though the three youngest the weans as they were called were only halfbrothers to the rest  nothing in point of fact could have been much more forlorn than the condition of all the father of the elder ones james i the flower of the whole stewart race had nine years before fallen a victim to the savage revenge and ferocity of the lawless men whom he had vainly endeavoured to restrain leaving an only son of six years old and six young daughters his wife joanna once the nightingale of windsor had wreaked vengeance in so barbarous a manner as to increase the dislike to her as an englishwoman forlorn and in danger she tried to secure a protector by a marriage with sir james stewart called the black knight of lorn but he was unable to do much for her and only added the feuds of his own family to increase the general danger the two eldest daughters margaret and isabel were already contracted to the dauphin and the duke of brittany and were soon sent to their new homes the little king the one darling of his mother was snatched from her and violently transferred from one fierce guardian to another each regarding the possession of his person as a sanction to tyranny he had been introduced to the two winsome young douglases only as a prelude to their murder and every day brought tidings of some fresh violence nay for the second time a murder was perpetrated in the queens own chamber  the poor woman had never been very tender or affectionate and had the haughty demeanour with which the house of somerset had thought fit to assert their claims to royalty the cruel slaughter of her first husband perhaps the only person for whom she had ever felt a softening love had hardened and soured her she despised and domineered over her second husband and made no secret that the number of her daughters was oppressive and that it was hard that while the royal branch had produced with one exception only useless pining maidens her second marriage in too quick succession should bring her sons who could only be a burthen no one greatly marvelled when a few weeks after the birth of little andrew his father disappeared though whether he had perished in some brawl been lost at sea or sought foreign service as far as possible from his queenly wife and inconvenient family no one knew  not long after the queen with her four daughters and the infants had been seized upon by a noted freebooter patrick hepburn of hailes and carried to dunbar castle probably to serve as hostages for they were fairly well treated though never allowed to go beyond the walls the queens health had however been greatly shaken the cold blasts of the north wind withered her up and she died in the beginning of the year 1445  the desolateness of the poor girls had perhaps been greater than their grief poor joanna had been exacting and tyrannical and with no female attendants but the old wornout english nurse had made them do her all sorts of services which were requited with scoldings and grumblings instead of the loving thanks which ought to have made them offices of affection as well as duty while the poor little boys would indeed have fared ill if their halfsister mary though only twelve years old had not been one of those girls who are endowed from the first with tender motherly instincts  beyond providing that there was a supply of some sort of food and that they were confined within the walls of the castle hepburn did not trouble his head about his prisoners and for many weeks they had no intercourse with any one save archie scott an old groom of their mothers ankaret nurse to baby andrew and the seneschal and his wife both hepburns  eleanor and jean who had been eight and seven years old at the time of the terrible catastrophe which had changed all their lives had been well taught under their fathers influence and the former who had inherited much of his talent and poetical nature had availed herself of every scanty opportunity of feeding her imagination by book or ballad storyteller or minstrel and the store of tales songs and fancies that she had accumulated were not only her own chief resource but that of her sisters in the many long and dreary hours that they had to pass unbrightened save by the inextinguishable buoyancy of young creatures together when their mother was dying hepburn could not help for very shame admitting a priest to her bedside and allowing the clergy to perform her obsequies in full form this had led to a more complete perception of the condition of the poor princesses just at the time when the two worst tyrants over the young king crichton and livingstone had fallen out and he had been able to put himself under the guidance of his first cousin james kennedy bishop of st andrews and now chancellor of scotland one of the wisest best and truesthearted men in scotland and imbued with the spirit of the late king  by his management hepburn was induced to make submission and deliver up dunbar castle to the king with all its captives and the meeting between the brother and sisters was full of extreme delight on both sides they had been together very little since their fathers death only meeting enough to make them long for more opportunities and the boy at fifteen years old was beginning to weary after the home feeling of rest among kindred and was so happy amidst his sisters that no attempt at breaking up the party at dunbar had yet been made as its situation made it a convenient abode for the court though he had never had such advantages of education as strangely enough captivity had afforded to his father he had not been untaught and his rapid eager intelligent mind had caught at all opportunities afforded by those palace monasteries of scotland in which he had stayed for various periods of his vexed and stormy minority good bishop kennedy with whom he had now spent many months had studied at paris and had passed four years at rome so as to be well able both to enlarge and stimulate his notions in eleanor he had found a companion delighted to share his studies and full likewise of original fancy and of that vein of poetry almost peculiar to scottish women and jean was equally charming for all the sports in which she could take part while the little ones whom to his credit be it spoken he always treated as brothers were pleasant playthings  his presence with all that it involved had made a most happy change in the maidens lives and yet there was still great dreariness much restraint in the presence of constant precaution against violence much rudeness and barbarism in the surroundings absolute poverty in the plenishing a lack of all beauty save in the wild and rugged face of northern nature and it was hardly to be wondered at that young people inheritors of the cultivated instincts of james i and of the plantagenets should yearn for something beyond especially for that sunny southern land which report and youthful imagination made them believe an ideal world of peace of poetry and of chivalry and the loving elder sister who seemed to them a part of that golden age when their noble and tenderhearted father was among them  the boys foot was on the turretstairs and he was out on the battlementsa tall lad for his age of the same colouring as eleanor and very handsome except for the blemish of a darkred mark upon one cheek  how now wee andie he exclaimed tossing the baby boy up in his arms and then on the cry of johnnie too me too performing the same feat with the other two the last so boisterously that mary screamed that the bairnie would be coupit over the crag  what looking out over the sea he cried to his elder sisters thats the wrang side ye should look out on the other to see glenuskie coming with davie and malcolm so well have no lack of minstrelsy and tales tonight that is if the doited old council will let me alone here come to the southern tower to watch for them  the sisters had worked themselves to the point of eagerness where propitious moments are disregarded and both broke out  glenuskie is going to margaret we want to go with him  go go to margaret and leave me cried james the red spot on his face spreading  oh jamie it is so dull and dreary and folks are so fierce and rude  that might be when that loon hepburn had you but now you have me who can take order with them  you cannot do all jamie persisted eleanor and we long after that fair smooth land of peace lady glenuskie would take good care of us till we came to margaret  ay and tis little you heed how it is with me exclaimed james when you are gone to your daffing and singing and dancingwith me that have saved you from that reiver hepburn  jamie dear ill never quit ye said little marys gentle voice  he laughed  you are a leal faithful little lady mary but you are no good as yet when angus is speiring for my sister for his heir  and do you trow said jean hotly that when one sister is to be a queen and the other is next thing to it we are going to put up with a rawboned redhaired unmannerly scots earl  and do you forget who is king of scotland ye proud peat her brother cried in return  a braw sort of king returned jean who could not hinder his mother and sisters from being stolen by an outlaw  the pride and hot temper of the beauforts had descended to both brother and sister and james lifted his hand with dare to say that again and jean was beginning i dare when little annaple opportunely called theres a plump of spears coming over the hill  there was an instant rush to watch them james saying  the drummond banner ye shall see how glenuskie mocks at this same fine fancy of yours and he ran downstairs at no kingly pace letting the heavy nailstudded door bang after him  he will never let us go sighed jean  you worked him into one of his tempers returned eleanor you should have broached it to him more by degrees  and lost the chance of going with sir patie and his wife and got plighted to the redhaired master of angusnever see sweet meg and her braw court and the tilts and tourneys but live among murderous caitiffs and reivers all my days sobbed jean  i would not be such a fule body as to give in for a hasty word or two specially of jamies said eleanor composedly  and gin ye bide here added gentle mary we shall be all together and you will have jamie and the bairnies  fine consolation muttered jean  eh well said eleanor we must go down and meet them  this fashion exclaimed jean look at your hair ellieblown wild about your ears like a daft womans and your kirtle all over mortar and smut my certie you would be a bonnie lady to be queen of love and beauty at a joustingmatch  you are no better jeanie responded eleanor  that i ken full well but id be shamed to show myself to knights and lairds that gate and see mary and all the lave have their hands as black as a cairds  come and let andies mary wash them said that little personage picking up fat andrew in her arms while he retained his beloved crabs claw jeanie would you carry johnnie hes not surefooted over the stair annaple take lorns hand over the kittle turning  one chamber was allotted to the entire party and their single nurse being far up in the tower it ventured to have two windows in the massive walls so thick that fiveandtwenty steps from the floor were needed to reach the narrow slips of glass in a frame that could be removed at will either to admit the air or to be exchanged for solid wooden shutters to exclude storms by sea or arrows and bolts by land the lower part of the walls was hung with very grim old tapestry on which holofernes head going into its bag could just be detected there were two great solid boxbeds two more pallets rolled up for the day a chest or two a rude table a crosslegged chair a few stools and some deer and seal skins spread on the floor completed the furniture of this ladies bower there was unusual luxury a chimney with a hearth and peat fire and a cauldron on it with a silver and a copper basin beside it for washing purposes never discarded by poor queen joanna and her old english nurse ankaret who had remained beside her through all the troubles of the stormy and barbarous country and though crippled by a fall and racked with rheumatism was the chief comfort of the young children she crouched at the hearth with her spinning and her beads and exclaimed at the tossed hair and soiled hands and faces of her charges  mary brought the little ones to her to be set to rights and the elder girls did their best with their toilette princesses as they were the ruddy golden tresses of eleanor and the flaxen locks of jean and mary were the only ornaments that they could boast of as their own and though there were silken and embroidered garments of their mothers in one of the chests their mourning forbade the use of them the girls only wore the plain black kirtles that had been brought from haddington at the time of the funeral and the little boys had such homespun garments as the shepherd lads wore  partly scolding partly caressing partly bemoaning the condition of her young ladies so different from the splendours of the house of somerset ankaret saw that eleanor was as fit to be seen as circumstances would permit as to jean and mary there was no trouble on that score  the whole was not accomplished till a horn was sounded as an intimation that supper was ready at five oclock for the entire household and all made their way downjean first in all the glory of her fair face and beautiful hair then eleanor with little lorn as he was called his christian name being james then annaple and johnnie handinhand mary carrying andrew and lastly old ankaret hobbling along with her stick and when out of sight a hand on annaples shoulder in public nothing would have made her presume so far the hall was a huge vaulted stonewalled room with a great fire on the wide hearth and three long tablesone was crosswise on the dais near the fire the other two ran the length of the hall the upper one was furnished with tolerably clean napery and a few silver vessels as to the lower ones they were in two degrees of comparison and the less said of the third the better it was for the menatarms and the lowest servants whereas the second belonged to those of the suite of the king and chancellor who were not of rank to be at his table the lord lion kingatarms was hightable company but he was absent and the inferior royal pursuivant was entertaining two of his fellows one with the douglas bloody heart the other with the lindsay lion on a black field besides two messengers of the different clans who looked askance at one another  leaning against the wall near the window stood the young king with two or three youths beside him laughing and talking over three great deerhounds and by the hearth were two elder menone a tall dignified figure in the square cap and purple robe of a bishop with a face of great wisdom and sweetness the other still taller with slightly grizzled hair and the weatherbeaten countenance of a valiant and sagacious warrior dressed in the leathern garments usually worn under armour  as jean emerged from the turret she was met and courteously greeted by sir patrick drummond and his sons as were also her sisters with a grace and deference to their rank such as they hardly ever received from the nobles and whose very rarity made eleanor shy and uncomfortable even while she was gratified and accepted it as her due  the bishop inclined his head and gave them a kind smile but they had already seen him in the morning as he was residing in the castle he was the most fatherly friend and kinsman the young things knew and though really their first cousin they looked to him like an uncle he insisted on due ceremony with them though he had much difficulty in enforcing it except with those scottish knights and nobles who like sir patrick drummond had served in france and retained their french breeding  so jean hawk and all had to be handed to her seat by sir patrick as the guest eleanor by her brother not without a little fraternal pinch and mary by the bishop who answered with a paternal caress to her murmured entreaty that she might keep wee andie on her lap and give him his brose  it was not a sumptuous repast the staple being a haggis also broth with chunks of meat and barleycorns floating in it the meat in strings by force of boiling at the high table each person had a bowl either silver or wood and each had a private spoon and a dagger to serve as knife also a drinkingcup of various materials from the kings gold goblet downwards to horns and a bannock to eat with the brose at the middle table trenchers and bannocks served the purpose of plates and at the third there was nothing interposed between the boards of the table and the lumps of meat from which the soup had been made  jeans quick eyes soon detected more menatarms and with different badges from the thyme spray of drummond and her brother was evidently bursting with some communication held back almost forcibly by the bishop who had established a considerable influence over the impetuous boy while sir patrick maintained a wise and tedious political conversation about the peace between france and england which was to be cemented by the marriage of the young king of england to the daughter of king rene and the cession of anjou and maine to her father  solid dukedoms for a lassie cried young james what a craven to make such a bargain  scarce like his fathers son returned sir patrick who gat the bride with a kingdom for her tocher that these folks have wellnigh lost among them  the saints be praised if they have  i cannot forget my liege how your own sainted father loved and fought for king harry of monmouth foe as he was i own that i shall never look on his like again  i hold with you in that patie said bishop kennedy and frown as you may my young liege a few years with such as he would do more for youas it did with your blessed fatherthan ever we can  i can hold mine own i hope without lessons from the enemy said james holding his head high while his ruddy locks flew back his eyes glanced and the red scar on his cheek widened and is it true that you are for going through false england patie  i made friends there when i spent two years there with your graces blessed father returned sir patrick and so did my good wife she longs to see the lady who is now sister clare at st katharines in london and it is well not to let her and annis brook the long sea voyage  there jean id brook ten sea voyages rather than hold myself beholden to an englishman quoth james  nevertheless there are letters and messages that it is well to confide to so trusty and wiseheaded a knight as glenuskie returned the bishop  the meal over the silver bowls were carried round with water to wash the hands by the two young drummonds sons of glenuskie and by the kings pages youths of about the same age after which the bishop and sir patrick asked licence of the king to retire for consultation to the bishops apartment a permission which as may well be believed he granted readily only rejoicing that he was not wanted  the little ones were carried off by mary and nurse ankaret and the king his elder sisters and the other youths of condition betook themselves followed by halfadozen great dogs to the court where the drummonds wanted to exhibit the horses procured for the journey and james and jean to show the hawks that were the pride of their heart  by and by came an italian priest who acted as secretary to the bishopa poor little man who grew yellower and yellower was always shivering and seemed to be shrivelled into growing smaller and smaller by the scottish winds but who had a most keen and intelligent face  how now father romuald called out james are ye come to fetch me  di grazia signor re began the italian in some fear as the dogs smelted his lambskin cape the lord bishop entreats your majestys presence  his majesty who by the way never was so called by any one else uttered some bitter growls and grumbles but felt forced to obey the call taking with him however his beautiful falcon on his wrist and the two huge deerhounds who he declared should be of the council if he was  jean and eleanor then closed upon david and malcolm eagerly demanding of them what they expected in that wonderful land to which they were going much against the will of young david who was sure there would be no hunting of deer nor hawking for grouse nor riding after an english borderer or hieland caterannothing in fact worth living for it would be all awearying with their manners and their courtesies and such like daft womans gear why could not his father be content to let him grow up like his fellows rough and free and ready  and knowing nothing betternothing beyond said eleanor  what would you have better than the hill and the brae to tame a horse and fly a hawk and couch a lance and bend a bow thats what a man is made for without fashing himself with letters and latin and manners no better than a monk but my father would always have it so  yell be thankful to him yet davie put in his graver brother  thankful i shall forget all about it as soon as i am knighted and make you write all my lettersand few enough there will be  and you malcolm said eleanor would you be content to hide within four walls and know nothing by your own eyes  no indeed cousin replied the lad i long for the fair churches and cloisters and the learned men and books that my father tells of my mother says that her brother that i am named for yearned to make this a land of peace and godliness and to turn these high spirits to gods glory instead of mans strife and feud and how it might have been done save for the slaying of your noble fathersaints rest himwhich broke mine uncles heart so that he died on his way home from pilgrimage she hopes to pray at his tomb that i may tread in his steps and be a blessing and not a curse to the land we love  eleanor was silent seeing for the first time that there might be higher aims than escaping from dulness strife and peril whilst jean cried  tis the titles and jousts the knights and ladies that i care formen that know what fair chivalry means and make knightly vows to dare all sorts of foes for a ladys sake  as if any lass was worth it said david contemptuously  ay thats what you are thats what it is to live in this savage realm returned jean  at this moment however brother romuald was again seen advancing and this time with a request for the presence of the ladies jean and eleanor  could james be relenting on better advice they asked one another as they went  more likely said jean with a sigh amounting to a groan it is only to hear that we are made over like a couple of kine to some ruffianly reivers who will beat a princess as soon as a scullion  they reached the chamber in time though the bishop slept there it also served for a council chamber and as he carried his chapel and household furniture about with him it was a good deal more civilisedlooking than even the princesses room large folding screens worked with tapestry representing the lives of the saints shut off the part used as an oratory and that which served as a bedchamber where indeed the good man slept on a rush mat on the floor there were a table and several chairs and stools all capable of being folded up for transport the young king occupied a large chair of state in which he twisted himself in a very undignified manner the bishopchancellor sat beside him with the great seal of scotland and some writing materials parchments and letters before him and sir patrick came forward to receive and seat the young ladies and then remained standingas few of his rank in scotland would have done on their account  well lassies began the king heres lads enow for you theres the master of angus as ye kenjean tossed her headmoreover auld crawford wants one of you for his son  the tyger earl gasped eleanor  and with stirling for your portion the modest fellow added james ay and thats not all theres the macalpin threats me with all his clan if i dinna give you to him and mackay is not behindhand but will come down with pibroch and braidsword and five hundred caterans to pay his court to you and make short work of all others my certie sisters seem but a cause for threats from reivers though maybe they would not be so uncivil if once they had you  oh jamie oh dear holy father cried eleanor turning from the king to the bishop do not for mercys sake give me over to one of those ruffians  they are coming eleanor said james with a boys love of terrifying the macalpin and mackay are both coming down after you and we shall have a fight like the clan chattan and clan kay theres for the demoiselle who craved for knights to break lances for her  knights indeed highland thieves said jean and tis for what tocher they may force from you james not for her face  you are right there my puir bairn said the bishop these mensave perhaps the young master of angusonly seek your hands as a pretext for demands from your brother and for spuilzie and robbery among themselves and i for my part would never counsel his grace to yield the lambs to the wolves even to save himself  no indeed broke in the king we may not have them fighting down here though it would be rare sport to look on if you were not to be the prize so my lord bishop here trows and i am of the same mind that the only safety is that the birds should be flown and that you should have your wish and be away the morn with patie of glenuskie here since he will take the charge of two such silly lasses  the sudden granting of their wish took the maidens breath away they looked from one to the other without a word and the bishop in more courtly language explained that amid all these contending parties he could not but judge it wiser to put the kings two marriageable sisters out of reach either of a violent abduction or of being the cause of a savage contest in either case ending in demands that would be either impossible or mischievous for the crown to grant and moreover in misery for themselves  sir patrick added something courteous about the honour of the charge  so soon gasped jean are we really to go the morn  with morning light if it be possible fair ladies said sir patrick  ay said james then will we take mary and the weans to the nunnery in st marys wynd where none will dare to molest them and i shall go on to st andrews or stirling as may seem fittest while we leave old seneschal peter to keep the castle gates shut if the hielanders come theyll find the nut too hard for them to crack and the kernel gone so youd best burn no more daylight maidens but busk ye as women will  oh jamie to speak so lightly of parting sighed eleanor  comeno fule greeting now you have your will hastily said james who could hardly bear it himself  our gear faltered jeanie with consternation at their illfurnished wardrobes  for that said the bishop you must leave the supply till you are over the border when the lady glenuskie will see to your appearing as nigh as may be as befits the daughters of scotland among your english kin  but we have not a mark between us said jean and all my mothers jewels are pledged to the lombards  there are moneys falling due to the crown said the bishop and i can advance enow to sir patrick to provide the gear and horses  and my gude wifes royal kin are my guests till they win to their sister added sir patrick  and so it was settled it was an evening of bustle and a night of wakefulness there were floods of tears poured out by and over sweet little mary and good old ankaret not to speak of those which james scorned to shed had a sudden stop been put to the journey perhaps eleanor would have been relieved but jean sorely disappointed  it was further decided that father romuald should accompany the party both to assist in negotiations with henry vi and cardinal beaufort and to avail himself of the opportunity of returning to his native land fa  north and to show cause to the pope for erecting st andrews into an archiepiscopal see instead of leaving scotland under the primacy of york  hawk and harp were all the properties the princesseserrant took with them but jean as her old nurse sometimes declared loved skywing better than all the weans and elleens small travellingharp was all that she owned of her fathersexcept the spirit that loved it     chapter 2 departure                    i bowed my pride      a horseboy in his train to ridescott   the lady of glenuskie as she was commonly called was a near kinswoman of the royal house lilias stewart a granddaughter of king robert ii and thus first cousin to the late king her brother malcolm stewart had resigned to her the little barony of glenuskie upon his embracing the life of a priest and her becoming the wife of sir patrick drummond the son of his former guardian  sir patrick had served in france in the scotch troop who came to the assistance of the dauphin until he was taken prisoner by his native monarch james i then present with the army of henry v he had then spent two years at windsor in attendance upon that prince until both were set at liberty by the treaty made by cardinal beaufort in the meantime his betrothed lilias being in danger at home had been bestowed in the household of the countess of warwick where she had been much with an admirable and saintly foreign lady esclairmonde de luxembourg who had taken refuge from the dissensions of her own vexed country among the charitable sisterhood of st katharine in the docks in london  sir patrick and his lady had thus enjoyed far more training in the general european civilisation than usually fell to the lot of their countrymen and they had moreover imbibed much of the spirit of that admirable king whose aims at improvement religious moral and political were so piteously cut short by his assassination during the nine miserable years that had ensued it had not been possible even in conjunction with bishop kennedy to afford any efficient support or protection to the young king and his mother and it had been as much as sir patrick could do to protect his own lands and vassals and do his best to bring up his children to godly honourable and chivalrous ways but amid all the evil around he had decided that it was wellnigh impossible to train them to courage without ruffianism or to prevent them from being tainted by the prevailing standard even among the clergy and monastic orders the type was very low in spite of the endeavours of bishop kennedy who had not yet been able to found his university at st andrews and it had been agreed between him and sir patrick that young malcolm drummond a devout and scholarly lad of earnest aspiration should be trained at the paris university and perhaps visit padua and bologna in preparation for that foundation which save for that cruel easterns een would have been commenced by the uncle whose name he bore  the daughter had likewise been promised in her babyhood to the sire de terreforte a knight of auvergne who had come on a mission to the scotch court in the golden days of the reign of james i and being an old companioninarms of sir patrick had desired to unite the families in the person of his infant son olivier and of annis drummond  lady drummond had ever since been preparing her little daughter and her wardrobe the whole was in a good state of forwardness but it must be confessed that she was somewhat taken aback when she beheld two young ladies riding up the glen with her husband sons and their escort and found on descending to welcome them that they were neither more nor less than the two eldest unmarried princesses of scotland  and dame lilias proceeded her knight you must busk and boune you to be in the saddle betimes the morn and put tweed between these puir lasses and their foesor shall i say their ower well wishers  the ladies of scotland lived to receive startling intelligence and lady drummonds kind heart was moved by the two forlorn wearylooking figures with traces of tears on their cheeks she kissed them respectfully conducted them to the guestchamber which was many advances beyond their room at dunbar in comfort and presently left her own two daughters annis and lilias and their nurse to take care of them since they seemed to have neither mails nor attendants of their own while she sought out her husband as he was being disarmed by his sons to understand what was to be done  he told her briefly of the danger and perplexity in which the presence of the two poor young princesses might involve themselves their brother and the kingdom itself by exciting the greed jealousy and emulation of the untamed nobles and highland chiefs who would try to gain them both as an excuse for exactions from the king and out of jealousy of one another to take them out of reach was the only ready means of preventing mischief and the bishop of st andrews had besought sir patrick to undertake the charge  we are bound to do all we can for their fathers daughters dame lilias owned alike as our king and the best friend that ever we had or my dear brother malcolm heaven rest them both but have they no servants no plenishing  that must we provide said sir patrick we must be their servants dame our lasses must lend them what is fitting till we come where i can make use of this which my good lord of st andrews gave me  what is it patie not the red gold  oh no i have heard of the like ye ken morini as they call him the lombard goldsmith in the canongate weel for sums that the bishop will pay to morini sums owing he says by himself to the crownthough i shrewdly suspect tis the other way gude manthen the lombards fellows in york london or paris or bourges will on seeing this bit bond supply us up to the tune of a hundred crowns thou lookst mazed lily but i have known the like before tis no great sum but mayhap the maidens english kin will do somewhat for them before they win to their sister  i would not have them beholden to the english said dame lilias not forgetting that she was a stewart  her husband perhaps scarcely understood the change made in the whole aspect of the journey to her not only had she to hurry her preparations for the early start but instead of travelling as the mistress of the party she and her daughter would in appearance at least be the mere appendages of the two princesses wait upon them give them the foremost place supply their present needs from what was provided for themselves and it was quite possible have likewise to control girlish petulance and inexperience in the strange lands where her charges must appear at their very best to do honour to their birth and their country  but the loyal woman made up her mind without a word of complaint after the first shock and though a busy night was not the best preparation for a days journey she never lay down nor indeed did her namesake daughter who was to be left at a priory on their way there to decide whether she had a vocation to be a nun  so effectually did she bestir herself that by six oclock the next morning the various packages were rolled up for bestowal on the sumpter horses and the goods to be left at home locked up in chests and committed to the charge of the trusty seneschal and his wife a meal to be taken in haste was spread on the table in the hall to be swallowed while the little rough ponies were being laden  mass was to be heard at the first haltingplace the benedictine nunnery of trefontana on lammermuir where lilias drummond was to be left to be passed on when occasion served to the sisterhood at edinburgh  the fresh morning breezes over the world of heather brightened the cheeks and the spirits of the two sisters the first wrench of parting was over with them and they found themselves treated with much more observance than usual though they did not know that the horses they were riding had been trained for the special use of the lady of glenuskie and her daughter annis upon the journey  they rode on gaily jean with her inseparable falcon skywing eleanor with her fathers harp bestowed behind hershe would trust it to no one else they were squired by their two cousins david and malcolm who in spite of davids murmurs felt the exhilaration of the future as much as they did as they coursed over the heather david with two great greyhounds with majestic heads at his side finn and finvola as they were called  the graver and sadder ones of the party father mother and the two young sisters rode farther back the father issuing directions to the seneschal who accompanied them thus far and the mother watching over the two fair young girls whose hearts were heavy in the probability that they would never meet again for how should a scottish benedictine nun and the wife of a french seigneur ever come together nor would there be any possibility of correspondence to bridge over the gulf  the nunnery was strong but not with the strength of secular buildings for except when a tempting heiress had taken refuge there convents were respected even by the rudest men  numerous unkempt and barelyclothed figures were coming away from the gates a pilgrim or two with brown gown broad hat and scallop shell the mornings dole being just over but a few some on crutches some with heads or limbs bound up were waiting for their turn of the sisterinfirmarers care the pennon of the drummond had already been recognised and the gateward readily admitted the party since the house of glenuskie were well known as pious benefactors to the church  they were just in time for a mass which a pilgrim priest was about to say and they were all admitted to the small nave of the little chapel beyond which a screen shut off the choir of nuns after this the ladies were received into the refectory to break their fast the men folk being served in an outside building for the purpose it was not sumptuous fare chiefly consisting of barley bannocks and very salt and dry fish with some thin and sour ale and davids attention was a good deal taken up by a manatarms who seemed to have attached himself to the party but whom he did not know and who held a little aloof from the restkeeping his visor down while eating and drinking in a somewhat suspicious manner as though to avoid observation  just as david had resolved to point this person out to his father sir patrick was summoned to speak to the lady prioress therefore the youth thought it incumbent upon him to deal with the matter and advancing towards the stranger said good fellow thou art none of our following how now for a pair of gray eyes looked up with recognition in them and a low voice whispered davie drummond keep my secret till we be across the border  geordie what means this  i canna let her gang i ken that she scorns me  that proud peat jean  whist whist she scorns me and the king scarce lent a lug to my fathers gude offer so that he can scarce keep the peace with their pride and upsettingness but i love her davie the mere sight of her is sunshine and wha kens but in the stour of this journey i may have the chance of standing by her and defending her and showing what a leal scots heart can do or if not if i may not win her i shall still be in sight of her blessed blue een  david whistled his perplexity the yerl said he doth he ken  i trow not he thinks me at tantallon watching for the raid the mackays are threateninglittle guessing the bird would be flown  how cam ye to guess that same which was so far as i know only decided two days syne  our pursuivant was to bear a letter to the king and i garred him let me bear him company as one of his grooms so that i might delight mine eyes with the sight of her  david laughed his time was not come and this love and admiration for his young cousin was absurd in his eyes for a young bit lassie he said gin it had been a knight but what will your father say to mine  i will write to him when i am well over the border said geordie and gin he kens that your father had no hand in it he will deem no illwill nor could he harm you if he did  david did not feel entirely satisfied on one side of his mind as to his own loyalty to his father or geordies to the yerl and yet there was something diverting to the enterprising mind in the stolen expedition and the fellowfeeling which results in honour to contemporaries made him promise not to betray the young man and to shield him from notice as best he might with geordies motive he had no sympathy having had too many childish squabbles with his cousin for her to be in his eyes a sublime princess joanna but only a masterful jeanie  sir patrick absorbed in orders to his seneschal did not observe the addition to his party and as david acted as his squire and had been seen talking to the young man no further demur was made until the time when the home party turned to ride back to glenuskie and sir patrick made a rollcall of his followers picked men who could fairly be trusted not to embroil the company by excesses or imprudences in england or france  besides himself his wife sons and daughters and the two princesses the party consisted of christian female attendant for the ladies the wife of andrew of the cleugh an elderly wellseasoned manatarms to whom the banner was entrusted dandie their son a stalwart youth of two or threeandtwenty who under his father was in charge of the horses and six lances besides sir patrick following the french fashion which gave to each lance two grooms armed likewise and a horseboy for each of the family there was likewise a spare palfrey with a servant in charge and one beast of burthen but these last were to be freshly hired with their attendants at each stage  geordie used to more tumultuous and irregular gatherings where any man with a good horse and serviceable weapons was welcome to join the raid had not reckoned on such a review of the party as was made by the old warrior accustomed to more regular warfare and who made each of his eight lancesnamely the two andrew drummonds jock of the glen jockie of braeside willie and norman armstrong wattie wudspurs and tam telferanswer to their names and show up their three followers  and who is yon lad in bright steel sir patrick asked  master davie kens sir responded old andrew david being called explained that he was a leal lad called geordie whom he had seen in edinburgh and who wished to join them go to france and see the world under sir patricks guidance and that he would be at his own charges and ill be answerable for him sir concluded the lad  answer ha ha what for eh that he is a longlegged lad like your ain self what more come call him up  the stranger had no choice save to obey and came up on a strong white mare which old andrew scanned and muttered to his son the mearns breeddid he come honestly by it  up with your beaver young man said sir patrick peremptorily no man rides with me whose face i have not seen  a face not handsome and thoroughly scottish was disclosed with keen intelligence in the gray eyes and a certain air of offended dignity yet selfcontrol in the closeshut mouth the cheeks were sunburnt and freckled a tawny down of young manhood was on the long upper lip and the shortcut hair was red but there was an intelligent and trustworthy expression in the countenance and the tall figure sat on horseback with the upright ease of one well trained  soh said sir patrick looking him over how ca they you lad  geordie o the red peel he answered  thats a byname said the knight sternly i must have the full name of any man who rides with me  george douglas then if nothing short of that will content you  are ye sib to the earl  ay sir and have rid in his company  whose word am i to take for that  mine sir a word that none has ever doubted said the youth boldly by that your son kens me  david here vouched for having seen the young man in the angus following when he had accompanied his father in the last riding of the scots parliament at edinburgh and this so far satisfied sir patrick that he consented to receive the stranger into his company but only on condition of an oath of absolute obedience so long as he remained in the troop  david could see that this had not been reckoned on by the highspirited master of angus and indeed obedience save to the head of the name was so little a scottish virtue that sir patrick was by no means unprepared for reluctance  i give thee thy choice laddie he said not unkindly best make up your mind while thou art still in thine own country and can win back home in england and france i can have no stragglers nor loons like to help themselves nor give cause for a fray to bring shame on the haill troop in lands that are none too friendly a raw carle like thyself or even these lads of mine might give offence unwittingly and then id have to give thee up to the laws or to stand by thee to the peril of all and of the ladies themselves so theres nothing for it but strict keeping to orders of myself and andrew drummond of the cleugh who kens as well as i do what sorts to be done in these strange lands wilt thou so bind thyself or shall we part while yet there is time  sir i will said the young man i will plight my word to obey you and faithfully so long as i ride under your banner in foreign partsprovided such oath be not binding within this realm of scotland nor against my lealty to the head of my name  nor do i ask it of thee returned sir patrick heartily but regarding him more attentively these are the scruples of a true man hast thou any following  only a boy to lead my horse to grass replied george giving a peculiar whistle which brought to his side a shockheaded barefooted lad in a shepherds tartan and little else but with limbs as active as a wild deer and an eye twinkling and alert  he shall be put in better trim ere the english pockpuddings see him said douglas looking at him perhaps for the first time as something unsuited to that orderly company  that is thine own affair said sir patrick mine is that he should comport himself as becomes one of my troop whats his name  ringan raefoot replied geordie sir patrick began to put the oath of obedience to him but the boy cried out  ill neer swear to any save my lawful lord the yerl of angus and my lord the master  hist ringan interposed geordie sir i will answer for his faith to me and so long as he is leal to me he will be the same to thee but i doubt whether it be expedient to compel him  so did sir patrick and he said  then be it so i trust to his faith to thee only remembering that if he plunder or brawl i may have to leave him hanging on the next bush  and if he doth the red douglas will ken the reason why quoth ringan with head aloft  it was thought well to turn a deaf ear to this observation indeed geordies effort was to elude observation and to keep his uncouth follower from attracting it ringan was not singular in running along with bare feet other bonnie boys as the ballad has it trotted along by the side of the horses to which they were attached in the like fashion though they had hose and shoon slung over their shoulders to be donned on entering the good town of berwickupontweed  not without sounding of bugle and sending out a pursuivant to examine into the intentions and authorisation of the party were they admitted jean and eleanor riding first with the pursuivant proclaimingplace place for the high and mighty princesses of scotland  it was an inconvenient ceremony for poor sir patrick who had to hand over to the pursuivant in the name of the princesses a ring from his own finger largesse he could not attempt but the proud spirit of himself and his train could not but be chafed at the expectant faces of the crowd and the intuitive certainty that beggarly scotch was in every disappointed mind  and this was but a foretaste of what the two royal maidens presence would probably entail throughout the journey his wife added to this care uneasiness as to the deportment of her three maidens of annis she had not much fear but she suspected jean and eleanor of being as wild and untamed as hares and she much doubted whether any counsels might not offend their dignity and drive them into some strange behaviour that the good people of berwick would never forget  they rode in however very upright and stately with an air of taking possession of the place on their brothers behalf and jean bowed with a certain haughty grace to the deputywarden who came out to receive them eleanor keeping her eye upon jean and imitating her in everything for eleanor though sometimes the most eager and most apt to commit herself by hasty words and speeches seemed now to be daunted by the strangeness of all around and to commit herself to the leading of her sister though so little her junior  she was very silent all through the supper spread for them in the hall of the castle while jean exchanged conversation with their host upon iceland hawks and wolf and deer hounds as if she had been a young lady keeping a splendid court all her life instead of a povertystricken prisoner in castle after castle  jeanie whispered eleanor as they lay down on their bed together didst mark the tall laddie that was about to seat himself at the high table and frowned when the steward motioned him down  whats that to me an illnurtured carle said jean i marvel sir patie brooks him in his meinie  eleanor was a little in awe of jeanie in this mood and said no more but annis who slept on a pallet at their feet heard all and guessed more as to the strange young squire  fain would she and eleanor have discussed the situation but jeans blue eyes glanced heedfully and defiantly at them and moreover the young gentleman in question after that one error effaced himself and was forgotten for the time in the novelty of the scenes around  the subwarden of berwick mindful of his charge to obviate all occasions of strife insisted on sending a knight and halfadozen men to escort the scottish travellers as far as durham david drummond and the young ladies murmured to one another their disgust that the english pockpudding should not suppose scots able to keep their heads with their own hands but as jean sagely observed no doubt he would not wish them to have occasion to hurt any of the english nor jamie to have to call them to account  this same old knight consorted with sir patrick dame lilias and father romuald and kept a sharp eye on the little party allowing no straggling on any pretence and as sir patrick enforced the command all were obliged to obey in spite of chafing and the scowls of the english borderers with the scant courtesy vouchsafed by these sturdy spirits proved the wisdom of the precaution  at durham they were hospitably entertained in the absence of the bishop the splendour of the cathedral and its adjuncts much impressed lady drummond as it had done a score of years previously but though malcolm ventured to share her admiration jean was far above allowing that she could be astonished at anything in england in fact she regarded the stately towers of st cuthbert as so much stolen family property which jamie would one day regain and all the other young people followed suit david even made all the observations his own sense of honour and the eyes of his hosts would permit with a view to a future surprise the escort of sir patrick was asked to york by a canon who had to journey thither and was anxious for protection from the outlawswho had begun to renew the doings of robin hood under the laxer rule of the young henry vi though things were expected to be better since the young duke of york had returned from france  perhaps this arrangement was again a precaution for the preservation of peace and at york there was a splendid entertainment by cardinal kemp but all the subtleties and wondersstags heads in their horns peacocks in their pride jellies with whole romances depicted in them could not reconcile the young scots to the presumption of the archbishop reckoning scotland into his province durham was at once too monastic and too military to have afforded much opportunity for recruiting the princesses wardrobe but york was the resort of the merchants of flanders and christie was sent in quest of them and their wares for truly the black serge kirtles and shepherds tartan screens that had made the journey from dunbar were in no condition to do honour to royal damsels  jean was in raptures with the graceful veils depending from the horned headgear worn she was told by the duchess of burgundy but eleanor wept at the idea of obscuring the snood of a scottish maiden and would not hear of resigning it  i feel as elleen no more she said but a mere flanders popinjay it has changed my ain self upon me as well as the country  thou shouldst have been born in a hovel returned jean raising her proud little head i feel more than ever what i ama true princess  and she looked it with beauty enhanced by the rich attire which only made eleanor embarrassed and uncomfortable  malcolm the more scrupulous of the drummond brothers begged of george douglas when at durham to write to his father and declare himself to sir patrick but the youth would do neither he did not think himself sufficiently out of reach and besides the very sight of a pen was abhorrent to him there was something pleasing to him in the liberty of a kind of volunteer attached to the expedition and he would not give it up nor was he without some wild idea of winning jeans notice by some gallant exploit on her behalf before she knew him for the object of her prejudice the master of angus as to sir patrick he was far too busy trying to compose border quarrels and gleaning information about the gloucester and beaufort parties at court to have any attention to spare for the young man riding in his suite with the barefooted lad ever at his stirrup  geordie never attempted to secure better accommodation than the other lances he groomed his steed himself with a little assistance from ringan and slept in the straw of its bed with the lad curled up at his feet the only difference observable between him and the rest being that he always groomed himself every night and morning as carefully as the horse a ceremony they thought entirely needless     chapter 3 falcon and fetterlock                   ours is the sky      where at what fowl we please our hawk shall fly      t randolph   beyond york that species of convoy which ranged between protection and supervision entirely ceased the scottish party moved on their own wa  oftener through heath rock and moor for england was not yet thickly inhabited though there was no lack of hostels or of convents to receive them on this the great road to the north and to its many shrines for pilgrimage  perhaps sir patrick relaxed a little of his vigilance since the good behaviour of his troop had won his confidence and they were less likely to be regarded as invaders than by the inhabitants of the district nearer their own frontier  hawking and coursing within bounds had been permitted by both the knight of berwick and the canon of durham on the wide northern moors but sir patrick on starting in the morning of the day when they were entering northamptonshire had given a caution that sport was not free in the more frequented parts of england and that hound must not be loosed nor hawk flown without special permission from the lord of the manor  he was however riding in the rear of the rest up a narrow lane leading uphill anxiously discussing with father romuald the expediency of seeking hospitality from any of the great lords whose castles might be within reach before he had full information of the present state of factions at the court when suddenly his son malcolm came riding back pushing up hastily  sir father he cried theres wud wark ahead theres a flight of unco big birds on before and lady jeans hawk is awa after them and jeanies awa after the hawk and geordie red peel is awa after jean and davies awa after geordie and theres the blast of an english bugle and my mither sent me for you to redd the fray  time indeed said sir patrick with a sigh and setting spurs to his horse he soon was beyond the end of the lane on an open heath where some of his troop were drawn up round his banner almost forcibly kept back by dame lilias and the elder andrew he could not stop for explanation from them indeed his wife only waved him forward towards a confused group some hundred yards farther off where he could see a number of his own men and too plainly long bows and coats of lincoln green and he only hoped as he galloped onward that they belonged to outlaws and not to rangers too soon he saw that his hope was vain there were ten or twelve stout archers with the white rosette of york in their bonnets the falcon and fetterlock on their sleeves and the plantagenet quarterings on their breasts in the midst was a dead bustard also an englishman sitting up with his head bleeding jean was on foot with her daggerknife in one hand and holding fast to her breast her beloved hawk whose jesses were however grasped by one of the foresters geordie of the red peel stood with his sword at his feet glaring angrily round while sir patrick pausing could hear his son davids voice in loud tones  i tell you this lady is a royal princess yes she isas there was a kind of scoffand we are bound on a mission to your king from the king of scots and woe to him that touches a feather of ours  that may be said the one who seemed chief among the english but that gives no licence to fly at the dukes game nor slay his foresters for doing their duty if we let the lady go hawk and man must have their necks wrung after forest laws  and i tell thee cried davie that this is a noble gentleman of scotland and that we will fight for him to the death  let it alone davie said george no scathe shall come to the lady through me  save him davie save skywing screamed jean  to the rescuea drummond shouted david but his father pushed his horse forward just as the men in green were in the act of stringing all at the same moment their bows as tall as themselves they were not so many but that his escort might have overpowered them but only with heavy loss and the fact of such a fight would have been most disastrous  what means this sirs he exclaimed in a tone of authority waving back his own men and his dignified air as well as the banner with which andrew followed him evidently took effect on the foresters who perhaps had not believed the young men  sir patie my hawk entreated jean she did but pounce on yon unco ugsome bird and these bloodthirsty grasping loons would have wrung her neck  she took her knife to me growled the wounded man who had risen to his feet and showed bleeding fingers  ay for meddling with a royal falcon broke in jean tis thou false loon whose craig should be raxed  happily this was an unknown tongue to the foresters and sir patrick gravely silenced her  whist lady brawls consort not with your rank gang back doucely to my leddy  but skywing he has her jesses said the girl but in a lower tone as though rebuked  sir ranger said sir patrick courteously i trust you will let the young demoiselle have her hawk it was loosed in ignorance and heedlessness no doubt but i trow it is the rule in england as elsewhere that ladies of the blood royal are not bound by forest laws  sir if we had known said the ranger who was evidently of gentle blood as he took his foot off the jesses and jean now allowed david to remount her  but my lord duke is very heedful of his bustards and when roger there went to seize the bird my young lady was overready with her knife  who would not be for thee my bird murmured jean  and yonder big fellow came plunging down and up with his swordso as he was nigh on being the death of poor roger again for doing his duty if such be the ways of you scots sir they be not english ways under my lord duke that is to say and if i let the lady and her hawk go forest law must have its due on the young man therei must have him up to fotheringay to abide the dukes pleasure  heed me not sir patrick exclaimed geordie i would not have those of your meinie brought into jeopardy for my cause  david was plucking his fathers mantle to suggest who george was which in fact sir patrick might suspect enough to be conscious of the full awkwardness of the position and to abandon the youth was impossible though it was not likely that the duke of york would hang him if aware of his rank he might be detained as a hostage or put to heavy ransom or he might never be brought to the dukes presence at all but be put to death by some truculent underling incredulous of a scotsmans tale if indeed he were not too proud to tell it anyway sir patrick felt bound to stand by him  good sir said he to the forester will it content thee if we all go with thee to thy duke the two scottish princesses are of his kin and near of blood to king henry whom they are about to visit at windsor i am on a mission thither on affairs of state but i shall be willing to make my excuses to him for any misdemeanour committed on his lands by my followers  the forester was consenting when george cried  ill have no hindrance to your journey on my account sir patrick let me answer for myself  foolish laddie said the knight father romuald and i were only now conferring as to paying the duke a visit on our way sir forester we shall be beholden to you for guiding us  he further inquired into the rangers hurts and salved them with a piece of gold while david thought proper to observe to george  so much for thy devoir to thy princess it was for skywings craig she cared never thine  george turned a deaf ear to the insinuation he was allowed free hands and his own horse which was perhaps well for the englishmen for ringan raefoot running by his stirrup showed him a long knife and said with a grin  ready for the first who daurs to lay hands on the master gin i could have come up in time the loon had never risen from the ground  george endeavoured in vain to represent how much worse this would have made their condition  sir patrick joining the ladies informed them of the necessity of turning aside to fotheringay which he had done not very willingly being ignorant of the character of the duke of york except as one of the war party against france and scotland whereas the beauforts were for peace as a vigorous governor of normandy he had not commended him self to one whose sympathies were french lady drummond however remembered that his wife cicely nevil the rose of raby was younger sister to that ralf nevil who had married the friend of her youth alice montagu now countess of salisbury in her own right  sir patrick did not let jean escape a rebuke  so lady you see what perils to brave men you maids can cause by a little heedlessness  i never asked geordie to put his finger in returned jean saucily i could have brought off skywing for myself without such a clamjamfrie after me  but eleanor and annis agreed that it was as good as a ballad and ought to be sung in one only jean would have to figure as the dour lassie for she continued to aver by turns that geordie need never have meddled and that of course it was his bounden duty to stand by his kings sister and that she owed him no thanks if he were hanged for it he had run his craig into the noose  so she tossed her proud head and toyed with her falcon as all rode on their way to fotheringay with geordie in the midst of the rangers  it was so many years since there had been serious war in england that the castles of the interior were far less of fortresses than of magnificent abodes for the baronage who had just then attained their fullest splendour it may be observed that the wars of the roses were for the most part fought out in battles not by sieges thus fotheringay had spread out into a huge pile which crowned the hill above with a strong inner court and lofty donjon tower indeed and with mighty walls but with buildings for retainers all round reaching down to the beautiful newlybuilt octagontowered church and with a great park stretching for miles for all kinds of sport  all this enclosed yet they make sic a wark about their bustards as they ca them muttered jean  the forester had sent a messenger forward to inform the duke of york of his capture the consequence was that the cavalcade had no sooner crossed the first drawbridge under the great gateway of the castle where the banner of plantagenet was displayed than before it were seen a goodly company in the glittering and gorgeous robes of the fifteenth century  there was no doubt of welcome foremost was a graceful slenderlymade gentleman about thirty years old in rich azure and gold who doffed his cap of maintenance turned up with fur and with long ends and bowing low declared himself delighted that the princesses of scotland his good cousins should honour his poor dwelling  he gave his hand to assist jean to alight and an equally gorgeous but much younger gentleman in the same manner waited on eleanor a tall grizzled sunburnt figure received lady drummond with recognition on both sides and the words my wife is fain to see you my honoured lady is this your daughter with a sign to a tall youth who took annis from her horse dame lilias heard with joy that the countess of salisbury was actually in the castle and in a few moments more she was in the great hall in the arms of the sweet countess alice of her youth who middleaged as she was with all her youthful impulsiveness had not waited for the grand and formal greeting bestowed on the princesses by her stately young sisterinlaw the duchess of york  there seemed to be a perfect crowd of richlydressed nobles ladies children and though the lady joanna held her head up in full state and kept her eye on her sister to make her do the same their bewilderment was great and when they had been conducted to a splendid chamber within that allotted to the drummond ladies tapestryhung and with silver toilette apparatus to prepare for supper jean dropped upon a highbacked chair and insisted that dame lilias should explain to her exactly who each one was  that slight darkeyed carle who took me off my horse was the duke of york of course said she my certie a bonnie scot would make short work of him bones and all and it would scarce be worth while to give a clout to the sickly lad that took elleen down  hush jean said eleanor some one called him king was he king harry himself  oh no said dame lilias smiling only king harry of the isle of wighta bit place about the bigness of arran but it pleased the english king to crown him and give him a ring and bestow on him the realm in a kind of sport he is in sooth harry beauchamp earl of warwick and was bred up as the kings chief comrade and playfellow  and what brings him here  so far as i can yet understand the family and kin have gathered for the marriage of his sister the lady annethe redcheeked maiden in the rosecoloured kirtleto the young sir richard nevil the same who gave his hand to thee annisthe son of my lord of salisbury  that was the old knight who led thee in mother said annis did you say he was brother to the duchess  even so there were fifteen or twenty nevils of rabyhe was one of the eldest she one of the youngest their mother was a beaufort aunt to yours  oh i shall never unravel them exclaimed eleanor spreading out her hands in bewilderment  lady drummond laughed having come to the time of life when ladies enjoy genealogies  it will be enough she said to remember that almost all are like yourselves grandchildren or greatgrandchildren to king edward of windsor  jean however wanted to know which were nearest to herself and which were noblest the first question lady drummond said she could hardly answer perhaps the earl of salisbury and the duchess but the duke was certainly noblest by birth having a double descent from king edward and in the male line  was not his father put to death by this kings father asked eleanor  ay the earl of cambridge for a foul plot i have heard my lord of salisbury speak of it but this young man was of tender years and king harry of monmouth did not bear malice but let him succeed to the dukedom when his uncle was killed in the battle of agincourt  they have not spirit here to keep up a feud said jean  my good brotheray and your father jeaniewere wont to say they were too christian to hand on a feud observed dame lilias at which jean tossed her head and said  that may suit such a carpetknight as yonder duke he is not so tall as elleen there nor as his own duchess  i do not like the duchess said annis she looks as if she scorned the very ground she walks on  she is wondrous bonnie though said eleanor and so was the bairnie by her side  in some degree jean changed her opinion of the duke in consequence perhaps of the very marked attention that he showed her when the supper was spread she had never been so made to feel what it was to be at once a kings daughter and a beauty and at the most magnificent banquet she had ever known  durham had afforded a great advance on scottish festivities but in the absence of its prince bishop another nevil it had lacked much of what was to be found at fotheringay in the full blossoming of the splendours of the princely nobility of england just ere the decimation that they were to perpetrate on one another  the hall itself was vast and newly finished in the rich culmination of gothic work with a fan traceryvaulted roof a triumph of architecture each stalactite glowing with a shield or a badge of england france mortimer and nevillion or lily falcon and fetterlock white rose and dun cow all and many otherslikewise shining in the stained glass of the great windows  the high table was loaded with gold and silver plate and venice glasses even more precious there were carpets under the feet of the nobler guests and even the second and third tables were spread with more richness and refinement than ever the sisters of james ii had known in their native land in a gallery above the dukes musicians and the choristers of his chapel were ready to enliven the meal and as the chief guest the lady joanna of scotland was handed to her place by the duke of york who as she now perceived though small in stature was eminently handsome and graceful and conversed with her not as a mere child but as a fair lady of full years  eleanor who sat on his other hand beside the earl of salisbury was rather provoked with her sister for never asking after the fate of her champion but was reassured by seeing his red head towering among the numerous squires and other retainers of the second rank it certainly was not his proper place but it was plain that he was not in disgrace and in fact the whole affair had been treated as a mere pardonable blunder of the rangers the superior one was sitting next to the young scot making good cheer with him grand as the whole seemed to the travellers it was not an exceptional banquet indeed the duchess apologised for its simplicity since she had been taken at unawares evidently considering it as the ordinary family meal there was ample provision served up in by no means an unrefined manner even to the multitudinous servants and retainers of the various trains and beyond on the steps and in the court were a swarm of pilgrims friars poor and beggars of all kinds waiting for the fragments  it was a wet evening and when the tables were drawn the guests devoted themselves to various amusements lord salisbury challenged sir patrick to a game at chess lady salisbury and dame lilias wished for nothing better than to converse over old times at middleham castle but the younger people began with dancing the duke who was only thirty years old leading out the elder scottish princess and the young king of the isle of wight the stately and beautiful duchess cicely eleanor who knew she did not excel in anything that required grace and was besides a good deal fatigued would fain have excused herself when paired with the young richard nevil but there was a masterful look about him that somewhat daunted her and she obeyed his summons though without acquitting herself with anything approaching to the dexterity of her sister who with quite as little practice as herself danced wellby quickness of eye and foot and that natural elegance of movement which belongs to symmetry  the dance was a wreathing in and out of the couples including all of rank to dance together and growing more and more animated till excitement took the place of weariness and eleanors pale cheeks were flushed her eyes glowing when the duchesss signal closed the dance  music was then called for and several of the princely company sang to the lute jean pleased to show there was something in which her sister excelled and gratified at some recollections that floated up of her fathers skill in minstrelsy insisted on sending for eleanors harp  oh jean not now i canna murmured eleanor who had been sitting with fixed eyes as though in a dream  but the duke and other nobles came and pressed her and jean whispered to her not to show herself a fule body and disgrace herself before the english setting the harp before her and attending to the strings eleanors fingers then played over them in a dreamy fitful way that made the old earl raise his head and say  that twang carries me back to king harrys tent and the good old time when an englishmans sword was respected  tis the very harp said sir patrick ay and the very tune  come elleen begin what gars thee loiter in that doited way insisted jean come up atween  and led by her sister in spite of herself almost as it were without volition eleanors sweet pathetic voice sang        up atween yon twa hillsides lass        where i and my true love wont to be      a the warld shall never ken lass        what my true love said to me       owre muckle blinking blindeth the ee lass        owre muckle thinking changeth the mind      sair is the life ive led for thee lass        farewell warld for its a at an end   her voice had been giving way through the last verse and in the final line with a helpless wail of the harp she hid her face and sank back with a strange choked agony  why elleen elleen how now cried jean cousin lilias come  lady drummond was already at her side and the duchess and lady salisbury proffering essences and cordials the gentlemen offering support but in a moment or two eleanor recovered enough to cling to lady drummond muttering  oh take me awa take me awa  and hushing the scolding which jean was commencing by way of bracing and rejecting all the kind offers of service dame lilias led the girl away leaving jean to make excuses and explanations about her sister being but silly since they had lost their mother and the tune minding her of home and of her father  when with only annis following the chambers had been reached eleanor let herself sink on a cushion hiding her face against her friend and sobbing hysterically  oh take me awa take me awa its all blood and horror  my bairnie my dearie you are overwearytis but a dreamy fancy look up all is safe none can harm you here  with soothings and with some of the wine on the table lady drummond succeeded in calming the girl and with anniss assistance she undressed her and placed her in the bed  oh do not gang leave me not she entreated and as the lady sat by her holding her hand she spoke it was all dim before me as the music played and  thou wast sair forefaughten dearie  eleanor went on  and then as i touched mine harp all all seemed to swim in a mist of blood and horror there was the old earl and the young bridegroom and many and many more of them with gaping wounds and deathly facesall but the young king of the isle of wight and his shroud his shroud cousin lily it was up to his breast and the ladies faces that were so blithe they were all weeping ghastly and writhen and they were whirling round a great sea of blood right in the middle of the hall and i couldi could bear it no longer  lady drummond controlled herself and for the sake both of the sobbing princess and of her own shuddering daughter said that this terrible vision came of the fatigue of the day and the exhaustion and excitement that had followed she also knew that on poor eleanor that fearful easterns eve had left an indelible impression recurring in any state of weakness or fever she scarcely marvelled at the strange and frightful fancies except that she believed enough in secondsight to be concerned at the mention of the shroud enfolding the young beauchamp who bore the fanciful title of the king of the isle of wight  for the present however she applied herself to the comforting of eleanor with tender words and murmured prayers and never left her till she had slept and wakened again her full self upon jean coming up to bed at nine oclocka very late hourescorted by sundry of the ladies to inquire for the patient  jean was still excited but she was with all her faults very fond of her sister and obeyed lady drummond in being as quiet as possible she seemed to take it as a matter of course that elleen should have her strange whims  mother used to beat her for them she said but nurse ankaret said that made her worse and we kept them secret as much as we could to think of her having them before all that english folk but she will be all right the morn  this proved true after the nights rest eleanor rose in the morning as if nothing had disturbed her and met her hosts as if no visions had hung around them it was well for sir patrick had accepted the invitation courteously given by the duke of york to join the great cavalcade with which he with his brothersinlaw the earl of salisbury and bishop of durham and the earl of warwick alias the king of the isle of wight were on their way to the parliament that was summoned anent the kings marriage the unwilling knights of the shire and burgesses of northampton who would have to assist in the money grant had asked his protection and all were to start early on the mondayfor sunday was carefully observed as a holiday and the whole party in all their splendours attended high mass in the beautiful church  after time had been given for the ensuing meal all the yeomen and young men of the neighbourhood came up to the great outer court of the castle where there was ample space for sports and military exercises shooting with the long and cross bow riding at the quintain and the like in competitions with the grooms and menatarms attached to the retinue of the various great men and the wives daughters and sweethearts came up to watch them for the most successful there were prizes of leathern coats bows knives and the like and refreshments of barleybread beef and very small beer served round with a liberal hand by the troops of servants bearing the falcon and fetterlock badge and all was done not merely in sport but very much in earnest in the hope on the part of the duke and all who were esteemed patriotic that these youths might serve in retaining at least if not in recovering the english conquests  those of gentle blood abstained from their warlike exercises on this day of the week but they looked on from the broad walk in the thickness of the massive walls the duke with his two beautiful little boys by his side the young earls of march and rutland handsome fair children in whom the hereditary blue eyes and fair complexion of the plantagenets recurred and who bade fair to surpass their father in stature their mother was by right and custom to distribute the prizes but she always disliked doing so and either excused herself or reached them out with the ungracious demeanour that had won for her the muttered name of proud cis on this day she had avoided the task on the plea of the occupations caused by her approaching journey and the duke put in her place his elder boy and his little cousin lady anne beauchamp the child of the young king of the isle of wighta shortlived little delicate being but very fair and pretty so that the two children together upon a stone chair cushioned with red velvet were like a fairy king and queen and there was many a murmur of admiration and bless their little hearts or their sweet faces as annes dainty fingers handled the prizes big bows or knives arrows or belts and edward had a smile and appropriate speech for each such as shoot at a frenchmans breast next time bob theres a knife to cut up the deer with will and the like amenities at which his father nodded well pleased to see the arts of popularity coming to him by nature sir patrick watched with grave eyes as he thought of his beloved sovereigns desire to see his people thus practised in arms without peril of feud and violence to one another  jean looked on eager to see some of the scots of their own escort excel the english pockpuddings but though dandie and two or three more contended the habits were too unfamiliar for them to win any great distinction and george douglas did not come forward the competition was not for men of gentle blood and success would have brought him forward in a manner it was desirable to avoid there was a good deal of merry talk between jean and the hosts enemies though she regarded them the duke of york was evidently much struck with her beauty and liveliness and he asked sir patrick in private whether there were any betrothal or contract in consequence of which he was taking her to france  none said sir patrick it is merely to be with her sister the dauphiness  then said young richard nevil who was standing by him and seemed to have instigated the question there would be no hindrance supposing she struck the kings fancy  the king is contracted said sir patrick  half contracted but to the beggarly daughter of a frenchman who calls himself king of halfadozen realms without an acre in any of them it is not gone so far but that it might be thrown over if he had sense and spirit not to be led by the nose by the cardinal and suffolk  hushhush dick this is dangerous matter said the duke and sir patrick added  these ladies are nieces to the cardinal  that is well and it would win the more readily consenteven though suffolk and his shameful peace were thrown over eagerly said the future kingmaker  gloucester would be willing added the duke he loved the damsels father and hateth the french alliance  i spoke with her added nevil and redhot little scot as she is she only lacks an english wedlock to make her as truly english which this wench of anjou can never be  she would give our meek king just the spring and force he needs said the duke but thou wilt hold thy peace sir knight and let no whisper reach the womenfolk  this sir patrick readily promised he was considerably tickled by the idea of negotiating such an important affair for his young king and his protegee feeling that the benefit to scotland might outweigh any qualms as to the disappointment to the french allies besides if king henry of windsor should think proper to fall in love with her he could not help it he had not brought her away from home or to england with any such purpose he had only to stand by and let things take their course so long as the safety and honour of her her brother and the kingdom were secure so reasoned the canny scot but he held his tongue to his lilias     chapter 4 st helen s        i thought king henry had resembled thee       in courage courtship and proportion       but all his mind is bent to holiness       to number avemaries on his beads       his champions are the prophets and apostles       his weapons holy saws of sacred writ                                         king henry vi   george douglass chivalrous venture in defence of the falcon of his ladylove had certainly not done much for him hitherto as davie observed the lady joanna as every one now called her took it as only the bounden duty and natural service of one of her suite and would have cared little for his suffering for it personally except so far as it concerned her own dignity which she understood much better than she had done in scotland where she was only one of the lassies an encumbrance to every one  the york retainers had dropped all idea of visiting his offence upon douglas when they found that he had acted in the service of an honoured guest of their lord but they did not look with much favour on him or on any other of the scottish troop whom their master enjoined them to treat as guests and comrades  the uniting of so many suites of the mighty nobles of the fifteenth century formed quite a little army amounting to some two or three hundred horsemen mostly armed and well appointed with their masters badges on their sleevesfalcon and fetterlock dun cow bear and ragged staff and the cross of durham while all likewise wore in their caps the white rose waggons with household furniture and kitchen needments had been sent in advance with the numerous black guard and a provision of cattle for slaughter accompanied these since it was one of the considerate acts that already had won affection to richard of york that unlike many of the great nobles he always avoided as much as possible letting his train be oppressive to the countrypeople  david drummond had been seeing that all his fathers troop were duly provided with the drummond badge the thyme which was requisite as showing them accepted of the duke of yorks company but as george and his follower had never submitted to wear it he was somewhat surprised to find the gray blossom prominent in georges steelguarded cap and to hear him saying  don it ringan as thou wouldst obey me  his fathers son is not his own father said ringan sulkily  then tak thy choice of wearing it or winning hame as thou canstmost like hanging on the nearest oak  and id gey liefer than demean myself in the drummond thyme replied ringan half turning away but then what would come of gray meg wi only the master to see till her muttered he caressing the mares neck weel aweel sirand he held out his hand for the despised spray  is yon thy wild callant geordie said david in some surprise for ringan was not only provided with a pony but his thatch of towlike hair had been trimmed and covered with a barret cap and his leathern coat and leggings were like those of the other horseboys  ay said george this is no place to be ower kenspeckle  i was coming to ask said david if thou wouldst not own thyself to my father and take thy proper place ere ganging farther south it irks me to see some of the best blood in scotland among the grooms  it must irk thee still davie returned george these english folk might not thole to see my fathers son in their hands without winning something out of him and i saw by what passed the other day that thou and thy father would stand by me hap what hap and ill never embroil him and peril the lady by my freak  my father kens pretty well wha is riding in his companie said david  ay but he is not bound to ken  and thou winna write to the yerl as ye said ye would when ye were ower the border theres a clerk o the bishop of durham ganging back and my father is writing letters that he will send forward to the king and thou couldst get a scart o the pen to thy father  and what wad be thought of a puir manatarms sending letters to the yerl said george na na i may write when we win to france a friendly land but while we are in england the loons shall make naething out of my fathers son  weel gang thine ain gait and an unco strange one it is said david i marvel what thou countst on gaining by it  the sicht of her at least said george nay she needed a stout hand once she may need it again  whereat david waved his hands in a sort of contemptuous wonder  if it were the duchess of york now he said she is far bonnier and even prouder gin that be what taks your fancy and as to our jeanie they are all cockering her up till shell no be content with a king i doot me if the paip himself wad be good enough for her  it was true that the brilliant and lively lady joanna was in high favour with the princely gallants of the cavalcade the only member of the party at all equal to her in beauty was the duchess of york who travelled in a whirlicote with her younger children and her ladies and at the haltingplaces never relaxed the stiff dignity with which she treated every one eleanor did indeed accompany her sister but she had not jeans quick power of repartee and she often answered at haphazard and was not understood when she did reply nor had she jeans beauty so that in the opinion of most of the young nobles she was but a raw almost dumb scotswoman and was left to herself as much as courtesy permitted except by the young king of the isle of wight a gentle poetical personage in somewhat delicate health with tastes that made him the chosen companion of the scholarly king henry he could repeat a great deal of chaucers poetry by heart the chief way in which people could as yet enjoy books and there was an interchange between them of blind harry and of the canterbury tales as they rode side by side sometimes making their companions laugh and wonder that the youthful queen was not jealous dame lilias found her congenial companion in the countess alice of salisbury who could talk with her of that golden age of the two kings henry and james of her brother malcolm and of esclairmonde de luxembourg now sister clare whom they hoped soon to see in the sisterhood of st katharines  hers hath been the happy course the blessed dedication said countess alice  we have both been blessed too thanks to the saints returned lilias  that is indeed sooth replied the other lady my lord hath ever been most good to me and i have had joy of my sons yet there is much that my mind forbodes and shrinks back from in dread as i watch my son richards overmastering spirit  the cardinal and the duke of gloucester have long been at strife as we heard said lady drummond but sure that will be appeased now that the cardinal is an old man and your king come to years of discretion  the king is a sweet youth a very saint already replied the countess but i misdoubt whether he have the stout heart and strong hand of his father and he is set on peace  peace is to be followed said lilias amazed at the tone in which her friend mentioned it  peace at home ay but peace at home is only to be had by war abroad peace abroad without honour only leaves these fiery spirits to fume and fly at one anothers throats or at those who wrought it my mind misgives me mine old friend lest wrangling lead to blows i had rather see my richard spurring against the french than against his cousins of somerset and while they advance themselves and claim to be nearer in blood to the king than our good host of york so long will there be cause of bitterness  our kindly host seems to wish evil to no man  nay he is content enough but my sister his wife and alas my son cannot let him forget that after the duke of gloucester he is highest in the direct male line to king edward of windsor and in the female line stands nearer than this present king  in scotland he would not forget that his father suffered for that very cause  ah lilias thou hast seen enow of what such bloodfeuds work in scotland to know how much i dread and how i pray they may never awaken here the blessed king harry of monmouth kept them down by the strong hand while he won all hearts to himself it is my prayer that his young son may do the like and that my lord of york be not fretted out of his peaceful loyalty by the somerset outrecuidance and above all that my own son be not the makebate but richard is proud and fiery and i feari greatly fear what may be in store for us  lilias thought of eleanors vision but kept silence respecting it  forerunners had been sent on by the duke of york to announce his coming and who were in his company and on the last stage these returned bringing with them a couple of knights and of clerks on the part of the cardinal of winchester to welcome his greatnieces whom he claimed as his guests  i had hoped that the ladies of scotland would honour my poor house said the duke  the lord cardinal deems it thus more fitting said the portly priest who acted as beauforts secretary and who spoke with an authority that chafed the duke  richard nevil rode up to him and mutteredhe hath divined our purpose and means to cross it  the clerk however spoke with sir patrick and in a manner took possession of the young ladies they were riding between walled courts substantially built with intervals of fields and woods or sometimes indeed of morass for london was still an island in the middle of swamps with the great causeways of the old roman times leading to it the spire of st pauls and the square keep of the tower had been pointed out to them and jean exclaimed  my certie it is a braw toon  but eleanor on her side exclaimed  tis but a flat mine eye wearies for the sea ay and for arthurs seat and the castle oh i wadna gie embro for forty of sic toons  perhaps jean had guessed enough to make her look on london with an eye of possession for her answer was  hear till her and she was the first to cry out upon embro for a place of reivers and landloupers and to want to leave it  there was so much that was new and wonderful that the sisters pursued the question no further they saw the masts of the shipping in the thames and what seemed to them a throng of church towers and spires while nearer the road began to be full of marketfolk the women in hoods and mantles and short petticoats the men in long frocks such as their saxon forefathers had worn driving the rough ponies or donkeys that had brought in their produce there were begging friars in cowl and frock and beggars not friars with crutch and bowl there were gleemen and tumbling women solid tradesfolk going out to the country farms they loved troops of prentices on their way to practice with the bow or cudgel and parties of gailycoloured nobles knights squires and burgesses coming like their own party to the meeting of parliament  there were continual greetings the duke of york showing himself most markedly courteous to all his dark head being almost continuously uncovered and bending to his saddlebow in response to the salutations that met him and friendly inquiries and answers being often exchanged the earl of salisbury and his son were almost equally courteous but in the midst of all the interest of these greetings soon after entering the city at bishopsgate the clerk caused the two scottish sisters to draw up at an arched gateway in a solidlooking wall saying that it was here that my lord cardinal wished his royal kinswomen to be received at the priory of st helens a hooded laysister looked out at a wicket and on his speaking to her proceeded to unbar the great gates while the duke of york took leave in a more than kindly manner declaring that they would meet again and that he knew my lady of st helens would make them good cheer  indeed he himself and the king of wight rode into the outer court and lifted the two ladies down from horseback at the inner gate beyond which they might not go jean crossed now for the first time since she had left home was in tears of vexation and could hardly control her voice to respond to his words muttering  as if i looked for this beshrew the old priest  none but female attendants could be admitted sir patrick with his sons and the rest of the train was to be lodged at the great palace of the bishop of winchester at southwark and as he came up to take leave of jean she said with a stamp of her foot and a clench of her hand  let my uncle know that i am no cloisterbird to be mewed up here i demand to be with the friends i have made and who have bidden me  shrewd sir patrick smiled a little as he said  i will tell the lord cardinal what you say lady but methinks you will find that submission to him with a good grace carries you farther here than does illhumour  he said something of the same kind to his wife as he took leave of her well knowing who were predominant with the king and who were in opposition the only link being the king of wight or rather earl of warwick who as the son of henrys guardian had been bred up in the closest intimacy with the monarch and indeed had been invested with his fantastic sovereignty that he might be treated as a brother and on an equality  jean however remained very angry and discontented after her neglected and oppressed younger days the courtesy and admiration she had received for the last ten days had the effect of making her like a spoilt child and when they entered the inner cloistered court within and were met by the lady prioress at the head of all her sisters in black dresses she hardly vouchsafed an inclination of the head in reply to the graceful and courtly welcome with which the princesses nieces to the great cardinal were received eleanor usually in the background was left in surprise and confusion to stammer out thanks in broad scotch seconded by lady drummond who could make herself far more intelligible to these southcountry ears  there was a beautiful cloister a double walk with clustered columns running down the centre and a vaulted roof and with a fountain in the midst of the quadrangle there was a chapel on one side the buildings of the priory on the others it was only a priory for the parent abbey was in the country but the prioress was a noble lady of the house of stafford a small personage as to stature but thoroughly alert and businesslike and in fact the moving spring not only of the actual house but of the parent abbey manager of the property it possessed in the city and of all its monastic politics  without apparent offence she observed that no doubt the ladies were weary and that sister mabel should conduct them to the guestchamber accordingly one of the black figures led the way and as soon as they were beyond earshot there were observations that would not have gratified jean  the illnurtured scots cried one young nun tis ever the way with them returned a much older one i mind when one was captive in my fathers castle who was a mere clown and drank up the water that was meant to wash his fingers after meat the guestchamber will need a cleaning after they are gone  methinks it was less lack of manners than lack of temper said the prioress she hath the beaufort face and the beaufort spirit  the chapel bell began to ring and the black veils and white filed in long procession to the pointed doorway while the two scottish damsels with lady drummond her daughter and christie were conducted to three chambers looking out on the one side on the cloistered court on the other over a choicelykept garden walled in but planted with trees shading the turf walks the rooms were as sister mabel explained with some complacency reserved for the lodging of the noble ladies who came to london as guests of my lord cardinal or with petitions to the king and certainly there was nothing of asceticism about them but they were an advance even on those at fotheringay st helena discovering the cross was carved over the ample chimney and the hangings were of spanish leather with all the wondrous history of santiagos relics including the miracle of the cock and hen embossed and gilt upon them there was a venetian mirror in which the ladies saw more of themselves than they had ever done before and with exquisite work around there were carved chests inlaid with ivory and cushions perfect marvels of needlework as were the curtains and coverlets of the mighty bed and the screens to be arranged for privacy there were toilette vessels of beautifully shaped and brightly polished brass and on a silver salver was a refection of manchet bread comfits dried cherries and wine  sister mabel explained that a laysister would be at hand in case anything was needed by the noble ladies and then hurried away to vespers  jean threw herself upon the crosslegged chair that stood nearest  a nunnery forsooth does our uncle trow that is what i came here for we have had enow of nunneries at home  oh fie for shame jeanie cried eleanor  twas thou that saidst it returned jean thou saidst thou hadst no call to the veil and gin my lord trows that we shall thole to be shut up here he will find himself in the wrong  lassie lassie exclaimed lady drummond what ails ye this is but a lodging and sic a braw chamber as ye hae scarce seen before would you have your uncle lodge ye among all his priests and clerks scarce the place for douce maidens i trow  leddy of glenuskie yere not sae sib to the bluid royal of scotland as to speak thus lassie indeed  again eleanor remonstrated jeanie to speak thus to our gude kinswoman  i would have all about me ken their place and what fits them said the haughty young lady partly out of illtemper and disappointment partly in imitation of the demeanour of duchess cicely as to the cardinal i would have him bear in mind that we are a kings own daughters and he is at best but the grandson of a king and if he deems that he has a right to shut us up here out of sight of the king and his court lest we should cross his rule over his king and disturb his french policy and craft there are those that will gar him ken better  some one else will ken better quietly observed dame lilias gin ye be no clean daft leddy joanna since naething else will serve ye canna ye see that to strive with the cardinal is the worst gait to win his favour with the king gin that be what ye be set upon  there be others that can deal with the king forbye the cardinal said jean tossing her head  just then arrived a sister sent by the mother prioress to invite the ladies to supper in her own apartments  her respectful manner so far pacified jeans illhumour that a civil reply was returned the young ladies bestirred themselves to make preparations though jean grumbled at the trouble for a pack of womenfolkand supposed they were to make a meal of dried peas and red herrings like their last on lammermuir  it was a surprise to be conducted not to the refectory where all the nuns took their meal together but to a small room opening into the cloister on one side and with a window embowered in vines on the other looking into the garden it was by no means bare like the typical cells of strict convents the mother margaret stafford was a great lady and the benedictines of the old foundation of st helens in the midst of the capital were indeed respectable and respected but very far from strict observers of their ruleand st helens was so much influenced by the wealth and display of the city that the nuns many of whom were these great merchants daughters would have been surprised to be told that they had departed from benedictine simplicity so the prioresss chamber was tapestried above with st helenas life and below was enclosed with drapery panels it was strewed with sweet fresh rushes and had three crosslegged chairs besides several stools the table as usual upon trestles was provided with delicate napery and there was a dainty perfume about the whole a beautiful crucifix of ivory and ebony with images of our lady and st john on either side and another figure of st helena cross in hand presiding over the holy water stoup were the most ecclesiastical things in the garniture except the exquisitely illuminated breviary that lay open upon a desk  mother margaret rose to receive her guests with as much dignity as jean herself could have shown and made them welcome to her poor house hoping that they would there find things to their mind  something restrained jean from bursting out with her petulant complaint and it was eleanor who replied with warm thanks my lord cardinal would come to visit them on the morn the prioress said and in the meantime she hoped looking at jean they would condescend to the hospitality of the poor daughters of st helen  the hospitality as brought in by two plump wellfed laysisters consisted of chickens in cretyne stewed in milk seasoned with sugar coloured with saffron of potage of oysters butter of almondmilk and other delicate meats such as had certainly never been tasted at stirling or dunbar lady drummonds birth entitled her and annis to sit at table with the princesses and the prioress and she ventured to inquire after esclairmonde de luxembourg or as she was now called sister clare of st katharines  i see her at times she is the head of the sisters said the prioress but we have few dealings with uncloistered sisters  they do a holy work observed lady lilias  none ever blamed the benedictines for lack of almsdeeds returned the prioress haughtily scarcely attending to the guests disclaimer nor do i deem it befitting that instead of the poor coming to us our sisters should run about to all the foulest hovels of the docks encountering men continually and those of the rudest sort  yet there are calls and vocations for all ventured lady drummond and the sick are brethren in need  let them send to us for succour then answered mother margaret i grant that it is well that some one should tend them in their huts but such tasks are for sisters of low birth and breeding mine are ladies of noble rank though i do admit daughters of lord mayors and aldermen  our saint margaret was a queen reverend mother put in eleanor  she was no nun saving your grace said the prioress what i speak of is that which beseems a daughter of st bennet of an ancient and royal foundation the saving of the soul is so much harder to the worldly life specially to a queen that it is no marvel if she has to abase herself moreeven to the washing of lepersthan is needful to a vowed and cloistered sister  it was an odd theory that this benedictine seclusion saved trouble as being actually the strait course but the young maidens were not scholars enough to question it and dame lilias though she had learnt more from her brother and her friend would have deemed it presumptuous to dispute with a reverend mother so only eleanor murmured the holy margaret no saintand jean weel i had liefer take my chance  all have not a vocation piously said the mother taste this rose dalmoyne madame our laysister mold is famed for making it an alderman of the fishmongers company sent to beg that his cook might know the secret but that was not to be lightly parted with so we only send them a dish for their banquets  rose dalmoyne was chiefly of peas flavoured with almonds and milk but the guests grew weary of the varieties of delicacies and were very glad when the tables were removed and eleanor asked permission to look at the illuminations in the breviary on the desk  and exquisite they were the book had been brought from italy and presented to the prioress by a merchant who wished to place his daughter in st helens and the beauty was unspeakable there were natural flowers painted so perfectly that the scattered violets seemed to invite the hand to lift them up from their goldbesprinkled bed and flies and beetles that eleanor actually attempted to drive away and at all the greater holy days the type and the antitype covering the two whole opposite pages were represented in the admirable art and pure colouring of the early cinquecento  eleanor and annis were entranced and the prioress seeing that books had an attraction for her younger guest promised her on the morrow a sight of some of the metrical lives of the saints especially of st katharine and of st cecilia it must be owned that jean was not fretted as she expected by chapel bells in the middle of the night nor was even lady drummond summoned by them as she intended but there was a conglomeration of the night services in the morning with beautiful singing that delighted eleanor and the festival mass ensuing was also more ornate than anything to be seen in scotland and that the extensive almsgiving had not been a vain boast was evident from the swarms of poor of all kinds who congregated in the outer court for the attention of the sisters almoner and infirmarer attended by two or three novices and some laysisters  there were genuine poor ragged forlorn women and barefooted almost naked children and also sturdy beggars pilgrims and palmers on their way to various shrines north or south and many more for whom a dole of broth or bread sufficed but there were also others with heads or limbs tied up sometimes injured in the many street fights but oftener with the terrible sores only too common from the squalid habits and want of vegetable diet of the poor these were all attended to with a tenderness and patience that spoke well for the charity of sister anne and her assistants and indeed before long dame lilias perceived that however slack and easygoing the general habits might be there were truly meek and saintly women among the sisterhood  the morning was not far advanced before a laysister came hurrying in from the portresss wicket to announce that my lord cardinal was on his way to visit the ladies of scotland there was great commotion mother margaret summoned all her nuns and drew them up in state and sister mabel who carried the tidings to the guests asked whether they would not join in receiving him  we are kings daughters said jean haughtily  but he is a prince of the church and an aged man said lady drummond who had already risen and was adjusting that headgear of eleanors that never would stay in its place and her matronly voice acted upon jean so as to conquer the petulant pride enough to make her remember that the lady of glenuskie was herself a stewart and kings grandchild and moreover knew more of courts and their habits than herself  so down they went together in time to join the prioress on the steps as the attendants of the great stately princely cardinal bishop began to appear he did not come in state so that he had only half a dozen clerks and as many gentlemen in attendance together with sir patrick and his two sons  few of the plantagenet family had been longlived and cardinal beaufort was almost a marvel in the family at seventy much evil has been said and written of him and there is no doubt that he was one of those mediaeval prelates who ought to have been warriors or statesmen and that he had been no model for the episcopacy in his youth but though far from having been a saint it would seem that his unpopularity in his old age was chiefly incurred by his desire to put an end to the long and miserable war with france and by his opposition to a much worse man the duke of gloucester whose plausible murmurs and amiable manners made him a general favourite at this period of his life the old man had lived past his political ambitions and his chief desire was to leave the gentle young king freed from the wasting war by a permanent peace to be secured by a marriage with a near connection of the french monarch and daughter to the most honourable and accomplished prince in europe that his measures turned out wretchedly has been charged upon his memory and he has been supposed guilty of a murder of which he was certainly innocent and which probably was no murder at all  he had become a very grand and venerable old man when old men were scarce and his white hair and beard a survival of the customs of the days of edward iii contrasted well with his scarlet hat and cape as he came slowly into the cloistered court on his large soberpaced spanish mule a knight and the chaplain of the convent assisted him from it and the whole troop of the convent knelt as he lifted his fingers to bestow his blessing jean casting a quick glance around to satisfy her proud spirit the prioress then kissed his hand but he raised and kissed the cheeks of his two grandnieces after which he moved on to the prioresss chamber and there after being installed in her large chair and waving to the four favoured inmates to be also seated he looked critically at the two sisters and observed so maidens one favours the mother the other the father poor joan it is twoandtwenty years since we bade her goodspeed she and her young kingwho behoved to be a minstrelon her way to her kingdom as if it were the land of cockayne for picking up gold and silver little of that she found i trow poor wench alack it was a sore life we sent her to and you are mourning her freshly my maidens i trust she died at peace with god and man  that reiver patrick hepburn let the priest from haddington come to assoilzie and housel her responded jean  ah masses shall be said for her by my bedesmen at st cross and at all my churches said the cardinal crossing himself and you are on your way to your sister the dolfine as your knight tells me it is well you may be worthily wedded in france and i will take order for your safe going meantime this is a house where you may well serve your poor mothers soul by prayers and masses and likewise perfect yourselves in french  this was not at all what jean had intended and she pouted a little while the cardinal asked changing his language ces donzelles ont elles appris le francais  jean who had tried to let father romuald teach her a little in conversation during the first part of the journey but who had dropped the notion since other ideas had been inspired at fotheringay could not understand and pouted the more but eleanor who had been interested and tried more in earnest for margarets sake answered diffidently and blushing deeply un petit peu beau sire oncle  he smiled and said you can be well instructed here the reverend mother hath sisters here who can both speak and write french of paris  that have i truly my good lord replied the prioress sisters isabel and beata spent their younger days the one at rouen the other at bordeaux and have learned many young ladies in the true speaking of the french tongue  it is well said the cardinal my fair nieces will have good leisure while sharing the orisons that i will institute for the repose of your mother you can also be taught the french  jean could not help speaking now so far was this from all her hopes sir sir the duke and duchess of york and the countess of salisbury and the queen of the isle of wight all bade us to be their guests  they could haply not have been aware of your dool said the cardinal gravely  but my lord our mother hath been dead since before martinmas exclaimed jean  i know not what customs of dool be thought befitting in a land like scotland said the cardinal in such a repressive manner that jean was only withheld by awe from bursting into tears of disappointment and anger at the slight to her country  lady drummond ventured to speak alack my lord she said my poor queen died in the hands of a freebooter leaving her daughters in such stress and peril that they had woe enough for themselves till their brother the king came to their rescue  the more need that they should fulfil all that may be done for the grace of her soul replied the uncle but just at this crisis of jeans mortification there was a knocking at the door and a sister breathlessly entreated  pardon merci my lord my lady mother heres the king the king himselfand the king and queen of the isle of wight asking licence to enter to visit the ladies of scotland  kings were always held to be free to enter anywhere even far more dangerous monarchs than the pious henry vi jeans heart bounded up again with a sense of exultation over the old uncle as the prioress went out to receive her new guest and the cardinal emitted a sort of grunting sigh without troubling himself to go out to meet the youth whom he had governed from babyhood and in whose own name he had as one of the council given permission for wholesome chastisements of the royal person  king henry entered he was then twentyfour years old tall graceful and with beautiful features and complexion almost feminine in their delicacy and with a wonderful purity and sweetness in the expression of the mouth and blue eyes so that he struck eleanor as resembling the angels in the illuminations that she had been studying as he removed his dark green velvet jewelled cap on entering and gave a cousinly respectful kiss lightly to each of the young ladies on her cheek somewhat as if he were afraid of them then after greeting the cardinal who had risen on his entrance he said that hearing that his fair cousins were arrived he had come to welcome them and to entreat them to let him do them such honour as was possible in a court without a queen  the which lack will soon be remedied put in his granduncle  truly you are in holy keeping here said the pious young king crossing himself but i trust my sweet cousins that you will favour my poor house at westminster with your presence at a supper and share such entertainment as is in our power to provide  my nieces are keeping their mourning for their mother from which they have hitherto been hindered by the tumults of their kingdom said the cardinal  ah said the king crossing himself and instantly moved far be it from me to break into their holy retirement for such a purpose jean could have bitten the cardinal but i will take order with my lord abbot of westminster for a grand requiem mass for the good queen joanna at which they will i trust be present and they will honour my poor table afterwards  to refuse this was quite impossible and the day was to be fixed after reference to the abbess meantime the kings eye was caught by the illuminated breviary he was a connoisseur in such arts and eagerly stood up to look at it as it lay on the desk eleanor could not but come and direct him to the pages with which she had been most delighted she found him looking at jacobs dream on the one side the ascension on the other  how marvellous it is she said it is like the very light from the sky  light from heaven said the king jacob has found it among the stones wandering and homelessness are his first step in the ladder to heaven  ah sir did you say that to comfort and hearten us said eleanor  there was a strange look in the startled blue eyes that met hers nay truly lady i presumed not so far i was but wondering whether those who are born to have all the world are in the way of the stair to heaven  meantime the king of wight had made his request for the presence of the ladies at a supper at warwick house and jean clasping her hands implored her uncle to consent  i am sure our mother cannot be the better for our being thus mewed up she cried and ill rise at prime and tell my beads for her  she looked so pretty and imploring that the old mans heart was melted all the more that the king was paying more attention to the book and the far less beautiful eleanor than to her and the invitation was accepted  the convent bell rang for nones and the king joined the devotions of the nuns though he was not admitted within the choir and just as these were over the countess of salisbury arrived to take the lady of glenuskie to see their old friend the mother clare at st katharines bringing a sober palfrey for her conveyance  a holy woman full of almsdeeds said the king the lady is happy in her friendship  which words were worth much to lady drummond for the prioress sent a laysister to invite mother clare to a refection at the convent     chapter 5 the meek usurper        henry thou of holy birth       thou to whom thy windsor gave       nativity and name and grave       heavily upon his head       ancestral crimes were visitedsouthey   it suits not with the main thread of our story to tell of the happy and peaceful meetings between the lady of glenuskie and her old friend who had given up almost princely rank and honour to become the servant of the poor and suffering strangers at the wharves of london to dame lilias mother clares quiet cell at st katharines was a blessed haven of rest peace and charity such as was neither the guestchamber nor the prioresss parlour at st helens with all the distractions of the princesses visitors and invitations and with the lady joanna continually pulling against the authority that the cardinal her uncle was exerting over his nieces  his object evidently was to keep them back firstly from the york party and secondly from the king under pretext of their mourning for their mother and in this he might have succeeded but for the interest in them that had been aroused in henry by his companion namesake and almost brother the king of wight the king came or sent each day to st helens to arrange about the requiem at westminster and when their late travelling companions invited the young ladies to dinner or to supper expressly to meet the king and the cardinalnot in state but at what would be now called a family partybeaufort had no excuse for a refusal such as he could not give without dire offence and indeed he was even then obliged to yield to the general voice and recalling his own nephew from normandy send the duke of york to defend the remnant of the english conquests  he could only insist that the requiem should be the first occasion of the young ladies going out of the convent but they had so many visitors there that they had not much cause for murmuring and the french instructions of sister beata did not amount to much even with eleanor while jean loudly protested that she was not going to school  the great day of the requiem came at last the cardinal had through sir patrick drummond and the lady provided handsome robes of black and purple for his nieces and likewise palfreys for their conveyance to westminster and made it understood that unless lady joanna submitted to be completely veiled he should send a closed litter  the doited auld carle she cried as she unwillingly hooded and veiled herself one would think we were basilisks to slay the good folk of london with our eyes  the drummond following with fresh thyme sprays beginning to turn brown were drawn up in the outer court all with black scarves across the breastgeorge douglas among them of courseand they presently united with the long train of clerks who belonged to the household of the cardinal of winchester jean managed her veil so as to get more than one peep at the throng in the streets through which they passed so as to see and to be seen and she was disappointed that no acclamations greeted the fair face thus displayed by fits she did not understand english politics enough to know that a beaufort face and beaufort train were the last things the london crowd was likely to applaud they had not forgotten the penance of the popular duke humfreys wife which justly or unjustly was imputed to the cardinal and his nephews of somerset  but the king in robes of purple and black came to assist her from her palfrey before the beautiful entry of the abbey church and led her up the nave to the desks prepared around what was then termed a herce but which would now be called a catafalque an erection supposed to contain the body and adorned with the lozenges of the arms of scotland and beaufort and of the stewart in honour of the black knight of lorn  the cardinal was present but the abbot of westminster celebrated all was exceedingly solemn and beautiful in a far different style from the maimed rites that had been bestowed upon poor queen joanna in scotland the young kings face was more angelic than ever and as psalm and supplication dirge and hymn arose chanted by the full choir speaking of eternal peace eleanor bowed her head under her veil as her bosom swelled with a strange yearning longing not exactly grief and large tears dropped from her eyes as she thought less of her mother than of her noblehearted father and the words came back to her in which father malcolm stewart in his own bitter grief had told the desolate children to remember that their father was waiting for them in paradise even jean was so touched by the music and carried out of herself that she forgot the spectators forgot the effect she was to produce forgot her struggle with her uncle and sobbed and wept with all her heart perhaps with the more abandon because she like all the rest was fasting  with much reverence for her emotion the king when the service was over led her out of the church to the adjoining palace where the queen of wight and the countess of suffolk a kinswoman through the mother of the beauforts conducted the ladies to unveil themselves before they were to join the noontide refection with the king  there was no great state about it spread as it was not in the great hall but in the richlytapestried room called paradise the kings manner was most gently and sweetly courteous to both sisters his three little orphan halfbrothers the tudors were at table and his kind care to send them dainties and the look with which he repressed an unseasonable attempt of jaspers to play with the dogs and edmunds roughness with little owen reminded the sisters of mary with her weans and they began to speak of them when the meal was over while he showed them his chief treasures his books there was st augustines city of god exquisitely copied there was the history of st louis by the bon sire de joinville there were sir john froissarts chronicles the same that the good canon had presented to king richard of bordeaux  jean cast a careless glance at the illuminations and exclaimed at queen isabels high headgear and her becloaked greyhound eleanor looked and longed and sighed that she could not read the french and only a very little of the latin  this you can read said henry producing the canterbury tales the fair minstrelsy of my lady of suffolks grandsire  eleanor was enchanted here were the lines the king of wight had repeated to her and she was soon eagerly listening as henry read to her the story of patient grisell  ah but is it well thus tamely to submit she asked  patience is the armour and conquest of the godly said henry quoting a saying that was to serve the meek usurper well in aftertimes  may not patience go too far said eleanor  in this world mayhap said he scarcely so in that which is to come  i would not be the kings bride to hear him say so laughed the lady of suffolk shall i tell her my lord that this is your graces ladder to carry her to heaven  henry blushed like a girl and said that he trusted never to be so lacking in courtesy as the knight and the king of wight wishing to change the subject mentioned that the lady eleanor had sung or said certain choice ballads and henry eagerly entreated for one it was the pathetic wife of ushers well that eleanor chose with the three sons whose hats were wreathen with the birk that                     neither grew in dyke nor ditch                    nor yet in any shaugh                    but at the gates of paradise                    that birk grew fair eneugh   henry was greatly delighted with the verse and entreated her if it were not tedious to repeat it over again  in return he promised to lend her some of the translations from the latin of lydgate the monk of bury and sent them wrapped in a silken neckerchief by the hands of one of his servants to the convent  was that a token anxiously asked young douglas riding up to david drummond as they got into order to ride back to winchester house after escorting the ladies to st helens  token no tis a book for lady elleen never fash yourself man the king so far as i might judge is far more taken with elleen than ever he is with jean he seems but a bookish sort of bodie of malcolms sort  my certie an that be sae we may look to winning back roxburgh and berwick returned the douglas his eye flashing hes welcome to lady elleen but that ane should look at her in presence of her sister he maun be mair of a monk than a man  such was in truth jeans own opinion when she flounced into her chamber at the priory and turned upon her sister  weel elleen and i hope yeve had your will and are a bit shamed taking up his grace so that none by yersell could get in a word wi him  deed jeanie i could not help it if he would ask me about our ballants and buiks that ye would never lay your mind to  ballants and buiks bonnie gear for a king that should be thinking of spears and jacks lances and honours yere welcome to him elleen sin ye choose to busk your cockernnonny at ane thats as good as wedded ill never have the man whos wanting the strick of carle hemp in the making of him  eleanor burst into tears and pleaded that she was incapable of any such intentions towards a man who was truly as good as married she declared that she had only replied as courtesy required and that she would not have her harp taken to warwick house the next day as she had been requested to do  dame lilias here interposed with a certain conviction that jeans dislike to the king was chiefly because the grapes were sour she declared that lady elleen had by no means gone beyond the demeanour of a douce maiden and that the king had only shown due attention to guests of his own rank and who were nearly of his own age in fact she said it might be his caution and loyalty to his espoused lady that made him avoid distinguishing the fairest  it was not complimentary to eleanor but jeans superior beauty was as much an established fact as her age and she was pacified in some degree agreeing with the lady of glenuskie that eleanor was bound to take her harp the next day  warwick house was a really magnificent place its courts gardens and offices covering much of the ground that still bears the name in the city and though the establishment was not quite as extensive as it became a few years later when richard nevil had succeeded his brotherinlaw it was already on a magnificent scale  all the party who had travelled together from fotheringay were present besides the king young edmund and jasper tudor and the earl and countess of suffolk and the banquet though not a state one nor encumbered with pageants and subtilties was even more refined and elegant than that at westminster showing as all agreed the hand of a mistress of the household the kings taste had been consulted for in the gallery were the children of st pauls choir and of the chapel of the household who sang hymns with sweet trained voices afterwards on the beautiful october afternoon there was walking in the garden where edmund and jasper played with little lady anne beauchamp and again king henry sought out eleanor and they had an enjoyable discussion of the tale of troie which he had lent her as they walked along the garden paths then she showed him her cousin malcolm and told of bishop kennedy and the schemes for st andrews and he in return described winchester college and spoke of his wish to have such another foundation as wykehams under his own eye near windsor to train up the godly clergy whom he saw to be the great need and lack of the church at that day  by and by on going in from the garden the king and eleanor found that a tall grayhaired gentleman richly but darkly clad had entered the hall he had been welcomed by the young king and queen of wight who had introduced jean to him my uncle of gloucester said the king aside it is the first time he has come among us since the unhappy affair of his wife let me present you to him  going forward as the duke rose to meet him henry bent his knee and asked his fatherly blessing then introduced the lady eleanor of scotlandwho knows all lays and songs and loves letters as you told me her blessed father did my fair uncle he said with sparkling eyes  duke humfrey looked well pleased as he greeted her ever the scholar nevoy hal he said as if marvelling at the preference above the beauty but each man knows his own mind so best eleanors heart began to beat high what did this bode was this king fully pledged she had to fulfil her promise of singing and playing to the king which she did very sweetly some of the pathetic airs of her country which reach back much farther than the songs with which they have in later times been associated the king thoroughly enjoyed the music and the duke of york came and paid her several compliments begging for the song she had once begun at fotheringay eleanor begannot perhaps so willingly as before strangely as she sang               owre muckle blinking blindeth the ee lass               owre muckle thinking changeth the mind  her face and voice altered something of the same mist of tears and blood seemed to rise before her eyes as beforeenfolding all around such a windingsheet which had before enwrapt the king of wight she saw it againnay on the duke of gloucester there was such another mountingmounting to his neck the face of henry himself grew dim and ghastly white like that of a marble saint she kept herself from screaming but her voice broke down and she gave a choking sob  king henrys arm was the first to support her though she shuddered as he touched her calling for essences and lamenting that they had asked too much of her in begging her to sing what so reminded her of her home and parents  she hath been thus before it was that song said jean and the lady of glenuskie coming up at the same time confirmed the idea and declined all help except to take her back to the priory the litter that had brought the countess of salisbury was at the door and henry would not be denied the leading her to it she was recovering herself and could see the extreme sweetness and solicitude of his face and feel that she had never before leant on so kind and tender a supporting arm since she had sat on her fathers knee ah sir you mind me of my blessed father she said  your father was a holy man and died wellnigh a martyrs death said henry tis an honour i thank you for to even me to himsuch as i am  oh sir the saints guard you from such a fate she said trembling  was it so sad a fateto die for the good he could not work in his life said henry   they had reached the arch into the court  a crowd was round them and no more could be said henry kissed eleanors hand as he assisted her into the litter and she was shut in between the curtains alone for it only held one person there was a strange tumult of feeling she seemed lifted into a higher region as if she had been in contact with an angel of purity and yet there was that strange sense of awful fate all round as if henry were nearer being the martyr than the angel and was she to share that fate the generous young soul seemed to spring forward with the thought that come what might it would be hallowed and sweetened with such as he yet withal there was a sense of longing to protect and shield him  as usual she had soon quite recovered but jean pronounced it one of elleens megrimsas if she were a hielander to have second sight  but said the young lady it takes no second sight to spae ill to yonder king he is not one whose hand will keep his head and there are those who say that he had best look to his crown for he hath no more right thereto than i have to be queen of france  fie jean thats treason  im none of his nor ever will be i have too much spirit for a gudeman who cares for nothing but singing his psalter like a friar  jean was even more of that opinion when the next day at york house only edmund and jasper tudor appeared with their brothers excuses he had been obliged to give audience to a messenger from the emperor moreover added edmund disconsolately tomorrow he is going to st albans for a weeks penitence harry is always doing penance i cannot think what for he never eats marchpane in churchnor rolls balls there  i know said jasper sagely i heard the lord cardinal rating him for being false to his betrothedthats the lady margaret you know  ha said the duke of york before whom the two little boys were standing how was that my little man  hush jasper said edmund you do not know  but i do edmund i was in the window all the time harry said he did not know it he only meant all courtesy and then the lord cardinal asked him if he called it loyalty to his betrothed to be playing the fool with the scottish wench and then harry staredlike thee ned when thy bolt had hit the lady of suffolk and my lord went on to say that it was perilous to play the fool with a kings sister and his own niece then for all that harry is a king and a man grown he wept like owen only not loud and he went down on his knees and he cried mea peccata mea peccata mea infirmitas just as he taught me to do at confession and then he said he would do whatever the lord cardinal thought fit and go and do penance at st albans if he pleased and not see the lady that sings any more  and i say exclaimed edmund whats the good of being a king and a man if one is to be rated like a babe  so say i my little man returned the duke patting him on the head then adding to his own two boys take your cousins and play ball with them or spin tops or whatever may please them  there is the king we have quoth richard nevil to be at the beck of any misproud priest and bewail with tears a moments following of his own will like other men  most of the company felt such misplaced penitence and submission as they deemed it beneath contempt but while eleanor had pride enough to hold up her head so that no one might suppose her to be disappointed she felt a strange awe of the conscientiousness that repented when others would only have felt resentmentrelief perhaps at not again coming into contact with one so unlike other men as almost to alarm her  jean tossed up her head and declared that her brother knew better than to let any bishop put him into leadingstrings by and by there was a great outcry among the children and edmund tudor and edward of york were fighting like a pair of mastiffpuppies because edward had laughed at king harry for minding what an old shaveling said edward though the younger was much the stronger and was decidedly getting the best of it when he was dragged off and sent into seclusion with his tutor for misbehaviour to his guest  no one was amazed when the next day the cardinal arrived and told his grandnieces and the lady of glenuskie that he had arranged that they should go forward under the escort of the earl and countess of suffolk who were to start immediately for nanci there to espouse and bring home the kings bride the lady margaret there was reason to think that the french royal family would be present on the occasion as the queen of france was sister to king rene of sicily and jerusalem and thus the opportunity of joining their sister was not to be missed by the two scottish maidens the cardinal added that he had undertaken and made sir patrick drummond understand that he would be at all charges for his nieces and further said that merchants with womens gear would presently be sent in when they were to fit themselves out as befitted their rank for appearance at the wedding at a sign from him a large bag jingling heavily was laid on the table by a clerk in attendance there was nothing to be done but to make a low reverence and return thanks  jean had it in her to break out with ironical hopes that they would see something beyond the walls of a priory abroad and not be ordered off the moment any one cast eyes on them but my lord of winchester was not the man to be impertinent to especially when bringing gifts as a kindly uncle and when moreover king henry had the bad taste to be more occupied with her sister than with herself  it was eleanor who chiefly felt a sort of repugnance to being thus as it were bought off or compensated for being sent out of reach she could have found it in her heart to be offended at being thought likely to wish to steal the kings heart and yet flattered by being for the first time considered as dangerous even while her awe alike of henrys holiness and of those strange visions that had haunted her made her feel it a relief that her lot was not to be cast with him  the cardinal did not seem to wish to prolong the interview with his grandnieces having perhaps a certain consciousness of injury towards them and after assuring brilliant marriages for them and graciously blessing them he bade them farewell saying that the lady of suffolk would come and arrange with them for the journey no doubt though he might have been glad to place a niece on the throne it would have been fatal to the peace he so much desired for henry to break his pledges to so near a kinswoman of the king of france and when the bag was opened and the rouleaux of gold and silver crowns displayed his liberality contradicted the current stories of his avarice  and by and by arrived a succession of merchants bringing horned hoods transparent veils like wings supported on wire projections long trained dresses of silk and sendal costly stomachers bands of velvet buckles set with precious stones chains of gold and silverall the fashions in fact enough to turn the head of any young lady and in which the staid lady prioress seemed to take quite as much interest as if she had been to wear them herselfindeed she asked leave to send sister mabel to fetch a selection of the older nuns given to needlework and embroidery to enjoy the exhibition though it was to be carefully kept out of sight of the younger ones and especially of the novices  the excitement was enough to put the cardinals offences out of mind while the delightful fitting and trying on occupied the maidens who looked at themselves in the little handmirrors held up to them by the admiring nuns and demanded every ones opinion jean insisted that annis should have her share and eleanor joined in urging it when dame lilias shook her head and said that was not the use the lord cardinal intended for his gold  he gave it to us to do as we would with it argued eleanor  and she is our maiden and it befits us not that she should look like ane scrub added jean in the words used by her brothers descendant a century later  i thank you noble cousins replied annis with a little haughtiness but davie would never thole to see me pranking it out of english gold  she is right jeanie cried eleanor we will make her braw with what we bought at york with gude scottish gold  all the more just added jean that she helped us in our need with her ain  and we are sibnear cousins after a added eleanor so we may well give and take  so it was settled and all was amicable except that there was a slight contest between the sisters whether they should dress alike as eleanor wished while jean had eyes and instinct enough to see that the colours and forms that set her fair complexion and flaxen tresses off to perfection were damaging to elleens freckles and general auburn colouring hitherto the sisters had worn only what they could get happy if they could call it ornamental and the power of choice was a novelty to them at last the decision fell to the one who cared most about it namely jean elleen left her to settle for both being after the first dazzling display only eager to get back again to saint marie maudelin before the king should reclaim it  there was something in the legend wild and apocryphal as it is together with what she had seen of the king that left a deep impression upon her                and by these things ye understand maun                 the three best things which this mary chose               as outward penance and inward contemplation                 and upward bliss that never shall cease               of which god said withouten bees                 that the best part to her chose mary               which ever shall endure and never decrease                 but with her abideth eternally   stiff quaint and awkward sounds old bokenhams translation of the golden legend but to eleanor it had much power the whole history was new to her after her life in scotland where information had been slow to reach her and books had been few the gewgaws spread out before jean were to her like the gloves jewels and braiding of hair with which martha reproached her sister in the days of her vanity and the cloister with its calm services might well seem to her like the better part these nuns indeed did not strike her as models of devotion and there was something in the prioresss easy way of declaring that being safe there might prevent any need of special heed which rung false on her ear and then she thought of king henry whose rapt countenance had so much struck her turning aside from enjoyment to seclude himself at the first hint that his pleasure might be a temptation she recollected too what lady drummond had told her of father malcolm and mother clare and how each had renounced the world which had so much to offer them and chosen the better part she remembered father malcolms sweet smile and kind words and mother clares face had impressed her deeply with its lofty peace and sweetness how much better than all these agitations about princely bridegrooms and broken lances and queens of beauty seemed to fade into insignificance or to be only incidents in the tumult of secular life and worldly struggle and her spirit quailed at the anticipation of the journey she had once desired the gay court with its follies empty show temptations coarsenesses and cruelties and the strange land with its new language the alternative seemed to her from maudelin in her worldly days to maudelin at the saviours feet and had mother margaret stafford been one whit more the ideal nun perhaps every one would have been perplexed by a vehement request to seclude herself at once in the cloister of st helens  looking up she saw a figure slowly pacing the turf walk it was the mother clare who had come to see the lady of glenuskie but finding all so deeply engaged had gone out to await her in the garden  much indeed had dame lilias longed to join her friend and make the most of these precious hours but as pursebearer and adviser to her lady joanna it was impossible to leave her till the arrangements with the merchants were over and the nuns of st helens did not as has already been seen think much of an uncloistered sister in her twenty years toils among the poor it had been pretty well forgotten that mother clare was esclairmonde de luxembourg almost of princely rank so that no one took the trouble to entertain her and she had slipped out almost unperceived to the quiet garden with its grass walks and there eleanor came up to her and with glistening tears on a sudden impulse exclaimed oh holy mother keep me with you tell me to choose the better part  you lady what is this  not lady daughterhelp me i kenned it not beforebut all is vanity turmoil false show except the sitting at the lords feet  most true my child ah have i not felt the same but we must wait his time  it was iit was i continued eleanor who set jean upon this journey leaving my brother and mary and the bairns and the farther we go the more there is of vain show and plotting and scheming and i am weary and heartsick and homesick of it all and shall grow worse and worse oh shelter me here in your good and holy house dear reverend mother and maybe i could learn to do the holy work you do in my own country  how well esclairmonde knew it all and what aspirations had been hers she took elleens hand kindly and said dear maid i can only aid you by words i could not keep you here your uncle the cardinal would not suffer you to abide here nor can i take sisters save by consent of the queenand now we have no queen of the king and  oh no i could not ask that said eleanor a deep blush mounting as she remembered what construction might be put on her desire to remain in the kings neighbourhood ah then must i go ononon farther from home to that court which they say is full of sin and evil and vanity what will become of me  if the religious life be good for you trust me the way will open however unlikely it may seem if not heaven and the saints will show what your course should be  but can there be such safety and holiness save in that higher path demanded eleanor  nay look at your own kinswoman dame liliaslook at the lady of salisbury are not these godly faithful women serving god through their duty to manhusband children all around and are the longings and temptations to worldly thoughts and pleasures of the flesh so wholly put away in the cloister  not here began eleanor but mother clare hushed her  verily my child she added you must go on with your sister on this journey trusting to the care and guidance of so good a woman as my beloved old friend dame lilias and if you say your prayers with all your heart to be guarded from sin and temptation and led into the path that is fittest for you trust that our blessed master and our lady will lead you have you the pater noster in the vulgar tongue she added  wewe had it once ere my fathers death and father malcolm taught us but we have since been so cast about thatthati have forgotten  ah father malcolm taught you and esclairmonde took the girls hand you know how much i owe to father malcolm she softly added as she led the maiden to a carved rood at the end of the cloister and before it repeated the vernacular version of the lords prayer till eleanor knew it perfectly and promised to follow up her pater nosters with it  and from that time there certainly was a different tone and spirit in eleanor  david urged by his father who still publicly ignored the young douglas persuaded him to write to his father now that there could be no longer any danger of pursuit and the messenger sir patrick was sending to the king would afford the last opportunity george growled and groaned a good deal but perhaps father romuald pressed the duty on him in confession for in his great relief at his ladys going off unplighted from london he consented to indite in the chamber father romuald shared with two of the cardinals chaplains in a crooked and crabbed calligraphy and language much more resembling anglosaxon than modern english a letter to the most high and mighty the yerl of angus these presents  but when he was entreated to assume his right position in the troop he refused na na davie he said gin my father chooses to send me gear and following tis all very weel but tisna for the credit of scotland nor of angus that the master should be ganging about like a landlouper with a single laddie after himstill less that he should be beholden to the drummonds  ye would win to the speech of the lassie suggested david gin that be what ye want  na kenning me she willna look at me wait till i do that which may gar her look at me said the chivalrous youth  he was not entirely without means for the links of a gold chain which he had brought from home went a good way in exchange and though he had spoken of being at his own charges he had found himself compelled to live as one of the train of the princesses who were treated as the guests first of the duke of york then of the cardinal who had given sir patrick a sum sufficient to defray all possible expenses as far as bourges besides having arranged for those of the journey with suffolk whose rank had been raised to that of a marquis in honour of his activity as proxy for the king     chapter 6 the price of a goose             we would have all such offenders cut off and we give            express charge that in the marches through the country            there be nothing compelled from the villages                                                   king henry v   the marquis of suffolks was a slow progress both in england and abroad with many halts both on account of weather and of feasts and festivals cardinal beaufort had hurried the party away from london partly in order to make the match with margaret of anjou irrevocable partly for the sake of removing eleanor of scotland the only maiden who had ever produced the slightest impression on the monasticminded henry of windsor  when once out of london there were however numerous halts on the roadtwo or three days of entertainment at every castle and then a long delay at canterbury to give time for suffolks retainers and all the heralds pursuivants and other adjuncts of pomp and splendour to join them they were the guests of archbishop stafford one of the peace party and a friend of beaufort and suffolk so that their entertainment was costly and magnificent as befitted the mediaeval notions of a highborn gentleman primate of all england a great establishment for the chase was kept by almost all prelates as a necessity and whenever the weather was favourable hunting and hawking could be enjoyed by the princesses and their suite indeed jean if not in the saddle was pretty certain to be visiting the hawks all the morning or else playing at ball or some other sport with her cousins or some of the young gentlemen of suffolks train who were all devoted to her  lady drummond found that to try to win her to quieter occupations was in vain the girl would not even try to learn french from father romuald by reading though she would pick up words and phrases by laughing and chattering with the young knights who chanced to know the language but as by this time dame lilias had learnt that there were bounds that princely pride and instinct prevented from overpassing she contented herself with seeing that there was fit attendance either by her daughter annis sir patrick himself or one or other of lady suffolks ladies  to some degree eleanor shared in her sisters outdoor amusements but she was far more disposed to exercise her mind than her body after having pined in weariness for want of intellectual food her opportunities were delightful to her not only did she read with father romuald with intense interest the copy of the bon sire jean froissart in the original which he borrowed from the archbishops library but she listened with great zest to the readings which the lady of suffolk extracted from her chaplains and unwilling pages while the ladies sat at work for the marchioness a grandchild of geoffrey chaucer had a strong taste for literature moreover from one of the choir eleanor obtained lessons on the lute as well as her beloved harp and was taught to train her voice and sing from prickesong so that she much enjoyed this period of her journey  nothing could be more courteous and punctilious than the marquis of suffolk to the two princesses and indeed to every one of his own degree but there was something of the parvenu about him and unlike the duke of york or archbishop stafford who were free bright and goodnatured to the meanest persons he was haughty and harsh to every one below the line of gentle blood and in his own train he kept up a discipline not too strict in itself but galling in the manner in which it was enforced by those who imitated his example by the time the suite was collected christmas and the festival of st thomas a becket were so near that it would have been neglect of a popular saint to have left his shrine without keeping his day and after the epiphany though the party did reach dover in a days ride a stormy period set in putting crossing out of the question and detaining the suite within the massive walls of the castle  at last on a brisk windless day of frost the crossing to calais was effected and there was another week of festivals spread by the hospitality of the captain of calais where everything was as english as at dover when they again started on their journey suffolk severely insisted on the closest order riding as travellers in a hostile country where a misadventure might easily break the existing truce although the territories of the duke of burgundy through which their route chiefly lay were far less unfavourable to the english than actual french countries indeed the flemings were never willingly at war with the english and some of the burgundian nobles and knights had been on intimate terms with suffolk still he caused the heralds always to keep in advance and allowed no stragglers behind the rearguard that came behind the long train of waggons loaded with much kitchen apparatus and with splendid gifts for the bride and her family as well as equipments for the weddingparty and tents for such of the troop as could not find shelter in the hostels or monasteries where the slowlymoving party halted for the night it was unsafe to go on after the brief hours of daylight especially in the neighbourhood of the forest of ardennes for wolves might be near on the winter nights it was thus that the first trouble arose with sir patrick drummonds two volunteer followers ringan raefoot had become in his progress a very different looking being from the wild creature who had come with geordie of the red peel but there was the same heart in him he had endured obedience to the knight of glenuskie as a scot and with the duke of york and through england the discipline of the troop had not been severe but suffolk though a courtly chivalrous gentleman to his equals had not the qualities of popularity and chafed his inferiors  there were signs of confusion in the cavalcade as they passed between some of the fertile fields of namur and while suffolk was halting and about to send a squire to the rear to interfere a couple of his retainers hurried up saying my lord those scottish thieves will bring the whole country down on us if order be not taken with them  sir patrick did not need the end of the speech to gallop off at full speed to the rear of all the waggons where a crowd might be seen and there was a perfect babel of tongues rising in only too intelligible shouts of rage swords and lances were flashing on one side among the horsemen on the other stones were flying from an everincreasing number of leatherjerkined men and boys some of them with long knives axes and scythes  george douglass high head seemed to be the main object of attack and he had ringan raefoot before him across his horse apparently retreating while david malcolm and a few more made charges on the crowd to guard him when he was seen there was a cry of which he could distinguish nothing but ringan geordie gooseflemish hounds  riding between regardless of the stones he shouted in the burgundian french he had learnt in his campaigns to demand the cause of the attack the stones ceased and the head man of the village a stout peasant came forward and complained that the varlet as he called ringan had been stealing the village geese on their pond and when they were about to do justice on him yonder manatarms had burst in knocked down and hurt several and carried him off  before there had been time for further explanation to sir patricks great vexation the marshal of the troop and his guard came up and the complaint was repeated george at the same time having handed ringan over to some others of the scots rode up with his head very high  sir patrick drummond said the marshal stiffly you know my lords rules for his followers as to committing outrages on the villeins of the country  we are none of my lord of suffolks following began douglas but sir patrick determined to avoid a breach if possible said  sir marshal we have as yet heard but one side of the matter if wrong have been done to these folk we are ready to offer compensation but we should hear how it has been  am i to see my poor laddie torn to bits stoned and hanged by these savage loons cried george for a gooses egg and an old gander  of course his defence was incomprehensible to the flemings but on their side a man with a boundup head and another limping were produced and the head man spoke of more serious damage to others who could not appear demanding both the aggressors to be dealt with ie to be hanged on the next tree  these men are of mine master marshal said sir patrick  my lord can permit no violence by those under his banner said the marshal stiffly i must answer it to him  do so then said sir patrick this is a matter for him  the marshal who had much rather have disposed of the scottish thieves on his own responsibility was forced to give way so far as to let the appeal be carried to the marquis of suffolk telling the flemings in something as near their language as he could accomplish that his lord was sure to see justice done and that they should follow and make their complaint  suffolk sat on his horse tall upright and angry what is this i hear sir patrick drummond said he that your miscreants of wild scots have been thieving from the peaceful peasantfolk and then beating them and murdering them i deemed you were a better man than to stand by such deeds and not give up the fellows to justice  it were shame to hang a man for one goose said sir patrick  all plunder is worthy of death returned the englishman your border law may be otherwise but tis not our english rule of honest men  and heres this other great lurdane knave been striking the poor rogues down right and left a halter fits both  my lord they are no subjects of england i deny your rights over them  whoever rides in my train is under me i would have you to know sir  hark ye my lord of suffolk said sir patrick coming near enough to speak in an undertone that lurdane as you call him is heir of a noble house in scotland come here on a young mans freak of chivalry you will do no service to the peace of the realms if you give him up to these churls for making in to save his servant  before sir patrick had done speaking while suffolk was frowning grimly in perplexity a wild figure with blood on the face rushed forth with a limping run crying let the loons hang me and welcome if they set such store by their lean old gander but they shanna lay a finger on the master  and he had nearly precipitated himself into the hands of the sturdy rustics who shouted with exultation but with two strides geordie caught him up peace ringan they shall no more hang thee than me and he stood with one hand on ringans shoulder and his sword in the other looking defiant  if he be a young gentleman masking i am not bound to know it said suffolk impatiently to drummond but if he will give up that rascal and make compensation i will overlook it  who touches my fellow does so at his peril shouted george menacing with his sword  peace young man said sir patrick look here my lord of suffolk we scots are none of your men we need no favour of you english with our allies there be enough of us to make our way through these peasants to the french border so unless you let us settle the matter with a few crowns to these rascallions we part company  the ladies were entrusted to my charge began lord suffolk  at that instant however both jean and eleanor came on the scene riding fast having in truth been summoned by malcolm who shrewdly suspected that thus an outbreak might be best averted  it was eleanor who spoke first in spite of all her shyness when her blood was up she was all the princess  what is this my lord of suffolk she said if one of our following have transgressed it is the part of ourselves and of sir patrick drummond to see to it as representing the king my brother  lady replied suffolk bowing low and doffing his cap yonder illnurtured knave hath been robbing the countryfolk and thethe manatarms there not only refuses to give him up to justice but has hurt wellnigh slain some of them in violently taking him from them they ride in my train and i am responsible  jean broke in he only served the cowardly loons right a whole crowd of the rogues to hang one poor laddie for one goose shame on a gentleman for hearkening to the foulmouthed villains one moment come here ringan king jamies sister will never see them harm thee  perhaps suffolk was not sorry to see a way out of the perplexity far be it from a knight to refuse a boon to a fair lady in her selle farther still to two royal damsels the lives are granted so satisfaction in coin be made to yon clamorous hinds  i do not call it a boon but a right said eleanor gravely nevertheless i thank you my lord marquis  george would have thrown himself at their feet but jean coldly said spare thanks sir it was for my brothers right and she turned her horse away and rode off at speed while eleanor could not help pausing to say she is more blithe than she lists to own sir patrick what the fellows claim must come from my uncles travelling purse  georges face was red this was very bitter to him but he could only say it shall be repaid so soon as i have the power  the peasants meanwhile were trying to make the best bargain they could by representing that they were tenants of an abbey so that the death of the gander was sacrilegious on that account as well as because it was in lent to this however sir patrick turned a deaf ear he threw them a couple of gold pieces with which as he told them they were much better off than with either the live goose or the dead ringan  suffolk had halted for the midday rest and was waiting for him till this matter was disposed of sir patrick drummond he said with some ceremony this company of yours may be scottish subjects but while they are riding with me i am answerable for them it may be the wont in scotland but it is not with us english to let unnamed adventurers ride under our banner  the young man is not unnamed said sir patrick on his mettle  you know him  ill no say but i have an inkling my son david kennd him and answered for him when he joined himself to my following nor has he hitherto done aught to discredit himself  what is his name or the name he goes by  george douglas  hm your scottish names may belong to any one from your earls down to your herdboys and they forsooth are as like as not to call themselves gentlemen  and wherefore not if theirs is gentle blood said sir patrick  nay now sir patrick stand not on your scotch pride gentlemen all if you will but you gave me to understand that this was none of your barefoot gentlemen and i ask if you can tell who he truly is  i have never been told my lord and i had rather you put the question to himself than to me  call him then an so please you  sir patrick saw no alternative save compliance and he found ringan undergoing a severe rating not unaccompanied by blows from the wood of his masters lance the perfect willingness to die for one another was a mere natural incident but the having transgressed and caused such a serious scrape made george very indignant and inflict condign punishment better fed than he had ever been in his life the rogue and he looked it though he muttered a bannock and a sup of barley brose were worth the haill of their greasy beeves better fed than ever before couldnt the daft loon keep the hands of him off poor folks bit goose in lent too by far the gravest part of the offence  george did however transfer ringans explanation to sir patrick and make some apology a nest of goose eggs apparently unowned had been too much for him incited further by a couple of english horseboys who were willing to share goose eggs for supper and let the scotsman bear the wyte of it the goose had been nearer than expected and summoned her kin the gander had shown fight the geese had gabbled the gooseherd and his kind came to the rescue the horseboys had made off ringan impeded by his struggle with the ferocious gander was caught and geordie had come up just in time to see him pricked with goads and axes to a tree where a halter was making ready for him of course without asking questions george hurried to save him pushing his horse among the angry crew and striking right and left and equally of course the other scots came to his assistance  sir patrick agreed that he could not have done otherwise though better things might have been hoped of ringan by this time  but said he theres not an end yet of the coil here has my lord of suffolk been speiring after your name and quality till i told him he must ask at you and not at me  telld you the dour meddling englishman my name asked george  i told him only what ye told me yerself in that there was no lie but bethink you royal maidens dinna come to speak for lads without a cause  georges colour mounted high in his sunburnt freckled cheek  kensken they trow ye sir pate  cannie folk even lassies can ken mair than they always tell said the knight of glenuskie yonder is my lord marquis as they ca him so bethink you weel how you comport yerself with him and my counsel is to tell him the full truth he is a dour man towards underlings whom he views as made not of the same flesh and blood with himself but he is the very pink of courtesy to men of his own degree  set him up quoth the heir of the douglas with a snort his own degree indeed scarce even a knights son  what he deems his own degree then corrected sir patrick but he holds himself full of chivalry to them and loves a spice of the errant knight ye may trust his honour and mind ye he added laughing ive never been told your name and quality  which the master of angus returned with an equally canny laugh the young man as he approached the marquis drew his head up straightened his tall form brushed off the dust that obscured the bloody heart on his breast and altogether advanced with a step and bearing far more like the great earls son than the manatarms of the glenuskie following his eyes bespoke equality or more as they met those of william de la pole and yet there was that in the glance which forbade the idea of insolence so that suffolk instead of remaining seated rose to meet him and took him aside standing as they talked  sir squire he said for such i understand your degree in chivalry to be  i have not won my spurs said george  it is not our rule to take to foreign courts gentlemen from another realm unknown to us proceeded suffolk with much civility therefore unless any vow of chivalry binds you i should be glad to know who it is who does my banner the honour of riding in its company for a time if a secret it is safe with me  george gave his name  that is the name of one of the chief nobles in scotland said suffolk do i see before me his son george bowed  then my lord douglas am i permitted to ask wherefore this mean disguise is it for some vow of chivalry or for that which is the guerdon of chivalry the marquis added in a lower softer tone which however extremely chafed the proud young scot all the more that he felt himself blushing  my lord he said i am not bound to render a reason to any save my father from whom i hope for letters shortly  to his further provocation suffolk smiled meaningly and answered  i understand but if my lord douglas would honour my suite by assuming the place that befits him i should be happy that aught of mine should serve  i am beholden to you my lord for the offer replied george somewhat roughly whatever i make use of must be my fathers or my own all i crave of you is to keep my secret and not make me the common talk have i your licence to depart  wherewith tall irate and shamefaced the master of angus stalked away to meet david drummond to whom he confided his disgusts  the parlous fulebody as though i were like to make myself a mere sport for balladmongers such as lady elleen is always mooning after or as if i would stoop to borrow a following of the english blackguard to bolster up my state like king herod in a mystery play if my father lists he may send me out a band but the douglas shall have douglass men or none at all  david approved the sentiment but added  ye could win to jeanie if ye took your right place  what good would that do me while she is full of her fine daffing singing clacking english knights that would only gibe at the redhaired scot let her wait to see what the red douglass hand can do in time of need but davie you that can speak to her let her know how deeply i thank her for what she did even now on my behalf or rather on puir ringans and that i am trebly bound to her service though i make no minstrel fules work  david delivered his message but did not obtain much by it for his friends satisfaction for jeanie only tossed her head and answered  does the gallant cock up his bonnet because he thinks it was for his sake it was elleens doing there firstly and next wadna we have done the like for the meanest of jamies subjects  dinna credit her davie said eleanor ye should have seen her start in her saddle and wheel round her palfrey at malcolms first word  it wasna for him replied jean hotly they dinna hang the like of him for twisting a gooses neck it was for the puir leal laddie and ye may tak that to him  shall i elleen asked david with a twinkle in his eye of cousinly teasing  an ye do not i shall proclaim ye in the lists at nanci as a corbie messenger and mansworn squire unworthy of your spurs threatened jeanie in all good humour however  suffolk baffled in his desire to patronise the young master of angus examined both sir patrick and lady drummond as far as their caution would allow telling that the youth had confessed his rank and admitted the causemaking inquiry whether the match would be held suitable in scotland and why it had not taken place therea matter difficult to explain since it did not merely turn upon the young ladys ambitionwhich would have gone for nothingbut on the danger to the crown of offending rival houses suffolk had a good deal about him of the flashy side of chivalry and loved its brilliance and romance he was an honourable man and the weak point about him was that he never understood that knighthood should respect men of meaner birth he was greatly flattered by the idea of having the eldest son of the great earl of angus riding as an unknown manatarms in his troop and on the way likewise to the most chivalrous of kings his scheme would have been to equip the youth fully with horse and arms and at some brilliant tourney see him carry all before him like du gueselin in his boyhood and that the eclat of the affair should reflect itself upon his sponsor but there were two difficulties in the waythe first that the proud young scot showed no intention of being beholden to any englishman and secondly that the tall ungainly youth did not look as if he had attained to the full strength or management of his own limbs and though in five or ten years time he might be a giant in actual warfare he did not appear at all likely to be a match for the highlytrained champions of the tiltyard moreover he was not a knight as yet and on sounding sir patrick it was elicited that he was likely to deem it high treason to be dubbed by any hand save that of his king or his father  so the marquis could only feel sagacious and utter a hint or two before the ladies which fell the more short since he was persuaded by eleanors having been the foremost in the defence that she was the object of the quest and he now and then treated her to hints which she was slow to understand but which exasperated while they amused her sister  the journey was so slow that it was not until the fourth week in lent that they were fairly in lorraine it had of course been announced by couriers and at thionville a very splendid herald reached them covered all over with the blazonry of jerusalem and the two sicilies to say nothing of provence and anjou he brought letters from king rene explaining that he and his daughters were en route from provence and he therefore designated a nunnery where he requested that the scottish princesses and their ladies would deign to be entertained and a monastery where my lord marquis of suffolk and his suite would be welcomed and where they were requested to remain till easter week by which time the king of france the dauphin and dauphiness would be near at hand and there could be a grand entrance into nanci of course there was nothing to be done but to obey though the englishmen muttered that the delay was in order to cast the expense upon the rich abbeys and to muster all the resources of lorraine and provence to cover the poverty of the manytitled king  the abbey where the gentlemen were lodged was so near nanci that it was easy to ride into the city and make inquiries whether any tidings had arrived from scotland but nothing had come from thence for either the princesses sir patrick or geordie of the red peel so that the strange situation of the latter must needs continue as long as he insisted on being beholden for nothing to the english upstart as he scrupled not to call lord suffolk whose newfashioned french title was an offence in scottish ears  the ladies on their side had not the relaxation of these expeditions the abbey was a large and wealthy one but decidedly provincial only the lady abbess and one sister could speak french of paris the others used a dialect so nearly german that lady suffolk could barely understand them and the other ladies whose french was not strong could hold no conversation with them  to insular minds whether scottish or english every deviation of the gallican ritual from their own was a sore vexation if lady drummond had devotion enough not to be distracted by the variations the young ladies certainly had not and jean very decidedly giggled during some of the most solemn ceremonies such as the creeping to the crossthe large carved cross in the middle of the graveyard to which all in turn went upon their knees on good friday and kissed it  last year at this season they had been shut up in their prisoncastle and had not shared in any of these ceremonies and eleanor tried to think of king henry and sister esclairmonde and how they were throwing their hearts into the great thoughts of the day and she felt distressed at being infected by jeans suppressed laughter at the movements of the fat abbess and at the extraordinary noises made by the younger nuns with clappers as demonstrations against judas on the way to the easter sepulchre  she was so much shocked at herself that she wanted to confess but father romuald had gone with the male members of the party and the chaplain did not half understand her french though he gave her absolution  meantime all the nuns were preparing easter eggs whereof there was a great exchange the next day when the mass was as splendid as the resources of the abbey could furnish and all were full of joy and congratulation the sense of oneness for once inspiring all  moreover after mass sir patrick and an englishman rode over with tidings that king rene had sent a messenger who was on the tuesday to guide them all to a glade where the king hoped to welcome the ladies as befitted their rank and beauty and likewise to meet the royal travellers from bourges so that all might make their entry into nanci together  the king himself it was reported did nothing but ride backwards and forwards between nanci and the convent where he had halted arranging the details of the procession and of the openair feast at the rendezvous upon the way  i hope said lady suffolk that king renes confections will not be as full of rancid oil as those of the good sisters i know not which was more distastefultheir lenten fast or their easter feast we have certes done our penance this lent  to which the rest of the ladies could not but agree though lady drummond felt it somewhat treasonable to the good nuns their entertainers and both she and eleanor recollected how differently esclairmonde would have felt the matter and how little these matters of daily fare would have concerned her  today we shall see her exclaimed eleanor springing to the floor as early on a fine spring morning the ladies in the guestchamber of the nunnery began to bestir themselves at the sound of one of the many convent bells they are at toul and we shall meet this afternoon i have not slept all night for thinking of it  no and hardly let me sleep said jean slowly sitting up in bed thou hast waked me so often that i shall be pale and heavyeyed for the pageant  little fear of that my bonnie bell said old christie laughing  besides said eleanor nobody will fash themselves to look at us in the midst of the pageant there will be the king to see and the bride oh i wish we were not to ride in it and could see it instead at our ease  thou wast never meant for a princess said jean christie annis for pitys sake see till her she is busking up her hair just as was gude enough for the old nuns but no for kings and queens  i hate the horned cap in which i feel like a cow and methought meg wad feel the snood a sight for sair een said eleanor  meg indeed thou must frame thy tongue to madame la dauphine  before the lave of them but not with sweet meg herself  our sister behoves to have learnt what suits her station and winna bide sic ways from an ower forward sister dinna put us all to shame and make the folk trow we came from some selvage land said jean tossing her head  hast ever seen me carry myself unworthy of king jamess daughter proudly demanded eleanor  nay now bairnies fash not yoursells that gate interfered old christie nae fear but lady elleen will be douce and canny enow when folks are there to see she kens what fits a kings daughter  jean made a little hesitation over kirtles and hoods but fortunately ladies however royal had no objection to wearing the same robes twice and both she and her sister were objects to delight the eyes of the crowding and admiring nuns when they mounted their palfreys in the quadrangle and attended by the lady of glenuskie and her daughter rode forth with the marchioness of suffolk at the great gateway to join the cavalcade headed by suffolk and sir patrick  after about two miles riding on a woodland road they became aware of fitful strains of music and a continuous hum of voices heard through the trees and presently a really beautiful scene opened before them as the trees seemed to retreat so as to unfold a wide level space further enclosed by brilliant tapestry hangings their scarlet blue gold and silver hues glittering in an april sun and the fastenings concealed by garlands of spring flowers an awning of rich gold embroidery on a green ground was spread so as to shelter a cloth glittering with plate and bestrewn with flowers horses in all varieties of ornamental housings were being led about there was a semicircle of musicians in the rear and as soon as the guests came in sight there came forward doffing his embroidered and jewelled cap a gentleman of middle stature and of exceeding grace and courtesy whose demeanour no less than the attendance around him left no doubt that this was no other than rene duke of anjou and of lorraine count of provence and king of the two sicilies and of jerusalem  welcome he exclaimed in french welcome fair and royal maidens welcome noble lord the representative of our dear brother and son of england deign on your journey to partake of the humble and rural fare of the poor minstrel shepherd  wherewith the music broke out in strains of welcome from the grove with voices betweenwhiles rene himself assisted each princess to dismount and respectfully kissed her on the cheek as she stood on the ground then taking a hand of each he led them to a great chestnut tree the shade of whose branches was assisted by hangings of blue embroidered with white beneath which cushions mantles and seats were spread and a bevy of ladies in bright garments stood from these came forward two beautiful young girls with fair complexions and flowing golden hair scarcely confined by the bands whence transparent veils descended king rene presented them as his two daughters yolande and margaret to the two scottish maidens and there were kindly as well as courtly embraces on either side the lady of glenuskie as a kings granddaughter with annis and lady suffolk had likewise been led up to take their places the four royal maidens were seated together yolande the most regularly beautiful but with an anxious look on her face talked to eleanor of her journey margaret who had one of those very simple innocentlooking childfaces that sometimes form the mask of immense energy of character was more absent and inattentive to her duties as hostess moreover she and jean did not understand one anothers language so well as did the other two delicate little cakes and tall venice glasses spirally ornamented and containing light wines were served to them on the knee by a tall large fairhaired youth who was named to them as the duke sigismund of alsace and the tyrol  jean had time to look about and heartily wish that her beautiful flaxen hair was loose and not encumbered with the rolled headgear with two projecting horns against which elleen had rebelled since york and even london were evidently behind the fashion margarets hair was bound with a broad band of daisies and yolandes with violets both in allusion to their names yolande being the french corruption of violante her provencal name in allusion to the golden violet jean thought of the scottish thistle and studied the dresses tightfitting cotte hardis of bright deep soft rose colour edged with white fur and white skirts embroidered with their appropriate flowers she wondered how soon this could be imitated casting a few glances at duke sigismund who stood waiting as if desirous of attracting yolandes attention eleanor on the other hand even while answering yolande had a feeling as if she had arrived at the completion of the very vision which she had imagined on the dreary tower of dunbar here was the warm spring sun shining on a scene of unequalled beauty and brilliancy set in the spring foliage and blossom whence as if to rival the human performers gushes of nightingales song came in every interval hearing eleanors eager question whether that were the nightingale whose liquid trillings she heard king rene realised that the scottish maidens knew not the note and signed to the minstrels to cease for a time then came and sat on a cushion beside the young lady and enjoyed her admiration  ah she said that is the king of the minstrel birds  he smiled the royal lady then has her orders and ranks for the birds  oh yes if the royal eagle is the king and the falcon is the true knight the nightingale and mavis merle and lark are the minstrels and the lovely seagull oh how call you itwith the long white floating wings rising and falling is the graceful dancer  guifette rene gave the word or in provence rondinel della marhirondelle de la mer  swallow ah the pilgrim birds who visit the holy land  lady you should be of our court of the troubadours said rene your words should be a poem  he was called away at the moment and craved her licence so politely that the chivalrous minstrel king seemed to elleen all she had dreamt of the whole was perfect nothing wanting save that for which her heart was all the time beating high the presence of her beloved sister margaret it was as if a scene out of a romance of fairyland had suddenly taken reality and she more than once closed her eyes and squeezed her hands to try whether she was awake  a fanfaron of trumpets came on the wind and all were on the alert while eleanors heart throbbed so that she could hardly stand and caught at margarets arm as she murmured with a gasp my sister my sister  ah you are happy to meet once more said margaret the saints only know whether yolande and i shall ever see one anothers faces again when once i am carried away to your dreary england  england is not mine lady said eleanor rather sharply we reckon the english as our bitterest foes  you have come with an englishman though said margaret whom i am to take for my husband and she laughed a gay innocent laugh a grizzled old knight whom i am not like to mistake for my true spouse  have you seen him  what like is he  the gentlest and sweetest of kings returned eleanor as fond of all that is good and fair and holy as is your own royal father  margaret coughed a little my husband should be a gallant warlike knight she said such as was this kings father  oh see cried eleanor i saw the glitter of the spears through the trees theres another blast of the trumpets oh oh it is a gallant sight if only jamie my little brother could see it it stirs ones blood  ah yes elleen cried jean this is something to have come for  and margaret sweet madge repeated eleanor to herself in her native scotch while king renes trumpets harps and hautbois burst forth with an answering peal so exciting her that her yellowbrown eyes sparkled and the colour rose in her cheeks giving her a strange beauty full of eager spirit duke sigismund turned and gazed at her in surprise and an old herald who was waiting near observed is that the daughter of the captive king of scotland she has his very countenance and bearing  the trumpeters and other attendants bearing the bluelilied banner of france appeared among the trees and dividing formed a lane for the advance of the royal personages king rene went forward to meet them foremost so as to be ready to hold the stirrup for his sister the queen of france duke sigismund seemed about to give his hand to the infanta violante as the provencaux called yolande but she was beforehand with him linking her arm into jeans while margaret took eleanors and said in her ear the great awkward german he is come here to pay his court to yolande but she will none of him she has better hopes  eleanor hardly attended for her whole soul was bent on the party arriving king charles riding on a handsome bay horse closely followed by a conveyance such as was called in england a whirlicote from which the queen was handed out by her brother and then on a sorrel palfrey in a blue goldembroidered ridingsuitcould that be margaret of scotland the long reddishyellow hair and the tall figure had a familiar look king rene was telling her something as he helped her to alight and with one spring regardless of all and of all ceremony she sprang forward my wee jeanie my elleen my titties mine ain wee things she cried in her native tongue as she embraced them by turns as if she would have devoured them with a gush of tears  though these were times of great state and ceremony yet they were also very demonstrative times when tears and embracings were expected of near kindred and indeed the king and queen were equally occupied with their brother and nieces but presently eleanor heard a low voice observe with a sort of sarcastic twang if madame has sufficiently satiated her tenderness perhaps she will remember the due of others margaret started as if stung and eleanor looking up beheld a face young but sharp and with a keen hard set look in the narrow eyes contracted brow and thin lips that made her feel as though the serpent had found his way into her paradise hastily turning margaret presented her sisters to her husband who bowed and kissed each with those strange thin lips that again made eleanor shudder perhaps because of his compliment we are graced by these ladies in whom we have another madame la dauphine as well as an errant beauty  jean appropriated the last words but elleen felt sure that the earlier ones were ironical both to her and to the dauphiness on whose cheeks they brought a flush the two kings however turned to receive the sisters and nothing could be kinder than the tone of king charles and queen marie towards the sisters of their good daughter as they termed the dauphiness who on her side was welcomed by rene as the sweet niece sharer of his tastes who brought minstrelsy and poetry in her train  trust her for that my fair uncle said her husband in a cold dry tone  all the royal personages sat down on the cushions spread on the grass to the rural fare as king rene called it which he had elaborately prepared for them while the music sounded from the trees in welcome  all was as the kind prince announced without ceremony and he placed lord suffolk as the representative of henry vi next to the young infanta margaret and contrived that the dauphiness should sit between her two sisters whose hands she clasped from time to time within her own in an ecstasy of delight while inquiries came from time to time low breathed in her native tongue for wee mary and jamie and baby annaple the very sound of your tongues is music to my lugs she said and how much mair when ye speak mine ain bonnie scotch sic as i never hear save by times when one archer calls to another jeanie you favour our mother tis gude for ye i am blithe one of ye is na like puir marget  dinna say that cried jean in an access of feeling tis hame and its hame to see sic a sonsie scots faceand it minds me of my blessed father  it was true that margaret and eleanor both were thorough scotswomen and with the expressive features the auburn colouring and tall figures of their father but there was for the rest a melancholy contrast between them for while elleen had the eager hopeful lively healthfulness of early youth giving a glow to her countenance and animation to the lithe but scarcelyformed figure margaret with the same original mould had the pallor and puffiness of illhealth in her complexion and a largeness of growth more unsatisfactory than leanness and though her face was lighted up and her eyes sparkled with the joy of meeting her sisters there were lines about the brow and round the mouth ill suited to her age which was little over twenty years     chapter 7 the minstrel kings court        where throngs of knights and barons bold       in weeds of peace high triumphs hold       with store of ladies whose bright eyes       rain influence and judge the prize       of wit or arms while both contend       to win her grace whom all commendlallegro   the whole of the two courts had to be received in the capital of lorraine in full state under the beautiful old gateway but as mediaeval pageants are wearisome matters this may be passed over though it was exceptionally beautiful and poetic owing to the influence of king renes taste and it perfectly dazzled the two scottish princessesthough to tell the truth they were somewhat disappointed in the personal appearance of their entertainers who did not come up to their notion of royalty their father had been a stately and magnificent man their mother a beautiful woman henry vi was a tall wellmade handsome man with plantagenet fairness and regularity of feature and a sweetness all his own but both these kings were like all the house of valois small men with insignificant features and sallow complexions rene indeed had a distinction about him that compensated for want of beauty and charles had a goodnatured easy indolent look and gracious smile that gave him an undefinable air of royalty renes daughters were both very lovely but their beauty came from the other side of the house with the blood of charles the great through their mother the heiress of lorraine  there was a curious contrast between the brothersinlaw charles when dismounting at the castle gate not disguising his weariness and relief that it was over and rene eager and anxious desirous of making all his bewildering multitude of guests as happy as possible while the dauphin louis stood by half interested and amused half mocking he was really fond of his uncle though in a contemptuous superior sort of manner despising his religious and honourable scruples as mere simplicity of mind  rene of anjou has been hardly dealt with as is often the case with princes upright religious and chivalrous beyond the average of their time yet without the strength or the genius to enforce their rights and opinions and therefore thrust aside after his early unsuccessful wars his lands of provence and lorraine were islands of peace prosperity and progress and withal he was an extremely able artist musician and poet striving to revive the old troubadour spirit of provence and everywhere casting about him an atmosphere of refinement and kindliness  the hall of his hotel at nanci was a beautiful place with all the gorgeous grace of the fifteenth century and here his guests assembled for supper soon after their arrival all being placed as much as possible according to rank eleanor found herself between a deaf old church dignitary and duke sigismund on whose other side was yolande the infanta as the provencals called the daughter of rene while jean found the dauphin on one side of her and a great french duke on the other louis amused himself with compliments and questions that sometimes nettled her sometimes pleased her giving her a sense that he might admire her beauty but was playing on her simplicity and trying to make her betray the destitution of her home and her purpose in coming  eleanor on the other hand found her cavalier more simple than herself in fact he properly belonged to the infanta but she paid no attention to him nor did the bishop try to speak to the scottish princess sigismunds french was very lame and eleanors not perfect but she had a natural turn for languages and had in the convent picked up some german which in those days had many likenesses to her own broad scotch they made one another out between the two languages with signs smiles and laughter and whereas the subtilties along the table represented the entire story of sir gawain and his loathly lady she contrived to explain the story to him greatly to his edification and they went on to king arthur and he did his best to narrate the german reading of sir parzival the difficulties engrossed them till the rosewater was brought in silver bowls to wash their fingers on which sigismund after observing and imitating the two ladies remarked that they had no such schwarmerci in deutschland and yolande looked as if she could well believe it while elleen though ignorant of the meaning of his word laughed and said they had as little in scotland  there was still an hour of daylight to come and moonrise would not be far off so that the hosts proposed to adjourn to the garden where fresh music awaited them  king rene was an ardent gardener his love of flowers was viewed as one of his weaknesses only worthy of an old abbot but he went his own way and the space within the walls of his castle at nanci was lovely with bright spring flowers blossoming trees and green walks where as lady suffolk said her grandfather could have mused all day and all night long to the sound of the nightingales  but what the sisters valued it for was that they could ramble away together to a stone bench under the wall and there sit at perfect ease together and pour out their hearts to one another margaret indeed touched them as they leant against her as if to convince herself of their reality and yet she said that they knew not what they did when they put the sea between themselves and scotland nor how sick the heart could be for its bonnie hills  o gin i could see a mountain top again i feel as though i could lay me down and die content what garred ye come daundering to these weary flats of france  ah sister scotland is not what you mind it when our blessed father lived  and they told her how their lives had been spent in being hurried from one prisoncastle to another  prisoncastles be not wanting here replied margaret with a sigh then as elleen held up a hand in delight at the thrill of a neighbouring nightingale she cried what is yon singsong seesaw gurgling bird to our own bonnie laverock soaring away to the sky without making such a wark of tuning his pipes and never thinking himself too dainty and tender for a wholesome frost or two so jamie sent you off to seek for husbands here did he couldna ye put up with a leal scot like glenuskie there  there were too many of them said jean  and not ower leal either said eleanor  lealty is a rare plant ony gate sighed margaret and where sae little is recked of our scots royalty mayhap yell find that tocherless lasses be less sought for than at hame didna i see thee elleen clavering with that muckle archduke that nane can talk with  ay said eleanor  he is come here acourting madame yolande with his fathers goodwill for alsace and tyrol be his mountains that might be in our ain hielands they tell me  methougnt said eleanor she scunnered from him as jeanie does atshall i say whom  and reason gude said margaret she has a joe of her ain count ferry de vaudemont that is the heir male of the line and a gallant laddie at the great joust the morn methinks yell see what may well be sung by minstrels and can scarce fail to touch the heart of a true troubadour as is my good uncle rene  margaret became quite animated and her sisters pressed her to tell them if she knew of any secret but she playfully shook her head and said that if she did know she would not mar the romaunt that was to be played out before them  nay said eleanor we have a romaunt of our own may i tell jeanie  who recks replied jean with a little toss of her head  thus eleanor proceeded to tell her sister whatsince the adventure of the goosehad gone far beyond a guess as to the tall redhaired young manatarms who had ridden close behind david drummond  douglas douglas tender and true exclaimed margaret he loves you so as to follow for weeks nay months in this guise without word or look oh jeanie jeanie happy lassie did ye but ken it nay put not on that scornful mou it sorts you not weel my bairn he is of degree befitting a stewart and even were he not oh sisters sisters better to wed with a leal loving soul in ane high peeltower than to bear a broken heart to a throne and she fell into a convulsive fit of choked and bitter weeping which terrified her sisters  at the sound of a lute apparently being brought nearer accompanied with footsteps she hastily recovered herself and rose to her feet while a smile broke out over her face as the musician a slender graceful figure appeared on the path in the moonlight  answering the nightingales maitre alain she said  this is the court of nightingales madame he replied it is presumption to endeavour to rival them even though the heart be torn like that of philomel wherewith he touched his lute and began to sing from his famous idyll                 ainsi mon coeur se guermentait                de la grande douleur quil portait                  en ce plaisant lieu solitaire                ou un doux ventelet venait                si seri quon le sentait                  lorsque la violette mieux flaire   again as eleanor heard the sweet strains and saw the long shadows of the trees and the light of the rising moon it was like the attainment of her dreamland and margaret proceeded to make known to her sisters maitre alain chartier the prince of song adding thou too wast a songster sister elleen even while almost a babe dost sing as of old  i have brought my fathers harp said eleanor  ah i must hear it she cried with effusion the harp it will be his voice again  madame madame madame la dauphine out here ever reckless of deway and of waur than dew  these last words were added in scotch as a tall darkcloaked figure appeared on the scene from between the trees margaret laughed with a little annoyance in her tone as she said ever my shadow good madame ever wearying yourself with care  here sisters here is my trusty and wellbeloved dame de ste petronelle who takes such care of me that she dogs my footsteps like a messan  and reason gude replied the lady here is the muckle hall all alight and this king rene as they call him twanging on his lute and but that the seigneur dauphin is talking to the english lord on some question of gascon boundaries we should have him speiring for you i saw the eye of him roaming after you as it was  his eye seeking me cried margaret springing up from her languid attitude with a tone like exultation in her voice such as evoked a low sigh from the old dame as all began to move towards the castle she was the widow of a scotch adventurer who had won lands and honours in france and she was now attached to the service of the dauphiness not as her chief ladythat post was held by an old french countessbut still close enough to her to act as her guardian and monitor whenever it was possible to deal with her  the old lady in great delight at meeting a compatriot poured out her confidences to dame lilias of glenuskie infinitely grieved and annoyed was she when early as were the ordinary hours of the court of nanci it proved that the dauphiness had called up her sisters an hour before and taken them across the chace which surrounded the castle to hear mass at a convent of benedictine nuns  it was perfectly safe though only a tirewoman and a page followed the dauphiness and only annis attended her two sisters for the grounds were enclosed and king renes domains were far better ruled and more peaceful than those of the princes who despised him it was an exquisite spring morning with grass silvery with dew and enamelled with flowers birds singing ecstatically on every branch squirrels here and there racing up a trunk margaret was in joyous spirits and almost danced between her sisters eleanor was amazed at the luxuriant beauty of the scene and could not admire enough jean though at first a little cross at the early summons could not but be infected with their delight and the three laughed and frolicked together with almost childish glee in the delight of their content  the great gentleeyed longhorned kine were being driven in at the conventyard to be milked by the laysisters at another entrance peasants beggars and sick were congregating the bell from the laceworks spire rang out and the dauphiness led the way to the gateway where at her knock on the ironstudded door a laysister looked through the wicket  good sister here are some early pilgrims to the shrine of st scolastique she began  to the other gate said the portress hastily margarets face twinkled with fun i wad fain take a turn with the beggar crew she said to her sisters in scotch but it might cause too great an outcry if i were kenned commend me to the mere st antoine she added in french and tell her that the dauphiness would fain hear mass with her  the portress cast an anxious doubtful glance but being apparently convinced cried out for pardon while hastily unlocking her door and sending a message to the abbess  as they entered the cloistered quadrangle the nuns in black procession were on their way to mass but turned aside to receive their visitors margaret knelt for a moment for the blessing and kiss of the abbess then greeted the nun whom she had mentioned but begged for no further ceremony and then was led into church  it was a brief festival mass and was not really over before she with a restlessness of which her sisters began to be conscious began to rise and make her way out a nun followed and entreated her to stay and break her fast but she would accept nothing save a draught of milk swallowed hastily and with signs of impatience as her sisters took their turn  she walked quickly rather as one guilty of an escapade again surprising her sisters who fancied the liberty of a married princess illimitable  jean even ventured to ask her why she went so fast would the king of france be displeased  he poor gude sire charles he heeds not what one does good or bad no not the murdering of his minion before his eyes said margaret half laughing  thy husband would he be angered pressed on jean  my husband oh no it is not in the depth and greatness of is thoughts to find fault with his poor worm said margaret a strange look half of exultation half of pain on her face ah jeanie woman none kens in sooth how great and wise my dauphin is nor how far he sees beyond all around him so that he cannot choose but scorn them and make them his tools when he has the power he will do more for this poor realm of france than any king before him  as our father would have done for scotland said eleanor  then he tells thee of his plans  me said margaret with the suffering look returning how should he talk to me the muckle uncouthie wife that i am kenning nought but a wheen ballads and romauntsnot even able to give him the heir for whom he longs and she wrung her hands together how can i be aught but a pain and grief to him  nay but thou lovest him said jean over simply  lassie exclaimed margaret hotly what thinkest thou i am made of how should a wife not love her man the wisest canniest prince in christendom too love him i worship him as the trouveres say with all my heart and wad lay down my life if i could win one kind blush of his eye and yetand yetsuch a creature am i that i am ever wittingly or unwittingly transgressing these weary laws and garring him think me a fool or others report me such clenching her hands again  madame de ste petronelle asked jean  she oh no she is a true loyal lindsay heart and soul dour and wearisome but she would guard me from every foe and most of all as she is ever telling me from mine ain self that is my worst enemy only she sets about it in such guise that for very vexation i am driven farther no it is the countess de craylierre who is forever spiting me and striving to put whatever i do in a cruel light if i dinna walk after her willhers as if she could rule a kings daughter  and margaret stamped her foot on the ground while a hot flush arose in her cheeks her sisters young girls as they were could not understand her moods either of wild mirth eager delight in poetry and music childish wilfulness and petulant temper or deep melancholy all coming in turn with feverish alternation and vehemence as the ladies approached the castle they were met by various gentlemen among whom was maitre alain chartier and a bandying of compliments and witticisms began in such rapid french that even eleanor could not follow it but there was something in the ring of the dauphinesss hard laugh that pained her she knew not why  at the entrance they found the chief of the party returning from the cathedral where they had heard mass not exactly in state but publicly  ha ha good daughter laughed the king i took thee for a slug abed but it is by thy errant fashion that thou hast cheated us  i have been to mass at st marys returned margaret with my sisters i love the early walk across the park  no wonder came from between the thin lips of the dauphin as his keen little eye fell on chartier margaret drew herself up and vouchsafed not to reply jean marvelled but eleanor felt with her that she was too proud to defend herself from the insult madame de ste petronelle however stepped forward and began madame la dauphine loves not attendance she made her journey alone with mesdames ses soeurs with no male company till she reached home  but before the first words were well out of the good ladys mouth louis had turned away with an air of the most careless indifference to a courtier in a long gown longer shoes and a jewelled girdle who became known to the sisters as messire jamet de tillay eleanor felt indignant was he too heedless of his wife to listen to the vindication  madame de ste petronelle took the lady of glenuskie aside and poured out her lamentations that was ever the way she said the dauphiness would give occasion to slanderers by her wilful ways and there were those who would turn all she said or did against her poisoning the ear of the dauphin little as he cared  is he an ill man to her asked dame lilias little prepossessed by his looks  he madame mind you an auld tale of the eatin wi no heart in his body i verily believe he and his father both were created like that giant no that the king is sair to live with either so that he can eat and drink and daff and be let alone to take his ease i have seen him and my gude man and them we kenned have marked him this score of years and whether his kingdom were lost or won whether his best friends were free or bound dead or alive he recked as little as though it were a game of chess so that he can sit in the ingle neuk at bourges and toy with madame de beaute shameless limmer that she is and crack his fists with yon viper jamet de tillay and the rest of the crew but hell let you alone and has a kindly word for them that dont cross himand there be those that would go through fire and water for him he is no that ill but for his son he has a sneer and a spite such as never his father had he is never a one to sit still and let things gang their gate but he has as little pity or compassion as his father and if king charles will not stir a finger to hinder a gruesome deed dauphin louis will not spare to do it so that he can gain by it and i trow verily that to give pain and sting with that bitter tongue of his is joy to him  then is there no love between him and our princess  alack lady there is love but tis all on one side of the house i doubt me whether messire le dauphin hath it in him to love any living creature i longed when i saw your maidens that my poor lady had been as bonnie as her sister joanna but mayhap that would not have served her better if she were as dull as the duchess of brittanywho they say can scarce find a word to give to a stranger at nantesshe might even anger him less than she does with her wit and her books and her verses sitting up half the night to read and write rondeaux forsooth  her blessed fathers own daughter  that may be but how doth it suit a wife it might serve here where every one is mad after poesy as they call it but such ways are in no good odour with the french dames who never put eye to book pen to paper nor foot to ground if they can help it and when she behoves to gang off roaming afoot as she did this morn theres no garring the illminded carlines believe that theres no ill purpose behind  it is scarce wise  yet to hear her tis such walking and wearing herself out that keeps the life in her and alone gives her sleep my puir bairn worshipping the very ground her man sets foot on and never getting aught but a gibe or a girn from him and for the very wilfulness of her sair heart ever putting herself farther from him  such was the piteous account that madame de ste petronelle otherwise dame elspeth johnstone gave and which the lady of glenuskie soon perceived to be only too true during the days spent at nanci to the two young sisters the condition of things was less evident to margaret their presence was such sunshine that they usually saw her in her highest most flighty and imprudent spirits taking at times absolute delight in shocking her two duennas and it was in this temper that one hot noon day coming after an evening of song and music finding alain chartier asleep on a bench in the garden she declared that she must kiss the mouth from which such sweet strains proceeded and bending down imprinted so light a kiss as not to waken him then turned round her whole face rippling with silent laughter at the amusement of jean and margaret of anjou elleens puzzled gravity and the horror and dismay of her elder ladies but dame lilias saw what she did nota look of triumphant malice on the face of jamet de tillay or at other times she would sit listening with silent tears in her eyes to plaintive scottish airs on eleanors harp which she declared brought back her fathers voice to her and with it the scent of the heather and the very sight of arthurs seat or the hills of perth elleen had some sudden qualms of heart lest her sisters blitheness should be covering wounds within but she was too young to be often haunted by such thoughts in the delightful surroundings in which that easter week was spentthe companionship of their sister and of the two young infantas of anjou as well as all the charm of king renes graceful attention eleanor had opened to her fresh stores of beauty exquisite illuminations books of all kindslegend history romance poetryall freely displayed to her by her royal host who took an elderly mans delight in an intelligent girl nor perhaps was the pleasure lessened by the need of explaining to archduke sigismund in german ever improving that which he could not understand there was a delightful freedom about the courtnot hard rugged always on the defence like that of scotland nor stiffly ecclesiastical as had been that of henry of windsor but though there was devotion every morning there was for the rest of the day holidaymaking according to each ones tastenot hawking for the bon roi rene was merciful to the birds in nesting time for which he was grumbled and laughed at by the young nobles and it may be feared by jean who wanted to exhibit skywings prowess but there was riding at the ring and jousting or long rides in the environs minstrelsy in the gardens and once a graceful ballet of the kings own composition and the evenings sometimes indoors sometimes outofdoors were given to song and music altogether it was a land of enchantment to most whether gaily or poetically inclined  only there were certain murmurs by the rugged scots and fierce gascons among the guests george observed to david drummond that he felt as if this was a nest of eiderducks all down and fluff davie responded that it was like a pasteboard town in a mystery play and that he longed to strike at it with his good broadsword the english squire who stood by in his turn compared it to a castle of flummery and blancmanger a french captain of a full company declared that he wished he had the plundering of it and a fiercelooking mountaineer of the vosges of alsace growled that if the harping old king of nowhere flouted his master duke sigismund maybe they should have a taste of plunder  there was actually to be a tournament on the monday the day before the wedding and a first tournament was a prodigious event in the life of a young lady jean was in the utmost excitement and never looked at her own pretty face of roses and lilies in the steel mirror without comparing it with those of the two infantas in the hope of being chosen queen of beauty but to her great disappointment king rene prudently ordained that there should be no such competition but that the prizes should be bestowed by his sister the queen of france  the marquess of suffolk requested sir patrick to convey to young douglas a free offer of fitting him out for the encounter with armour and horse if needful and even of conferring knighthood on him so that he might take his place on equal terms in the lists  he would like to do it the insolent loon was geordies grim comment will de la pole dare to talk of dubbing the red douglas when i bide his buffet it shall be in another sort when i take knighthood it shall be from my lawful king or my father  so i shall tell him replied sir patrick and i deem you wise for there be tricks of french chivalry that a man needs to know ere he can acquit himself well in the lists and to see you fail would scarce raise you in the eyes of your lady  more like they would find too much earnest in the midst of their sham returned geordie you had best tell your english marquis as he calls himself that he had better not trust a lance in a scotsman hand if he wouldna have all the shams that fret me beyond my patience about their ears  this was not exactly what sir patrick told the marquis though he was far from disapproving of the resolution he kept an eye on this strange follower and was glad to see that there was no evil or licence in his conduct but that he chiefly consorted with david and a few other young squires to whom this week so delightful to the ladies was inexpressibly wearisome  tournaments have been described so far as the nineteenth century can describe them so often that no one wishes to hear more of their details these had nearly reached their culmination in the middle of the fifteenth century defensive armour had become highly ornamental and very cumbrous so that it was scarcely possible for the champions to do one another much harm except that a fall under such a weight was dangerous thus it was only an exercise of skill in arms and horsemanship on which the ladies gazed as they sat in the gallery around queen marie the five young princesses together forming as the minstrels declared a perfect wreath of loveliness the dauphiness with a flush on her cheek and an eager look on her face her tall form and dress more carefully arranged than usual looked well and princely eleanor very like her but much developed in expression and improved in looks since she left home and a beauty of her own but the palm lay between the other threeyolande tall grave stately and anxious with darker blue eyes and brown hair than her sister who with her innocent childish face showing something of the shyness of a bride sat somewhat back as if to conceal herself between yolande and jean who was all excitement her cheeks flushed and her sunny hair seeming to glow with a radiance of its own duke sigismund was among the defenders in a very splendid suit of armour made in italy and embossed in that new taste of the cinquecento that was fast coming in  the two kings began with an amicable joust in which rene had the best of it then they took their seats and as usual there was a good deal of riding one against the other at the lists and shivering of lances while some knights were borne backwards horse and all others had their helmets carried off but rene who sat in great enjoyment with his staff in hand between his sister and her husband king charles had taken care that all the weapons should be blunted sigismund a tall large strongly made man was for some time the leading champion perhaps there was an understanding that the lion of hapsburg and famed eagle of the tyrol was to carry all before him and win in an undoubted manner the prize of the tourney and the hand of the infanta yolande certainly the colour rose higher and higher in her delicate cheek but those nearest could see that it was not with pleasure for she bit her lip with annoyance and her eyes wandered in search of some one  presently in a pause there came forward on a tall white horse a magnificently tall man in plain but bright armour three allerions or beakless eagles on his breast and on his shield a violet plant with the motto si douce est la violette the dauphiness leant across her sister and squeezed yolandes hand vehemently as the knight inclined his lance to the king and was understood to crave permission to show his prowess charles turned to rene whose goodhumoured face looked annoyed but who could not withhold his consent the dauphiness whose vehement excitement was more visible than even yolandes whispered to eleanor that this was messire ferry de vaudemont her true love come to win her at point of the lance  history is the parent of romance and romance now and then becomes history it is an absolute and undoubted fact that count frederic or ferry de vaudemont the male representative of the line of charles the great did win his ladylove yolande of anjou by his good lance within the lists and that thus the direct descent was brought eventually back to lorraine though this was not contemplated at the time since yolande had then living both a brother and a nephew and it was simply for her own sake that messire ferry in all the strength and beauty that descended to the noted house of guise was now bearing down all before him touching shield after shield only to gain the better of their owners in the encounter yolande sat with a deep colour in her cheeks and her hands clasped rigidly together without a movement while the lorrainer spectators with a strong suspicion who the knight of the violet really was and with a leaning to their own line loudly applauded each victory  king rene long ago had had to fight for his wifes inheritance with this young mans father who supported by the strength of burgundy had defeated and made him prisoner so that he was naturally disinclined to the match and would have preferred the hapsburg duke whose alsatian possessions were only divided from his own by the vosges but his generous and romantic spirit could not choose but be gained by the proceeding of count ferry and the mute appeal in the face and attitude of his muchloved daughter  he could not help joining in the applause at the grace and ease of the young knight till by and by all interest became concentrated on the last critical encounter with sigismund  every one watched almost breathlessly as the big heavy austrian mounted on a fresh horse and the slim lorrainer in armour less strong but less weighty had their meeting two courses were run with mere splintering of lance at the third while rene held his staff ready to throw if signs of fighting a loutrance appeared ferry lifted his lance a little and when both steeds recoiled from the clash the azure eagle of the tyrol was impaled on the point of his lance and sigismund though not losing his saddle was bending low on it half stunned by the force of the blow down went renes warder loud were the shouts vive the knight of the violet victory to the allerions  the voice of rene was as clear and exulting as the rest as the heralds with blast of trumpet proclaimed the chevalier de la violette the victor of the day and then came forward to lead him to the feet of the queen of france his helmet was removed and at the face of manly beauty that it revealed the applause was renewed but as marie held out the prize a splendidly hilted sword he bowed low and said madame one boon alone do i ask for my guerdon and withal he laid the blue eagle on his lance at the feet of yolande  rene was not the father to withstand such an appeal he leapt from his chair of state he hurried to yolande in her gallery took her by the hand and in another moment ferry had sprung from his horse and on the steps knight and lady in their youthful glory and grace stood hand in hand all blushes and bliss amid the ecstatic applause of the multitude while the dauphiness shed tears of joy thus brilliantly ended the first tournament witnessed by the scottish princesses eleanor had been most interested on the whole in duke sigismund and had exulted in his successes and been sorry to see him defeated but then she knew that yolande dreaded his victory and she suspected that he did not greatly care for yolande so that since he was not hurt and was certainly the second in the field she could look on with complacency  moreover at the evenings dance when margaret and suffolk ferry and yolande stood up for a stately pavise together sigismund came to eleanor and while she was thinking whether or not to condole with him he shyly mumbled something about not regrettingbeing freethe dauphin her brother enduring a beaten knight it was all in a mixture of french and german mostly of the latter and far less comprehensible than usual unless indeed maidenly shyness made her afraid to understand or to seem to do so he kept on standing by her both of them mute and embarrassed not quite unconscious that they were observed perhaps secretly derided by some of the lookerson the first relief was when the dauphiness came and sat down by her sister and began to talk fast in french scarce heeding whether the duke understood or answered her  one question he asked was who was the redfaced young man with stubbly sunburnt hair and a scar on his cheek who had appeared in the lists in very gaudy but illfitting armour and with a great rawboned snorting horse and now stood in a corner of the hall with his eyes steadily fixed on the lady joanna  so said sigismund that fellow is the baron rudiger von batchburg der schelm how has he the face to show himself here  is he one of your borderersyour robber castellanes asked margaret  even so his fathers castle of balchenburg is so cunningly placed on the march between elsass and lothringen that neither our good host nor i can fully claim it and these rogues shelter themselves behind one or other of us till it is what they call in germany a rat castle the refuge of all the ecorcheurs and routiers of this part of the country they will bring us both down on them one of these days but the place is wellnigh past scaling by any save a gemsbock or an ecorcheur  jean herself had remarked the gaze of the alsatian mountaineer it was the chief homage that her beauty had received and she was somewhat mortified at being only viewed as part of the constellation of royalty and beauty doing honour to the infantas she believed too that if g  he could have brought her out in as effective and romantic a light as that in which yolande had appeared and she was in some of her moods hurt and angered with him for refraining while in others she supposed sometimes that he was too awkward thus to venture himself and at others she did him the justice of believing that he disdained to appear in borrowed plumes  the wedding was by no means so splendid an affair as the tournament as indeed it was merely a marriage by proxy and yolande and her count of vaudemont were too near of kin to be married before a dispensation could be procured  the king and queen of france would leave nanci to see the bride partly on her way the dauphin and his wife were to tarry a day or two behind and the princesses belonged to their court sir patrick had fulfilled his charge of conducting them to their sister and he had now to avail himself of the protection of the kings party as far as possible on the way to paris where he would place malcolm at the university and likewise meet his daughters bridegroom and his father  dame lilias did not by any means like leaving her young cousins so long her charge without attendants of their own but the dauphiness gave them a tirewoman of her own and undertook that madame de ste petronelle should attend them in case of need as well as that she would endeavour to have annis when madame de terreforte at her court as long as they were there they also had a squire as equerry and george douglas was bent on continuing in that capacity till his outfit from his father arrived as it was sure to do sooner or later  margaret knew who he was and promised sir patrick to do all in her power for him as truly his patience and forbearance well deserved  it was a very sorrowful parting between the two maidens and the lady of glenuskie who for more than half a year had been as a mother to them nay more than their own mother had ever been and bad done much to mitigate the sharp angles of their neglected girlhood by her influence in a very few months more she would see james and mary and the weans and the three sisters loaded her with gifts letters and messages for all eleanor promised never to forget her counsel and to strive not to let the bright new world drive away all those devout feelings and hopes that mother clare and king henry had inspired and that lady drummond had done her best to keep up  duke sigismund had communicated to sir patrick his intention of making a formal request to king james for the hand of the lady eleanor he was to find an envoy to make his proposal in due form who would join sir patrick at terreforte after the wedding was over so as to go with the party to scotland  meantime with many fond embraces and tears lady drummond took leave of her princesses and they owned themselves to feel as if a protecting wall had been taken away in her and her husband  it is folly though thus to speak said jean when we have our sister and her husband and his father and all his court to protect us  we ought to be happy said eleanor gravely outside here at nanci it is all that my fancy ever shaped and yetand yet there is a strange sense of fear beyond  oh talk not that gate cried jean as thou wilt be having thy gruesome visions  no it is not of that sort returned eleanor i trow not it may be rather the feeling of the vanity of all this worlds show  oh for mercys sake dinna let us have clavers of that sort or we shall have thee in yon nunnery exclaimed jean see this girdle of maggies which she has given me must i not make another hole to draw it up enough for my waist  jean herself was much disappointed when margaret with great regret told her that the dauphin had to go out of his way to visit some castles on his way to chalons sur marne and that he could not encumber his hosts with so large a train as the presence of two royal ladies rendered needful they were therefore to travel by another route leading through towns where there were hostels madame de ste petronelle was to go with them and an escort of trusty scots archers and all would meet again in a fortnights time  all sounded simple and easy and margaret repeated it will be a troop quite large enough to defend you from all ecorcheurs indeed they dare not come near our scottish archers whom messire my husband has told off for your escort and you will have your own squire she added looking at jean  thats as he lists said jean scornfully  ah jeanie jeanie thou mayst have to rue it if thou turnst lightly from a leal heart  im not damselerrant of romance as thou and elleen would fain be said jean  nay said margaret love is not mere romance and oh sister credit me a scots lassies heart craves better food than crowns and coronets hard and unco cold be they where there is no warmth to meet the yearning soul beneath that would give all and ten times more for one glint of a loving eye one word from a tender lip again she had one of those hysteric bursts of tears but she laughed herself back crying but what is the treason wifie saying of her gudemanher louis that never yet said a rough word to his meg  then came another laugh but she gathered herself up at a summons to come down and mount  she was tenderly embraced by all king rene kissing her and calling her his dear niece and princess of minstrelsy who should come to him at toulouse and bestow the golden violet  she rode away looking back smiling and kissing her hand but eleanors eyes grew wide and her cheeks pale  jean she murmured low and hoarsely margarets shroud is up to her throat  hoots with thy clavers exclaimed jeanie in return i never let thee sing that fule song but megs fancies have brought the megrims into thine head thou and she are pair  that we shall be nae longer sighed eleanor i saw the shroud as clear as i see yon cross on the spire     chapter 8 stings        yet one asylum is my own         against the dreaded hour       a long a silent and a lone         where kings have little powerscott   at chalons the sieur de terreforte and his son olivier a very quiet stiff and welltrained youth met sir patrick and the lady of glenuskie terreforte was within the province of champagne and as long as the court remained at chalons the sieur felt bound to remain in attendance on the kinglodging at his own house or hotel as he called it in the city dame lilias did not regret anything which gave her a little more time with her daughter and enabled annis to make a little more acquaintance with her bridegroom and his family before being left alone with them moreover she hoped to see something more of her cousins the princesses  but they came not the dauphin and his wife arrived from their excursion and took up their abode in the castle of surry le chateau at a short distance from thence and thither went the lady of glenuskie with her husband to pay her respects and present the betrothed of her daughter  margaret was sitting in a shady nook of the walls under the shade of a tall massive tower with a page reading to her but in that impulsive manner which the court of france thought grossiere and sauvage she ran down the stone stairs and threw herself on the neck of her cousin exclaiming however but where are my sisters  are they not with your grace i thought to find them here  nay they were to start two days after us with an escort of archers while we visited the shrine of st menehould they might have been here before us exclaimed margaret in much alarm my husband thought our train would be too large if they went with us  if we had known that they were not to be with your grace we would have tarried for them said dame lilias  oh cousin would that you bad  mayhap king rene and his daughter persuaded them to wait a few days  that was the best hope but there was much uneasiness when another day passed and the scottish princesses did not appear strange whispers coming from no one knew where began to be current that they had disappeared in company with some of those wild and gay knights who had met at the tournament at nanci  in extreme alarm and indignation margaret repaired to her husband he was kneeling before the shrine of the lady in the chapel of surry telling his beads and he did not stir or look round or relax one murmur of his aves while she paced about wrung her hands and vainly tried to control her agitation at last he rose and coldly said i knew it could be no other who thus interrupted my devotions  my sisters she gasped  well what of them  do you know what wicked things are said of themthe dear maids ahas she saw his strange smileyou have heard you will silence the fellows who deserve to have their tongues torn out for defaming a kings daughters  verily ma mie said louis i see no such great improbability in the tale they have been bred up to the like no doubt a mountain kite of the vosges is a more congenial companion than a chevalier bien courtois  you speak thus simply to tease your poor margot she said pleading yet trembling but i know better than to think you mean it  as my lady pleases he said  then will i send sir patrick with an escort to seek them at nanci and bring them hither  where is this same troop to come from demanded louis  our own scottish archers who will see no harm befall my blessed fathers daughters  ha say you so i had heard a different story from buchan from the grahams the halls revenge is sweetas your mother found it  the murderers had only their deserts  louis shrugged his shoulders that is as their sons may think  no one would be so dastardly as to wreak vengeance on two young helpless maids cried margaret oh sir help me what think you  madame knows better than i do the spirit alike of her sisters and of her own countrymen  nay nay monsieur husband do but help me my poor sisters in this strange land you who are wiser than all tell me what can have become of them  what can i say madame lovelove of the minstrel kind seems to run in the family you all have supped full thereof at nanci if report said true there was a secret lover in their suite what so likely as that the may game should have become earnest  but sir we are accountable my sisters were entrusted to us  not to me said louis if the boy your brother expected me to find husbands and dowers for a couple of wild penniless featherpated damselserrant he expected far too much i know far too well what are scotch manners and ideas of decorum to charge myself with the like  sir do you mean to insult me demanded margaret rising to the full height of her tall stature  that is as madame may choose to fit the cap he said with a bow i accuse her of nothing but there was an ironical smile on his thin lips which almost maddened her  speak out oh sir tell me what you dare to mean she said with a stamp of her foot clasping her hands tightly he only bowed again  i know there are evil tongues abroad said margaret with a desperate effort to command her voice but i heeded them no more than the midges in the air while i knew my lord and husband heeded them not butoh say you do not  have i said that i did  then for a proofdismiss and silence that foulslandering wretch jamet de tillay  a true womans imagination that to dismiss is to silence he laughed  it would show at least that you will not brook to have your wife defamed oh sir sir she cried i only ask what any other husband would have done long ago of his own accord and rightful anger smile not thusor you will see me frenzied  smiles best befit womans tears said louis coolly one moment for your sisters the next for yourself  ah my sisters my sisters wretch that i am to have thought of my worthless self for one moment ah you are only teasing your poor margot you will act for your own honour and theirs in sending out to seek them  my honour and theirs may be best served by their being forgotten  margaret became inarticulate with dismay indignation disappointment as these envenomed stings went to her very soul further pointed by the curl of louiss thin lips and the sinister twinkle of his little eyes almost choked she stammered forth the demand what he meant only to be answered that he did not pretend to understand the scottish errant nature and pointing to a priest entering the church he bade her not make herself conspicuous and strolled away  margarets despair and agony were inexpressible she stood for some minutes leaning against a pillar to collect her senses then her first thought was of consulting the drummonds and she impetuously dashed back to her own apartments and ordered her palfrey and suite to be ready instantly to take her to chalons  madame la dauphines palfreys were all gone to ghalons to be shod in fact there were some games going on there and trusting to the easygoing habits of their mistress almost all her attendants had lounged off thither even the maidens as well as the pages who felt madame de ste petronelles sharp eyes no longer over them  tell me said margaret to the one lame frightened old man who alone seemed able to reply to her call do you know who commanded the escort which were with my sisters the princesses of scotland  the old man threw up his hands how should he know the escort was of the savage scottish archers  i know that but can you not tell who they werenor their commander  ah madame knows that their names are such as no christian ears can understand nor lips speak  i had thought it was the sire andrew gordon who was to go with them he with the blue housings on the dapple grey  no madame i heard the captain mercour say monsieur le dauphin had other orders for him it was the little dark onehow call they himah with a more reasonable namele halle who led the party of mesdames madame madame let me call some of madames women  no no gasped margaret knowing indeed that none whom she wished to see were within call thanks jean herenow go and she flung him a coin  she knew now that whatever had befallen her sisters had been by the connivance if not the contrivance of her husband unwilling to have the charge and the portioning of the two penniless maidens imposed upon him and what might not that fate be betrayed into the hands of one who had so deadly a bloodfeud with their parents for hall was the son of one of the men whose daggers had slain james i and whose crime had been visited with such vindictive cruelty by queen joanna the mans eyes had often scowled at her as if he longed for vengeanceand thus had it been granted him  margaret with understanding to appreciate louiss extraordinary ability had idolised him throughout in spite of his constant coldness and the satire with which he treated all her higher tastes and aspirations continually throwing her in and back upon herself and blighting her instincts wherever they turned she had accepted all this as his superiority to her folly and though the thwarted and unfostered inclinations in her strong unstained nature had occasioned those aberrations and distorted impulses which brought blame on her she had accepted everything hitherto as her own fault and believed in and adored the image she had made of him throughout now it was as if her idol had turned suddenly into a viper in her bosom not only stinging her by implied acquiescence in the slanders upon her discretion if not upon her fair fame but actually having betrayed her innocent sisters by means of the deadly enemy of their familyto what fate she knew not  to act became an immediate need to the unhappy dauphiness at once as the only vent to her own misery and because she must without loss of time do something for the succour of her young sisters or ascertain their fate  she did not spend a moments thought on the censure any imprudent measure of her own might bring on her but hastily summoning the only tirewoman within reach she exchanged her blue and gold embroidered robe for a dark serge which she wore on days of penance with a mantle and hood of the same and to linettes horror and dismay bade her attend her on foot to the hotel de terreforte in chalons  linette was in no position to remonstrate but could only follow as the lady wrapped in her cloak descended the steps and crossed the empty hall the porter let her pass unquestioned but there were a few guards at the great gateway and one shouted whither away pretty linette  margaret raised her hood and looked full at him and he fell back he knew her and knew that madame la dauphine did strange things the road was stony and bare and treeless unfrequented at first and it was very sultry the sun shining with a heavy melting heat on margarets weighty garments but she hurried on never feeling the heat or hearing linettes endeavours to draw her attention to the heavy bank of gray clouds tinged with lurid red gradually rising and whence threatening growls of thunder were heard from time to time she really seemed to rush forward and poor panting linette toiled after her feeling ready to drop while the way was as yet unobstructed as the two beautiful steeples of the cathedral and notre dame de lepine rose before them but after a time as they drew nearer the road became obstructed by carts waggons donkeys crowded with countryfolks and their wares with friars and ragged beggars all pressing into the town and jostling one another and the two footpassengers all the more as raindrops began to fall and the thunder sounded nearer  margaret had been used to walking but it was all within parks and pleasances and she was not at all used to being pushed about and jostled linette knew how to make her way far better and it was well for them that their dark dresses and hoods and linettes elderly face gave the idea of their being votaresses of some sacred order and so secured them from actual personal insult but as they clung together they were thrust aside and pushed about while the throng grew thicker the streets narrower the storm heavier the air more stifling and unsavoury  a sudden rush nearly knocked them down driving them under a gargoyle whose spout was streaming with wet and completed the drenching but there was a porch and an open door of a church close behind and into this linette dragged her mistress dripping breathless bruised she leant against a pillar not going forward for others much more gaily dressed had taken refuge there and were chattering away for little reverence was paid at that date to the sanctity of buildings  will the king be there think you eagerly asked a young girl who had been anxiously wiping the wet from her pink kirtle  certeshe is to give the prizes replied a portly dame in crimson  and the lady of beauty i long to see her  her beauty is passingexcept that which was better worth the solid castle the king gave her laughed the stout citizen who seemed to be in charge of them  the dauphiness toowill she be there  ah the dauphiness said the elder woman with a meaning sound and shake of the head  scandalevil tongues growled the man  nay master jerome theres no denying it for a merchant of bourges told me she runs about the country on foot like no discreet woman let alone a princess with a goodfornothing minstrel after her ah you may grunt and make signs but i had it from the countess de craylierres own tirewoman who came for a bit of lace that the dauphin is about to  the sire jamet de tillay caught her kissing the minstrel on a bench in the garden at nanci  i would not trust the sire de tillays word he is in debt to every merchant of the placea smoothtongued deceiver belike he is bribed to defame the poor lady that the dauphin may rid himself of a childless wife  the young girl was growing restless declaring that the rain was over and that they should miss the getting good places at the show margaret had stood all this time leaning against her pillar with hands clenched together and teeth firm set trying to control the shuddering of horror and indignation that went through her whole frame she started convulsively when linette moved after the burgher but put a force upon herself when she perceived that it was in order to inquire how best to reach the hotel de terreforte  he pointed to the opposite door of the church and linette reconnoitring and finding that it led into a street entirely quiet and deserted went back to the dauphiness whom she found sunk on her knees stiff and dazed  come madame she entreated trying to raise her the hotel de terreforte is near these houses shelter us and the rain is nearly over  margaret did not move at first then she looked up and said what was it that they said linette  oh no matter what they said madame they were ignorant creatures who knew not what they were talking about come you are wet you are exhausted this good lady will know how to help you  there is no help in man said margaret wildly stretching out her arms oh god help mea desolate womanand my sisters betrayed betrayed  very much alarmed linette at last succeeded in raising her to her feet and guiding her halfblinded as she seemed to the portal of the hotel de terrefortean archway leading into a courtyard it was by great good fortune that the very first person who stood within it was old andrew of the cleugh who despised all french sports in comparison with the completeness of his masters equipment and was standing at the gate about to issue forth in quest of leather to mend a defective strap his eyes fell on the forlorn wanderer who had no longer energy to keep her hood forward my certie he exclaimed in utter amaze  the scottish words and voice seemed to revive margaret and she tottered forward exclaiming oh good man help me take me to the lady  fortunately the lady of glenuskie being much busied in preparations for her journey had sent annis to the sports with the lady of terreforte and was ready to receive the poor drenched exhausted being who almost stumbled into her motherly arms weeping bitterly and incoherently moaning something about her sisters and her husband and betrayed  old christie was happily also at home and dry clothing a warm posset and the ladys own bed perhaps still more her soothing caresses brought margaret back to the power of explaining her distress intelligiblyat least as regarded her sisters she had discovered that their escort had been that bitter foe of their house robert hall and she verily believed that he had betrayed her sisters into the hands of some of the routiers who infested the roads  dame lilias could not but think it only too likely but she said the worst that could well befall the poor lassies in that case would be their detention until a ransom was paid and if their situation was known the king the dauphin and the duke of brittany would be certain one or other to rescue them by force of arms if not to raise the money she saw how margaret shuddered at the name of the dauphin  oh i have jewelspearlsgold cried margaret i could pay the sum without asking any one only where are they where are they what are they not enduringthe dear maidens would that i had never let them out of my sight  would that i had not echoed dame lilias but cheer up dear lady madame de ste petronelle is with them and will watch over them and she knows the ways of the country and how to deal with these robbers whoever they may be she will have a care of them  but though the lady of glenuskie tried to cheer the unhappy princess she was full of consternation and misgivings as to the fate of her young cousins whom she loved heartily and she was relieved when in accordance with the summons that she had sent her husbands spurs were heard ringing on the stair  he heard the story with alarm he knew that sir andrew gordon had been told off to lead the convoy and had even conversed with him on the subject  who exchanged him for hall he inquired  oh do not ask cried the unhappy margaret covering her face with her hands and the shrewder scots folk began to understand as glances passed between them though they spared her  she had intended throwing herself at the feet of the king who had never been unkind to her and imploring his succour but sir patrick brought word that the king and dauphin were going forth together to visit the abbot of a shrine at no great distance and as soon as she heard that the dauphin was with his father she shrank together and gave up her purpose for the present indeed sir patrick thought it advisable for him to endeavour to discover what had really become of the princesses before applying to the king or making their loss public nor was the dauphiness in a condition to repair to court dame lilias longed to keep her and nurse and comfort her that evening but while the spiteful whispers of de tillay were abroad it was needful to be doubly prudent and the mornings escapade must if possible be compensated by a public return to chateau le surry so margaret was placed on lady drummonds palfrey and accompanied home by all the attendants who could be got together she could hardly sit upright by the time the short ride was over for pain in the side and stitch in her breath again lady drummond would have stayed with her but the countess de craylierre who had been extremely offended and scandalised by the expedition of the dauphiness made her understand that no one could remain there except by the invitation of the dauphin and showed great displeasure at any one but herself attempting the care of madame la dauphine who as all knew was subject to megrims  margaret entreated her belle cousine to return in the morning and tell her what had been done and dame lilias accordingly set forth with annis immediately after mass and breakfast with the news that sir patrick had taken counsel with the sieur de erreforte and that they had got together such armed attendants as they could and started with their sons for nanci where they hoped to discover some traces of the lost ladies  indeed he had brought his wife on his way and was waiting in the court in case the princess should wish to see him before he went but lilias found poor margaret far too ill for this to be of any avail she had tossed about all night and now was lying partly raised on a pile of embroidered goldedged pillows under an enormous stiff heavy quilt gorgeous with heraldic colours and devices her pale cheeks flushed with fever her breath catching painfully and with a terrible short cough murmuring strange words about her sisters and about cruel tongues a crowd of both sexes and all ranks filled the room gazing and listening  she knew her cousin at her entrance clasped her hand tight and seemed to welcome her native tongue and understand her assurance that sir patrick was gone to seek her sisters but she wandered off into dont let him ask jamet ah katie douglas keep the door they are coming  her husband returning from the morning mass had way made for him as he advanced to the bed and again her understanding partly returned as he said in his low dry voice how now madame  she looked up at him held out her hot hand and gasped oh sir sir where are they  be more explicit ma mie he said with an inscrutable face  you know you know oh husband my lord you do not believe it say you do not believe it send the whispering fiend away he has hidden my sisters  she raves said louis has the chirurgeon been with her  he is even now about to bleed her my lord said madame de craylierre and so i have sent for the kings own physician  louiss barbersurgeon not yet olivier le dain was a little crooked old jew at sight of whom margaret screamed as if she took him for the whispering fiend he would fain have cleared the room and relieved the air but this was quite beyond his power the ladies knights pages and all chose to remain and look on at the struggles of the poor patient while madame de craylierre and lady drummond held her fast and forced her to submit her husband who alone could have prevailed did not or would not speak the word but shrugged his shoulders and left the room carrying off with him at least his own attendants  when she saw her blood flow margaret exclaimed ah traitors take me instead of my fatheronlya priest  presently she fainted and after partly reviving seemed to doze and this being less interesting caused many of the spectators to depart  when she awoke she was quite herself and this was well for the king came to visit her margaret was fond of her fatherinlaw who had always been kind to her but she was too ill and speech hurt her too much to allow her to utter clearly all that oppressed her  my sisters my poor sisters she moaned  ah ma belle fille fear not all will be well with them no doubt my good brother rene has detained them that madame eleanore may study a little more of his music and painting we will send a courier to nanci who will bring good news of them said the king in a caressing voice which soothed if it did not satisfy the sufferer  she spoke out some thanks and he added they may come any moment daughter and that will cheer your little heart and make you well only take courage child and here is my good physician maitre bertrand come to heal you  margaret still held the kings hand and sought to detain him beau pere beau pere she said you will not believe them you will silence them  whom what ma mie  the evilspeakers ah jamet  i believe nothing my fair daughter tells me not to believe  ah sire he speaks against me he says  hush hush child whoever vexes my daughter shall have his tongue slit for him but here we must give place to maitre bertrand  maitre bertrand was a fat and stolid personage who nevertheless had a true doctors squabble with the jew samiel and drove him out his treatment was to exclude all the air possible make the patient breathe all sorts of essences and apply freshlykilled pigeons to the painful side  margaret did not mend under this method she begged for samiel who had several times before relieved her in slight illnesses but she was given to understand that the dauphin would not permit him to interfere with maitre bertrand  ah she said to dame lilias in their own language my husband calls bertrand an old fool he does not wish me to recover a childless wife is of no value he would have me dead and so would iif my fame were cleared if my sisters were found oh my lord my lord i loved him so  poor margaret such was her cry whether sane or delirious hour after hour day after day only when delirious she rambled into scotch and talked of perth went over again her fathers murder or fancied her sisters in the hands of some of the ferocious chieftains of the north and screamed to sir patrick or to geordie douglas to deliver them where was all the chivalry of the bleeding heart  or again she would piteously plead her own cause with her husbandnot that he was present a morning glance into her room sufficed him but she would excuse her own eager follytelling him not to be angered with her who loved him wholly and entirely and begging him to silence the wicked tongues that defamed her  when sensible she was very weak and capable of saying very little but she clung fast to lady drummond and dauphin or no dauphin dame lilias was resolved on remaining and watching her day and night madame de craylierre becoming ready to leave the nursing to her when it became severe  the king came to see his daughterinlaw almost every day and always spoke to her in the same kindly but unmeaning vein assuring her that her sisters must be safe and promising to believe nothing against herself but as the lady of glenuskie knew from olivier de terreforte taking no measures either to discover the fate of the princesses or to banish and silence jamet de tillay though it was all over the court that the dauphiness was dying for love of alain chartier was it that his son prevented him from acting or was it the strange indifference and indolence that always made charles the wellserved bestir himself far too late  any way margaret of scotland was brokenhearted utterly weary of life and with no heart or spirit to rally from the illness caused by the chill of her hasty walk she only wished to live long enough to know that her sisters were safe see them again and send them under safe care to brittany she exacted a promise from dame lilias never to leave them again till they were in safe hands with good husbands or back in scotland with their brother and good archbishop kennedy bid jeanie never despise a true heart better far better than a crown she sighed  louis concerned himself much that all the offices of religion should be provided he attended the mass daily celebrated in her room and caused priests to pray in the farther end continually lady drummond who had not given up hope and believed that good tidings of her sisters might almost be a cure thought that he really hurried on the last offices at which he devoutly assisted however the confession seemed to have given margaret much comfort she told dame lilias that the priest had shown her how to make an offering to god of her sore suffering from slander and evil report and reminded her that to endure it patiently was treading in the steps of her master she was resolved therefore to make no further struggle nor complaint but to trust that her silence and endurance would be accepted she could pray for her sisters and their safety and she would endeavour to yield up even that last earthly desire to be certified of their safety and to see their bonnie faces once more so there she lay a being formed by nature and intellect to have been the inspiring helpmeet of some noblehearted man the stay of a kingdom the education of all around her in all that was beautiful and refined but cast away upon one of the most mean and selfishhearted of mankind who only perceived her great qualities to hate and dread their manifestation in a woman to crush them by his contempt and finally though he did not originate the cruel slander that broke her heart he envenomed it by his sneers so as to deprive her of all power of resistance  the lot of margaret of scotland was as piteous as that of any of the doomed house of stewart and there the lady of glenuskie and annis de terreforte watched her sinking day by day and still there were no tidings of jean and eleanor from nanci no messenger from sir patrick to tell where the search was directed     chapter 9 balchenburg        in these wylde deserts where she now abode         there dwelt a salvage nation which did live       on stealth and spoil and making nightly rade         into their neighbours bordersspenser   a terrible legacy of the hundred years war which indeed was not yet entirely ended by the peace of tours was the existence of bands of men trained to nothing but war and rapine and devoid of any other means of subsistence than freebooting on the peasantry or travellers whence they were known as routiershighwaymen and ecorcheursflayers they were a fearful scourge to france in the early part of the reign of charles vii as indeed they had been at every interval of peace ever since the battle of creci and they really made a state of warfare preferable to the unhappy provinces or at least to those where it was not actually raging in a few years more the dauphin contrived to delude many of them into an expedition where he abandoned them and left them to be massacred after which he formed the rest into the nucleus of a standing army but at this time they were the terror of travellers who only durst go about any of the french provinces in wellarmed and large parties  the domains of king rene whether in lorraine or provence were however reckoned as fairly secure but from the time the little troop with the princesses among them had started from nanci madame de ste petronelle became uneasy she looked up at the sun which was shining in her face more than once and presently drew the portly mule she was riding towards george douglas  sir she said you are the ladies squire  i have that honour madame  and a scot  even so  i ask you which way you deem that we are riding  eastward madame if the sun is to be trusted mayhap somewhat to the south  yea and which side lies chalons  this was beyond georges geography he looked up with open mouth and shook his head  westward said the lady impressively and whats yon in the distance  save that this land is as flat as a bannock id have said twas mountains  mountains they are young man said madame de ste petronelle emphaticallythe hills between lorraine and alsace which we should be leaving behind us  is there treachery asked george reining up his horse ken ye who is the captain of this escort  his name is hall he is thick with the dauphin ha madame is he sib to him that aided in the slaughter of easterns eve night  just laddie tis own son to him that queen jean made dae sic a fearful penance what are ye doing  ill run the villain through and turn back to nanci while yet there is time said george his hand on his sword  hold ye daft bodie that would but bring all the lave on ye theres nothing for it but to go on warily and maybe at the next halt we might escape from them  but almost while madame de ste petronelle spoke there was a cry and from a thicket there burst out a band of men in steel headpieces and buff jerkins led by two or three horsemen there was a confused outcry of st denys st andrew on one side yield on the other madames rein was seized and though she drew her dagger her hand was caught before she could strike by a fellow who cried none of that you old hag or it shall be the worse for thee  st andrew st andrew screamed eleanor scots to the rescue of your kings sisters  douglasdouglas help cried jean but each was surrounded by a swarm of the ruffians and as george douglas hastily pushed down some with his horse and struck down one or two with his sword he was felled by a mighty blow on the head and the ecorcheurs thronged over him dragging him off his horse any resistance on the part of the scottish archers their escort they could not tell they only heard a tumult of shouts and cries and found rude hands holding them on their horses and dragging them among the trees their screams for help were answered by a gruff voice from a horseman evidently the leader of the troop hold that noise lady no ill is meant to you but you must come with us no screams are useless theres none to come to you stop them or i must  there is none said madame de ste petronelles voice in her own tongue best cease to cry and not fash the loons more  the sisters heard and in her natural tone eleanor said in french sir know you who you are thus treating the kings daughtersisters of the dauphiness  he laughed full well he answered in very germansounding french  such usage will bring the vengeance of the king and dauphin on you  he laughed yet more loudly his face was concealed by his visor but the illfitting armour and great roan horse made jean recognise the knight whose eyes had dwelt on her so boldly at the tournament and she added her voice  your duke of the tirol will punish this  he has enough to do to mind his own business was the answer  come fair one hold your tongue theres no help for it and the less trouble you give us the better it will be for you  but our squire jean exclaimed looking about her where is he  again there was a rude laugh  showed fight disposed of see there and jean could not but recognise the great gray horse from the mearns that george douglas had always ridden had she brought the gallant youth to this and without word or look to reward his devotion she gave one low cry and bowed her head grieved and sick at heart while eleanor on her side exclaimed  felon thou hast slain a noblemans brave heir disgrace to knighthood  peace maid or we will find means to silence thy tongue growled the leader and madame de ste petronelle interposed whishtwhisht my bairn dinna anger them for she saw that there was more disposition to harshness towards eleanor than towards jean whose beauty seemed to command a sort of regard  eleanor took the hint her eyes filled with tears and her bosom heaved at the thought of the requital of the devotion of the brave young man lying in his blood so far from his father and his home but she would not have these ruffians see her weep and think it was for herself and she proudly straightened herself in her saddle and choked down the rising sob  on on they went at first through the wood by a tangled path then over a wide moor covered with heather those mountains which had at first excited the old ladys alarm growing more distinct in front of them going faster too so that the men who held the reins were half running till the ground began to rise and grow rougher when at an order in german from the knight a man leapt on in front of each lady to guide her horse  where were they going no one deigned to ask except madame de ste petronelle and her guard only grunted nicht verstand or something equivalent  a thick mass of wood rose before them a stream coming down from it and here there was a halt the ladies were lifted down and the party who numbered about twelve men refreshed themselves with the provisions that the infanta yolande had hospitably furnished for her guests the knight awkwardly but not uncivilly offered a share to his captives but eleanor would have moved them off with disdain and jean sat with her head in her hands and would not look up  the old lady remonstrated eateat she said we shall need all our spirit and strength and theres no good in being weak and spent with fasting  eleanor saw the prudence of this and accepted the food and wine offered to her but jean seemed unable to swallow anything but a long draught of wine and water and scarcely lifted her head from her sisters shoulder eleanor held her rosary and though the words she conned over were latin all her heart was one silent prayer for protection and deliverance and commendation of that brave youths soul to bis maker  the knight kept out of their way evidently not wishing to be interrogated and he seemed to be the only person who could speak french after a fashion by and by they were remounted and led across some marshy ground where the course of the stream was marked by tall ferns and weeds then into a wood of beeches where the sun lighted the delicate young foliage while the horses trod easily among the brown fallen leaves this gave place to another wood of firs and though the days were fairly long here it was rapidly growing dark under the heavy branches so that the winding path could only have been followed by those well used to it as it became steeper and more stony the trees became thinner and against the eastern sky could be seen dark and threatening the turrets of a castle above a steep smoothlooking grassy slope one of the hills in fact called from their shape by the french ballons  just then jeans horse weary and unused to mountaineering stumbled the man at its head was perhaps not attending to it for the sudden pull he gave the rein only precipitated the fall the horse was up again in a moment but jean lay still her sister and the lady were at her side in a moment but when they tried to raise her she cried out at first inarticulately then oh my arm and on another attempt to lift her she fainted away the knight was in the meantime swearing in german at the man who had been leading her then asking anxiously in french how it was with the maiden as she lay with her head on her sisters lap madame answered  hurtmuch hurt  but not to the death  who knows no thanks to you he tendered a flask where only a few drops of wine remained growling something or other about the schelm and when jeans lips had been moistened with it she opened her eyes but sobbed with pain and only entreated to be let alone this of course was impossible but with double consternation eleanor looked up at what in the gathering darkness seemed a perpendicular height the knight made them understand that all that could be done was to put the sufferer on horseback and support her there in the climb upwards and he proceeded without further parley to lift her up not entirely without heed to her screams and moans for he emitted such sounds as those with which he might have soothed his favourite horse as he placed her on the back of a stout little strong mountain pony eleanor held her there and he walked at its head madame de ste petronelle would fain have kept up on the other side but she had lost her mountain legs and could not have got up at all without the mule on which she was replaced eleanors height enabled her to hold her arm round her sister and rest her head on her shoulder though how she kept on in the dark dragged along as it were blindly up and up she never could afterwards recollect but at last pine torches came down to meet them there was a tumult of voices a yawning black archway in front a light or two flitting about jean lay helplessly against her only groaning now and then then as the arch seemed to swallow them up eleanor was aware of an old man lame and rugged who bawled loud and seemed to be the highly displeased master of calls for barbe and then of an elderly homelylooking woman who would have assisted in taking jean off the pony but that the knight was already in the act however he resigned her to her sister and madame de ste petronelle while barbe led the way lamp in hand it was just as well poor jeanie remained unconscious or nearly so while she was conveyed up the narrow stairs to a round chamber not worse in furnishing than that at dunbar though very unlike their tapestried rooms at nanci  it was well to be able to lay her down at all and old barbe was not only ready and pitying but spoke french she had some wine ready and had evidently done her best in the brief warning to prepare a bed the tone of her words convinced madame de ste petronelle that at any rate she was no enemy so she was permitted to assist in the investigation of the injuries which proved to be extensive bruises and a dislocated shoulder both had sufficient experience in roughandready surgery as well as sufficient strength for them to be able to pull in the shoulder while eleanor white and trembling stood on one side with the lamp and a little flaxenhaired girl of twelve years old held bandages and ran after whatever barbe asked for  this done and jean having been arranged as comfortably as might be barbe obeyed some peremptory summonses from without and presently came back  the seigneur desires to speak with the ladies she said but i have told him that they cannot leave la pauvrette and are too much spent to speak with him tonight i will bring them supper and they shall rest  we thank you said madame de ste petronelle only de grace tell us where we are and who this seigneur is and what he wants with us poor women  this is the castle of balchenburg was the reply the seigneur is the baron thereof for the nextshe shrugged her shouldersit must be one of baron rudigers ventures but i must go and fetch the ladies some supper ah the demoiselle surely needs it  and some water entreated eleanor  ah yes she replied trudchen shall bring some  the little girl presently reappeared with a pitcher as heavy as she could carry she could not understand french but looked much interested and very eager and curious as she brought in several of the bundles and mails of the travellers  thank the saints cried the lady they do not mean to strip us of our clothes  they have stolen us and that is enough for them said eleanor  jean lay apparently too much exhausted to take notice of what was going on and they hoped she might sleep while they moved about quietly the room seemed to be a cell in the hollow of the turret and there were two loophole windows to which eleanor climbed up but she could see nothing but the stars ah yonder is the plough just as when we looked out at it at dunbar oer the sea she sighed the only friendly thing i can see ah but the same god and the saints are with us still and she clasped her rosarys cross as she returned to her sister who was sighing out an entreaty for water  by and by the woman returned and with her the child she made a low reverence as she entered having evidently been informed of the rank of her captives a white napkin was spread over the great chest that served for a tablea piece of civilisation such as the dunbar captivity had not knownthree beechen bowls and spoons and a porringer containing a not unsavoury stew of a fowl in broth thickened with meal they tried to make their patient swallow a little broth but without much success though eleanor in the mountain air had become famished enough to make a hearty meal and feel more cheered and hopeful after it barbes evident sympathy and respect were an element of comfort and when jean revived enough to make some inquiry after poor skywing and it was translated into french there was an assurance that the hawk was cared forhopes even given of its presence barbe was not only compassionate but ready to answer all the questions in her power she was burgundian but her home having been harried in the wars her husband had taken service as a manatarms with the baron of balchenburg she herself becoming the bowerwoman of the baroness now dead since the death of the good lady whose influence had been some restraint everything had become much rougher and wilder and the lords of the castle standing on the frontier as it did had become closely connected with the feuds of germany as well as the wars in france the old baron had been lamed in a raid into burgundy since which time he had never left home and barbes husband had been killed her sons either slain or seeking their fortune elsewhere so that nothing was left to her but her little daughter gertrude for whose sake she earnestly longed to find her way down to more civilised and godly life but she was withheld by the difficulties in the path and the extreme improbability of finding a maintenance anywhere else as well as by a certain affection for her two barons and doubts what they would do without her since the elder was in broken health and the younger had been her nursling in fact she was the highest female authority in the castle and kept up whatever semblance of decency or propriety remained since her mistresss death all this came out in the way of grumbling or lamentation in the satisfaction of having some woman to confide in though her young master had made her aware of the rank of his captives every one it seemed had been taken by surprise he was in the habit of making expeditions on his own account and bringing home sometimes lawless comrades or followers sometimes booty but this time after taking great pains to furbish up a suit of armour brought home long ago he had set forth to the festivities at nanci the lands and castle were so situated that the old baron had done homage for the greater part to sigismund as duke of elsass and for another portion to king rene as duke of lorraine as whose vassal the young baron had appeared no more had been heard of him till one of his men hurried up with tidings that herr rudiger had taken a bevy of captives with plenty of spoil but that one was a lady much hurt for whom barbe must prepare her best  since this barbe had learnt from her young master that the injured lady was the sister of the dauphiness and a kings daughter and that every care must be taken of her and her sister for he was madly in love with her and meant her to be his wife  eleanor and madame de ste petronelle cried out at this with horror in a stifled way as barbe whispered it  too high too dangerous game for him i know said the old woman so said his father who was not a little dismayed when he heard who these ladies were  the king my brother the dauphin the duke of brittany began eleanor  alas the poor boy would never have ventured it but for encouragement sighed barbe treacherous i say it must be  i knew there was treachery exclaimed madame de ste petronelle so soon as i found which way our faces were turned  but who could or would betray us demanded eleanor  you need not ask that when your escort was led by andrew hall returned the elder lady poor young george of the red peel had only just told me so when the caitiffs fell on him and he came to his bloody death  hall then i marvel not said eleanor in a low awestruck voice my brother the dauphin could not have known  the old scotswoman refrained from uttering her belief that he knew only too well but by the time all this had been said barbe was obliged to leave them having arranged for the night that eleanor should sleep in the big bed beside her sister and their lady across it at their feeta not uncommon arrangement in those days  sleep however in spite of weariness was only to be had in snatches for poor jean was in much pain and very feverish besides being greatly terrified at their situation and full of grief and selfreproach for the poor young master of angus never dozing off for a moment without fancying she saw him dying and upbraiding her and for the most part tossing in a restless misery that required the attendance of one or both she had never known ailment before and was thus all the more wretched and impatient alarming and distressing eleanor extremely though madame de ste petronelle declared it was only a matter of course and that the lassie would soon be well  ah madame our comforter and helper said elleen  call me no french names dearies call me the leddy lindsay or dame elspeth as i should be at home we be all scots here in one sore stour if i could win a word to my son ritchie he would soon have us out of this place  would not barbe help us to a messenger  i doubt it she would scarce bring trouble on her lords but we might be worse off than with her  why does she not come i want some more drink moaned jean barbe did come and moreover brought not only water but some tisane of herbs that was good for fever and had been brewing all night and she was wonderfully goodhumoured at the patients fretful refusal though between coaxing and authority leddy lindsay managed to get it taken at last after margarets experience of her as a stern duenna her tenderness in illness and trouble was a real surprise  no keys were turned on them but there was little disposition to go beyond the door which opened on the stone stair in the gray wall the view from the windows revealed that they were very high up there was a bit of castle wall to be seen below and beyond a sea of forest the dark masses of pine throwing out the lighter more delicate sweeps of beech and pale purple distance beyondnot another building within view giving a sense of vast solitude to eleanors eyes more dreary than the sea at dunbar and far more changeless an occasional bird was all the variety to be hoped for  by and by barbe brought a message that her masters requested the ladies presence at the meal a dinner in fact served about an hour before noon eleanor greatly demurred but barbe strongly advised consent or my young lord will be coming up here she said they both wish to have speech of you and would have been here before now if my old lord were not so lame and the young one so shy the poor child  shy exclaimed eleanor after what he has dared to do to us  all the more for that very reason said barbe  true returned madame the savage who is most ferocious in his acts is most bashful in his breeding  how should my poor boy have had any breeding up here in the forests demanded barbe oh if he had only fixed his mind on a maiden of his own degree she might have brought the good days back but alas now he will be only bringing about his own destruction which the saints avert  it was agreed that eleanor had better make as royal and imposing an appearance as possible so instead of the plain camlet riding kirtles that she and lady lindsay had worn she donned a heraldic sort of garment a tissue of white and gold thread with the red lion ramping on back and breast and the double tressure edging all the hems part of the outfit furnished at her greatuncles expense in london but too gaudy for her taste and she added to her already considerable height by the tall veiled headgear that had been despised as unfashionable  jean from her bed cried out that she looked like pharaohs daughter in the tapestry and consented to be left to the care of little trudchen since madame de ste petronelle must act attendant and barbe evidently thought her young masters good behaviour might be the better secured by her presence  so at the bottom of the narrow stone stair eleanor shook out her plumes the attendant lady arranged her veil over her yellow hair and drew out her short train and long hanging sleeves a little behind the fashion but the more dignified as she swept into the ball and though her heart beat desperately holding her head stiff and high and looking every inch a princess the shrewd scotch lady behind her flattered herself that the two barons did look a little daunted by the bearing of the creature they had caught  the father who had somewhat the look of an old fox limped forward with a less ungraceful bow than the son who had more of the wolf some greeting was mumbled and the old man would have taken her hand to lead her to the highest place at table but she would not give it  i am no willing guest of yours sir she said perhaps alarmed at her own boldness but drawing herself up with great dignity i desire to know by what right my sister and i kings daughters on our way to king charless court have thus been seized and detained  we do not stickle as to rights here on the borders lady said the elder baron in bad french it would be wiser to abate a little of that outrecuidance of yours and listen to our terms  a captive has no choice save to listen returned eleanor but as to speaking of terms my brothersinlaw the dauphin and the duke of brittany may have something to say to them  exactly so replied the old baron in a tone of some irony which she did not like now lady our terms are these but understand first that all this affair is none of my seeking but my son here has been backed up in it by some whomon a grunt from sir rudigerthere is no need to name hethe more fool hehas taken a fancy to your sister though if all reports be true she has nought but her royal blood not so much as a denier for a dowry nor as ransom for either of you however this i will overlook dead loss as it is to me and mine and so your sister so soon as she recovers from her hurt will become my sons wife and i will have you and your lady safely conducted without ransom to the borders of normandy or brittany as you may list  and think you sir returned eleanor quivering with indignation that the daughter of a hundred kings is like to lower herself by listening to the suit of a petty robber baron of the marches  i do not think but i know that though i am a fool for giving in to my sons madness these are the only terms i propose and if you lady so deal with her as to make her accept them you are free without ransom to go where you will  you expect me to sell my sister said eleanor disdainfully  look you here broke in rudiger bursting out of his shyness she is the fairest maiden gentle or simple i ever saw i love her with all my heart if she be mine i swear to make her a thousand times more cared for than your sister the dauphiness and if all be true your scottish archers tell me you scottish folk have no great cause to disdain an elsass forest castle  an awkward recollection of the black knight of lorn came across eleanor but she did not lose her stately dignity  it is not the wealth or poverty that we heed she said but the nobility and princeliness  there is nothing to be done then son said the old baron but to wait a day or two and see whether the maiden herself will be less proud and more reasonable otherwise these ladies understand that there will be close imprisonment and diet according to the custom of the border till a thousand gold crowns be paid down for each of these sisters of a scotch king and five hundred for madame here and when that is like to be found the damoiselle herself may know and he laughed  we have those who will take care of our ransom said eleanor though her heart misgave her moreover duke sigismund will visit such an offence dearly and there was a glow on her cheeks  he knows better than to meddle with a vassal of lorraine said the old man  king rene began eleanor  he is too wary to meddle with a vassal of elsass sneered the baron no no lady ransom or wedding there lies your choice  with this there appeared to be a kind of truce perhaps in consequence of the appearance of a great pie and eleanor did not refuse to sit down to the table and partake of the food though she did not choose to converse whereas madame de ste petronelle thought it wiser to be as agreeable as she could and this in the opinion of the court of the dauphiness was not going very far  long before the barons and their retainers had finished little trudchen came hurrying down to say that the lady was crying and calling for her sister and eleanor was by no means sorry to hasten to her side though only to receive a petulant scolding for the desertion that had lasted so very long according to the sick girls sensations  matters remained in abeyance while the illness continued jean had a night of fever and when that passed under the experienced management of dame elspie as the sisters called her more and more she was very weak and sadly depressed sometimes she wept and declared she should die in these dismal walls like her mother at dunbar and never see jamie and mary again sometimes she blamed elleen for having put this mad scheme into her head sometimes she fretted for her cousins lilias and annis of glenuskie and was sure it was all elleens fault for having let themselves be separated from sir patrick while at others she declared the drummonds faithless and disloyal for having gone after their own affairs and left the only true and leal heart to die for her and then came fresh floods of tears though sometimes as she passionately caressed skywing she declared the hawk to be the only faithful creature in existence  baron rudiger was evidently very uneasy about her barbe reported how gloomy and miserable he was and how he relieved his feelings by beating the unfortunate man who had been leading the horse and in a wiser manner by seeking fish in the torrent and birds on the hills for her refreshment and even helping trudchen to gather the mountain strawberries for her this was however so far from a recommendation to jean that after the first barbe gave it to be understood that all were trudchens providing  they suspected that barbe nattered and soothed her boy as she termed him with hopes but they owed much to the species of authority with which she kept him from forcing himself upon them eleanor sometimes tried to soothe her sister and while away the time with her harp the scotch songs were a great delight to dame elspie but they made jean weep in her weakness and elleens great resource was king renes parting gift of the tales of huon de bourdeaux with its wonderful chivalrous adventures and the appearances of the dwarf oberon and she greatly enjoyed the idea of the pleasure it would give jamieif ever she should see jamie again and she wondered too whether the duke of the tirol knew the storywhich even at some moments amused jean  there was a stair above their chamber likewise in the thickness of the wall which barbe told them they might safely explore and thence eleanor discovered that the castle was one of the small but regularlybuilt fortresses not uncommon on the summit of hills it was an octagonas complete as the ground would permitwith a huge wall and a tower at each angle one face that on the most accessible side was occupied by the keep in which they were with a watchtower raising its finger and banner above them the little squat round towers around not lifting their heads much above the battlements of the wall the descent on most of the sides was almost precipitous on two entirely so while in the rear another steep hill rose so abruptly that it seemed to frown over them though separated by a ravine  nothing was to be seen all round but the tops of treesdark pines beeches and chestnuts in the gay light green of spring a hopeless and oppressive waste of verdure where occasionally a hawk might be seen to soar and whence the howlings of wolves might be heard at night  jean was in a week so well that there was no cause for deferring the interview any longer and indeed she was persuaded that elleen had not been half resolute or severe enough and that she could soon show the two barons that they detained her at their peril still she looked white and thin and needed a scarf for her arm when she caused herself to be arrayed as splendidly as her sister had been and descended to the hall where like eleanor she took the initiative by an appeal against the wrong and injustice that held two freeborn royal ladies captive  he who has the power may do as he wills my pretty damsel replied the old baron once for all as i told your sister these threats are of no avail though they sound well to puff up your little airs your own kingdom is a long way off and breeds more men than money and as to our neighbours they dare not embroil themselves by meddling with us borderers you had better take what we offer far better than aught your barbarous northern lords could give and then your sister will be free without ransom to depart or to stay here till she finds another bold baron of the marches to take her to wife ha thou rudiger why dost stand staring like a wild pig in a pit canst not speak a word for thyself  she shall be my queen said rudiger hoarsely bumping himself down on his knees and trying to master her hand but she drew it away from him  as if i would be queen of a mere nest of robbers and freebooters she said you forget messires that my sister is daughterinlaw to the king of france we must long ago have been missed and i expect every hour that my brother the dauphin will be here with his troops  thats what you expect so you do not know my proud demoiselle that my son would scarce have been rash enough to meddle with such lofty gear for all his folly if he had not had a hint that maidens with royal blood but no royal portions were not wanted at court and might be had for the picking up  it is a brutal falsehood or else a mere invention of the traitor halls our fathers murderer said jean with flashing eyes i would have you to know both of you my lords that were we betrayed and forsaken by every kinsman we have i will not degrade the blood royal of scotland by mating it with a rude and petty freebooter you may keep us captives as you will but you will not break our spirit  so saying jean swept back to the stairs turning a deaf ear to the barons chuckle of applause and murmur a gallant spirited dame she will make thee my junker and hold out the castle well against all foes when once she is broken in  jean and eleanor alike disbelieved that louis could have encouraged this audacious attempt but they were dismayed to find that madame de ste petronelle thought it far from improbable for she believed him capable of almost any underhand treachery she did however believe that though there might be some delay a stir would be made if only by her own son which would end in their situation being publicly known and final release coming if jean could only be patient and resolute  but to the poor girl it seemed as if the ground were cut from under her feet and as her spirits drooped more and more there were times when she said elleen i must consent i have been the death of the one true heart that was mine why should i hold out any longer and make thee and dame elspie wear out your days in this dismal forest hold never shall i be happy again so it matters not what becomes of me  it matters to me said elleen sister thinkest thou i could go away to be happy leaving thee bound to this rude savage in his donjon fie jean this is not worthy of king jamess daughter he spent all those years of patience in captivity and shall we lose heart in a few days  is it a few days it is like years  that is because thou hast been sick see now let us dance and sing so that the jailers may know we are not daunted we have been shut up ere now god brought us out and he will again and we need not pine  ah then we were children and had seen nothing better andand there was not his blood on me  and jean fell aweeping     chapter 10 tender and true        for i am now the earlis son       and not a banished manthe nutbrown maid   o st andrew st bride our lady of succour st denysall the lave of you that may be nearest in this fremd landcome and aid him it

bloodopen his eencome to help ane that ever loved you and did you honour  so wailed ringan of the raefoot holding his masters head on his knees and binding up as best he might an ugly thrust in the side and a blow which had crushed the steel cap into the midst of the hair when he saw his master fall and the ladies captured he had with the better part of valour rushed aside and hid himself in the thicket of thorns and hazels where being manifestly only a stray horseboy no search was made for him he rightly concluded that dead or alive his master might thus be better served than by vainly struggling over his fallen body  it seemed as though in answer to his invocation a tremor began to pass through douglass frame and as ringan exclaimed there therehe lives sir sir blessings on the saints i was sure that a french reivers lance could never be the end of the master george opened his eyes  what is it he said faintly where are the ladies  heed not the leddies the noo sir but let me bind your head that cap has crushed like an eggshell and has cut you worse than the sword bide still sir i say if ye mean to do any gude another time  the ladiesringan  the loons rid aff wi them sirup towards the hills yonder nay but if ye winna thole to let me bind your wound how dye think to win to their aid or ever to see bonnie scotland again  george submitted to this reasoning but as his senses returned asked if all the troop had gone  na sir the ane with that knight who was at the tourneya plague light on himwent aff with the leddiesup yonder but they as they called the escortthe archers of the guard as they behoved to call themselvesthey rid aff by the way that we came bythe traitor loons  ah it was black treachery follow the track of the ladies ringanheed not me  mickle gude that wad do sir if i left you bleeding here na na i maun see you safely bestowed first before i meet with ony other im the douglass man no the stewarts  then will i after them cried george of angus starting up but he staggered and had to catch at ringan  there was no water near nothing to refresh or revive him had been left ringan looked about in anxiety and distress on the desolate scenebare heath on one side thicket gradually rising into forest and mountain on the other suddenly he gave a long whistle and to his great joy there was a crackling among the bushes and he beheld the shaggyfaced pony on which he had ridden all the way from yorkshire and which had no doubt eluded the robbers there was a bundle at the saddlebow and after a little coquetting the pony allowed itself to be caught and a leathern bottle was produced from the bag containing something exceedingly sour but with an amount of strength in it which did something towards reviving the master  i can sit the pony he said let us after them  nae sic fulery said ringan i ken better what sorts a green wound like yours sir sit the pony ye may but to be safely bestowed ere i stir a foot after the leddies  george broke out into fierce language and angry commands none of which ringan heeded in the least  hist he cried theres some one on the road come into shelter sir  he was half dragging half supporting his master to the concealment of the bushes when he perceived that the newcomers were two friars cowled black gowned corded and barefooted  there will be help in them he muttered placing his master with his back against a tree for the late contention had produced such fresh exhaustion that it was plain the wounds were more serious than he had thought at first  the two friars men with homely weatherbeaten but simple good faces came up startled at seeing a wounded man on the wayside and ready to proffer assistance  need like george douglass was of all languages and besides ringan had among the exigencies of the journey picked up something by which he could make himself moderately well understood the brethren stooped over the wounded man and examined his wounds one of them produced some oil from a flask in his wallet and though poor georges own shirt was the only linen available they contrived to bandage both hurts far more effectually than ringan could  they asked whether this was the effect of a quarrel or the work of robbers  routiers ringan said the ladieswe guarded themthey carried them offup there  what ladiesthe scottish princesses asked one of the friars for they had been at nanci and knew who had been assembled there besides that the scot was known enough all over france for the nationality of ringan and his master to have been perceived at once  george understood this and answered vehemently i must follow them and save them  in good time with the saints blessing replied brother benigne soothingly but healing must come first we must have you to our poor house yonder where you will be well tended  george was lifted to the ponys back and supported in the saddle by ringan and one of the brethren he had been too much dazed by the cut on the head to have any clear or consecutive notion as to what they were doing with him or what passed round him and ringan did his best to explain the circumstances and thought it expedient to explain that his master was grand seigneur in his own country and would amply repay whatever was done for him the which brother gerard gave him to understand was of no consequence to the sons of st francis the brothers had no doubt that the outrage was committed by the balchenburg baron the ally of the ecorcheurs and routiers the terrors of the country in his impregnable castle no doubt they said he meant to demand a heavy ransom from the good king and dauphin for the honour of scotland ringan though convinced that hall had his share in the treason withheld that part of the story to him and still more to his master the journey seemed endless though in reality it was not more than two miles before they arrived at a little oasis of wheat and orchards growing round a vineclad building of reddish stone with a spire rising in the midst  here the porter opened the gate in welcome the history was volubly told the brotherinfirmarer was summoned and the master of angus was deposited in a much softer bed than the good friars allowed themselves there the infirmarer tended him in broken feverish sleep all night ringan lying on a pallet near and starting up at every moan or murmur but with early dawn when the brethren were about to sing prime the lad rose up and between signs and words made them understand that he must be released pointing towards the mountains and comporting himself much like a dog who wanted to be let out  perceiving that he meant to follow the track of the ladies the friars not only opened the doors to him but gave him a piece of black barley bread with which he shot off like an arrow from a bow towards the place where the catastrophe had taken place  george douglass mind wandered a good deal from the blow on his head and it was not till two or three days had elapsed that he was able clearly to understand what his follower had discovered almost with the instinct of a red indian ringan had made his way at first indeed the bushes had been sufficiently trampled for the track to be easy to find but after the beechtrees with no underwood had been reached he had often very slight indications to guide him where the halt had taken place however by the brookside there were signs of trampling and even a few remnants of food and after a long climb higher he had come on the marks of the fall of a horse and picked up a piece of a torn veil which he recognised at once as belonging to the lady joanna he inferred a struggle what had they been doing to her  faithful ringan had climbed on and at length had come below the castle he had been far too cautious to show himself while light lasted but availing himself of the shelter of trees and of the projections he had pretty well reconnoitred the castle as it stood on its steep slopes of turf on the rounded summit of the hill only scarped away on one side whence probably the materials had been taken  there could be no doubt that this was the prison of the princesses and the character of the barons of balchenburg was only too well known to the good franciscans  soevi et feroces said the prior to george for latin had turned out to be the most available medium of communication spite of scotts averment in the mouth of georges grandson bell the cat that            thanks to st bothan son of mine            save gawain neer could pen a line  the douglases were far too clever to go without education and young nobles who knew anything knew a little latin there was a consultation over what was to be done and the prior undertook to send one of his brethren into nanci with ringan to explain the matter to king rene or if he had left nanci for provence to the governor left in charge but a frontier baron like balchenburg was a very serious difficulty to one so scrupulous in his relations with his neighbours as was good king rene  a man of piety peace and learning said the prior and therefore despised by lawless men like a sheep among wolves though happy are we in living under such a prince  then whats the use of him and all his raree shows demanded the scot if he can neither hinder two peaceful maids from being carried off nor will stir a finger to deliver them much should we heed borders and kings if it had been a ridley or a graeme who had laid hands on them  however he consented to the priors proposal and the incongruous pair set out togetherthe soberpaced friar on the convent donkey and ringan on his shaggy ponyboth looking to civilised eyes equally rough and unkempt at the gates they heard that king rene had the day before set forth on his way to aix which boded ill for them since more might be hoped from the impulsive chivalry of the king than from the strict scrupulosity of a responsible governor  but they had not gone far on their way across the place de la carriere where the tournament had been held before ringan startled his companion with a perfect howl which had in it however an element of ecstasy as he dashed towards a tall bony figure in a blue cap buff coat and shepherds plaid over one shoulder  archie o the brake archie oh yere a sight for sair een how cam ye here  eh was the answer equally astonished wha is it that cries on me here eh eh tis never ringan of the raefootsae braw and grand  for ringan was a wonderful step before him in civilisation  querieshow cam ye here and whar is the masterwere rapidly exchanged while the friar looked on in amaze at the two wildlooking men about whom other tall scots more or less well equipped began to gather coming from a hostelry near at hand  the earl of angus as they told him had been neither to have nor to hold when first his embassy to dunbar came back and his son was found to be missing he had been very near besieging the young king until bishop kennedy had convinced him that no one of the court had suspected the masters presence far less connived at his disappearance the truth had been suspected before long though there was no certainty until the letter that george douglas had at last vouchsafed to write had after spending a good deal of time on the road at last reached tantallon then the earl had declared that since his son had set out on this fools errand he should be suitably furnished for the heir of angus and should play his part as became him in their sports at nanci whither his letter said he was bound instead of figuring as a mere groom of drummond of glenuskie and still worse in the train of a lowborn englishman like de la pole  so he had sent off ten lances under a stout kinsman who had campaigned in france beforesir robert douglas of harsidewith all their followers and full equipment such as might befit the heir of a branch of the great house of the bleeding heart but their voyage had not been prosperous and after riding from flanders they had found the wedding over and no one in the hostel having heard of the young master of angus nor even having distinguished sir patrick drummoud though there was a vague idea that the scottish kings sisters had been there  sir robert douglas had gone to have an interview with the governor left in charge thus the separation of the party became known to himhow the drummonds had gone to paris and the scottish ladies had set forth for chalons but there was nothing to show with whom the master had gone no sooner then had he come forth than half his men were round him shouting that here was ringan of the raefoot that the master had been foully betrayed and that he was lying sair wounded at a priory not far off  ringan a perfectly happy man among those who not only had scots tongues but the bleeding heart on shield and breast was brought up to him and told of the attack and capture of the princesses and of the masters wounds  sir robert after many imprecations turned back to the governor who heard the story in a far more complete form than if it had been related to him by ringan and the friar  but his hands were tied till he could communicate with king rene for border warfare was strictly forbidden and unfortunately duke sigismund had left nanci some days before for luxembourg to meet the duke of burgundy  however just as george douglas had persuaded the infirmarer to let him put on his clothes there had been a clanging and jangling in the outer court and the lion and eagle banner was visible duke sigismund had drawn up there to water the horses and to partake of any hospitality the prior might offer him  the first civilities were passing between them when a tall figure his red hair crossed by a bandage his ruddy face paled his steps faltering came stumbling forward to the porch crying in his wonderful dialect between latin and french sire domine dux justitia you loved the lady eleanor free her they are prisoners to latroniun routiersceleratissimoreiverbalchenburg  sigismund ponderous and not very rapid opened wide his big blue eyes while the prior explained in french it is even so beau sire this poor manatarms was found bleeding on the wayside by our brethren having been left for dead by the robbers of balchenburg who it seems descended on the ladies dispersed their escort and carried them off to the castle  sigismund made some tremendously emphatic exclamation in german and turned upon douglas to interrogate him they had very little of common language but sigismund knew french though he hated it and was not devoid of latin so that the narrative was made tolerably clear to him and he had no doubts or scruples as to instantly calling the latrones to account and releasing the ladies he paced up and down the guestchamber his spurs clattering against the stone pavement growling imprecations in guttural german now and then tugging at his long fair hair as he pictured eleanor in the miscreants power putting queries to george more than could be understood or answered and halting at door or window to shout orders to his knights to be ready at once for the attack george was absolutely determined that whatever his own condition he would not be left behind though he could only go upon ringans pony and was evidently in sigismunds opinion only a faithful groom  it was hard to say whether he was relieved or not when there was evidently a vehement altercation in german between the duke and a tough grizzled old knight the upshot of which turned out to be that the ritter gebhardt von fuchstein absolutely refused to proceed through those pine and beech forests so late in the day since it would be only too easy to lose the way and there might be ambuscades or the like if balchenburg and his crew were on the watch and there was no doubt that they were allied with all the rentiers in the country  sigismund raged but he was in some degree under the dominion of his prudent old marskalk and had to submit while george knew that another night would further restore him and would besides bring back his attendant  the next hour brought more than he had expected again there was a clattering of hoofs a few words with the porter and to the utter amazement of the prior as well as of duke sigismund who had just been served with a meal of franciscan diet a knight in full armour with the crowned heart on his breast dashed into the hall threw a hasty bow to the prior and throwing his arms round the wounded manatarms cried aloud geordiethe masterye daft callant see what you have brought yourself to what would the yerl your father say  i trow that i have been striving to do my devoir to my lieges sisters answered george how does my fatherand my mother make your obeisance to the duke of the tirol rab ye can knap the french with him better than i now i can go with him as becomes a yerls son for the freedom of the lady  sir robert a veteran scot who knew the french world well was soon explaining matters to duke sigismund who presently advanced to the heir of angus wrung his hand and gave him to understand that he accepted him as a comrade in their doughty enterprise and honoured his proceeding as a piece of knighterrantry he was free from any question whether george was to be esteemed a rival by hearing it was the lady joanna for whose sake he thus adventured himself whereas it was not her beauty but her sisters intellect that had won the heart of sigismund perhaps sir robert somewhat magnified the grandeur of the house of douglas for sigismund seemed to view the young man as an equal which he was not as the hapsburgs of alsace and the tirol were sovereign princes but on the other hand george could count princesses among his ancestresses and only jeans personal ambition had counted his as a mesalliance  it was determined to advance upon the castle of balchenburg the next morning the ten scottish lances being really forty men making the douglass troop not much inferior to the alsatian  a nights rest greatly restored george and equipments had been brought for him which made him no longer appear only the manatarms but the gallant young nobleman though not yet entitled to the golden spurs  ringan served as their guide up the long hills through the woods up steep slippery slopes where it became expedient to leave behind the big heavy warhorses under a guard while the rest pushed forward the master of anguss long legs nearly touching the ground as not to waste his strength he was mounted on ringans surefooted pony which seemed at home among mountains sigismund himself and the tirolese among his followers were chamoishunters and used enough to climbing and thus at length they found themselves at the foot of the green rounded slopes of the talchen or ballon crowned by the fortress with its eight cornerturrets and the broader keep  were elleen and jean looking outwhen the alsatian trumpeter came forward in full array and blew three sonorous blasts echoing among the mountains and doubtless bringing hope to the prisoners the rugged walls of the castle had however an imperturbable look and there was nothing responsive at the gateway  a pursuivant then stood forthfor sigismund had gone in full state to his intended wooing at nanciand called upon the baron of balchenburg to open his gates to his liege lord the duke of alsace  on this a wicket was opened in the gate but the answer in a hoarse shout was that the baron of balchenburg owned allegiance only under the emperor frederick to king rene duke of lorraine  what hot words were thereupon spoken between sigismund gebhardt and the two douglases it scarcely needs to tell but looking at the strength of the castle it was agreed that it would be wiser to couple with the second summons an assurance that though duke sigismund was the lawful lord of the mountain and entrance was denied at the peril of the baron yet he would remit his first wrath provided the royal ladies foully and unjustly detained there in captivity were instantly delivered up in all safety  to this the answer came back with a sound of derisive mockeryone was the intended wife of baron rudiger the other should be delivered up to the duke upon ransom according to her quality  the ransom i will pay roared sigismund in german shall be by the axe and cord  the while george douglas gnashed his teeth with rage when the reply as to jean had been translated to him the duke hurled his fierce defiance at the castle it should be levelled with the ground and the robbers should suffer by cord wheel and axe  but what was the use of threats against men within six or eight feet every way of stone wall with a steep slippery slope leading up to it heavily armed horsemen were of no avail against it even if there were nothing but old women inside there was no means of making an entrance sigismund possessed three rusty cannon made of bars of iron hooped together but they were no nearer than strasburg and if they had been at hand there was no getting them within distance of those walls  there was nothing for it but to blockade the castle while sending after king rene for assistance and authority the worst of it was that starving the garrison would be starving the captives and likewise so far up on the mountain a troop of eighty or ninety men and horses were as liable to lack of provisions as could be the besieged garrison villages were distant and transport not easy to find money was never abundant with duke sigismund and had nearly all been spent on the entertainments at nanci nor could he make levies as lord of the countryfolk since the more accessible were not alsatian but lorrainers and to exasperate their masters by raids would bring fresh danger indeed the two nearest castles were on lorraine territory their masters had not a much better reputation than the balchenburgs and with the temptation of warhorses and men in their most holiday equipment were only too likely to interpret sigismunds attack as an invasion of their dukedom and to fall in strength upon the party  all this gebhardt represented in strong colours recommending that this untenable position should not be maintained  sigismund swore that nothing should induce him to abandon the unhappy ladies  nay my lord duke it is only to retreat till king rene sends his forces and mayhap the french dauphin  to retreat would be to prolong their misery nay the felons would think them deserted and work their will out upon such craven counsel  the captive ladies may be secured from an injury if your lordship holds a parley demands the amount of ransom and without pledging yourself undertakes to consult the dauphin and their other kinsmen on the matter  detained here in i know not what misery exposed to insults endless never gebhardt i marvel that you can make such proposals to any belted knight  gebhardt grumbled out rather to a demented lover the lord duke will sing another tune ere long  certainly it looked serious the next day when sir robert douglas had had the greatest difficulty in hindering a handtohand fight between the scots and alsatians for a strip of meadow land for pasture for their horses when a few loaves of black bread were all that could be obtained from one village and in another there had been a fray with the peasants resulting in blows by way of payment for a lean cow and calf and four sheep the tirolese laid the blame on the scots the scots upon the tirolese and though disputes between his tirolese and alsatian followers had been the constant trouble of sigismund at nanci they now joined in making common cause against the scots so that gebhardt strongly advised that these should be withdrawn to nanci for the present the which advice george douglas hotly resented he had as good a claim to watch the castle as the duke he was not going to desert his kings sisters far less the lady he had followed from scotland if any one was to be ordered off it should be the fat lazy alsatians who were good for nothing but to ride big flemish horses and were useless on a mountain  gebhardt and robert douglas both experienced men of the world found it one of their difficulties to keep the peace between their young lords and each day was likely to render it more difficult they began to represent that it could be made a condition that the leaders should be permitted to see the ladies and ascertain whether they were treated with courtesy and there was a certain inclination on sigismunds part when he was driven hard by his embarrassments to allow this to be proposed  the very notion of coming to any terms made geordie furious if the craven dutchman chose to sneak off and go in search of a ransom forsooth he would lie at the foot of the castle till he had burrowed through the walls or found a way over the battlements  ay said douglas of harside drily or till the baron sticks you in the thrapple or his next neighbour throws you into his dungeon  in the meantime the captives themselves were suffering as may well be believed agonies of suspense their loophole did not look out towards the gateway but they heard the peals of the trumpet started up with joy and thought their deliverance was come eleanor threw herself on her knees lady lindsay began to collect their properties jean made a rush for the stair leading to the top of the turret but she found her way barred by one of the few menatarms who held his pike towards her in a menacing manner  she tried to gaze from the window but it told her nothing except that a certain murmur of voices broke upon the silence of the woods nothing more befell them they eagerly interrogated barbe  ah yes lady birds she said there is a gay company without all in glittering harness asking for you but my lords know tis like a poor frog smelling at a walnut for any knight of them all to try to make way into this castle  who are they for pitys sake tell us dear barbe entreated eleanor  they say it is the duke himself but he has never durst meddle with my lords before all but the hawks tower is in lorraine and my lord can bring a storm about his ears if he lifts a finger against us a messenger would soon bring banget and steintour upon him but never you fear fair ladies you have friends and he will come to terms said good old barbe divided between pity for her guests and loyalty to her masters  if it is the duke he will free you elleen said jean weeping he will not care for me  jeanie jeanie could you think i would be set free without you  you might not be able to help yourself tis you that the german wants  never shall he have me if he be such a recreant mansworn fellow as to leave my sister to the reiver never  ah if poor geordie were there he would have moved heaven and earth to save me but there is none to heed me now and jean fell into a passion of weeping  when they had to go down to supper the younger baron received them with the newsso ladies the duke has been shouting his threats at us but this castle is too hard a nut for the like of him  i have seen others crack their teeth against it said his father and they both laughed a hoarse derisive laugh  the ladies vouchsafed not a word till they were allowed to retire to their chamber   they listened in the morning for the sounds of an assault but none came there was absolutely nothing but an occasional hum of voices and clank of armour when summoned to the midday meal it was scanty  ay said the elder baron we shall have to live hard for a day or two but those outside will live harder  till they fall out and cut one anothers throats said his son fasting will not mend the temper of hans of schlingen and michel au bec rouge  or till banget descends on him for meddling on lorraine ground added old balchenburg eat lady he added to jean your meals are not so large that they will make much odds to our stores we have corn and beer enough to starve out those greedy knaves outside  poor jean was nearly out of her senses with distress and uncertainty and being still weak was less able to endure she burst into violent hysterical weeping and had to be helped up to her own room where she sometimes lay on her bed sometimes raged up and down the room heaping violent words on the head of the tardy cowardly german sometimes talking of loosing skywing to show they were in the castle and cognisant of what was going on but it was not certain that skywing with the lion rampant on his hood would fly down to the besiegers so that she would only be lost  eleanor by the very need of soothing her sister was enabled to be more tranquil besides there was pleasure in the knowledge that sigismund had come after her and there was imagination enough in her nature to trust to the true knight daring any amount of dragons in his ladys cause and the lady always had to be patient     chapter 11 fetters broken        then long and loud the victor shout      from turret and from tower rang out         the rugged walls replied              scott lord of the isles   sir i have something to show you  it was the early twilight of a summers morning when ringan crept up to the shelter of pine branches under which george douglas was sleeping after hotly opposing gebhardt who had nearly persuaded his master that retreat was inevitable unless he meant to be deserted by more than half his men  george sat up anent the ladies he said  ringan bowed his head with an air of mystery and george doubted no longer but let him lead the way keeping among the brushwood to the foot of the quarry whence the castle had been built it had once been absolutely precipitous no doubt but the stone was of a soft quality on which weather told ivy and creepers had grown on it and ringan pointed to what to dwellers on plains might have seemed impracticable but to those who had birdsnested on the crags of tantallon had quite a different appearance true there was castle wall and turret above but on this the weather side there had likewise been a slight crumbling which had been neglected perhaps from over security perhaps on account of the extreme difficulty of repairing where there was the merest ledge for foothold above the precipitous quarry indeed the condition of the place might never even have been perceived by the inhabitants as there were no traces of the place below having been frequented  tis a mere staircase as far as the foot of the walls compared with the guillemots crag observed ringan  and a man with a heart and a foot could be up the wall in the corner where the ivy grows added george it is well ringan thou hast done good service here is the way  with four or five of our own tall carles we may win the castle and laugh at the german pockpuddings added ringan let them gang their gate and well free our leddies  george was tempted but he shook his head that were scarce knightly towards the duke he said he has been gude friend to me and i may not thus steal a march on him moreover we ken na the strength of the loons within  i misdoot there being mair than ten of them said ringan i have seen the same faces too often for there to be many and what there be we shall take napping  that was true nevertheless george douglas felt bound in honour not to undertake the enterprise without the cognisance of his ally though he much doubted the germans being alert or courageous enough to take advantage of such a perilous clamber  sigismund had a tent under the pinetrees and a guard before the entrance who stood halbert in hand like a growling statue when the young scot would have entered understanding not one word of his objurgations in mixed scotch and french but only barring the way till sigismunds own wer da sounded from within  moigeorge of angus shouted that individual in his awkward french let me in sir duke i have tidings  sigismund was on foot in a moment and from king eene he asked  far better strong heart and steady foot can achieve the adventure and save the ladies unaided come with me beau sire silently  george had fully expected to see the german quail at the frightful precipice and sheer wall before him but the hapsburg was primarily a tirolean mountaineer and he measured the rock with a glistening triumphant eye  man can he said that will we brave sire your hand on it  the days were almost at their longest and it was about five in the morning the sun only just making his way over the screen of the higher hills to the northeast though it had been daylight for some time  prudence made the two withdraw under the shelter of the woods and there they built their plan both young men being gratified to do so without their two advisers  neither of them doubted his own footing and george was sure that three or four of the men who had come with sir robert were equally good cragsmen sigismund sighed for some tirolese whom he had left at home but he had at least one man with him ready to dare any height and he thought a rope would make all things sure nothing could be attempted till the next night or rather morning and sigismund decided on sending a messenger down to the franciscans to borrow or purchase a rope while george and ringan more used to shifts proceeded to twist together all the horses halters they could collect so as to form a strong cable  to avert suspicion sigismund appeared to have yielded to the murmurs of his people and sent more than half his troop down the hill in the expectation that he was about to follow the others were withdrawn under one clump of wood the scotsmen under another with orders to advance upon the gateway of the castle so soon as they should hear a summons from the dukes bugle or the cry a douglas neither sir gebhardt nor sir robert was young enough or light enough to attempt the climb each would fain have withheld his master had it been possible but they would have their value in dealing with the troop waiting below  so it came to pass that when eleanor anxious sorrowful heated and weary awoke at daydawn and crept from the side of her sleeping sister to inhale a breath of morning breeze and murmur a morning prayer as she gazed from her loophole over the woods with a vague neverquenchable hope of seeing something she became aware of something very stealthy belowthe rustling of a fox or a hare in the fern mayhap though she could not see to the bottom of the quarry but she clung to the bar craned forward and beheld far down a shaking of the ivy and whiteflowered rowan then a hand grasping the root of a little sturdy birch then a yellow head gradually drawn up till a thin bony alert figure was for a moment astride on the birch reaching higher the sunburnt freckled face was lifted up and eleanors heart gave a great throb of hope was it not the wild boy ringan raefoot she could not turn away her head she durst not even utter a word to those within lest it should be a mere fancy or a lad from the country birdsnesting higher higher he went lost for a moment among the leaves and branches then attaining a crag in some giddy manner but butwhat was that head under a steel cap that had appeared on the tree what was that face raised for a moment was it the face of the dead eleanor forced back a cry and felt afraid of wakening herself from what she began to think only a blissful dreamall the more when that length of limb had reared itself and attained to the dizzy crag above a fairer but more solid face with a long upper lip appeared mounting in its turn she durst not believe her eyes and she was not conscious of making any sound unless it was the vehement beating of her own heart but perhaps it was the power of her own excitement that communicated itself to her sleeping sister for jeans voice was heard what is it elleen what is it  she signed back with her hand to enjoin silence for her sense began to tell her that this must be reality and that castles had before now been thus surprised by brave scotsmen jean was out of bed and at the loophole in a moment there was room for only one and eleanor yielded the place the less reluctantly that the fair head had reached the part veiled by the tree and jeans eyes would be an evidence that she herself might trust her own sight  jeans glance first fell on the backs of the ascending figures now above the crag ah ah she cried under her breath a surprisea rescue oh the ladstretching spreading the man below is holding his foot oh that tuft of grass wont bear him his knees are up yesyes he is even with the top of the wall now elleen hope brave laddie whytisyestis ringan now the other the muckle carleah and then a sudden breathless silence came over her  eleanor knew she had recognised that figure  madame de ste petronelle was awake now asking what this meant  deliverance whispered eleanor they are scaling the wall oh jean one moment  i canna i canna cried jean grasping the iron bar with all her might i see his face he is there on the ledge at fit of the wall in life and strength ringanyes ringan is going up the wall like a cat  where is he is he safethe duke i would say gasped eleanor oh let me see jeanie  the duke is it ah geordie is giving a hand to help him on the ground tak tent tak tent geordie dinna coup ower ah they are baith there and onetwothree muckle fellows are coming after them  climbing up there exclaimed the dame bustling up god speed them those are joes worth having leddies  there theregeordie is climbing now st bride speed him and hide them well done duke he hoisted him so far now his hand is on that broken stone up up his foot is in the cleft now his handohclasps the ivy god help him ah he feels about yes he has it nownow the top of the battlement i see no more they are letting down a rope your duke disna climb like my geordie elleen  oh for mercys sake to your prayers dinna wrangle about your joes bairns cried madame de ste petronelle the castles no won yet  but is as good as won said eleanor there are barely twelve fighting men in it and sorry loons are the maist how many are up yet jeanie  theres a fifth since the duke yet to come up answered jean eight altogether counting the gallant ringan there  tis the warders horn they have been seen and the poor women clasped their hands in fervent prayer with ears intent but jean suddenly darted towards her clothes and they hastily attired themselves then cautiously peeped out at their door since neither sight nor sound came to them from either window the guard who had hindered their passage was no longer there and jean led the way down the spiral stairs at the slit looking into the court they heard cries and the clash of arms but it was too high above their heads for anything to be seen and they hastened on  there also in the narrow court was a fight going onbut nearly ended geordie douglas knelt over the prostrate form of rudiger von balchenburg calling on him to yield but meeting no answer one or two other men lay overthrown three or four more were pressed up against a wall howling for mercy sigismund was shouting to them in germanringan and the other assailants standing guard over them but evidently hardly withheld from slaughtering them the maidens stood for a moment then jeans scream of welcome died on her lips for as he looked up from his prostrate foe and though he had not yet either spoken or risen sigismund had stepped to his side and laid his sword on his shoulder  victor said he in the name of god and st mary i make thee chevalier rise sire george of douglas  true knight cried jean leaping to his side oh geordie geordie thou hast saved us thou noblest knight  ah lady it canna be helpit said the new knight tis no treason to your brother to be dubbed after a fair fight though tis by a dutch prince  thy kings sister shall mend that and bind your spurs said jean is the reiver dead geordie  even so was the reply my sword has spared his craig from the halter  such were the times and such jeans breeding that she looked at the fallen enemy much as a modern lady may look at a slain tiger  eleanor had meantime met sigismund with ah well i knew that you would come to our aid so true a knight must achieve the adventure  safe safe i am blessed and thankful said the duke falling on one knee to kiss her hand how have these robbers treated my lady  well as well as they know how that good woman has been very kind to us said eleanor as she saw barbe peeping from the stair come hither barbe and trudchen to the lord dukes mercy  they were entering the hall and at the same moment the gates were thrown open and the men waiting with gebhardt and robert douglas began to pour in it was well for barbe and her daughter that they could take shelter behind the ladies for the men were ravenous for some prize or something to wreak their excitement upon besides the bare walls of the castle and its rude stores of meal and beer the old baron was hauled down from his bed by halfadozen men and placed before the duke with bound hands  hola siege said he in german all unabashed you have got me at lastby a trick i always bade rudiger look to that quarry but young men think they know best  the old traitor said george in french hang him from his tower for a warning to his like as we should do in scotland  what cause have you to show why we should not do as saith the knight said sigismund  i care little how it goes with my old carcase now returned balchenburg in the spirit of the amalekite of old i only mourn that i shall not be there to see the strife you will breed with the lutetwanger or his fellows at nanci  gebhardt here gave his opinion that it would be wise to reserve the old man for king renes justice so as to obviate all peril of dissension the small garrison to be left in the castle under the most prudent knight whom gebhardt could select were instructed only to profess to hold it till the lords of alsace and lorraine should jointly have determined what was to be done with it  it was not expedient to tarry there long a hurried meal was made and then the victors set out on the descent george had found his good steed in the stables together with the ladies palfreys and there had been great joy in the mutual recognition but jeans horse was found to show traces of its fall and her arm was not yet entirely recovered so that she was seated on ringans surefooted pony with the newmade knight walking by her side to secure its every step though ringan grumbled that sheltie would be far safer if left to his own wits  sigismund was proposing to make for sarrebourg when the glittering of lances was seen in the distance and the troop was drawn closely together for the chance that as had been already thought probable some of the lorrainers had risen as to war and invasion however the banner soon became distinguishable with the many quarterings showing that king rene was there in person and sigismund rode forward to greet him and explain  the chivalrous king was delighted with the adventure only wishing he had shared in the rescue of the captive princesses young blood he said youth has all the guerdons reserved for it while age is lagging behind  yet so soon as sir patrick drummond had overtaken him at epinal he had turned back to nanci and it was in consequence of what he there heard that he had set forth to bring the robbers of balchenburg to reason to him there was no difficulty in accepting thankfully what some would have regarded as an aggression on the part of the duke of alsace and though old balchenburg when led up before him seemed bent upon aggravating him ha sir king so a young german and a wild scot have done what you with all your kingdoms have never had the wit to do  the poor old man is distraught said the king while sigismund put in  mayhap because you never ventured on such audacious villainy and outrecuidance before  young blood will have its way repeated the old man nay i told the lad no good would come of it but he would have it that he had his backers and in sooth that escort played into his hands ha ha much will the fair damsels royal beaufrere thank you for overthrowing his plan for disposing of them  hark you foulmouthed fellow said king rene did i not pity you for your bereavement and ruin i should requite that slander of a noble prince by hanging you on the nearest tree  your grace is kindly welcome was the answer  rene and sigismund however took counsel together and agreed that the old man should instead of this fate be relegated to an abbey where he might at least have the chance of repenting of his crimes and be kept in safe custody  thats your mercy muttered the old mountain wolf when he heard their decision  all this was settled as they rode back along the way where madame de ste petronelle had first become alarmed she had now quite resumed her authority and position and promised protection and employment to barbe and trudchen the former had tears for her boy thus cut off in his sins but it was what she always foreboded for him and if her old master was not thankful for the grace offered him she was for him  king rene who believed not a word against his nephew intended himself to conduct the ladies to the court of his sister and see them in safety there jean however after the first excitement so drooped as she rode and was so entirely unable to make answer to all the kindness around her that it was plain that she must rest as soon as possible and thus hospitality was asked at a little country castle around which the suite encamped a pursuivant was however despatched by rene to the french court to announce the deliverance of the princesses and sir patrick sent his son david with the party that his wife and the poor dauphiness might be fully reassured  there was a strange stillness over chateau le surry when david rode in triumphantly at the gate a scottish archer who stood on guard looked up at him anxiously with the words is it weel with the lassies and on his reply they are sain and safe thanks under heaven to geordie douglas of angus the man exclaimed on on sir squire the saints grant ye may not be too late for the puir dolfine ah but she has been sair misguided  is my mother here asked david  ay sir and with the puir lady ye may gang in without question a the doors be open that ilka loon may win in to see a princess die  the pursuivant hearing that the king and dauphin were no longer in the castle rode on to chalons but david dismounted and followed a stream of persons chiefly monks friars and women of the burgher class up the steps and on into the vaulted room the lower part shut off by a rail against which crowded the curious and only halfawed multitude who whispered to each other while above at a temporary altar bright with rows of candles priests intoned prayers the atmosphere was insufferably hot and david could hardly push forward but as he exclaimed in his imperfect french that he came with tidings of madames sisters way was made and he heard his mothers voice is it is it my son bring him oh quickly  he heard a little faint gasping cry and as a lane was opened for him struggled onwards in poor margarets case the etiquette that banished the nearest kin from royalty in articulo mortis was not much to be regretted david saw herwhite save for the deathflush called up by the labouring breath as she lay upheld in his mothers arms a priest holding a crucifix before her a few ladies kneeling by the bed  good tidings i see my son said lady drummond  aretheyhere gasped margaret  alack not yet madame they will come in a few days time she gave a piteous sigh and david could not hear her words  tell her how and where you found them said his mother  david told his story briefly there was little but a quivering of the heavy eyelids and a clasping of the hands to show whether the dying woman marked him but when he had finished she said so low that only his mother heard safe thank god nunc dimittis who was ityoung angus  even so said david when the question had been repeated to him by his mother  so best sighed margaret bid the good father give thanks  dame lilias dismissed her son with a sign margaret lay far more serene for a few minutes there was a sort of hope that the good news might inspire fresh life and yet after the revelation of what her condition was in this strange frivolous hardhearted court how could life be desired for her weary spirit she did not seem to wishfar less to struggle to wishto live to see them again perhaps there was an instinctive feeling that in her weariness there was no power of rousing herself and she would rather sink undisturbed than hear of the terror and suffering that she knew but too well her husband had caused  only when it was very near the last she said safe safe in leal hands oh tell my jeanie to be content with themnever seek earthly crownsashesasheselleenjeanieall of themmy loveoh safe safe now indeed i can pardon  pardon said the french priest catching the word whom madame the sieur de tillay  even on the gasping lips there was a semismile tillayi had forgotten tillay yes and another  if no one else understood lady drummond did that the forgiveness was for him who had caused the waste and blight of a life that might have been so noble and so sweet and who had treacherously prepared a terrible fate for her young innocent sisters  it was all ended now there was no more but to hear the priest commend the parting christian soul while with a few more faint breaths the soul of margaret of scotland passed beyond the world of sneers treachery and calumny to the land where the wicked cease from troubling and where the weary are at rest     chapter 12 sorrow ended        done to death by slanderous tongues          was the hero that here lies       death avenger of wrongs          gives her fame which never dies                             much ado about nothing   a days rest revived jean enough to make her eager to push on to chalons and enough likewise to revive her coquettish and petulant temper  sigismund and eleanor might ride on together in a species of paradise as having not only won each others love but acted out a bit of the romance that did not come to full realisation much more often in those days than in modern ones they were quite content to let king rene glory in them almost as much as he had arrived at doing in his own daughter and her ferry and they could be fully secure sigismund had no ones consent to ask save a formal licence from his cousin the emperor frederick iii who would pronounce him a fool for wedding a penniless princess but had no real power over him while eleanor was certain that all her kindred would feel that she was fulfilling her destiny and high sweet thoughts of thankfulness and longing to be a blessing to him who loved her and to those whom he ruled filled her spirit as she rode through the shady woods and breezy glades bright with early summer  jean however was galled by the thought that every one at home would smile and say that she might have spared her journey and that in spite of all her beauty she had just ended by wedding the scottish laddie whom she had scorned true her heart knew that she loved him and none other and that he truly merited her but her pride was not willing that he should feel that he had earned her as a matter of course and she was quite as ungracious to sir george douglas the master of angus as ever she had been to geordie of the red peel and she showed all the petulance of a semiconvalescent she would not let him ride beside her his horse made her palfrey restless she said and when king rene talked about her true knight she pretended not to understand  ah he said be consoled brave sire we all know it is the part of the fair lady to be cruel and merciless let me sing you a roman both sad and true  which goodnatured speech simply irritated george beyond bearing the daft old carle muttered he to sir patrick why cannot he let me gang my ain gate instead of bringing all their prying eyes on me if jean casts me off the noo it will be all his fault  these small vexations however soon faded out of sight when the drooping halfhoisted banner was seen on the turrets of chateau le surry and the clang of a knell came slow and solemn on the wind  no one was at first visible but probably a warder had announced their approach for various figures issued from the gateway some coming up to rene and david drummond seeking his father the tidings were in one moment made known to the two poor girlsa most sudden shock for they had parted with their sister in full health as they thought and sir patrick had only supposed her to have been chilled by the thunderstorm yet eleanors first thought was ah i knew it would that i had clung closer to her and never been parted but the next moment she was startled by a cryjean had slid from her horse fainting away in george douglass arms  madame de ste petronelle was at hand and the lady of glenuskie quickly on the spot and they carried her into the hall where she revived and soon was in floods of tears these were the days when violent demonstration was unchecked and admired as the due of the deceased and all stood round weeping with her king charles himself leaning forward to wring her hands and cry my daughter my good daughter as soon as the first tempest had subsided the king supported eleanor to the chapel where in the midst of rows of huge wax candles margaret lay with placid face and hands clasped over a crucifix as if on a tomb the pall that covered all except her face embellished at the sides with the blazonry of france and scotland her husband with his thin hands clasped knelt by her head and requiems were being sung around by relays of priests there was fresh weeping and wailing as the sisters cast sprinklings of holy water on her and then jean sinking down quite exhausted was supported away to a chamber where the sisters could hear the story of these last sad days from lady drummond  the solemnities of margarets funeral took their due coursea lengthy one and then or rather throughout there was the consideration what was to come next too late all the court seemed to have wakened to regret for margaret she had been openhanded and kindly and the attendants had loved her while the ladies who had gossiped about her habits now found occupation for their tongues in indignation against whosoever had aspersed her discretion the king himself who had always been lazily fond of the belle fille who could amuse him was stirred perhaps by rene into an inquiry into the scandalous reports the result of which was that jamet de tillay was ignominiously banished from the court and margarets fair fame vindicated all too late to save her heart from breaking the displeasure that charles expressed to his son in private on the score of poor margarets wrongs is in fact believed to have been the beginning of the breach which widened continually till finally the unhappy father starved himself to death in a morbid dread of being poisoned by his son  however for the present the two scottish princesses reaped the full benefit of all the feeling for their sister the king and queen called them their dearest daughters and made all sorts of promises of marrying and endowing them and louis himself went outwardly through all the forms of mourning and devotion and treated his two fair sisters with extreme civility such as they privately declared they could hardly bear when they recollected how he had behaved before margaret  jean in especial flouted him with all the sharpness and pertness of which she was capable but do what she would he received it all with a smiling indifference and civility which exasperated her all the more  the laird and lady of glenuskie were in some difficulty they could not well be much longer absent from scotland and yet lilias had promised the poor dauphiness not to leave her sisters except in some security eleanors fate was plain enough sigismund followed her about as her betrothed and the only question was whether during the period of mourning he should go back to his dominions to collect a train worthy of his marriage with a kings daughter but this he was plainly reluctant to do besides the unwillingness of a lover to lose sight of his lady the catastrophe that had befallen the sisters might well leave a sense that they needed protection perhaps too he might expect murmurs at his choice of a dowerless princess from his vassals of the tirol  at any rate he lingered and accompanied the court to tours where in the noble old castle the winter was to be spent  there sir patrick and his wife were holding a consultation their means were wellnigh exhausted what they had collected for their journey was nearly spent and so was the sum with which cardinal beaufort had furnished his nieces it was true that eleanor and jean were reckoned as guests of the french king and the knight and lady and attendants as part of their suite but the high proud scottish spirits could not be easy in this condition and they longed to depart while still by selling the merely ornamental horses and some jewels they could pay their journey but then jean remained a difficulty to take her back to scotland was the most obvious measure where she could marry george of angus as soon as the mourning was ended  even if she will have him said dame lilias i doubt me whether her proud spirit will brook to go home unwedded  dost deem the lassie is busking herself for higher game that were an evil requital for his faithful service and gallant daring  i cannot tell said lilias the maid has always been kittle to deal with i trow she loves geordie in her inmost heart but she canna thole to feel herself bound to him and it irks her that when her sisters are wedded to sovereign princes she should gang hame to be gudewife to a mere scots earls son  the proud unthankful peat leave her to gang her ain gate lily and yet she is a bonny winsome maid that i canna cast off  nor i patie and i have gien my word to her sister yet gin some prince cam in her way id scarce give much for geordies chance  the auld king spake once to me of his younger son the duke of berry as they call him said sir patrick but the constable told me that was all froth the young duke must wed a princess with a tocher  i trust none will put it in our jeanies light brain sighed lily or she will be neither to have nor to hold  the consultation was interrupted by the sudden bursting in of jean herself she flew up to her friends with outstretched hands and hid her face in liliass lap  oh cousins cousins tak me away out of his reach he has been the death of poor meg now he wants to be mine  they could not understand her at first and indeed shame as well as dismay made her incoherentfor what had been proposed to her was at that time unprecedented it is hard to believe it yet french historians aver that the dauphin louis actually thought of obtaining a dispensation for marrying her in the unsettled condition of the church when it was divided by the last splinterings as it were of the great schism perhaps the astute louis deemed that any prince might obtain anything from whichever rival pope he chose to acknowledge though it was reserved for alexander borgia to grant the first licence of this kind to jean the idea was simply abhorrent alike as regarded her instincts and for the sake of the man himself his sneering manner towards her sister had filled her with disgust and indignation and he had in those days been equally contemptuous towards herselfbesides which she was aware of his share in her capture by balchenburg and whispers had not respected the manner in which his silence had fostered the slanders that had broken margarets heart  i would sooner wed a viper she said  what was louiss motive it is very hard to guess perhaps there was some real admiration of jeans beauty and it seems to have been his desire that his wife should be a nonentity as was shown in his subsequent choice of charlotte of savoy now jean was in feature very like her sister isabel duchess of brittany who was a very beautiful woman but not far from being imbecile and louis had never seen jean display any superiority of intellect or taste like margaret or eleanor but rather impatience of their pursuits and he therefore might expect her to be equally simple with the other sister however that might be sir patrick was utterly incredulous but when his wife asked madame ste petronelles opinion she shook her head and said the sire dauphin was a strange ower cannie chiel and advised that maitre jaques coeur should be consulted  who may he be  ken ye not jaques coeur the great merchant of bourgesthe man to whom above all others france owes it that we be not under the english yoke the man i say for it was the poor pucelle that gave the first move and ill enough was her reward poor blessed maiden as she was a saint must needs die a martyrs death and they will own one of these days that such she was but it was maitre coeur that stirred the king and gave him the wherewithal to raise his menlending they called it but it was out of the free heart of a true frenchman who never looked to see it back again nor even thanks for it  a merchant asked sir patrick  ay the mightiest merchant in the realm you would marvel to see his house at bourges it would fit a prince he has ships going to egypt and africa and stores of silk enough to array all the dames and demoiselles in france jewels fit for an emperor perfumes like a very grove of camphire then he has mines of silver and copper and the king has given him the care of the coinage everything prospers that he sets his hand to and he well deserves it for he is an honest man where honest men are few  is he here  yea i saw his green hood crossing the court of the castle this very noon the king can never go on long without him though there are those that so bate him that i fear he may have a fall one of these days methinks i heard that he ay hears his morning mass when here at the little chapel of st james close to the great shrine of st martin at six of the clock in the morning so as to be private you might find him there and whatever he saith to you will be sooth whether it be as you would have it or no  on consideration sir patrick decided to adopt the ladys advice and on her side she reflected that it might be well to take care that the interview did not fail for want of recognition  the glorious cathedral of tours was standing up dark but with glittering windows from the light within deepening the stained glass and throwing out the beauty of the tracery while the sky brightening in the autumn morning threw the towers into relief when little recking of all this beauty only caring to find the way sir patrick on the one hand the old scots french lady on the other went their way to the noble west front each wrapped in a long cloak and not knowing one another till their eyes met as they gave each other holy water at the door after the habit of strangers entering at the same time  then madame de ste petronelle showed the way to the little side chapel close to the noble apse there beneath the six altarcandles a priest was hurrying through a mass in a rapid illpronounced manner while besides his acolyte worshippers were very few only the light fell on the edges of a darkgreen velvet cloak and silvered a grizzled head bowed in reverence and madame de ste petronelle touched sir patrick and made him a significant sign  daylight was beginning to reveal itself by the time the brief service was over sir patrick stimulated by the lady ventured a few steps forward and accosted maitre coeur as he rose and drawing forward his hood was about to leave the church  beau sire a word with you i am the kinsman and attendant of the scottish kings sisters  ah one of them is to be married my steward is with me it is to him you should speak of her wardrobe said jaques coeur an impatient look stealing over his keen but honest visage  it is not of duke sigismunds betrothed that i would speak returned the scottish knight it is of her sister  jaques coeurs dark eyes cast a rapid glance as of one who knew not who might lurk in the recesses of a twilight cathedral  not here he said and he led sir patrick away with him down the aisle out into the air where a number of odd little buildings clustered round the walls of the cathedral even leaning against it heedless of the beauty they marred  by your leave father he said after exchanging salutations with a priest who was just going out to say his mornings mass and leaving his tiny bare cell empty here sir patrick could incredulously tell his story and the merchant could only sigh and own that he feared that there was every reason to believe that the intention was real jaques coeur religiously was shocked at the idea and politically wished the dauphin to make a more profitable alliance he whispered that the sooner the lady was out of reach the better and even offered to advance a loan to facilitate the journey  there followed a consultation in the securest place that could be devised namely in the antechamber where sir patrick and lady drummond slept to guard their young princesses in the palace at tours jean eleanor and madame de ste petronelle having a bedroom within  sir patricks view was that jean might take her leave in full state and honour leaving eleanor to marry her duke in due time but the girl shuddered at this oh no no he would call himself my brother for the nonce and throw me into some convent there is nothing for it but to make it impossible sir patie fetch geordie and tell him an he loves me to wed me on the spot and bear me awa to bonnie scotland would that i had never been beguiled into quitting it  geordie douglas you were all for flouting him a while ago said eleanor puzzled  dinna be sae daft like elleen that was but sport andand a maid may not hold herself too cheap geordie that followed me all the way from home and was sair hurt for me and freed me from yon awsome castle oh could ye trow that i could love ony but he  it was not too easy to refrain from saying so thats the end of all your airs but the fear of making her fly off again withheld lady drummond and even eleanor  george did not lodge in the castle and sir patrick could not sound him till the morning but for a long space after the two sisters had laid their heads on the pillow jean was tossing sometimes sobbing and to her sisters consolations she replied oh elleen he can never forgive me why did my hard dour ungrateful nature so sport with his leal loving heart will he spurn me the now geordie geordie i shall never see your like it would but be my desert if i were left behind to that treacherous spiteful princei wad as soon be a mouse in a cats claw  but george of angus made no doubt he had won his ladylove at last and the only further doubt remained as to how the matter was to be carried out jaques coeur was consulted again no priest at tours would he thought dare to perform the ceremony for fear of aftervengeance of the dauphin and sir patrick then suggested father romuald who had been lingering in his train waiting to cross the alps till his scotch friends should have departed and winter be over but the deed would hardly be safely done within the city  the merchants advice was this sir patrick his lady and the master of angus had better openly take leave of the court and start on the way to brittany no opposition would be made though if louis suspected lady jeans presence in their party he might close the gates and detain her jaques coeur therefore thought she had better travel separately at first for eleanor as the betrothed bride of sigismund there was no  might therefore remain at court with the queen jaques coeur the greatest merchant of his day had just received a large train of waggons loaded with stuffs and other wares from bourges on the way to nantes and he proposed that the lady jean should travel with one attendant female in one of these passing as the wife and daughter of the foreman these two personages had actually travelled to tours and were content to remain there while their places were taken by madame de ste petronelle and jean  we must not describe the parting of the sisters nor the many messages sent by elleen to bonny scotland and the brothers and sisters she was willing to see no more for the sake of her austrian duke of her all that needs to be said is that she lived and died happy and honoured delighting him by her flow of wit and poetry and only regretting that she was a childless wife  barbe and trudchen were to remain in her suite barbe still grieving for her boy and hoping to devote all she could obtain as wage or largesse to masses for his soul and trudchen very happy in the new world though being broken in with some difficulty to civilised life  having been conveyed by bystreets to the great factory or shop of maltre coeur at tours a wonder in itself though far inferior to his main establishment at bourges madame de ste petronelle and jean with her faithful skywing nestled under her cloak were handed by jaques himself to seats in a covered wain containing provisions for them and also some more delicate wares destined for the duchess of brittany he was himself in riding gear and a troop of armed servants awaited him on horseback  was he going with them jean asked  not all the way he said but he would not part with the lady till he had resigned her to the charge of the sire de glenuskie the state of  should accompany any valuable convoy that his going with the party would excite no suspicion  so they journeyed on in the wain at the head of a quarter of a mile of waggons and packhorses
