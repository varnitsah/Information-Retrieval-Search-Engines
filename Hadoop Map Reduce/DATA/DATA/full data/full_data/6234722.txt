  introduction  my dear boys the rover boys on the river is a complete story in itself but forms the ninth volume of the rover boys series for young americans  nine volumes what a great number of tales to write about one set of characters when i started the series i had in mind as i have mentioned before to write three or possibly four books but the gratifying reception given to the rover boys at school soon made the publishers call for the second third and fourth volumes and then came the others and still the boys and girls do not seem to be satisfied i am told there is a constant cry for more more and so i present this new rover boys story which tells of the doings of dick tom and sam and their friends during an outing on one of our great riversan outing full of excitement and fun and with a touch of a rather unusual mystery during the course of the tale some of the old enemies of the rover boys turn up but our heroes know as of old how to take care of themselves and all ends well  in placing this book into the hands of my young readers i wish once more to thank them for the cordial reception given the previous volumes many have written to me personally about them and i have perused the letters with much satisfaction i sincerely trust the present volume fulfills their every expectation  affectionately and sincerely yours  arthur m winfield     the rover boys on the river     chapter i  plans for an outing   whoop hurrah zip boom ah rockets  for gracious sake tom whats all the racket about i thought we had all the noise we wanted last night when we broke up camp  its news dick glorious news returned tom rover and he began to dance a jig on the tent flooring its the best ever  it wont be glorious news if you bring this tent down on our heads answered dick rover have you discovered a gold mine  better than that dick ive discovered what we are going to do with ourselves this summer  i thought we were going back to the farm to rest up now that the term at putnam hall is at an end  pooh who wants to rest ive rested all i wish right in this encampment  well whats the plan dont keep us in suspenders as hans mueller would say  dear old hansy that dutch boy is my hearts own cried tom enthusiastically i could not live without him he must go along  go along where  on our outing this summer  but where do you propose to go to tom  for a trip on the broad and glorious ohio river  eh  thats it dick we are to sail the briny deep of that river in a houseboat now what do you think of that  id like to know what put that into your head tom came from the tent opening and sam rover the youngest of the three brothers stepped into view  uncle randolph put it into my head not over half an hour ago sam its this way youve heard of john v black of jackville  the man that owed uncle randolph some money  exactly well black is a bankrupt or next door to it he couldnt pay uncle randolph what was coming to him so he turned over a houseboat instead shes a beauty so i am told and she is called the dora  after dora stanhope of course interrupted the youngest rover with a quizzical look at his big brother dick  now look here dont you start in like that sam came quickly from dick with a blush for the girl mentioned was his dearest friend and had been for some years tell us about this houseboat tom he went on  the houseboat is now located on the ohio river at a place not many miles from pittsburg uncle randolph says if we wish to we can use her this summer and float down to the mississippi and further yet for that matter and we can take along half a dozen of our friends too  hurrah thats splendid burst out sam what a glorious way to spend the best part of this summer let us go and each take a chum along  father says if we go we can take alexander pop along to do the cooking and dirty work the houseboat is now in charge of an old riverman named captain starr who knows the ohio and mississippi from end to end and we can keep him on board  it certainly looks inviting mused dick rover it would take us through a section of the country we havent as yet seen and we might have lots of sport fishing and swimming and maybe hunting how many will the houseboat accommodate he added  twelve or fourteen on a pinch  then we could have a jolly crowd the question is who are you going to take along we cant take all of our friends and it would seem a shame to ask some and not others  we can decide that question later dick remember some of the fellows already have their arrangements made for this summer  i know major colby cant go said sam he is going to visit some relatives in maine  and george granbury is going up to the thousand islands with his folks put in tom  we might ask songbird powell came from dick i dont believe he is going anywhere in particular  yes we ought to have him by all means and hans mueller too they would be the life of the party  i should like to have fred garrison along said sam he is always good company we can  sam broke off short as the roll of a drum was heard on the parade ground outside the tent  dress parade for the last time cried dick rover come get out and be quick about it and as captain of company a he caught up his sword and buckled it on in a hurry while tom as a lieutenant of the same command did likewise  when they came out on the parade ground of the encampment they found the cadets of putnam hall hurrying to the spot from all directions it was a perfect day this fifth of july with the sun shining brightly and a gentle breeze blowing the camp was as clean as a whistle and from the tall flagstaff in front of the grounds old glory flapped bravely out on the air  to those who have read the rover boys at school and other volumes in this series dick tom and sam need no special introduction when at home they lived with their father and their aunt and uncle at valley brook farm pleasantly located in the heart of new york state from this farm they had been sent by their uncle randolph to putnam hall military academy presided over by captain victor putnam to whom they became warmly attached at the academy they made many firm friends some of whom will be introduced in the pages which follow and also several enemies among them dan baxter the offspring of a criminal named arnold baxter who after suffering for his crimes by various terms of imprisonment was now very sick and inclined to turn over a new leaf and become a better man  a term at school had been followed by a remarkable chase on the ocean and then a journey to the jungles of africa in a hunt after anderson rover the boys father who was missing then had come a trip to a gold mine in the west followed by some exciting adventures on the great lakes on an island in one of the lakes they unearthed a document relating to a treasure hidden in the adirondack mountains and next made their way to that locality in midwinter and obtained a box containing gold silver and precious stones much to their satisfaction  after their outing in the mountains the boys had expected to return to putnam hall but a scarletfever scare broke out and the institution was promptly closed this being the case mr rover thought it best to allow his sons to visit california for their health this they did and in the seventh volume of the series entitled the rover boys on land and sea i related how sam tom and dick were carried off to sea during a violent storm in company with dora stanhope already mentioned and her two cousins nellie and grace laning two particular friends of tom and sam the whole party was cast away on a deserted island and had much trouble with dan baxter who joined some sailor mutineers our friends were finally rescued by a united states warship which chanced to pass that way and see their signal of distress  after reaching san francisco once more the rover boys had returned to the east while dora stanhope and the lanings had gone to santa barbara where mrs stanhope was stopping for her health the scare at putnam hall was now over and in another volume of the series called the rover boys in camp i related how dick tom and sam returned to the military academy again and took part in the annual encampment here there had been no end of good times and not a little hazing the most of which was taken in good part the boys had made a new enemy in the shape of a bully named lew flapp who was finally expelled from the school for his wrongdoings dan baxter also turned up but when the authorities got after him he disappeared as quickly as he had done many times before leaving his father to his fate as already mentioned  i dont think well be bothered much with dan baxter after this tom had said but he was mistaken as later events proved  rat tat tat rat tat tat went the drum on the parade ground and soon the three companies which comprised the putnam hall battalion were duly assembled with major larry colby in command of the whole and dick at the head of company a fred garrison at the head of company b and mark romer leading company c in front of all stood captain putnam the sole owner of the military institution and george strong his chief assistant  the boys certainly make a fine showing on this last day of our encampment said captain putnam to his assistant and a good deal of the credit is due to you mr strong  thank you for saying so sir was the answer yes they look well and i am proud of them captain putnam i believe our military school will compare favorably with any in the land  after the drill was over captain putnam came forward and made a rather extended speech in which he reviewed the work accomplished at the academy from its first opening as told by me in another series of books entitled the putnam hall series starting with the putnam hall cadets down to those later days when the rover boys appeared on the scene he also complimented the cadets on their excellent showing and trusted they would all have a pleasant vacation during the summer this speech was followed by a short address by george strong and then came a surprise when dick rover stepped forward  captain putnam said he in behalf of all the cadets here assembled i wish to thank you for your kind words which we deeply appreciate  i have been chosen by my fellows to present you with this as a token of our esteem we trust it will prove to your liking and that whenever you look upon it you will remember us all  as dick spoke he brought into view a fairsized package wrapped in tissue paper when unrolled it proved to be a small figure of a cadet done in silver and gold on the base was the inscription from the cadets of putnam hall to their beloved head master captain victor putnam  after that mr strong was presented with a set of coopers works and the other teachers were likewise remembered more addresses of thanks followed and then the battalion was dismissed for dinner  its a fine windup for this seasons encampment said tom after it was over i dont believe well ever have another encampment like it  and now ho for the rolling river cried sam say im just crazy to begin that trip on the houseboat  so am i came from both of his brothers but they might not have been so anxious had they dreamed of the many adventures and perils in store for them     chapter ii  on the way to putnam hall   boys we start the march back to putnam hall in fifteen minutes  such was the news which flew around the camp not long after the dinner hour had passed already the tents had been taken down the baggage strapped and six big wagons fairly groaned with the loads of goods to be taken back to the military institution  the cadets had marched to the camp by one route and were to return to the academy by another all was bustle and excitement for in spite of the general order a few things had gone astray  weally this is mostahremarkable dont you know came from that aristocratic cadet named william philander tubbs  whats remarkable tublets asked tom who was near by putting away a pair of blankets  lieutenant rover how many times must iahtell you not to address me as tublets sighed the fashionable young cadet  oh all right tubhouse it shant occur again upon my honor  tubhouse oh rover please let up  whats wrong billy  that is better but it is bad enough sighed william philander iveahlost one of my walking shoes  perhaps being a walking shoe it walked off  maybe it got in that beefsteak we had this morning put in sam with a wink i thought that steak was rather tough  shoo yourself with such a joke sam came from fred garrison  have you really lost your shoe tubby dear sang out songbird powell the sostyled poet of the academy and then he started to sing  rub a dub dub one shoe on the tubb   where can the other one be look in your bunk and look in your trunk   and look in the bumblebee tree  whoop hurrah songbird has composed another ode in washtubs honor sang out fred garrison washtub you ought to give songbird a dollar for that  thanks but i make not my odes for filthy lucre same from powell tragically and then he continued  one penny reward and a big tin sword   to whoever finds the shoe come one at a time and form in line   and raise a hullabaloo  and then a shout went up that could be heard all over the encampment  ill lend you a slipper tubbs said little harry moss whose shoes were several sizes smaller than those of the aristocratic cadet  somebody get me a shingle and ill cut tubstand a sandal with my jackknife came from tom  ill shingle you roared william philander tubbs and rushed away to escape his tormentors in the end he found another shoe but it was not the one he wanted for that had been rolled up in the blankets by tom and was not returned until putnam hall was reached  drums and fifes enlivened the way as the cadets started for the military academy the march was to take the balance of that afternoon and all of the next day during the night they were to camp out like regular soldiers on the march in a big field captain putnam had hired for that purpose  the march did not take the cadets through oakville so the rover boys did not see the friends they had made in that vicinity they headed directly for the village of bramley and then for another small settlement named white cornerswhy nobody could tell since there was not so much as a white post anywhere to be seen in that vicinity  its queer how a name sticks declared tom after speaking of this to his brother dick they might rather call this brown corners since most of the houses are brown  at the corners they obtained supper which was supplied to the cadets by the hotel keeper who had been notified in advance of their coming  while they were eating a boy who worked around the stables of the hotel watched them curiously afterwards this boy came up to sam and tom  we had a cadet here yesterday who was awfully mad said the boy  had hydrophobia eh returned tom too bad  no i dont mean that i mean he was very angry  what was the trouble  i dont know exactly but i think he had been sent away from the school for something or other  what was his name  lew flapp  why i thought he had gone home cried sam  so did i answered his brother he turned to the hotel youth what was this flapp doing here  nothing much he asked the boss when you were expected here  is he here now  no he left last night  where did he go to  i dont know but i thought i would tell you about the fellow i think he is going to try to do you cadets some harm  did he mention any names  he seemed to be extra bitter against three brothers named rover  humph  are the rovers here went on the youth  i think they are sonny im one this is another and there is the third and tom pointed to dick who was at a distance conversing with some other cadets  oh so you are the rovers how strange that i should speak to you of this  which way did this lew flapp go questioned sam off the way you are bound  ill wager he tries to make trouble for us on our way to putnam hall tom  its not unlikely sam  shall we tell captain putnam of this tom shook his head  no let us tell dick though and a few of the others then we can keep our eyes peeled for lew flapp and if he actually does wrong expose him  a little later tom and sam interviewed dick on the subject and then they told larry colby fred garrison george granbury and half a dozen others  i dont believe he will do much said larry colby he is only talking thats all he knows well enough that captain putnam can have him locked up if he wants to  by eight oclock that evening the field in which they were to encamp for the night was reached tents were speedily put up and half a dozen campfires started making the boys feel quite at home the cadets gathered around the fires and sang song after song and not a few practical jokes were played  hans they tell me you feel cold and want your blood shook up said tom to hans mueller the german cadet  coldt is it queried hans vot you dinks i vos coldt mid der borometer apout two hundred by der shade aint it i vos so hot like i lif in africa alretty  oh hans must be cold cried sam let us shake him up boys  all right came from half a dozen get a blanket somebody  no you tont not by my life alretty sang out hans who had been tossed up before i stay py der groundt mine feets on and he started to run away  several went after him and he was caught in the middle of an adjoining cornfield where a roughandtumble scuffle ensued with poor hans at the bottom of the heap  hi git off kvick he gasped dis tont been no footsball game nohow git off somebody und dake dot knee mine mouth out of  are you warm now hansy asked tom  chust you wait tom rofer answered the german cadet and shook his fist at his tormentor i git square somedimes or mine name aint  sauerkraut finished another cadet and a roar went up hans is it true that you eat sauerkraut three times a day when you are at home  no i tont eat him more as dree dimes a veek answered hans innocently  hans is going to treat us all to limberger cheese when his birthday comes put in fred garrison its a secret though so dont tell anybody  i tont vos eat limberger came from hans  oh hansy groaned several in chorus  base villain thou hast deceived us quoted songbird powell away to the dungeon with him and then the crowd dragged poor hans through the cornfield and back to the campfire once more where he was made to sit so close to the blaze that the perspiration poured from his round and rosy face yet with it all he took the joking in good part and often gave his tormentors as good as they sent  they tell me that william philander tubbs is going to newport for the summer said tom a little later when the cadets were getting ready to retire just wait till he gets back next fall hell be more dudish than ever  we ought to tame him a little before we let him go said sam  right you are sam but what can we do nearly everything has been tried since we went into camp  i have a plan tom  all right lets have it  why not black tubby up while he is asleep  sam you are a jewel but where are we to get the lampblack  ive got it already i put several corks in the campfire and burnt cork is the best stuff for blacking up known  right again oh but well make william philander look like a regular negro minstrel and thats not all after the job is done well wake him up and tell him captain putnam wants to see him at once  several boys were let into the secret and then all waited impatiently for tubbs to retire this he soon did and in a few minutes was sound asleep  now then come on said sam and led the way to carry out the anticipated fun     chapter iii  the doings of a night   as luck would have it william philander tubbs just then occupied a tent alone his two tentmates being on guard duty for two hours as was the custom during encampment  the aristocratic cadet lay flat on his back with his face and throat well exposed  now be careful sam or youll wake him up whispered tom  one cadet held a candle while sam and tom blackened the face of the sleeping victim of the joke the burnt cork was in excellent condition and soon william philander looked for all the world like a coalblack darkey  py chimanatics he could go on der stage py a nigger minstrel company was hans muellers comment  makes almost a better nigger than he does a white man said tom dryly  wait a minute till i fix up his coat for him said fred garrison and turned the garment inside out  a moment later all of the cadets withdrew leaving the tent in total darkness then one stuck his head in through the flap  hi there private tubbs he called out wake up  whatahwhats the mattah drawled the aristocratic cadet sleepily  captain putnam wants you to report to him or to mr strong at once went on the cadet outside in a heavy assumed voice  wants me to report questioned tubbs sitting up in astonishment  yes and at once hurry up for its very important  well this is assuredly strange murmured william philander to himself wonder what is up  he felt around in the dark for a light but it had been removed by tom and so had all the matches  beastly luck not a match growled tubbs and then began to dress in the dark in his hurry he did not notice that his coat was inside out nor did he discover that his face and hands were blacked  captain putnams quarters were at the opposite end of the camp and in that direction william philander hurried until suddenly stopped by a guard who chanced to be coming in from duty  halt cried the cadet what are you doing in this camp he demanded  captain putnam wants me answered tubbs thinking the guard wanted to know why he was astir at that hour of the night  captain putnam wants you  yes  its strange how did you get in  in in where  in this camp  oh ribble are you crazy  so you know me said ribble well i must say i dont know you  you certainly must be crazy i am william philander tubbs  what oh then you stammered ribble and then a light dawned on him who told you the captain wanted to see you  some cadet who just woke me up  all right go ahead then and ribble grinned behind tubbs he now saw half a dozen cadets hovering in the semidarkness watching for sport  on ran william philander to make up for lost time and soon arrived at the flap of the tent occupied by captain putnam  here i am captain putnam he called out and then as he got no reply he called again by this time the captain was awake and coming to the flap he peered out  what do you want he asked sharply you sent for me sir stammered tubbs  i sent for you  yes sir  i have no recollection of so doing answered captain putman where are you from  from  exactly  why i amahfrom this camp answered the puzzled tubbs  do you mean to tell me you belong here questioned the now astonished master of putnam hall  of course captain putnam didnt you send for me somebody said you did continued william philander  sir i dont know you and never heard of you so far as i can remember you must be mixed up  i mixed up i guess you are mixed up roared tubbs growing angry if i dont belong to this camp where do i belong  how should i know we have no negroes here to the best of my knowledge  captain putnam what do you mean by calling me anahnegro fumed william philander  well arent you one i cant see very well  no sir i am not a negro and never was a negro answered tubbs getting more and more excited i shall report this to my parents when i arrive home  will you in all goodness tell me your name queried captain putnam beginning to realize that something was wrong  you know my name well enough sir  perhaps i do and perhaps i dont answer me please  my name is william philander tubbs  tubbs is it possible  somebody came to my tent and said you wanted to see me  well did you think it was necessary to black up to make a call on me  black up repeated william philander that is what i said  am i black sir  yes as black as coal look at yourself in this glass and the captain held out a small looking glass and also a lantern  when tubbs saw himself in the glass he almost had a fit  my gracious sakes alive he groaned how ridiculous how did this happen why i look like a negro  is anything amiss captain putnam came from the next tent and george strong appeared  nothing excepting that private tubbs has seen fit to black up as a negro and call upon me answered the master of the academy with a faint smile playing around the corners of his mouth  i didnt black up roared william philander its all a horrid joke somebody has played on me while i was asleep you dont want me do you  no tubbs  then ill go back and if i can find out who did this  a burst of laughter from a distance made him break off short  theyre laughing at me he went on just hear that  go to bed and i will investigate in the morning answered captain putnam and william philander went off vowing vengeance  just wait till i find out who did it he told himself as he washed up the best he could in some cold water ill have them in court for it but he never did find out nor did captain putnams investigation lead to any disclosures  william philanders trials for that night were not yet at an end on the march to the camp some of the cadets had picked up a number of burrs of fair size a liberal quantity of these had been introduced under the covers of tubbs cot immediately after he left the tent  having washed up as best he could the aristocratic cadet blew out the light he had borrowed and prepared to retire once more he threw back the covers and dropped heavily upon the cot in just the spot where the sharpest of the burrs lay  an instant later a wild shriek of pain and astonishment rent the air  ouch oh my im stuck full of pins oh dear me  and then william philander tubbs leaped up and began to dance around like a wild indian  whats the matter with you billy asked one of his tentmates entering in the midst of the excitement  whats the matter roared poor tubbs everything is the matter dont you know its an ahoutrage  somebody told me you had blacked up as a negro minstrel and were going to serenade your best girl  its not so parkham some beastly cadets played a joke on me oh wait till i find out who did it and then william philander began to moan once more over the burrs it was a good quarter of an hour before he had his cot cleaned off and fit to use once more and even then he was so excited and nervous he could not sleep another wink  william philander wont forget his last night with the boys in a hurry remarked tom as he slipped off to bed once more  you had better keep quiet over this came from dick we dont want to spoil our records for the term remember  right you are dick ill be as mum as a clam climbing a huckleberry bush  the boys were tired out over the march of the afternoon and over playing the joke on tubbs and it was not long before all of the rovers were sound asleep the three brothers had begged for permission to tent together and this had been allowed by captain putnam for the term was virtually over ending with the dismissal of the cadets at the last encampment parade  on guard duty at one end of the field was a cadet named link smith a rather weakminded fellow who was easily led by those who cared to exert an influence over him at one time link smith had trained with lew flapp and his evil associates but fortunately for the feebleminded cadet he had been called home during the time when lew flapp got into the trouble which ended by his dismissal from putnam hall  link smith was pacing up and down sleepily when he heard a peculiar whistle close at hand he listened intently and soon heard the whistle repeated  the old call he murmured to himself at first he did not feel like answering but presently did so then from out of the gloom stalked a tall young fellow dressed in the uniform of a cadet but with a face that was strangely painted and powdered  who is it questioned link smith uneasily  dont you know me link  lew flapp cried the weakminded cadet  hush not so loud link somebody might hear you  what do you want  i want to visit the camp answered lew flapp     chapter iv  what the morning brought forth   link smith was much surprised by lew flapps assertion that he wanted to visit the camp during the middle of the night and when practically everybody was asleep  what do you want to come in for he asked feeling fairly certain that flapps mission could not be as upright and honest as desired  oh its all right link answered the big bully smoothly  but what do you want  well if you must know i want to talk to a couple of my old friends  why cant you talk to them tomorrow after they leave school  that wont do i want them to do something for me before they leave the academy  its a strange request to make lew  oh its perfectly square i assure you you see its this way i want them to get some proofs for meto prove that i am not as black as the follows reported to captain putnam  now it is possible that some other cadet would not have been hoodwinked in this fashion by the bully but link smith swallowed the explanation without a second thought  oh if thats what you want go ahead said he but dont tell anybody i let you in  i shant say a word if you dont answered lew flapp by the way he went on with assumed indifference they tell me the rover boys have cleared out and gone home  no they havent was link smiths prompt answerthey are right here  are you sure link  of course i am they are bunking together in the last tent in street b over yonder and the feebleminded cadet pointed with his hand as he spoke  is that so well i dont care i dont want to see them again until i can prove to captain putnam that they are a set of rascals  are you going to try to get into the academy again lew asked link curiously  not much ill be done with captain putnam just as soon as i can show him how he mistreated me and how the rovers are pulling the wool over his eyes  everybody here thinks the rovers about perfect  thats because they dont know them as well as i and rockley do  a few words more passed and then lew flapp slipped into the camp lines and made his way between the long rows of tents  he had gained from link smith just the information he desired namely the location of the rover boys sleeping quarters he looked back to make certain that link was not watching him and then hurried on to where the rovers rested totally unconscious of the proximity of their enemy  ill show them what i can do muttered lew flapp to himself ill make them wish they had never been born  at last the tent was reached and with caution he opened the flap and peered inside all was dark and with a hand that was none too steady he struck a match and held it up  each of the rover boys lay sleeping peacefully on his cot with his clothing hung up on one of the tent poles  now for working my little plan murmured flapp and allowed the match to go out in a second more he was inside the tent moving around cautiously so as not to disturb the sleepers  the bully remained in the tent all of ten minutes then he came out as cautiously as he had entered and fairly ran to where link smith was still on guard  did you see them asked the feebleminded cadet  i did and its all right link now dont tell anybody i visited the camp  humph do you think i want to get myself in trouble  goodnight  goodnight  and in a moment more lew flapp was out of sight down the country roadway and link smith was pacing his post as before  bright and early the camp was astir and at halfpast seven oclock a good hot breakfast was served the cadets pitching into the food provided with a will  and now for putnam hall and the grand windup said tom as he finished his repast  and then to go home and prepare for that grand trip on the houseboat came from sam  which puts me in mind that we must see who will go with us said dick  songbird powell says he is more than willing answered tom and i know dutchy will fall all over himself to become one of the party  i think fred garrison will go said sam he said he would let me know as soon as he heard from his parents  captain putnam had expected to begin the march to the hall by halfpast eight but there were numerous delays in packing the camping outfit so the battalion was not ready for the start until over an hour later  the cadets were just being formed to start the march when several men appeared at the edge of the field  theres them young soldiers now cried one come on and find the rascals  what do you want gentlemen demanded george strong who happened to be near the crowd  who is in charge of this school asked one of the men  captain victor putnam is the owner i am his head assistant  well im josiah cotton the constable of white corners  what can i do for you mr cotton  im after a feller named dick rover and his two brothers are they here  they are what do you want of them  im goin to lock em up if they did what i think they did  lock them up cried george strong in astonishment  thats what i said show me the young villains  but what do you think they have done  they broke into my shop an stole some things put in another of the men  thats right they did came from a third man dont let em give ye the slip josiah  i aint agoin to let em give me the slip growled the constable from white corners  when was your shop robbed demanded george strong of the man who had said he was the sufferer  i cant say exactly fer i was to the city abuying of more goods  mr fairchild is a jeweler and watchmaker besides dealing in paints oils glass an wall paper explained the constable he carries a putty considerable stock of goods as are valuable yesterday or early last night when he was away his shop was broken into and robbed  and what makes you think the rovers are the thieves asked george strong  we got proof came doggedly from aaron fairchild were certain on it  by this time seeing that something was wrong captain putnam came to the scene in the meantime the battalion was already formed with major colby at the head and dick in his proper position as captain of company a  i cannot believe that the rover boys are guilty of this robbery said the master of putnam hall after listening to what the newcomers had to say what proof have you that they did it  this proof for one thing answered josiah cotton and drew from his pocket a memorandum book and the envelope to a letter in the front of the memorandum book was the name richard rover and the envelope was addressed likewise  the thief dropped that went on the constable  where did you find these things  on the floor of the shop in front of the desk  anybody might have dropped them  see here captain putnam do you stand up fer shieldin a thief roared aaron fairchild to me this hull thing is as plain as the nose on my face  as aaron fairchilds smelling organ was an unusually large one this caused the master of putnam hall to smile but he immediately grew grave again  this is a serious matter mr fairchild i do not wish to shield a thief but at the same time i cannot see one or more of my pupils unjustly treated  are ye afraid to have em examined  by no means i will call them up and you can talk to them but i advise you to be careful of what you say the rover boys come from a family that is rich and they can make it exceedingly warm for you if you accuse them wrongfully  oh i know what im adoin and the constable knows what hes adoin too answered aaron fairchild  george strong was sent to summon dick tom and sam and soon came up with the three brothers behind him  something is wrong that is certain murmured dick  those men look mad enough to chew us up answered tom  now boys keep cool cautioned george strong i think some terrible mistake has been made  whats it all about mr strong asked sam  ill let them explain returned the head assistant  josiah cotton had heard captain putnams words of caution to aaron fairchild and as he had a great regard for persons who were rich and did not want to get himself into trouble he resolved to move with caution  id like to ask you three young gents a few questions said he as the boys came up fust which one of you is richard rover  i am richard commonly called dick was the ready reply this is my brother tom and this is sam  very well now then do you remember visitin mr fairchilds jewelry an paint store went on the constable  visiting a jewelry and paint store repeated dick i do not what a combination  perhaps he paints his jewels put in the funloving tom  dont you git funny with us growled aaron fairchild lets come to the pint my store was robbed an im thinking you fellers done the deed  robbed echoed sam  and you think we did it put in dick indignantly i like that  we are not thieves said tom and you ought to have your head punched for thinking it  boys keep cool came from captain putnam mr cotton hadnt you better do the talking for mr fairchild  i want em searched burst out aaron fairchild if they robbed my store they must have put the stuff somewheres  what makes you think we robbed you asked dick  this and he was shown the memorandum book and the envelope  humph i lost that book some weeks ago when i had my fight with lew flapp rockley and the rest of that crowd that were dismissed from the academy  and what of the envelope richard asked captain putnam  i dont remember anything about that it probably came on a letter from home and i must have thrown it away  the book and the envelope were found on the floor of the shop that was robbed  well i didnt drop them there  and neither did i came from tom  nor i added sam  are you going to let us search you and your belongings or not demanded the constable from white corners  i dont see why you should search us put in tom hotly its an outrage to my way of thinking  you had better let him make a search came from captain putnam then he will see that he has made a mistake  all right search me all you please said sam  i am of toms opinion that it is an outrage said dick nevertheless he can search me if he wishes  let us retire to yonder barn out of the sight of the battalion said captain putnam  the constable and aaron fairchild were willing and all walked to the barn in question  you can look at that first said dick and unbuttoning his coat he took it off and handed it to the constable  josiah cotton dove into one pocket after another bringing out various articles which were dicks private property  any o these yours he asked the jeweler  cant say as they are josiah answered aaron fairchild go on ahuntin maybe somethin is in the linin  there is shouted the constable running his hand over the padding he found a small hole and put in his fingers here ye are he ejaculated and brought forth two plain gold rings and one set with a topaz  my property gasped aaron fairchild my property and ill swear to it didnt i tell ye he was a thief     chapter v  for and against   all in the barn gazed in amazement at the three rings which the constable of white corners held in his hand  i dont know how those rings got into my coat said dick who was the first to recover from the shock  i am certain dick didnt steal them put in tom  and so am i added sam dick this is a plot against you  it aint no plotits plain facts came from aaron fairchild go on an continue the search josiah  thats what im adoin returned the constable  he felt the coat over carefully and presently brought forth another ring and a pair of childs bracelets  its as plain as preachin came from the third man a farmer named gassam hes the thief sure  i declare upon my honor i am innocent cried dick the hot blood rushing to his face he turned to captain putnam you dont think ii  i believe what you say captain rover answered the master of the hall promptly there is assuredly some mistake here  give me your coat said josiah cotton to tom  the garment was handed over and after a thorough search two small gold stick pins were found in the middle of the back  more o my goods cried aaron fairchild triumphantly i can prove i had em on sale not four days ago  sams coat was then examined and from one of the sleeves came half a dozen cheap rings and an equally cheap watchchain  all mine the case is as clear as day said the jeweler josiah you must lock em up  0 course ill lock em up answered the constable  lock us up cried sam aghast  not much came from tom im no thief and i dont propose to go to jail  boys have you any idea how this jewelry got into your clothes asked captain putnam  no sir came promptly from the three  the rest of the rover boys clothing was then searched and a few more cheap rings were brought to light  now let us go for their baggage said the constable and this was done but nothing more was found  it was soon buzzing around the battalion which stood at parade rest that something was wrong and then somebody whispered that the rovers were accused of breaking into a shop and stealing some jewelry  it cant be true said fred garrison i shall never believe it and a number of others said the same but a few shrugged their shoulders those who had belonged to the lew flapp and dan baxter crowd  i never trusted those rovers altogether said one they have too much money to spend  well they are worth a good bit of money replied another cadet  this aint a quarter of the stuff i lost said aaron fairchild after the baggage had undergone a rigid inspection  what have you done with the rest asked the constable of the rovers  you may think as you please said dick i am innocent and i do not understand how that stuff got where you found it an enemy must have placed it there  yes and that enemy must be the one who robbed the shop cried tom  its easy enough to talk came from gassam the farmer but you cant go behind the evidence as they say in court you might just as well confess an give up the rest o the goods maybe if ye do that theyll let ye off easy  what do you consider this stuff worth asked dick  nigh on to thirtyfive dollars answered aaron fairchild  how much did you lose altogether  about a hundred an sixty dollars worth  then the real thief kept about a hundred and twentyfive dollars worth for himself said tom  there can be no doubt but that one of our enemies did this said sam the question is which one  perhaps dan baxteror lew flapp suggested dick  yes but how did the things get into our clothes tom  i give it up  that sort of talk wont wash put in the constable you have got to go with me  where to  to squire haggertys office  i will go with you said captain putnam this affair must be sifted to the bottom  it was learned that squire haggerty lived two miles away but a wagon was handy belonging to a nearby farmer and this was hired to take the whole party to the place  you must take charge of the cadets said captain putnam to his head assistant i must see this affair through  i do not believe the rovers are guilty sir whispered george strong  neither do i this is a plot against them the question is who carried the plot out  not long after this the battalion of cadets marched off on the road to putnam hall while the rovers and the others entered the big wagon  inside of half an hour squire haggertys home was reached the squire proved to be an irishman of about fifty who when he was not acting as a judge did jobs of mason work in the vicinity  sure an its the boldest robbery we have had in this neighborhood for years said the squire the back door av the shop was broken open and many valuables extracted from the premises  have you any idea when the robbery was committed asked captain putnam  not exactly mr fairchild was away all day yesterday and did not get home until nearly twelve oclock at night  didnt he leave anybody else to run the shop  he has nobody when he goes away he has to lock up  all were ushered into the squires parlor where he had a flattop desk and several office chairs the squire had heard of captain putnam and knew of the fame of the academy and he respected the hall owner accordingly  i will be after hearing all the particulars of this case said he as he sat down to his desk  in a long rambling story aaron fairchild told how he had come home from a visit to the city late the night before he had some goods for his shop with him and on going to the place had found the back door broken in and everything in the shop in confusion jewelry and other things to the value of a hundred and sixty dollars had been taken and on the floor he had found the memorandum book and the envelope from some boys in the hamlet he has learned that the rover boys belonged to the putnam hall cadets and farmer gassam had told him where to find the young soldiers then he had called up the constable and set out with the results already related  this certainly looks black for the rover boys said squire haggerty how do ye account for having the goods on your persons tell me that now  i can account for it only in one way said dick the thief whoever he was placed them there for the double purpose of keeping suspicion from himself and to get us into trouble  thin if he wanted to git you into throuble he was after being a fellow who had a grudge against ye  that must be it put in captain putnam  do ye know of any such persons  yes there are a number of such persons answered dick and he mentioned dan baxter flapp rockley and a number of others who in the past had proved to be his enemies  following this captain putnam related how dan baxter had escaped after trying to harm dick rover and how it was that lew flapp was considered an enemy and how the fellow had been dismissed from the academy along with several followers squire haggerty listened attentively  well if one of thim fellows robbed the shop he must have visited your camp too said squire haggerty did ye see any of thim around  captain putnam looked inquiringly at the rover boys  i must confess i didnt see any of them said dick  but we heard from lew flapp cried tom suddenly how strange that i didnt think of this before  where did you hear from him thomas  at the hotel where we stopped for supper yesterday a boy who works around the stables told me flapp had been there and was very angry because he had been sent away from the academy the boy said flapp vowed he was going to get square with the rovers for what they had done  what boy was that asked josiah cotton with interest  the boy was described and a little later he was brought over from the hotel he was very much frightened and insisted upon it that he had had nothing to do with the robbery  tell what you can about lew flapp said dick and the boy did so  that young fellow had been drinking or else he wouldnt have talked so much added the lad he certainly said he was going to get square with the rover brothers  have you seen him since  yes i saw him in the village right after the cadets left  anywhere near mr fairchilds shop  on the road that runs back of the shop  where was he going  i dont know  and that is the last you saw of him  yes sir  you dont know if he went towards the back of the shop  no sir  more than this the boy could not tell and he was excused squire haggerty shook his head in perplexity  i dont know about this he said but it looks to me as if ill have to hold these rover brothers until they can clear themselves     chapter vi  link smiths confession   for a moment there was a painful pause and the rover boys looked at each other and at captain putnam in perplexity  does this mean that we must go to jail demanded tom  i dont think it will be necessary to hold them came from captain putnam squire haggerty i presume you know who i am  yes sir captain putnam of putnam hall  then you will of course let me go on a bail bond for these three pupils of mine  if ye care to do it captain  certainly i am convinced that they are innocent why it is preposterous to think that they would break into such a shop and rob it of a hundred and sixty dollars worth of goods they are rich young gentlemen of a highstanding family and each has all the spending money he needs  i see i see  well it aint nuthin to me what they be so long as i git my goods back growled aaron fairchild i aint got nuthin against em personally especially if they are innocent  i think you will find it to your advantage to let this whole matter rest for the present went on captain putnam if you make a charge against the boys it will hurt both them and my school i feel sure they will not run away and i will give you my personal word that they shall appear in court whenever wanted  that sounds reasonable came from the constable who was beginning to fear the influence which captain putnam and the rovers might bring to bear on the case it aint no nice thing to ruin a boys repertation if he aint guilty he added  that is a sensible speech which does you credit sir said the captain  id like to find this feller flapp went on aaron fairchild how does he look  i have his photograph at the academy i will let the constable have that if he wishes it  that suits me returned josiah cotton hang me if i dont kinder think he must be guilty but it puzzles me how them things got in the boys uniforms  the matter was discussed for fully an hour and the whole party visited aaron fairchilds shop but no clews were brought to light then a wagon was hired to take the captain and the boys to putnam hall the constable went along to get the photograph which had been promised  on the way the three rovers were unusually silent and but little was said by the master of the school arriving at the hall the picture was turned over to josiah cotton who soon after departed then the three rovers were invited into the captains private office the marching battalion had not yet arrived and was not expected for several hours  id like to sift this matter out said the captain seating himself at his desk richard when did you clean your uniform last  yesterday afternoon captain putnam  were those holes in there then  i dont think so  how about your uniform thomas  i cleaned up yesterday morning i dont remember any holes  and you samuel  i had a hole in my left sleeve but the jewelry was found in the right sleeve  let me examine the coats  this was done and all concluded that the holes had been cut with the blade of a sharp knife or with a small pair of scissors  i believe the job was done in the dark said dick somebody must have visited our tent last night after we went to sleep  when did you go to sleep richard  well i dont think we were real sound asleep until about midnight there was some sort of a noise in the camp that kept us awake  somebody said tubbs was up playing negro minstrel added tom soberly  yes he was up so you went to sleep about midnight and when did you get up  at the first call answered sam  and your coats were as you had left them  mine was came from sam and dick  i dont remember exactly how i did leave mine said tom but i didnt notice anything unusual  then if the real thief visited our camp he must have come in between midnight and six oclock went on the master of the school i must question those who were on guard duty about this  thats the idea cried dick if the thief sneaked in somebody must have seen him  unless a guard was asleep on his post came from tom as it was the last night out they may have been pretty lax in that direction  dinner had been ordered and the three rovers dined with the captain in his private dining room then the boys went up to their dormitory to pack their trunks  i must say this is a fine ending for the term was toms comment as he began to get his belongings out of the closet and after everything looked so bright too  its a jolly shame cried sam if lew flapp did this or dan baxter id like toto wring his neck for it  it will certainly put a cloud on our name said dick in spite of what we can say some folks will be mean enough to think we are guilty  we must catch the thief and make him confess went on tom  the three boys packed their trunks and other belongings and then went below again and down to the gymnasium and then to the boathouse but they could not interest themselves in anything and their manner showed it  what is the matter that you came back so soon questioned mrs green the matron of the academy who knew them well  oh we had business with captain putnam answered tom and that was all he would say he dearly loved to play jokes on the matron but now he felt too downcast to give such things a thought  late in the afternoon the distant rattle of drums was heard and soon the battalion dusty and hot came into view making a splendid showing as it swung up the broad roadway leading to the hall  here they come cried sam but he had not any heart to meet his friends and kept out of sight until the young cadets came to a halt and were dismissed for the last time by captain putnam and major colby  well this is certainly strange said larry colby as he came up to dick what was the row in the barn about  ill have to tell you some other time larry was dicks answer there has been trouble and captain putnam wants to get at the bottom of it  somebody said you had been locked up for robbing a jewelry shop  there has been a robbery and we were suspected but we were not locked up  as soon as he was able to do so captain putnam learned the names of the twelve cadets who had been on picket duty between midnight and six oclock that morning these cadets were marched to one of the classrooms and interviewed one at a time in the captains private office  from the first six cadets to go in but little was learned one cadet when told that something of a very serious nature had occurredsomething which was not a mere school lark and could not be overlookedconfessed that he had allowed two cadets to slip out of camp and come back again with two capfuls of apples taken from a neighboring orchard  but i cant tell their names captain putnam the cadet added  how long were they gone beresford  not over fifteen or twenty minutes  did you see the apples  yes sir ierate two of them  and you allowed nobody else to pass  no sir  very well you may go and beresford went thankful that he had not been reprimanded for neglect of duty had the thing occurred in the middle of the term the reprimand would surely have been forthcoming  the next cadet to come in was link smith who showed by his general manner that he was much worried captain putnam knew smith thoroughly and also remembered that the feebleminded cadet was a fellow easily led astray  smith you were on guard duty from twelve oclock to two last night he began severely  yes sir answered link smith with an inward shiver  did you fall asleep on your post during that time  no sirthat is i dont think i did  what do you mean by saying you dont think you did  ithat isi was awfully sleepy and could scarcely keep my eyes open ii sat down on a rock for a little while  and slept  ii think not  was that before or after you allowed an outsider to get into our camp  oh captain putnam how did you know i let somebody in ithat isi mean who said i let anybody in stammered poor smith taken completely off his guard  never mind who told me what i want to know is did you sleep after you let him in or before  why iireally  tell me the truth smith  i guess i took a nap afterwards sir but it was only for a minute sir pleaded the cadet  i see did you see the outsider leave camp after you had let him in  why sirii  i want the strict truth remember smith if you dont tell the truth you may get yourself in great trouble  oh captain putnam ii didnt mean to do anything wrong  did you see the outsider leave again or not  yes sir i saw him leave  how soon after he had come in  about fifteen or twenty minutescertainly not much longer than that  now who was the outsider  why ieri  answer me smith and now captain putnams voice was as keen as the blade of a knife he stood before the frightened cadet looking him squarely in the eyes  it was lew flapp but oh please dont let him know i told you hell kill me if he finds it out link smith was about ready to cry  lew flapp the captain drew a long breath how did you come to let him in you knew he had been dismissed from the school  he begged me to let him in saying he merely wanted to speak to two of his old friends i asked him why he didnt wait until morning but he said he wanted them to do something for him before they left the schoolthat he must see them then and there  did he mention his friends names  no sir  what did he say when he went away  nothing much sir excepting that he had seen them and it was all right  where did he go to  i dont know it was dark and i soon lost sight of him  he came alone  yes sir but please captain putnam dont tell him i told you or hell kill me  dont be alarmed smith ill protect you if you see flapp again tell me at once  i will sir  this ended the examination of link smith and as soon as it was over the remainder of the cadets who had been on guard duty the night before were likewise told they might go     chapter vii  fun on the campus   it was lew flapp just as i supposed said dick when he heard the news from captain putnam what a rascal he is getting to be almost as bad as dan baxter  oh he would have to be a good deal worse than he is to be as bad as dan returned sam but i admit he is bad enough  id give some money to lay my hands on him put in tom oh but wouldnt i punch his head good and hand him over to the police afterwards  word was sent to josiah cotton and other officers of the law to look for flapp but for the time being nothing was seen or heard of that individual  the rover boys were to start for home the next day and that night a large number of the cadets held a special jollification on the parade ground in front of the hall a bonfire was lit and the lads danced around and sang to their hearts content  in the midst of the excitement somebody saw peleg snuggers the generalutility man of the school hurrying across the backyard  hullo there goes peleg was the shout  lets give him a rousing farewell boys came from tom rover hi there peleg come here  cant im in a hurry responded the manofallwork who had had the cadets plague him before  oh you must come was the cry and in a moment more peleg snuggers was surrounded  let us march him around on our shoulders went on tom peleg loves that i know he does  dont neither cried the generalutility man now tom rover you just let me alone  well carry you around for your rheumatism peleg youve got rheumatism havent you  no i havent  its good for the lumbago too  aint got no lumbaoh crickey let me down boys i dont want a ride  behold the conquering hero comes announced sam as six of the boys hoisted poor snuggers up into the air now sit up straight peleg dont you want a sword  heres a broom put in fred garrison and handed over an article which was worn to a stump present arms forward march general washtub will lead the funeral procession  if you let me tumble ill break my neck gasped peleg snuggers oh creation how can i carry that broom and hold on too this is awful shall i call the captain let up i say  send for mrs green to give him some soothing syrup hes got the fits came from a cadet in the crowd  ill get her cried tom struck with a new idea  off ran the funloving youth to the kitchen of the academy where the matron was superintending the work of several of the hired girls  oh mrs green come quick he gasped as he caught the lady by the arm  what is it tom  its poor peleg they say hes got a fit he wants some soothing syrup or something  well i never ejaculated mrs green a fit poor man shall i ring for the doctor  perhaps you had better ring for two doctors or else come and see if you can help him  ill do what i can answered the matron and ran to get some medicine from a chest i know what it is she added its indigestion he ate four ears of green corn for dinner and four for supperand it was very green at that  then he will surely want mrs green to help him murmured tom  off hurried the matron with some medicine and tom at her heels  in the meantime the boys had marched poor peleg close to the fire  now steady cried sam dont let him fall into the flames and singe his hair  let us warm his feet for him cried a cadet take off his shoes and stockings  hi dont you do nuthin of the kind cried peleg snuggers in new alarm my feet are warm enough  but there was no help for it and in a twinkling off came his shoes and his socks followed  i aint agoin to have my feet warmed groaned the utility man you are worse nor heathens lemme go  he struggled violently but the cadets placed him on the grass and sat on him then one who had run down to the icehouse for a piece of ice came up  heres a redhot poker he said peleg dont you want your initials branded on your feet  no no oh help somebody help yelled the utility man  be careful or he may get a spasm whispered dick who was looking on without taking part  oh hes all right returned the cadet with the ice wait till i brand a p on one foot and an s on the other and he drew the ice across the sole of one foot as he spoke  the poor utility man thought it was a redhot poker and gave a yell which would have done credit to a south sea savage he squirmed and fought and in the midst of the melee mrs green and tom arrived  there he is said tom he certainly must have a fit  poor peleg cried mrs green here my dear take this it will do you good and she held out the bottle of medicine she had brought take about a big spoonful  hurrah mrs green to the rescue shouted sam come peleg dont be backward about coming forward  what is this mrs green asked the astonished manofallwork as he suddenly sat up  its for your cramps or fits or whatever youve got peleg  cramps or fits i aint got no cramps or fits are you crazy mrs green  oh peleg dont act so you certainly have cramps or indigestion come take the medicine  that fer your medicine roared the angry manofallwork and flung the bottle into the bonfire  oh that medicine shrieked the matron and i made it myself too  its them pesky boys mrs green they be atormenting the life out of me  the boys the matron stopped short in wonder  yes mum theyve stolen my shoes and socks and they started to brand me with a redhot poker i aint got no fits nur cramps nur nuthin i aint  well i declare burst out the thoroughly angry matron tom rover come here  thank you mrs green ill come day after tomorrow murmured tom as he kept at a safe distance  well i guess you are all in this together went on mrs green looking at the crowd of cadets its your last night and i suppose you will tear the academy down over our ears  why mrs green we never do anything wrong said sam reproachfully  oh no of course not was the sarcastic answer ill be thankful to find myself alive after you are all gone and with this reply the matron bounced off into the kitchen where she slammed the door after her  here are your shoes peleg said george granbury as he handed them over  i want my socks first  here you are came from larry colby as larrys term as major was now over he was inclined to be as full of fun as anybody  peleg took his socks and his shoes and started to put on the former  hullo whats this he cried and shook one foot violently whats in that sock a grasshopper i declare larry colby did you do that  why peleg you know i never play any jokes answered the exmajor innocently  dont i though but never mind the generalutility man started to put on the other sock if you thinkgreat snakes whats this oh my foot a hoptoad beastly and peleg flung the toad at larry the exmajor dodged and the animal struck william philander tubbs full in the face  oh ahwhat do youahmean by such actions stormed the aristocratic cadet i shall report this  hurrah tubby has gone into the frograising business shouted tom merrily  i shant put nuthin on here went on peleg snuggers and watching his chance he ran off at top speed with his shoes in one hand and his socks in the other     chapter viii  goodbye to putnam hall   now songbird give us one of your best poetical effusions came from dick rover after the excitement had died down a little we havent heard a word out of you for fourteen minutes and a quarter  yes songbird turn on the poetry spigot and let her flow put in tom  give us something on old schooldays came from another cadet  put in a touch of last farewells added another  dont forget to speak of the moon and fond memories  or shall we ever forget  or camping on the old campground songbird  and of all things mention the soup we had last thursday no piece of poetry would be complete without that soup  whos making up poetry about soup roared songbird powell but then he grew calmer all right fellows here goes and he started  of all the days to memry dear the dearest days are those spent here   when we  thats a libel interrupted tom captain putnams rates are no higher than the rates of other firstclass academies i move we cut that verse out songbird  i didnt mean the cost of the days spent here  you cant spend anything here put in george granbury you have to go to cedarville to do your shopping  ill make a fresh start came from powell and he warbled  old putnam hall i do adore and love the place as neer before the campus boathouse fishing pier the roads that run from far and near each classroom is a hallowed spot though many lessons are forgot the dormitories bright and clean no better rooms were ever seen the messroom where we gathered oft  to eat our eggs both hard and soft  finished up tom and then went on  the prison wherein i was cast and thought that day would be my last the teachers sweet and the teachers sour and the feasts we held at the midnight hour the games of ball we lost and won and the jubilees what lots of fun and then the skating on the ice  when we broke in twas not so nice  interrupted george granbury referring to a calamity the particulars of which have already been related in the rover boys in the mountains and then songbird powell took up the strain once more  i love each corner and each nook i love the lake and love the brook i love the cedars waving high  and love the dinners with mince pie  interrupted tom once more and continued  in fact i love it one and all there is no spot like putnam hall  and then with one accord all standing around joined in the academy cheer  zip boom bang ding dong ding dong bang hurrah for putnam hall then the fire was stirred up more boxes and barrels piled on top and the cadets danced around more wildly than ever they were allowed to keep up the fun until midnight when all were so tired that further sport was out of the question and all went sound asleep  bright and early the next morning the cadets assembled for their last breakfast in the messroom the parade was dispensed with for some had to leave by the early boat on the lake in order to make the proper connections many were the handshakings and the kind words of farewell some of the students had graduated and were not to come back of these a few were bound for college while others were going into various lines of business  we shall never forget our days at putnam hall said more than one  and i shall never forget you boys answered captain putnam i wish all of you the best of success in life  it was not until ten oclock that the three rover boys left for cedarville in the big school stage as was usual peleg snuggers drove the turnout which was filled to overflowing with cadets behind the stage came a big wagon heavily loaded with trunks and boxes  now young gents no cutting up pleaded the generalutility man the hosses wont stand it nowhow  thats an old scare peleg replied tom he had a tin horn and gave a loud blast that will let folks know we are coming and then a dozen other horns sounded out while some of the cadets began to sing  a few minutes after reaching the steamboat dock at the village which as my old readers know was located on the shore of cayuga lake the golden star came along and made her usual landing the boat looked familiar to them and they gave the captain a rousing greeting  over a dozen pupils were to make the trip to ithaca at the foot of the lake there the rovers would get aboard a train which would take them to oak run the nearest railroad station to their home  the golden star looks like an old friend remarked dick when they were seated on the front upper deck enjoying the refreshing breeze that was blowing  i am never on this boat but what i think of our first meeting with dan baxter and with dora stanhope and nellie and grace laning came from tom what an enemy dan baxter has been from that time on  and what a pile of things have happened since that time was sams comment by the way it is strange that none of us have heard from any of those girls lately they ought to be coming east from california by this time  i wish they were home went on tom id like to propose something  maybe youd like to propose to nellie put in his younger brother slyly  no sooner than youd propose to grace was toms prompt answer which made sam blush dick he went on wouldnt it be great if we could get the girls and mrs stanhope to take that trip with us on the houseboat  that would certainly be immense cried the eldest rover enthusiastically why didnt we think of it before we might have written to them about it  is it too late to write now asked sam or maybe we can telegraph  perhaps mrs laning wants her girls at home now said dick slowly they have been away a long time remember  perhaps mrs laning might go along we could have a jolly time of it with six or seven boys and perhaps the same number of girls and ladies  the idea of having the girls along interested the three rovers greatly and they talked of practically nothing else during the trip on cayuga lake  ithaca reached they bid farewell to the last of their school chums who were to depart in various directions and then made their way to one of the hotels for dinner  there they are mamma they heard a wellknown voice exclaim oh how glad i am that we didnt miss them and the next moment dora stanhope rushed up followed by nellie and grace laning and mrs stanhope  well of all things ejaculated dick as he shook hands warmly where did you drop from  we were talking about you during the trip from cedarville said tom as he too shook hands all around followed by sam  we were wondering why you hadnt written added sam  we were going to surprise you answered grace we expected to get home yesterday and visit the academy but there was a breakdown on the line and our train was delayed and that made us miss a connection  we thought sure wed miss you said nellie it made us feel awfully  have you dined yet asked dick  no  then you must all come and take dinner with us we want to hear all youve got to tell  and we want to hear what youve got to tell too said dora with a merry laugh she was looking straight into dicks eyes have you had a good time at the hall  yes but we had a better time at the encampment  i heard you met some very nice young ladies up there went on dora  who wrote to you about that dora  oh never mind i heard it and thats enough  well we did meet some nice young ladies  oh and dora turned away for a moment they were on their way to the dining room and the others were temporarily out of hearing  but i didnt meet anybody half as nice as you went on dick in a low tone of voice and caught her hand  oh dick she said this with a toss of her head but smiled nevertheless  its true dora i wished you were there more than once i would have written more only we had a whole lot of trouble with our enemies  and you really did think of me  i didnearly every day i suppose you forgot all about me and thats why you didnt write  dick rover you know better than that  i suppose you met some stunning californian that owns a gold mine and he claimed all of your attention  i did meet one rich young man andand he proposed to me faltered dora  oh dora and now dicks heart seemed to stop beating and youyou didnt accept him did you  would you care if i did she whispered dora he answered half fiercely  well i told him i didnt want him so there said dora hurriedly i told him that i wanted to marry somebody that lived in the east and that ii  and that you had the young man picked out why didnt you tell him that dora you know  hi you folks came in a cry from tom what are you steering for the smoking room for we are bound for the dining room  well i never murmured dora dick we had better watch out where we are going  thats right they turned toward the dining room dora you know as i was saying that  dick rover i thought we were going to dinner just see the folks what a crowd you musnt talk like that here  yes thats true but  you really must mind dick she gave him a bright smile iiguess i understand you  and then all went in to dinner     chapter ix  the rover boys at home   there was a great deal to tell on all sides and the dinner lasted over an hour the stanhopes and the lanings had had a grand time while at santa barbara and the widow was much improved in health so much so in fact that she was now practically a well woman those who had been in the far west listened with interest to the boys doings at the hall and during the encampment and were amazed to think that dan baxter and his father had turned up once more and that arnold baxter was trying to turn over a new leaf  i do not believe dan will ever turn over a new leaf said dora he is a thoroughly bad young man  let us hope that he does said her mother i do not wish to see anybody throw himself away as that young man is doing  after this you will have to watch out for this lew flapp as well as for dan baxter said nellie both appear to be painted with the same brush  during the dinner the houseboat project was broached and the boys spoke of what a fine time they expected to have on the ohio and perhaps on the mississippi  and we would like all of you to go with us said dick  with you exclaimed mrs stanhope  oh mamma what a delightful trip it would be exclaimed dora  and we would like your mother to go too went on tom to nellie and grace  oh if mamma would only go cried grace i am sure it would do her a great deal of good she goes away from home so little  the matter was talked over until it was time for the two parties to separate and the rovers promised to write more particulars in a few daysas soon as they knew more about the houseboat and how it was to be run and what sort of sleeping accommodations it afforded  the boys saw the stanhopes and the lanings on the boat bound up the lake and then almost ran to the depot to catch their train it came in directly and in half a minute more they were being whirled away in the direction of oak run  there is no use of talking those girls are just all right said sam bluntly i never met a nicer lot in my life  i guess dick thinks one of them is all right said tom with a grin although i dont see why you were steering her into the smoking room he added to his big brother were you going to teach her to smoke cigarettes  oh say tom let up grumbled dick you paid about as much attention to nellie as i did to dora  anyway i didnt steer her to the smoking room  no but while you were talking to her i saw you put five spoonfuls of sugar in her coffee for her returned dick maybe you didnt think she was sweet enough for you eh  at this tom reddened while sam set up a roar  hes got you tom cried the youngest rover better cry quits and talk about something else we all like those girls amazingly and thats the end of it and then the subject was changed  it was almost dark when oak run was reached here a carriage driven by jack ness the rovers hired man was in waiting for them  hullo jack cried tom all well at home  very well master tom was the answer and how are you and how is master dick and master sam  all o k and top side up jack said sam  they were soon in the carriage and then the hired man whipped up the team and away they sped across swift river through the village of dexters corners and then along the highway leading to the farm  i see the lights of home sang out sam as they made the last turn i can tell you it makes a fellow feel good doesnt it  its a true saying that there is no place like home returned dick here we are  the carriage made a turn around a clump of trees and then dashed up to the piazza from the house rushed several people  here we are father sang out dick how are you uncle randolph and how are you aunt martha  dick cried mr anderson rover and embraced his oldest son and tom and sam i am glad to see you looking so well  my boys murmured their aunt as of old and gave each a sounding kiss  getting to be big young men was their uncles comment they wont be boys much longer  im going to stay a boy all my life uncle randolph answered tom promptly by the way he went on with a merry twinkle in his eye how is scientific farming getting on  splendidly thomas splendidly  not losing money any more then  welleri have lost a little just a little this summer but next summer i expect grand results  going to grow a new kind of turnip  no i  or maybe its a squash this time uncle  no i am trying  or a parsnip i have heard there is a great call for parsnips in new zealand the natives use them for dyeing  thomas interrupted his father sternly please dont start to joke so early tomorrow will do  all right ill subside answered tom but really do you know im bubbling all over like an uncorked sodawater bottle  dont you feel hungry  hungry just you try me and see  i made a big cherry pie for you tom said his aunt i know you like it  oh aunt martha thats worth an extra hug he gave it to her your pie cant be beat  and ive got some fried chicken dick likes that  and i like it too said sam  yes i know it sam but i made some spice cakes too  oh aunt just my weakness cried the youngest rover theres another kiss for you and another youre the best aunt a boy ever had  they were soon washed up and sitting down to the table scarcely had they seated themselves than alexander pop came in acting as waiter something he always did when the boys came home alexander usually called aleck for short was a goodnatured colored man who had once been employed at putnam hall he had gone to africa with the rover boys as already related in the rover boys in the jungle and had been with them on numerous other trips he was now employed steadily in the rover household  howde do genmen he said with a broad grin on his coalblack face  aleck all three cried together how are you  fustrate thank yo yo am looking right smart too went on the colored man and then he began to serve them with the best the place afforded he loved dearly to talk but thought the present no time for so doing  it was a happy family gathering and all remained at the table a long time the boys telling their different tales from beginning to end mr anderson rover was much interested in what they had to say about the baxters and lew flapp  you must be careful said he arnold baxter can do you no more harm but the others will be worse than snakes in the grass  well watch out answered dick and then he and the others asked about the houseboat which had been taken for debt and how soon they could use the craft  you may use the houseboat as soon as you please said randolph rover but you must promise your father and aunt martha and me not to get into mischief  how could we get into mischief with a houseboat questioned tom why we just intend to knock around and take it easy all summer  the rest ought to do all of you a power of good came from his father i declare it seems to me you have been on the jump ever since you first went to putnam hall  where is the houseboat now  tied up at the village of steelville not very far from pittsburg as i wrote to you she is under the command of captain starr he knows the ohio and the mississippi thoroughly and will take you wherever you wish to go  well we want to stay home a few days first and make all of our arrangements said dick and so it was decided     chapter x  a scene in a cemetery   hurrah fred garrison says he will go with us cried sam two days later i have just received a telegram from him he says he will come on tomorrow  and here is word from songbird powell put in dick he will go too he is to meet us at pittsburg any time i say  and hans mueller will go said tom that makes three of our friends to start with i hope the lanings and the stanhopes go  so do i answered dick who could not get that talk with dora in the hallway of the hotel out of his head  sam was anxious to meet fred garrison and on the following afternoon drove down to the railroad station at oak run to greet his chum  the train was late and after finding this out sam took a walk around the village to see what changes had been made during the past few months but oak run was a slow place and he look in vain for improvements  guess ill have my hair cut while i am here he said to himself and started to enter the only barber shop of which the railroad village boasted  as he pushed open the door a young fellow got out of one of the chairs and paid the barber what was coming to him then he reached for his hat and started to leave  lew flapp ejaculated sam is it possible  the bully of putnam hall whirled around and gave a start he had not dreamed of meeting one of the rovers  whaterwhat do you want he stammered not knowing what to say  where did you come from flapp  thats my business  it was a fine trick you played on us while we were on the march back to putnam hall  trick i havent played any trick on you answered lew flapp loftily as he began to regain his selfpossession  you know well enough that you robbed that jewelry shop and then tried to lay the blame on me and my brothers  rover you are talking in riddles  no im not im telling the strict truth  bah lew flapp shoved forward let me pass  not just yet sam placed himself in front of the barber shop door  whats the row put in the barber who happened to be the only other person in the shop  this fellow is a thief mr gregg  you dont say cried lemuel gregg who did he rob  he robbed a jewelry shop up near putnam hall and then he laid the blame on my brothers and me  that was a mean thing to do  it is false roared lew flapp get out of my way or it will be the worse for you  im not afraid of you flapp responded sam sturdily mr gregg will you help me to make him a prisoner  are you certain of what you are doing questioned the barber nervously i dont want to get into trouble over this i once cut off a mans beard by mistake and had to pay twentytwo dollars damages  i know exactly what i am doing help me to make him a prisoner and you shall be well rewarded  at the promise of a reward lemuel gregg became interested he knew that the rovers were welltodo and could readily pay him handsomely for his services  youyou had better stay here young man he said to lew flapp if you are innocent it wont hurt you well have the squire look into this case  i wont stay roared the bully and making a sudden leap at sam he hurled the youngest rover to one side and tried to bolt through the door  no you dont came from the barber and leaping to the front he caught lew flapp by the end of the coat and held him  let go  i wont  then take that and the next instant lew flapp hit the barber a telling blow in the nose which made the blood spurt from that member then flapp dove for the door pulled it open and sped up the street with all speed  oh my nose he has smashed it to jelly groaned the barber as he rushed to the sink for some water  sam had been thrown against a barber chair so forcibly that for the moment the wind was knocked completely out of him by the time he was able to stand up flapp was out of the building  we must catch him he cried come on  catch him yourself growled lemuel gregg i aint going to stand the risk of being killed hes a reglar tiger he is and he began to bathe his nose at the sink  lew flapp was running towards the railroad but as soon as he saw that sam was on his track he made several turns finally taking to a side road which led to the oak run cemetery here he saw there were numerous bushes and cedar trees and thought he could hide or double on his trail without discovery  but he forgot one thingthat sam was a splendid runner and good of wind as well as limb try his best he could not shake the youngest rover off  the fool muttered the bully to himself why dont he give it up  flapp looked about him for a club but none was at hand then he picked up a stone and taking aim hurled it at sam the missile struck the youngest rover in the shoulder causing considerable pain  i reckon two can play at that game murmured sam and he too caught up a stone and launched it forth it landed in the middle of lew flapps back and caused the bully to utter a loud cry of anguish  stop flapp i am bound to catch you sooner or later cried sam  you come closer and ill fix you growled the bully ill hammer the life out of you  youve got to spell able first answered sam  the cemetery gained lew flapp ran along one of the paths leading to the rear along this path were a number of goodsized sticks he picked up one of these and a few seconds later sam did likewise  near the rear of the cemetery was a new receiving vault which had just been donated to the cemetery association by the widow of a rich stockholder who had died the year before the vault was of stone with a heavy iron door that shut with a catch and a lock  making a turn that hid him from sams view for the moment lew flapp espied the vault standing with the door partly open  he wont look for me in there reasoned the bully and slipped into the place with all possible alacrity once inside he crouched in a dark corner behind the door and waited  sam making the turn at just the right instant saw flapp disappearing into the vault without stopping he ran forward and closed the iron door allowing the heavy catch to slip into place  now lew flapp i guess ive got you he called out after he was certain the door was secure  to this the bully made no answer but it is more than likely his heart sank within him  do you hear me flapp you neednt pretend you are not in there for i saw you go in  still lew flapp made no answer  do you want me to go away and leave you locked in the vault continued sam it would be a beautiful place in which to die of starvation  let me out came from the bully and now he got up and showed his face at the small grating near the top of the door let me out rover thats a good fellow  then you dont want to die of starvation just yet  you wouldnt dare to leave me here you know you wouldnt  why not dont you deserve it after the trick you played on dick and tom and me  i tell you its all a mistake let me out and i will explain everything went on flapp who was now thoroughly alarmed  ill let you outafter i have summoned the town constable  dont have me locked up i beg of you sam give me a chance pleaded the bully  you dont deserve any chance you tried to send me and my brothers to prison and you have got to suffer for it  then you wont let me out  no  ill pay you well for it  you havent got money enough to pay me flapp and you know it  if you have me locked up ill say you helped me in that robbery  ah so you admit you did it cried sam triumphantly  no i admit nothing growled the bully  goodbye then  where are you going  i am going after the cemetery keeper and the constable answered sam and walked off without another word     chapter xi  attacked from behind   lew flapp watched sams departure with much anxiety as my old readers know he was a coward at heart and the thought of being put under arrest for the robbery of aaron fairchilds shop made him quake in every limb  i must get out of here i really must he told himself over and over again  he shook the door violently but it refused to budge then he tried to reach the catch by putting his hand through the grating but found it was out of his reach  its a regular prison cell he groaned what a fool i was to come in here  he tried to reach the catch by using his stick but that was also a failure  wonder if i cant find a bit of wire or something he mused and struck a match he had in his pocket  now it chanced that the widow who had given the new vault to the cemetery association had a horror of allowing supposed dead folks to be buried alive as a consequence she had had the vault furnished with an electric button which opened the door from the inside it had been stipulated that a light should be placed close to the button but as yet this was not in place  by the light of the match lew flapp saw the button and these words over it  to open the door and ring the bell push this button  good that just suits me he chuckled to himself but immediately had something of a chill thinking that the button might not yet be fixed to work  with nervous fingers he pushed upon the object there was a slight click and he saw the big iron door of the vault spring ajar  the trick is done and i am free he murmured and sprang to the door but here he paused again to gaze through the grating sam was out of sight and not another soul could be seen the coast was clear  now goodbye to oak run he muttered to himself i was a fool to come here in the first place even to meet that dan baxter  in a moment more he was out of the vault and running to the rear of the cemetery as fast as his legs would carry him  in the meantime sam made his way as quickly as possible to a house situated at the front corner of the cemetery where the keeper of the place resided  a knock on the door brought the keepers daughter she knew sam and smiled  what can i do for you sam she asked  where is your father jennie  he just went down to the village to buy a new spade  oh pshaw thats too bad  what is the matter i hope youre not going to have a funeral in your family  no funeral in this jennie i met a thief in oak run and tried to have him arrested he ran into the cemetery and hid in the new vault and i locked the door on him now i want your father or somebody else to help me take him to the lockup  a thief what did he steal  some jewelry its a long story do you know where i can find somebody else  jack sooker is working over to the other end of the cemeterycutting down an old tree you might get him  where  ill show you  jennie ran to get her hat she was just putting it on when a bell began to ring in the hall of the cottage  gracious me gasped the girl  whats the matter now  thats the bell to the new vault  i dont understand  there is an electric button in the vault when you push it it unlocks the door and rings this bell it was put there in case somebody was in the vault in a trance and came to life again  what ejaculated sam then that rascal must have pushed the button and opened the door from the inside  yes  im off he is not going to escape if i can help it and so speaking the youngest rover dashed off the porch of the cottage and in the direction from whence he had come  it did not take him long to reach the new vault and a glance through the open doorway showed him that his bird had flown  what a dunce i was not to think of that electric button he mused i knew mrs singleton had stipulated it should be put in she has a perfect horror of being buried alive  sam looked around in all directions but could see nothing of lew flapp  but not far away was a pile of loose dirt and in this he saw some fresh tracks pointing to the rear of the cemetery  thats his course he thought and set off in that direction he still carried the stick he had picked up and vowed that lew flapp should not get away so easily again  the end of the cemetery bordered on the swift river a stream which has already figured in these stories of the rover boys it was a rocky swiftflowing watercourse and the bank at the end of the burying ground was fully ten feet high  perhaps he crossed the river thought the youngest rover but he couldnt do that very well unless he had a boat and then he would run the risk of being dashed on the rocks  the edge of the river reached sam looked around on all sides of him lew flapp was still nowhere to be seen  ive missed him thought sam what next  as the youngest rover stood meditating a figure stole from behind some bushes which were close at hand the figure was that of lew flapp who had been on the point of turning back when he had seen sam coming  he will raise an alarm as soon as he sees me reasoned the bully oh if only i could get him out of my way  he gazed at the youngest rover and when he saw how close to the waters edge sam was standing a sudden thought came into his mind as silently as a wild beast stealing on its prey he crept up to sam  there how do like that sam rover he cried triumphantly and gave the youngest rover a shove which sent him over the bank and into the rocky stream below  sam gave out one yell and then with a loud splash sank beneath the surface  lew flapp gazed for a second in the direction wondering when sam would reappear but then a new fear took possession of him and off he ran this time harder than ever  his course was along the river bank for a distance of a hundred yards and then he came out on a road leading to a small place called hacknack  to hacknack he muttered after reading a signboard thats the place im looking for one mile eh well i had better lose no time in getting there  the bully was a fair walker and now fear lent speed to his limbs and in less than fifteen minutes he reached the hamlet named he gazed around and presently located a small cottage standing near the edge of a sandpit  that must be the cottage he told himself and walking to it he rapped on the door four times in succession and then four times again  there was a stir within and then an old woman bent with age and with a wicked look in her sharp yellowish eyes came to answer his summons  is this mother mattersons place he asked  yes im mother matterson squeaked the old woman who are you and what do you want  my name is lew flapp im looking for a fellow called si silvers he added for that was the name dan baxter had assumed for the time being  its all right old woman tell him to come in said a voice from inside the cottage and lew flapp entered the house immediately the old woman closed the door after him and barred it     chapter xii  flapp and baxter plot mischief   the cottage which mother matterson occupied was a much dilapidated one of a story and a half containing three rooms and a loft some of the windows were broken out and the chimney was sadly in need of repair  many were the rumors afloat concerning this old woman some said she was little short of being a witch while others had it that she was in league with tramps who had stolen things for miles around but so far if guilty she had escaped the penalty of the law  so youve come at last went on the person in the cottage as lew flapp came in and a moment later dan baxter came into view he was tall and lanky as of old with a sour look on his face and several scars which made him particularly repulsive i had almost given you up  ive had my own troubles getting here answered flapp at first i couldnt locate hacknack and then i had the misfortune to fall in with sam rover  sam rover is he on your track now  i rather guess not and the bully of putnam hall gave a short laugh he has gone swimming for his health  what do you mean  ill tell you answered lew flapp and in a rapid manner he related all that had occurred since he had met sam in the oak run barber shop  well all i can say is that you are a lucky dog came from dan baxter at the conclusion of the recital you can thank your stars that you are not at this moment in the oak run lockup  i shouldnt have run any risk at all if it hadnt been for you growled flapp  oh dont come any such game on me flapp i can read you like a book you know you dont dare to go homeafter that tripup at white corners your old man would just about kill youand youd be locked up in the bargain  at these words lew flapp winced for he knew that dan baxter spoke the truth he was afraid to go home and had come to hacknack simply because he knew not where else to go and because baxter had promised him some money the amount he had realized on the sale of the stolen jewelry had been spent  see here whats the use of talking that way he grumbled i didnt come here to get a lecture  im not lecturing you came hastily from dan baxter im merely telling you things for your own good flapp i want you to pull with me i know well get along swimmingly  you said youd let me have some money  and ill keep my word  i need at least fifty dollars  youll need more than that flapp youve got to stay away from home until this matter blows over or until your old man patches things up with that aaron fairchild and the white corners authorities ive got a plan if you care to listen to it  sure ill listenif youll only let me have that money  ill let you have all you wantproviding youll agree to help me  well what is your plan but first tell me how about this woman and flapp nodded his head toward mother matterson  dont you worry about her grinned dan baxter ive got her fixed she wont squeal  then go ahead  as i said before the best thing you can do is to stay away from home until this unpleasantness blows over write to your father and tell him it is all a mistake and that you are not guilty but that you cant prove it ask him to square the thing with aaron fairchild and the others and tell him you are going on an ocean trip and wont be back until you know you are safe then you come with me and well have a jolly good time besides squaring up matters with the rovers  where are you going and how are you going to square matters with them  ive learned a thing or two since i came here at first i was going to try to fix them while they were at home but now ive learned that they are going away on a houseboat trip on the ohio and the mississippi i propose to follow them and give them more than they want the first opportunity that presents itself  you are certain about this houseboat trip  i am  and who is going  the three rover boys and some of their school chums  humph id like to get square with the whole crowd muttered lew flapp id like to sink them in the middle of the ohio river  well square up dont you worry answered dan baxter im not forgetting all theyve done against me in the past if i had the chance id wring the neck of every one of them he added fiercely  i dont think it is safe to stay around here any longer said lew flapp after a pause somebody may spot us both  im not going to stay any longer we can get out on the night train by the way supposing sam rover doesnt get out of the river  what do you mean questioned flapp with a shiver although he knew well enough  maybe sam rover was drowned  oh dont say that  bah dont be chickenhearted flapp  iididnt mean totokill him  i know you didnt just the same that is a dangerous river the current is swift and its full of rocks  youre making me feel very uncomfortable  oh dont worry those rover boys are like catseach has nine lives sam rover will be hotfooted after you before you know it  have you got that money with you baxter  to be sure i have i never travel without a wad  then let me have some  you wont need it if we are to travel together  we may become separated urged lew flapp he did not altogether trust his companion  well i reckon thats so too ill let you have twentyfive dollars when thats gone you can come to me for more but remember one thing youve got to help me to down the rovers  ill help you to do that butbut  but what  we mustnt go too far  oh you leave that to me youve heard how they treated my father havent you  they say dick rover was kind to him  bah thats a fairy story  but your father says the sameso i have been told  the old man is out of his headon account of that fire when he gets clearheaded again he wont think dick roveror any of the rovers for the matter of thatis his friend  there was another pause  where do you propose to go to  philadelphia on a little business first and then to pittsburg and to that place where they have their houseboat  and after that  im going to be guided by circumstances but you can rest assured of one thing flappill make those rover boys wish they had never undertaken this trip  dan baxter brought out a pocketbook well filled with bank bills and counted out five fivedollar bills  my but youre rich cried the bully of putnam hall  oh ive got a good bit more than that was the bragging answer i want you to know that once upon a time my father was as rich as the rovers and he would be as rich now if it wasnt that they cheated him out of his rights to a gold mine went on dan baxter bringing up something which has already been fully explained in the rover boys out west the claim belonged to the rovers but the baxters would never admit this  did they really cheat him questioned lew flapp with interest  they certainly did  then why didnt you go to law about it with them  they stole all the evidence so we couldnt do a thing in law do you wonder that i am down on them  no i dont if i were you id try to get my rights back  im going to get them back some day answered dan baxter and i am going to square up with all the rovers too mind that     chapter xiii  chips and the circus bills   it is now time that we return to sam and find out how he fared after being so unexpectedly hurled into the river by lew flapp  the youngest rover was taken so completely off his guard that he could for the moment do nothing to save himself down he went and his yell was cut short by the waters closing over his head  he was dazed and bewildered and swallowed some of the water almost before he was aware but then his commonsense returned to him and he struggled to rise to the surface  as he neared the top the current carried him against a sharp rock instead of clutching this he hit the rock with his head the blow almost stunned him and down he went once more around the rock and along the river a distance of fully a hundred feet ere he again appeared  by this time he realized that he was having a battle for his life and he clutched out wildly for the first thing that came to hand it was a tree root and by its aid he pulled himself to the surface of the river and gazed around him  he was under the bank at a point where the current had washed away a large portion of the soil exposing to view half of the roots of a tree standing above to get out of the stream at that spot was an impossibility and he let himself go once more when he had regained his breath and felt able to take care of himself  in a few minutes more sam reached a point where to climb up the bank was easy and he lost no time in leaving the river once on the bank he squeezed the water out of his garments he had lost his cap but spent no time in looking for the head covering  oh if only i had lew flapp here he muttered over and over again but the bully had as we already know made good his escape and sam found it impossible to get on his track soaked to the skin he made his way back through the cemetery  hullo so you have fallen into the river sang out a man who saw him coming it was jack sooker the fellow mentioned by the cemetery keepers daughter  no i was pushed in answered sam who knew sooker fairly well  how did it happen sam  i was after a rascal i wanted to have locked up but he shoved me into the river and got away  you dont tell me where is he now  i dont know  thats too bad do i know him  no he is a stranger around these parts  a young fellow  yes about dicks age  cant say as ive seen him what are you going to do about it  i dont know yet ive got to get some dry clothes first  sam walked up to the cottage at the corner of the cemetery jennie the keepers daughter saw him coming and gave a cry at his wet garments  can i dry myself here he asked after he had explained the situation  to be sure you can sam she answered and stirred up the fire in the kitchen stove if you wish ill lend you a suit of my brother zacks clothesthat is if you are in a hurry  thanks ill borrow the suit i want to report this and ill send the suit back tomorrow  you neednt hurry zack isnt home just now so he doesnt need the suit  the clothes were found and sam slipped into a bedchamber of the cottage and made the change then after thanking jennie once more for her kindness the youngest rover set off for oak run as fast as he could  a train was just coming into the depot and the first person to hop off was fred garrison  hullo i thought youd meet me sang out fred how are you  pretty well considering answered sam with a quiet smile but ive had a whole lot of happenings since i drove down to the depot  whats the matter horse run away  no i met lew flapp  nonsense why what is he doing around here  i give it up fred but he was here and we have had a lively time of it answered sam and told his story  well ill be jiggered what do you propose to do next  i dont know what to do i might get the village constable to hunt for him but i dont think it will do any good  why dont you tell your folks first  yes i reckon that will be best jump in the carriage and ill drive you over to our home  fred had but little to tell out of the ordinary his folks had wanted him to go to the seashore for the summer but he had preferred to take the houseboat trip with the rovers  i am sure we shall have a dandy time he said i was on a houseboat trip once down in florida and it was simply great  what do you think about the lanings and the stanhopes going with us  that will be nice we certainly ought to have a bangup time answered fred enthusiastically  sam had driven over with the best horse the rover stable afforded a magnificent bay which anderson rover had purchased in albany at a special sale early in the spring sam had pleaded to take the steed and his parent had finally consented  thats a fine bit of horseflesh you have observed fred as they sped along the level road leading to valley brook farm i like the manner in which he steps out firstrate  chips is a good horse answered sam there is only one fault he has  and what is that  he is easily frightened at a bit of paper or some other white object in the road  that is bad  the conversation now changed and the boys spoke of the good times ahead farm after farm was passed until they were almost in sight of valley brook  what a beautiful stretch of country observed fred as he gazed around i dont wonder that your uncle settled here while your father was in africa  we used to hate the farm tom especially we thought it was too dead slow for anything but now we love to come back to it after being at school or somewhere else  they were just passing the farm next to that of the rovers when a man came driving up to them at a rapid gait he was seated on a buckboard and had behind him a box filled with showbills  visit the circus day after tomorrow biggest show on earth for a quarter he shouted and flung a couple of bills at them  a circus began fred when without warning chips made a wild leap that nearly threw him and sam into the road scared by the sight of the showbills the horse made a plunge and then began to run away  whoa chips whoa sang out sam  dontdont let him get away sam came from fred as he gripped the side of the carriage  he shant get away if i can help it was the answer from between sams shut teeth whoa chips whoa he went on  but chips wouldnt whoa and the sight of another white handbill in the middle of the road caused him to shy to one side both boys were unseated and sam would have gone to the ground had not fred held him fast  whoa yelled sam and now he pulled in tighter than ever on the reins but on and on went the bay steed straight through the lane leading to the rovers barn  hell smash us up gasped fred  hi hi came from the barnyard and then dick rover came into view his quick eye took in the situation in an instant and he made a grand dash to reach chips head he was successful and in spite of the steeds efforts to throw him off held on until at last the bay was brought to a standstill trembling in every limb and covered with foam  how did this happen samuel asked his uncle as he too came forward  a fellow with circus bills scared him answered sam and he added id just like to catch that fellow and give him a piece of my mind  and so would i added fred  are either of you hurt  no  let us be thankful for that said mr rover and then had the horse taken to the stable by jack ness     chapter xiv  fun at the show   as soon as the family were assembled and fred had been greeted all around sam told of what had happened since he had started out to have his hair cut  well youve had your share of happenings declared mrs rover it is a wonder you are alive to tell of them  we ought to go after lew flapp said dick he ought to be arrested by all means  yes but where are you going to look for him  perhaps he will take the late train tonight from oak run  thats an idea came from tom let us watch the train  this was decided upon and he and dick accompanied by their father went to oak run that evening for that purpose but lew flapp and dan baxter took the train from a station three miles away so the quest was unsuccessful  i guess he didnt let the grass grow under his feet said sam the next morning no doubt he was badly scared  what could he have been doing in this neighborhood asked dick  i give it up  during the day sam got his hair cut and also returned the clothing loaned to him by the cemetery keepers daughter while in oak run he met the fellow who was distributing circus bills  you want to be more careful when distributing bills said he to the man  whats the matter with you growled the circus agent  you scared my horse yesterday and made him run away  oh go tumble over yourself growled the fellow and turned away  the manner of the man angered sam and likewise angered tom who happened to be along  some of those circus chaps think they own the earth was toms comment ive a good mind to go to his old circus and have some fun with the outfit  just the thing tom let us ask the others to go too i havent seen a circus in a long time  well this wont be much to look at but we may get some fun out of it added tom with a sly wink  yes there is sure to be fun when you are around added his younger brother with a laugh  when the circus was mentioned at home dick said he would be glad to go and so did fred  it is frozzlers grand aggregation of attractions said tom looking over one of the showbills the most stupendous exhibition on earth daring bareback riding trained elephants and a peanuteating contest likewise an egghunting raffle all for a quarter twentyfive cents  what is an egghunting raffle questioned fred  hes fooling you fred answered sam you mustnt believe all tom says  thus doth mine own flesh go back on me came from tom with an injured look never mind it is put and carried that we go and see frozzlers outfit occupying reserved orchestra chairs close to the family circle and adjoining the second gallery west  as soon as it was settled tom and sam laid their heads together to have all the fun they could at the circus just to get square with that agent as sam expressed it  none of the older folks wanted to go for which the boys were thankful  say id like to see dat show tom said aleck pop when he got the chance aint seen no circuses since i was a little boy  then you must go by all means aleck but dont you get too close to the monkey cage  why not tom  they might take you for a longlost brother  yah yah dats one on me aleck showed his ivories in a broad grin maybe da will take yo for a longlost brudder tooyo is so full ob monkey shines and then tom had to laugh at the sally  at the proper time the four boys drove over to the circus grounds taking aleck pop with them aleck was arrayed in his best and from his broad expanse of shirt bosom sparkled an imitation diamond which looked like a small electric light  tickets were procured for all by dick and the boys and the servant pressed their way into the first of the tents in company with one of the largest crowds ever gathered in that vicinity  now as it happened frozzlers grand aggregation of attractions was largely so only in name frozzler was himself the man who had given out the showbills his regular agent having refused to work because his salary had remained unpaid for three weeks the circus was fast going to pieces  here is where i am going to make a bunch of money said frozzler to himself as he saw the crowd coming in this day will put me on my feet again but he never saw the bunch of money in question for before the show was over a sheriff came along and levied on the receipts in behalf of several tradespeople and some performers  the exhibition was held in two tents one for the wild animals and the other for the ring performance the wild animals were in exactly eight wagon cages and consisted of a sicklylooking lion a halfstarved tiger several raccoons two foxes a small bear and about a dozen monkeys there were also two elephants one so old he was blind and could hardly stand  well this is a sell if ever there was one murmured tom after looking into the various cages  i feel like going out to the butcher shop and buying something with which to feed that tiger answered dick he looks as if he hadnt had a square meal for a week  im going to give the monkeys some peanuts thats the best i can do for them put in sam  if the ring show isnt better than this we are stuck sure was freds comment  hullo theres that handbill man now cried tom as giles frozzler came into the tent wont he laugh when he sees how sam and fred have been stuck  two of the circus employees were near by and from their talk fred learned that the showbill man was the proprietor of the circus  he certainly must be a onehorse fellow or he wouldnt be throwing out his own showbills said sam on hearing this  frozzler wore a soft hat and as he stood near the monkey cage tom threw some peanuts into the crown of the head covering  instantly the monkeys crowded forward one seized a peanut and another to get the rest of the nuts caught hold of the hat and pulled it into the cage  hi give me my hat roared giles frozzler and put his hand into the cage to get the article in question  the monkeys thought he had more peanuts and being half starved they grabbed his hand and pulled it this way and that while one gave the man a severe nip  oh oh screamed the circus man let go my hand you pesky rascal  hullo dat monkey am got a limb dat dont belong to no tree sang out aleck  you shut your mouth growled frozzler hi give me my hat he went on to the monkeys but the animals paid no attention to him they ate up the peanuts as fast as they could and then one began an investigation by pulling the band from the hat  the head covering was a new one purchased but two days before and to see it being destroyed made giles frozzler frantic  give me that you rascals he roared and began to poke at the monkeys with a sharp stick but two of them caught the stick and watching their chance jerked it away from him  hurrah score one for the monks sang out tom and this made the crowd laugh  if you dont shut up ill have you put out came angrily from giles frozzler  why dont you buy hats for the pool dear monkeys went on tom then they wouldnt want yours  oh you keep quiet  those monkeys are about starved said sam let us get up a subscription for their benefit i dont believe they have had a square meal in a year  all of the animals look starved said dick loudly  dat am a fac added aleck  this is a bum show cried a burly farmer boy standing close by why they have more animals nor this in a dime museum  will you fellows shut up cried giles frozzler this show is all right  of course youd say soyoure the feller wot put out them bills said the burly country boy  if you dont like the show you can get out  all right mr billman give me back my quarter  yes give me my quarter and ill go too put in one of the shopkeepers of oak run  and so will i go added a woman  me too came in a voice from the rear of the crowd  oh you people make me tired grumbled giles frozzler and then fearing that the people would really demand their money back he sneaked off leaving the monkeys to continue the destruction of his head covering     chapter xv  acts not on the bills   it was now almost time for the ring performance to begin dick had purchased socalled reserved seats for the crowd paying an additional ten cents for each seat but when they reached the tent with the ring they found that the reserved seats were merely a creation of fancy on the part of the circus owner giles frozzler had had imitation chair bottoms painted on the long boards used for seats and each of these buttons was numbered  this is a snide sure said sam  well there is one thing about it they cant crowd you answered dick and that was the one advantage the reserved seats afforded on the common seats the spectators were crowded just as closely as possible until the seats threatened to break down with the weight put upon them  there was a delay in opening the ring performance and for a very good reason in the dressing tent giles frozzler was having great difficulty in persuading his leading lady rider and his clown to go on both wanted their pay for the past two weeks  i shall not ride a step until i am paid said the equestrienne with a determined toss of her head  and i dont do another flipflap put in the clown  oh come dont talk like that argued giles frozzler ill pay you tomorrow sure  no  ill pay you tonightjust as soon as the performance is over just see what a crowd we havethe money is pouring in  at this the lady bareback rider hesitated and finally said she would go on but the clown would not budge  i may be a clown in the ring but not in the dressing room said he tartly i want my pay or i dont go on  all right then you can consider yourself discharged cried giles frozzler  he had started in the circus business as a clown and thought he could very well fill his employees place for a day or two in the meantime he would send to the city for another clown whom he knew was out of a situation  at last the show began with what frozzler termed on his handbills the grand opening parade consisting of the two elephants two ladies on horseback two circus hands on horseback the little bear who was tame and several educated dogs in the meantime the band consisting of seven pieces struck up a march which was more noise than harmony  heres your grand circus whispered sam beats the greatest show on earth to bits doesnt it  ill wager a big tomato against a peck of clams that i can get up a better show myself and do it blindfolded too returned tom  the grand opening at an end there was a bit of juggling by a juggler who made several bad breaks in his act and then came the lady bareback rider at the same time frozzler came out dressed in a clowns suit and painted up  hullo theres that chap again cried dick he must be running half the show himself  how are you tomorrow sang out the clown and after doing a flipflap he continued mr ringmaster whats the difference between your knife and me  i know shouted tom his knife is a jackknife while you are a jackofalltrades  at this sally there was a loud laugh  what is the difference between my knife and you queried the ringmaster as soon as he could make himself heard  thats it  i dont know  i told you shouted tom  the difference between your knife and me answered frozzler is that you can shut your knife up but you cant shut me up and then he made a face and did another tumble  his knife is sharper than you too cried sam a roar followed which made frozzler so angry he shook his fist at the youngest rover  why is that boy like a fish cried frozzler  because hes too slippery for a clown to catch put in fred loudly and this created such a laugh that frozzlers answer was completely lost on the crowd again he shook his fist at our friends but they merely laughed at him  i had a funny dream last night went on the clown what do you think i dreamed  that you had paid all your bills called out dick  this brought forth another laugh at frozzlers expense in which even some of the circus hands joined  say those boys are sharp said the clown who had been discharged i shouldnt care to run up against them  three of them are the rover boys answered a man sitting near nobody can get the best of them  i dreamed a whale came along and swallowed me went on frozzler  hullo i knew you were a jonah sang out tom and once more the crowd roared  in the whale i met my old schoolmate billy black continued the clown  that was a black moment for poor billy was sams comment  did you give billy a whaling asked tom  did dat whale git a stummick ache from swallerin yo came loudly from aleck i tink any whale would less his insides was copperlined  aleck said this so gravely that it brought forth a roar which did not subside for a full minute poor frozzler could do nothing and to save himself made half a dozen tumbles then he started to run from the ring but tripped over one of the ropes and pitched headlong on his nose  hullo there a tumble extra sang out tom thank you nothing like giving us good measure  id like to wax that boy good growled giles frozzler as he shot into the dressing tent those youngsters spoiled my act completely and then he hurried to a pail of water to bathe his nose  the next act was fairly good and put the crowd in good humor once more but that to follow was so bad that many began to hiss then came a race which was as tame as it could possibly be and many began to leave  this is the worst circus yet said one man if anybody comes tonight hell be sold  im going to let all my friends know what a flat thing it is said another it isnt worth ten cents much less a quarter  the circus was to wind up with the riding of a trick mulethe animal being brought out by the clown  as it happened the regular clown and the mule were friends but the mule hated frozzler for the circus owner had on more than one occasion mistreated the animal  be careful of that mule said one of the hostlers as he turned the trick animal over to giles frozzler hes ugly this afternoon  oh i know how to manage him growled frozzler come on here you imp and he hit the mule in the side  instantly the mule made a bolt for the ring with frozzler running after him  one hundred dollars to anybody who can ride hankypanky sang out giles frozzler he is as gentle as a kitten and it is a great pleasure to be able  the clown got no further for just then the mule turned around and gave him a kick which sent him sprawling then like a flash hankypanky turned around caught frozzler by the waist and began to run around the ring with him  hi let go screamed the thoroughly frightened circus owner let go i say help he will kill me help  hurrah the mule has got the best of it sang out tom he knows how to run a circus even if that fellow dont  ill bet on the mule put in dick hes a nose ahead in this race  save me yelled frozzler drat that beast stop him somebody  there was intense excitement and several employees rushed forward to rescue frozzler but before this could be done the mule left the ring tent and dashed into the dressing room where he allowed the circus owner to drop into a barrel of water which was kept there in case of fire at this the crowd yelled itself hoarse and this scene brought the afternoon performance to an end     chapter xvi  aleck brings news   i reckon we got square was toms comment after the fun was over and they were on their way to the farm my but wasnt that circus owner mad  i dont think hell have another such crowd tonight said fred and he was right the evening performance was attended by less than a hundred people and a week later the show failed and was sold out completely  by the end of the week word was received from both the stanhopes and the lanings that all would be glad to join the rovers in their houseboat vacation they would take a train for pittsburg direct on the following wednesday morning and would there await their friends  this suits me to a t cried dick after reading the communication dora had sent him if we dont have the best time ever then it will be our own fault  just what i say answered sam who had received a long letter from grace  there were many articles to pack and ship to pittsburg the boys also made out a long list of the things to be purchased for the trip and in this their father and their aunt helped them  sunday passed quietly all of the boys attending both church and sunday school it was a hard matter for tom to keep still on the sabbath day but he did so much to his aunts comfort  aleck pop was highly delighted to think that he was to be taken along especially as cook  ise gwine to do ma level best fo yo an fo de ladies said the colored man yo is gwine to hab reglar waldorfastoria feed  dont feed us too good aleck or well all die of dyspepsia said sam  ill take care of dat massah sam dont yo remember how i used to cook when we was out in de wilderness ob africa  indeed i do aleck yes i know youll take care of us answered sam  on the day before the start the boys were surprised to see hans mueller appear with a big trunk and a dresssuit case the german boy came over from oak run in a grocery wagon having been unable to find a cab  how you all vos said he shaking hands i dink first i go py dot pittsburg und den i dinks me i got lost maybeso i come here  thats right hans said dick

got three dress suits in his trunk  phew hell leave us in the shade entirely say hans have you got any patent leathers  yah i got two pairs of batentleather shoes  hope you brought your pumps put in sam who had come up  bumps queried hans with a puzzled look vy i pring me a bump does der poat leak  well thats the limit roared dick  sam means your dancing pumps said fred you mustnt forget them you

and a pair of rubber boots in case we have to walk ashore in the mud some time  veil i got dem too answered hans  a letter had already been sent to captain starr asking him to have the houseboat brought up to pittsburg the captain was also told to have the dora thoroughly cleaned and put in proper trim for he outing  we want the ladies to be satisfied with her appearance said dick  and especially since she is named the dora grinned tom  oh youre only piqued because she isnt named the nellie retorted his older brother with a laugh  never mind dick some day you can use the houseboat on a honeymoon answered tom and then ran off  at last came the time for the boys to leave the farm jack ness took all the trunks and suit cases to the depot and then transported the boys in the family carriage with aleck on the seat beside him  goodbye to valley brook farm cried tomb waving his hat  take good care of yourselves boys shouted anderson rover  dont get drowned put in the aunt and then with final adieux they were off the drive to oak run was a quick one and ten minutes later the train came in and they went aboard  the run to pittsburg was to occupy several hours so the boys made themselves as comfortable as possible they had dinner on the train and ordered the best of everything to be had  it had been arranged that all bound for the houseboat trip should meet at the american house and thither the boys made their way on reaching the smoky city as pittsburg is often called on account of its numerous manufactories  here we are cried a voice as soon as they entered and songbird powell hurried up to them i thought youd get here about this time  have you seen anything of the ladies queried dick  yes they are all in the ladies parlor i told them id keep a lookout for you  they made their way to the parlor where a great handshaking took place mrs stanhope and dora were there and also grace and nellie with mrs laning the latter was not used to traveling and was in quite a flutter  the girls insisted upon my coming said mrs laning i didnt think i could do it at first but they wouldnt take no for an answer  and we are real glad to have you answered dick  aleck had been sent off to hunt up captain starr and the houseboat and in the meantime all of the party obtained rooms for the night and then went to supper  this puts me in mind of the time we took dinner at ithaca said dick to dora on the way to the dining hall do you remember  indeed i do she answered with a pretty blush but please do not steer me into the smoking room again she added mischievously  dont you think we are going to have a good time dora  if i hadnt thought that i shouldnt have come answered the miss  it was a happy gathering and hans mueller kept the young folks convulsed by his odd speeches  and you tont vos put no salt py mine coffee in dis dime tom said hans referring to a trick which had once been played on him  all right hansy answered tom and please dont you pour any coffee down my back he added for he had not forgotten how he had been paid back for that joke  the supper lasted a long time and after it was over all went to one of the rooms upstairs where they spent a couple of hours very agreeably  we can be thankful that it is such pleasant weather said mrs stanhope an outing on a houseboat during a wet spell would not be so nice  oh wed try to make things pleasant said tom there is a piano on board and we could have music and singing  a piano oh tom cried nellie how nice it must be a regular little palace  i havent seen the boat yet uncle randolph said there was a piano on board  and ive got a guitar came from songbird powell  with which he will sing to the moon on dark nights came from tom  i haf got some musics py mine drunk in too said hans  what have you got hansy asked sama tin whistle  no a music pox vot mine fadder brought from chermany he vos a fine pox too i can told you  thats splendid hans said dora i love a good music box  so the talk ran on until there was a knock at the door and aleck appeared the look on his black face showed that he was excited  say massah dick i would like to see yo in private a minute he said  certainly replied dick excuse me he added to the others and went out into the hall with the colored man  i didnt want fo to alarm de ladies explained aleck but i wanted to tell you as soon as i could  tell me what aleck  dat i dun seen dat rascal dan baxter less dan half an hour ago was the answer     chapter xvii  a queer captain   you saw dan baxter here in pittsburg ejaculated dick  dats it  you are sure you were not mistaken aleck i thought that rascal was miles and miles away  dats jess wot i dun been thinkin too but it was dan baxter suah i knows him too well to make any mistake about his ugly face  where was he  dats de alarmin part ob it massah dick yo know yo tole me to find de houseboat  yes  well i found de boat wid dat dar capn starr on board an we made all dem rangements wot you spoke about den i started to leave de boat dar was an eleckric light on de dock an a man standing near it awatchin de houseboat i almost run into him an den i discobered it was dat goodfonuffin dan baxter  he was watching the houseboat  dats it  did he recognize you aleck  not till i spoke to him i said wot yo doin heah dan baxter when he heard dat he most jumped a foot den he mutters sumthing wot i couldnt make out an runs away  did you go after him  yes but i couldnt cotch him nohow dar was big piles ob boxes an barrels on de dock and he got away befo i know wot i was at i hunted an hunted but i couldnt git on his track  this is certainly unpleasant to say the least mused dick biting his lip if he is watching us he is doing it for no good purpose  dats de way i reasoned but i didnt want de ladies to heah mrs stanhope am a powerfully narvous woman  yes aleck you were wise in keeping them in ignorance but ill have to tell tom and sam and the other fellows and well have to keep our eyes open  is you goin to report dis to de police  i may ill think it over first now how about the houseboat has captain starr done as directed  yes sah  what kind of a man does he seem to he  all right massah dick only  only what asked the eldest rover as he saw the colored servant hesitate  well to tell de truf he seems kind of funny to me  how funny  here and aleck tapped his forehead  do you mean that he is crazy  not dat persackly massah dick but he said sum mighty funny tings when we was talkin acted like he was tinkin ob sumting else  humph well if he isnt the sort of fellow we want well have to let him go and get another captain  dick returned to the apartment he had left and told the others that aleck had made the necessary arrangements then he gave tom and sam a wink which meant a good deal soon after this the party broke up and the boys retired to the connecting rooms they had engaged for the night  so aleck saw dan baxter cried tom when told of the news that must mean the rascal is on our trail  just what i am thinking tom returned dick  we ought to have the authorities arrest him put in sam  perhaps but weve got to locate him first now that he has been discovered he will do his best to keep shady maybe he has already left the city  they talked the matter over for an hour but could reach no satisfactory conclusion  better take matters as they come said powell he wont dare to molest you openly  no but he will molest us in secret which will be worse replied sam  none of the ladies or the girls must hear of this said tom it would spoil their whole trip even if baxter didnt show himself again  i tont oben mine mouds apout noddings declared hans i vos so quiet like an ellerfaunt in a church  bright and early the boys were astir on the following morning and dick tom and sam went off to interview captain starr before breakfast they found the captain a thickset fellow with a heavy mustache and big bushy whiskers he had eyes of the dreamy sort which generally looked away when speaking to anybody  this is captain starr said dick addressing him  im your man  i am dick rover and these are my brothers tom and sam  dick put out his hand but the captain merely nodded  is everything ready for the trip captain asked tom  yes sir  you had the boat cleaned up said sam  yes sir  well look her over said dick  yes sir  they walked over the houseboat from end to end the craft was certainly a beauty and as clean as a whistle there was a living room a dining room a kitchen and eight sleeping roomsfour of the latter downstairs and four upstairs each sleeping room contained two berths there was also a bunk room below for the help and a small room for the captain in the living room was the piano and also a bookcase containing half a hundred choice novels  this is certainly great said tom  better than i thought it would be answered sam its a perfect palace  and see how the brasswork shines went on tom the captain certainly had things cleaned up  but he is a queer stick if ever there was one came from dick in a whisper i must say i dont half like him  he acts as if he was asleep was toms comment  or else as if he had something on his mind  anyway he comes highly recommended said sam  when they came out on the deck they found captain starr sitting on a bench smoking a corncob pipe  she is in fine shape and i congratulate you captain said dick pleasantly  thank you was the short answer  you will be ready to have us taken down the river as soon as we get our things on board  yes sir  confound him thought dick why doesnt he say something else he is a regular automaton  by the way captain put in tom have you noticed a stranger watching the dora the last night or two  at this question captain starr leaped to his feet allowing his corncob pipe to fall to the ground  what made you ask that question he demanded  we have an enemy named dan baxter we suspect he is following us and is spying on us  yes i have seen a young fellow around half a dozen times in fact i caught him on the houseboat once  you did cried dick what was he doing  going through the stuff in the living room  what did you do to him  i yelled at him demanding to know what he wanted as soon as he heard me he ran ashore and disappeared  did you try to find him  no because i didnt want to leave the houseboat alone  did you see him last nightwhile our colored man was here  i saw somebody but it was too dark to make out exactly who it was     chapter xviii  on board the houseboat   after questioning captain starr as closely as possible all three of the rover boys came to the conclusion that it must have been dan baxter who had visited the dora on the sly  i dont like this at all said sam he is going to make trouble for usno two ways about that  the best thing to do in my opinion is to get away without delay said tom he wont find it so easy to follow us then  im going to throw him off the scent said dick  how  by pretending to go to one place while we can really go to another  thats a scheme  a small tug had been chartered to tow the houseboat and the captain of this was ordered to be ready for moving at eleven oclock  we shall go to camdale first said dick naming a place about forty miles away  all right sirwherever you say said the tug commander  returning to the hotel the boys found the others finishing breakfast and sat down to their own they said the dora was in perfect trim and that the trip down the ohio was to begin without delay  well i am sure i am ready said nellie i am just dying to see the houseboat  aleck hurried around to buy the necessary stores which were taken to the dora in a wagon then two carriages brought down the ladies and the boys and a truck brought along the baggage  what a beautiful boat cried dora after going on board and how tidy everything is  then you are not ashamed to have her called the dora said dick well satisfied  ashamed oh dick i am delighted  this boat is a gem was songbird powells comment say folks on the ohio will take us to be millionaires  dis ship is besser dan a ferrypoat was hans comment  a ferryboat shrieked grace oh hans  i mean von of dem doubledecker ferrypoats vot runs from new york to chersey citydem kind vot has got blateglass vinders und lookingglasses der sthairs on explained the german cadet da vos peauties too  if we dont enjoy this trip it will be our fault said fred  the lines were cast off the steam tug puffed and in a moment more the houseboat had left the dock and the voyage down the ohio was begun  ill not be sorry to leave pittsburg behind said nellie there is so much smoke  well they have to have smokein such a hive of industry answered dick  by noon pittsburg and allegheny were left behind and once more the sky was clear and blue above them the sun shone brightly and there was just enough breeze to keep the air cool and delicious all sat on the forward deck under a widespread awning watching the scenery as they floated onward  after a consultation it was decided that the first stop should be made at a small village on the river called pleasant hills mrs laning had a friend there whom she had not seen for years and she said she would be pleased to make a call  all right said dick pleasant hills it is and he called to the tug captain and gave the necessary directions  that will throw dan baxter off the track a little whispered sam  aleck pop was highly pleased with the cooking arrangements there was a firstclass gasolene stove and the kitchen was fitted with all sorts of appliances for rendering cooking easy  ise gwine to do my best fo you said the colored man and dinner which was served at one oclock proved to be little short of a genuine feast with oxtail soup breast of lamb mashed potatoes green peas lettuce coffee pudding and cheese  why aleck this is a surprise said dora some day they will want you to become the chef in a big hotel and this compliment tickled the colored man greatly  tank yo miss dora he answered but i dont want to be no chef in a hotel all i wants to do is to stay wid de rober boys so long as i lib  during the afternoon the boys tried their hands at fishing and caught quite a mess by four oclock pleasant hills was reached and they tied up in a convenient spot all of the girls and mrs stanhope went ashore with mrs laning to visit the friend that had been mentioned  bring them down to the houseboat tonight if they care to come said dick  thank you dick perhaps we will answered mrs laning  let us take a swim while they are gone suggested tom that water is too inviting to resist  agreed shouted the others and ran to their rooms to get out their bathing suits soon tom was ready and leaping to the end of the houseboat took a straight dive into the river sam followed and fred came next and then dick songbird and hans came down in a bunch the water was just cold enough to be pleasant and they splashed around in great sport  this is what i call living yelled tom and diving under he caught hans by the big toe  hi hi let go mine does shrieked the german lad somedings has me py der does cotched  maybe its a shark suggested fred  a shark vos der sharks py der ohio river  tons of them came from sam look out hansy or theyll swallow you  du meine zeit gasped the german cadet vy didnt you tole me dot pefore hey i guess i dont schwim no more and he started to climb up a rope ladder leading to the deck of the houseboat  dont go hans sang out songbird they are fooling you  dere tont been no sharks in der river  no nothing but sawfish and whales  a vale dots chust so bad like a shark  no not at all a shark bites a whale simply swallows you alive put in sam with a grin  swallows me alife hey not on your life he tont returned hans and started again for the rope ladder but sam pulled him back and ducked him and was in turn ducked by fred who went under by a shove from dick and then followed a regular mixup the water flying in all directions  by golly dats great cried aleck from the deck i dun tink a lot ob eels was dancin a jig down dar  come down here aleck and get some of the black washed off shouted tom gleefully  not fo a dollah massah tomleasewise not while yo is around  what are you afraid of asked tom innocently  yo is too full ob tricks fo dis chile when i wants a baf ise gwine to take dat baf in a tub an when yo aint around answered aleck yo amohwough and then the colored man retreated in great haste for tom had sent up a shower of water all over him  here comes a big river boat cried songbird presently let us go out and catch the rollers and out they swam and waited until the swells several feet high came rolling in it was immense fun bobbing up and down like so many corks  wish the steamers would continue to come past said fred this suits me to death  here comes another pretty big boat answered tom and she is closer to shore than that other craft so well get the rollers at their best  dont get too close cried songbird i knew a fellow who did that once and got sucked under  on came the river boat and was soon opposite to where the houseboat lay she carried only a few passengers but a very large quantity of freight  here she comes cried fred now for some more fun  dont get too close repeated songbird but tom did not heed him and went within fifty feet of the steamboats side the rollers here were certainly large but all of a sudden tom appeared to lose interest in the sport  hullo tom what are you so quiet about sang out dick in alarm  perhaps he has a cramp put in sam tom are you all right he cried  yes im all right was the answer and then tom swam to his brothers with all speed the steamboat was now well on its way down the ohio  what is it asked dick feeling that something was wrong if you have had even a touch of a cramp you had better get out tom  i havent any cramp did you see them  them who  the two fellows at the stern of that boat  no what of them  one was dan baxter and the other was lew flapp     chapter xix  words and blows   baxter and flapp  the cry came from several at once and all climbed to the deck of the houseboat after tom  are you certain of this tom asked dick  yes i saw them as plain as day they were looking at the houseboat  did they see you  i think they did and if so they must have seen the rest of our crowd too  we ought to go after them came from fred the name of that steamboat was the beaver  wonder where she will make her first stop  for an answer to this question captain starr was appealed to and he said the craft would most likely stop first at a town which we will call penwick  how far is that from here asked sam  about six miles  can we get a train to that place  yes but i dont know when  a timetable was consulted and it was found that no train could be had from pleasant hills to penwick for two hours and threequarters  that is too late for us said dick if they saw tom theyll skip the moment the steamboat touches the landing  if you want to catch them why dont you follow them up in the tug suggested songbird  dots the talk came from hans i would like to see you cotch dot flapp and paxter mineselluf  ill use the tug said dick  he summoned the captain and explained the situation it was found that steam on the tug was low but captain carson said he would get ready to move down the stream with all possible speed  i would like you to stay on the houseboat said dick to songbird fred and hans i dont want to leave captain starr in charge all alone  so it was agreed and fifteen minutes later the tug was on the way after the beaver with dick tom and sam on board  can we catch the steamboat captain questioned tom anxiously  we can try was the answer if i had known you wanted to use the tug again tonight i should have kept steam up  well we didnt know  the beaver was out of sight and they did not see the steamboat again until she was turning in at the penwick dock  there she is cried sam  hurry up captain carson called out dick if you dont hurry we will lose the fellows we are after sure  i am hurrying as much as i can replied the captain  in five minutes more they gained one end of the dock and the rovers leaped ashore the beaver was at the other end discharging passengers at one gang plank and freight at another  see anything of them asked sam  yes there they are shouted tom and pointed to the street beyond the dock  i see them returned dick come on and he started for the street as swiftly as his feet could carry him  he was well in advance of sam and tom when dan baxter looking back espied him  hi flapp we must leg it cried baxter in quick alarm  eh queried lew flapp whats wrong now  they are after us  who  the three rover boys come on  the former bully of putnam hall glanced back and saw that dan baxter and he too had been a bully at the hall was right  where shall we go to he asked in sudden fright  follow me and away went dan baxter up the street with flapp at his heels dick tom and sam came after them with a number of strangers between  do you think we can catch them asked tom  weve got to catch them answered dick if you see a policeman tell him to come alongthat we are after a couple of criminals  having passed up one street for a block baxter and flapp made a turn and pursued their course down a thoroughfare running parallel to the river  here were located a number of factories and mills with several tenement houses and low groggeries between  they are after us yet panted flapp after running for several minutes say i cant keep this up much longer  come in here was dan baxters quick reply and he shot into a small lumber yard attached to a box factory it was now after six oclock and the factory had shut down for the day  once in the lumber yard they hurried around several corners and presently came to a shed used for drying lumber from this shed there was a small door leading into the factory proper  i reckon we are safe enough here said dan baxter as they halted in the shed and crouched down back of a pile of boards  yes but we cant stay here forever replied lew flapp  we can stay as long as they hang around flapp  in the meantime the rover boys reached the entrance to the yard and dick who had kept the lead called a halt  i am pretty certain they ran in here he declared  then let us root them out said tom and the quicker the better  the others were willing and they entered the small lumber yard without hesitation as there were but three wagonways each took one and all presently reached the entrance to the drying shed  see anybody questioned dick  no came from his brothers  neither did i i see there is a big brick wall around this yard if they came in here they must have gone into this shed or into the factory itself  thats it dick said tom he pushed open the door to the shed im going to investigate  so am i said both of the others  in the shed all was dark and soon sam stumbled over some blocks of wood and fell headlong  confound the darkness he muttered we ought to have brought a light  ive got one answered dick and feeling in his pocket he produced one of the newstyle electric pocket lights he pushed the button and instantly the light flashed out as from a bullseye lantern  hurrah thats a good thing cried tom by the way isnt it queer there is no watchman here  maybe the night watchman hasnt got around yet answered dick and struck the truth  they began to move around the shed much to the alarm of both dan baxter and lew flapp  i dont see any trace began dick when of a sudden the light landed fairly and squarely on baxters face then it shifted to the face of lew flapp  the old harry take you dick rover yelled baxter in a sudden rage and throwing his whole weight against the pile of boards on which the eldest rover was standing he caused it to go over hurling dick flat on his back on the floor  dick are you hurt called out tom the electric light had been broken and all was pitchdark  ii guessnot answered dick but it was a close shave  they are getting out came from sam as he heard a scuffling of feet  nothey are going into the factory shouted tom stop baxter stop flapp if you dontoh  toms cry came to a sudden end for without warning a billet of wood struck him fairly on top of the head and he went down as if shot  by this time dick was on his feet  whats up tom  iioh my head  did somebody hit you  yes  sam was running after baxter and flapp but they reached the factory first and banged the door full in the face of the youngest rover  open that door dan baxter called out sam  all right was the sudden reply and open flew the door then down on poor sams head came a heavy billet of wood and he pitched backward unconscious then the door was closed once more and locked from the inside     chapter xx  days of pleasure   sam sam speak to us  it was dick who uttered the words as he knelt beside his youngest brother and caught his hands tom was just staggering up  but sam was past speaking and made no reply  whats the matter dick asked tom  poor sam is knocked out completely i dont know but what they have killed him  oh dont say that  have you got a match ive lost that electric pocket light  yes tom struck the match and lit a bit of pine wood that was handy and found the light dick dont tell me he is dead  oh came in a deep gasp from poor sam and he gave a shiver from head to feet  he isnt dead but they must have hit him a terrible blow let us carry him out into the open air  this they did and laid the youngest rover on some boards here he presently opened his eyes and stared about him  dontdont hit me again he pleaded vacantly  they shant hit you again sam answered dick tenderly he felt of his brothers head on top was a lump from which the blood was flowing  this is the worst yet said tom what had we best do next  call a policeman if you can find any  thats rather a hard thing to do around here  however tom ran off and while he was gone dick did what little he could to make sam comfortable at last the youngest rover opened his eyes again and struggled to sit up  wherewhere are they dick  gone into the factory  oh my head  it was a wicked blow sam but keep still if your head hurts  when tom came back he was accompanied by a watchman from a neighboring yard and presently they were joined by the watchman of the box factory who had been to a corner groggery getting a drink  whats the row questioned the first watchman and when told emitted a low whistle  i think those fellows are in the factory yet continued dick  as soon as the second watchman came up both went into the box factory and were gone fully ten minutes then dick followed them since sam was rapidly recovering  cant find them said one of the watchmen but yonder window is open they must have dropped into that yard and run away  is the window generally closed  yes  then you must be right  why dont you call up the police you can do it on the telephone  have you a telephone here  of course  dick went to the telephone and told the officer in charge at the station what had occurred  ill send two men at once said the officer over the wire and in five minutes the policemen appeared  again there was a search not only of the box factory but also of the whole neighborhood but no trace of dan baxter or lew flapp could be found  having bathed their hurts both sam and tom felt better and all three of the rovers walked to the police station with the policemen and there told the full particulars of their story  you were certainly in hard luck said the police captain who happened to be in charge ill do what i can to round these rascals up but nothing came of this for both baxter and flapp left penwick that very night  when the rover boys returned to the houseboat it was long after midnight but none on board had gone to bed the stanhopes and lanings had come back bringing their friends with them and all had been surprised to find the rovers absent after remaining on the houseboat a couple of hours the friends had gone home again  something is wrong i can see it in your looks dick said dora as she came to him  sam where did you get that hurt on your head questioned grace in alarm  oh we had a little trouble but it didnt amount to much answered the youngest rover as bravely as he could  yes but your head is in a dreadful condition  and tom has a cut over the left eye burst in nellie oh you have had a fight of some kind and i know it  a fight cried mrs stanhope is it possible that you have been fighting  we had a brush with a couple of rascals in penwick said dick we tried to catch them but they got away from us that is all there is to it id rather not talk about it he went on seeing that mrs laning also wanted to ask questions  well you must really be more careful in the future said mrs stanhope i suppose they wanted to rob you  they didnt get the chance to rob us put in tom and then the rovers managed to change the subject the stanhopes and the lanings did not dream that dan baxter and lew flapp had caused the trouble perhaps in the light of later events it would have been better had they been told the truth  dick gave orders that the dora should be moved down the river early the next day and before the majority of the party were up pleasant hills was left behind  i sincerely trust we have seen the last of baxter and flapp said sam  so do i sam answered dick  id like to meet them and punch their heads good for them came from tom  after that a week slipped by with very little out of the ordinary happening day after day the houseboat moved down the river stopping at one place or another according to the desires of those on board the weather continued fine and the boys and girls enjoyed themselves immensely in a hundred different ways all had brought along bathing suits and took a dip every day they also fished and tramped through the woods at certain points along the stream one night they went ashore in a field and camped out with a big roaring fire to keep them company  this is the way it was when the cadets went into camp said dick i can tell you we had lots of sport  it must have been very nice dick answered dora sometimes i wish i was a boy and could go to putnam hall  not much id rather have you a girl declared dick and in the dark he gave her hand a tight squeeze  during those days dick noticed that captain starr acted more peculiar than ever at times he would talk pleasantly enough but generally he was so closemouthed that one could scarcely get a word out of him  i believe he is just a wee bit off in his upper story said the oldest rover but i dont imagine it is enough to count  if he had any ambition in him he wouldnt be satisfied to run a houseboat said tom its about the laziest job i know of  the monday after this talk found the dora down the ohio as far as louisville to avoid the falls in the stream the houseboat had been taken through the canal and during the middle of the afternoon was taken down the stream a distance of perhaps eighteen miles to skemportso named after samuel skem a dealer in kentucky thoroughbreds  fred garrison had a friend who came from skemport and wanted to visit him the others were willing and fred went off with tom and sam as soon as the boat was tied up when they came back late in the evening the others were told that the friend had invited all hands to visit a large stock farm in that vicinity the next afternoon to look at the horses there  that will be nice cried dora i love a good horse  two large carriages were hired for the purpose and aleck was allowed to drive one a man from the local livery stable driving the other  how soon will you be back sang out captain starr after them  cant say exactly replied dick  the distance to the stock farm was three miles but it was quickly covered and once there the rovers and their friends were made to feel perfectly at home  id like to go horseback riding on one of those horses said dora after inspecting a number of truly beautiful steeds  you shall said the owner of the stock farm and a little later dora nellie dick and tom were in the saddle and off for a gallop of several miles never once speculating on how that ride was to end     chapter xxi  the disappearance of the houseboat   never was a girl more lighthearted than was dora when in the saddle on the kentucky thoroughbred and her cousin was scarcely less elated  let us have a little race nellie cried dora it will be lots of fun  oh we dont want the horses to run away answered nellie  i dont think they will run away  the race was started and to give the girls a chance dick and tom dropped to the rear soon a turn of the road hid the two girls from view  wait a minutethere is something wrong with my saddle said tom a moment later and he came to a halt and slipped to the ground  dick would have preferred going on but did not wish to leave his brother alone so he also halted a buckle had broken and it took some time to repair the damage so tom could continue his ride  the girls have disappeared said dick on making the turn ahead in the road  they came to a spot where the road divided into three forks and halted in perplexity  well this is a nuisance declared tom after scratching his head i suppose they thought we were watching them  more than likely  which road shall we take  bless me if i know  well we cant take all three  they stared at the hoofprints in the road but there were too many of them to make anything of the marks  stumped remarked tom laconically  let us wait a while perhaps when the girls see we are not following they will turn back  all right but weve made a fine pair of escorts havent we dick  we are not responsible for that buckle breaking  thats so too  they waited for several minutes but the girls did not appear  supposing i take to one road and you to the other said dick if you see them whistle  what about the third road and tom grinned  well leave that for the present  off they set and as illluck would have it took the two roads the girls had not traveled each went fully a mile before he thought of coming back  well what luck asked dick as he rode up  nothing doing dick  ditto  then they must have taken to the third road  thats itunless they rode faster than we did  shall i try that other road  you can if you wish ill stay here if they come back we can wait for you added the oldest rover  once more tom set off but he had pushed his horse so fast before the animal was now tired and had to take his time in traveling  the third road led down to the river front and before a great while the waters edge was reached here there were numerous bushes and trees and the road turned and ran some distance along the bank  well im stumped and no mistake murmured the funloving rover i felt sure  he broke off short for a distance scream had reached his ears  was that nellies voice he asked himself and then strained his ears for two more screams had reached him nellie and dora too as sure as fate he ejaculated something has happened to them perhaps those horses are running away  he hardly knew how to turn for the trees and bushes cut off his view upon every side he galloped along the road which followed the windings of the ohio but try his best he could locate neither girls nor horses  it was maddening and the cold sweat stood out upon toms forehead something was very much wrong but what was it  nellie dora where are you he called out where are you  only the faint breeze in the trees answered him  ive got to find them he groaned ive got to that is all there is to it he repeated the words over and over again what will mrs laning and mrs stanhope say and grace  again he went on but this time slower than before looking to the right and the left and ahead not a soul was in sight the road was so cut up he could make nothing of the hoofmarks which presented themselves  this is enough to drive one insane he reasoned where in the world did they go to id give a thousand dollars to know  at last he reached a point where the road ran close to the waters edge he looked out on the river only a distant steamboat and a small sailboat were in view  wonder if they rode down to where we left the houseboat he asked himself she must be somewhere in this vicinity maybe they have only been fooling us  although tom told himself this there was no comfort in the surmise he moved on once more it was now growing dark and there were signs of a coming storm in the air  at last he reached a spot which looked somewhat familiar to him he came down to the waters edge once more  whyeri thought the houseboat was here he said half aloud this looks like the very spot  but no houseboat was there and scratching his head once more tom concluded that he had made a mistake  im upset if ever a fellow was he thought well no wonder such happenings as these are enough to upset anybody  tom knew of nothing more to do than to return to where he had left dick and this he did as quickly as the tired horse would carry him  no success eh said the oldest rover what do you make of it tom  when he had heard his brothers tale he grew unusually grave  you are sure you heard them scream he questioned anxiously  im sure of nothingnow i thought i was sure about the houseboat but i wasnt answered tom bluntly im all mixed up  ill go down there with you was the only answer dick made  it did not take long to reach the spot it was now dark and a mist was rising from the river  this is certainly the spot where we tied up declared the oldest rover why i helped to drive that stake myself  then the houseboat is gone  thats the size of it  and the girls are gone too went on tom yes but the two happenings may have no connection tom  dont be so sure of that  what do you mean  im thinking about dan baxter and lew flapp they wouldnt be above stealing the houseboat  i believe you there  and if those girls happened to go on boardlook there  tom pointed out in the darkness on the road two horses were coming toward them each wearing a ladys saddle and each riderless  there are the horses said dick but the girls you think  the girls came down here on their horses and dismounted to go on board of the houseboat  well where is the houseboat  it was a question neither of them could answer they looked out on the river but the mist hung over everything like a pall  dick i am afraid something serious has happened came from tom ominously those screams werent uttered for nothing  let us make a closer examination of the shore answered the oldest rover and they did so they found several hoofprints of horses but that was all  i cant see any signs of a struggle said tom  nor i and yet if those rascals ran off with the houseboat and with the girls on board how would they square matters with captain starr  and with captain carson the tug is gone too  yes but the tug went away when we did and wasnt to come back until tomorrow morning captain carson said he would have to coal up over to one of the coal docks  then some other tug must have towed the houseboat away  either that or they are letting the dora drift with the current  that would be rather dangerous around hereand in the mist a steamer might run the houseboat down  the brothers knew not what to do to go back to the stock farm with the news that both the girls and the houseboat were missing was extremely distasteful to them  this news will almost kill mrs stanhope said dick  well it will be just as bad for mrs laning dick  not exactlyshe has grace left while dora is mrs stanhopes only child  once again the two boys rode up and down the ohio for a distance of nearly a mile at none of the docks or farms could they catch the least sign of the houseboat  she may be miles from here by this time said dick with almost a groan there is no help for it tom weve got to go back and break the news as best we can  very well answered tom soberly every bit of fun was knocked out of him and his face was as long as if he was going to a funeral  dick felt equally bad never until that moment had he realized how dear dora stanhope was to him he would have given all he possessed to be able to go to her assistance  the mist kept growing thicker and by the time the stock farm was reached it was raining in torrents but the boys did not mind this discomfort as they rode along leading the two riderless saddle horses they had other things more weighty to think about     chapter xxii  dan baxters little game   in order to ascertain just what did become of the houseboat it will be necessary to go back to the time when the dora was tied up near the village of skemport  not far away from skemport was a resort called the stock breeders resta crossroads hotel where a great deal of both drinking and gambling was carried on  during the past year dan baxter had become passionately fond of card playing for money and he induced lew flapp to accompany him to the stock breeders rest  we can have a fine time there said baxter and as the rovers houseboat will not be far off we can keep our eyes on that crowd and watch our chance to deal them another blow  lew flapp was now reckless and ready for almost anything and he consented they hired a room at the crossroads hotel and that night both went to the smoking room to look at what was going on  a professional gambler from kentucky soon discovered them and he induced dan baxter to lay with himafter learning that lew flapp had no money to place on a game baxter and the gambler played that night and also the next morning and as a result baxter lost about every dollar he had with him  you cheated me he cried passionately when his last dollar was gone you cheated me and ill have the police arrest you  this accusation brought on a bitter quarrel and fearful that they might be killed by the gambler and his many friends who frequented the resort dan baxter and lew flapp fled for their lives they were followed by two thugs and to escape molestation took refuge in a stable on the outskirts of skemport and only a short distance from where the dora lay  how much money did you lose baxter asked flapp after they had made certain that they were safe for the time being  two hundred and sixtyfive dollarsevery dollar i had with me was the gloomy response  is it possible gasped lew flapp he wondered what they were going to do without money  what have you got left of the money i loaned you went on baxter  just two dollars and twenty cents  humph thats a long way from being a fortune grumbled the discomfited leader of the evildoers  you are right i think you were foolish to gamble  oh dont preach  im not preaching what shall we do next  i dont know if i was near some big city i might draw some money from a bank  you might go to louisville  no id be sure to have trouble if i went to that placei had trouble there before  they looked around them and were surprised to see the houseboat in plain view this interested them and they watched the dora with curiosity  if we had a houseboat we could travel in fine style was lew flapps comment  just the thing flapp cried dan baxter  perhaps but you cant buy a houseboat for two dollars and twenty cents nor charter one either  we wont buy one or charter one was dan baxters crafty answer  eh  well borrow that one shes a fairy and will just suit us flapp  i dont quite understand youre not fool enough to think the rovers will let you have their houseboat  of course not but if i take possession while they are away  how do you know they will be awayi mean all of them at one time  ill fix it so they are we must watch our chance i can send them a decoy message or something like that  youll have to be pretty shrewd to get the best of the rovers  pooh they are not so wise as you think they put on a big front but that is all there is to it went on dan baxter loftily  well go ahead i dont care what you do  youll help me wont you  certainlyif the risk isnt too great we dont want to get caught and tried for stealing  leave it all to me flapp  as we know fortune for once favored dan baxter from the stable he and flapp saw the party depart for the stock farm leaving nobody but captain starr in charge they also saw the steam tug move away to get a new supply of coal in her bunkers  everything is coming our way chuckled dan baxter with a wicked grin on his scarred face flapp the coast is almost clear  almost but not quite that captain is still on board  oh that chap is a doughhead we can easily make him do what we want  dont be too sure he might watch his chance and knock us both overboard  well i know how to fix him ill send him a message to come herethat dick rover wants him when he comes we can bind him fast with this old harness and leave him here then we will have the houseboat all to ourselves  and after that what  well drop down the river a way then we can paint a new name on the boat get a steam tug and make off for the mississippiand the rovers and their friends can go to grass  this programme looked inviting to flapp and when dan baxter wrote a note to the captain of the dora he volunteered to deliver it he found captain starr on the front deck of the houseboat smoking his corncob as usual  the captain had one of his peculiar moods on him and it took a minute or two for flapp to make him understand about the note but he fell into the trap with ease and readily consented to follow the young rascal to the stable  as he entered the open doorway dan baxter came at him from behind hitting him in the head with a stout stick the captain went down half stunned  seesee here he gasped whawhat does this  shut up cried baxter we wont hurt you if youll keep still but if you dont  ii havent hurt anybody sir  all right old man keep still  but ii dont understand  you will later on  dan baxter had the straps of the old harness ready and with them he fastened captain starrs hands behind him and also tied his ankles together then he backed the commander of the houseboat to a post and secured him hands and feet  now then dont you make any noise until tomorrow morning was dan baxters warning if you do youll get into trouble if you keep quiet well come back in the morning release you and give you a hundred dollars  give me a hundred dollars questioned the captain simply  that is what i said  then i had better keep quiet but the houseboat  the houseboat will be left just where it is  oh all right sir and the captain breathed a sigh of relief that he was just a little simpleminded was beyond question  leaving the captain a prisoner dan baxter and lew flapp made their way with caution toward the houseboat as they had surmised the dora was now totally deserted they leaped on the deck and entered the sumptuous living room  this is fine murmured lew flapp they must be living like nabobs on this craft  youre right a piano and a guitar too baxter passed into the dining room real silver on the table flapp weve struck luck  sure  that silver is worth just so much moneywhen we need the funds  would you sell it  why not didnt i tell you the rovers robbed my father of a mine this isnt a fleabite to what theyve got that belongs to us from the dining room the young rascals passed to the staterooms  trunks full of stuff observed flapp we shant fall short of clothing  i hope there is money in some of them answered dan baxter  hadnt we better be putting off asked flapp nervously some of them may be coming back you know  yes let us put off at once this mist that is coming up will help us to get away  leaving the stateroom they were in they went out on deck and began to untie the houseboat while they were doing so they heard the sounds of two horses approaching  somebody is coming said flapp and an instant later dora and nellie came into view nellie had her skirt badly torn and it was her intention if she could locate the houseboat to don a new skirt before she returned to where tom and dick had left them on the highway  its a pity you fell and tore the skirt dora was saying but i suppose you can be thankful that you did not hurt yourself  that is true but the boys will think i cant ride andoh  nellie came to a sudden stop and pointed to the houseboat  dan baxter burst from doras lips oh how did that fellow get here  dora stanhope muttered baxter and then he and lew flapp ran towards the girls     chapter xxiii  a run in the dark   both girls were thoroughly alarmed by the unexpected appearance of dan baxter and his companion and brought their horses to a standstill  how do you do miss stanhope said baxter with a grin  what are you doing here demanded dora icily  oh nothing much  do you know that that is the rovers houseboat  is it said baxter in pretended surprise  yes  no i didnt know it baxter turned to nellie how are you miss laning i suppose you are surprised to meet me out here  i am was nellies short answer both girls wished themselves somewhere else  my friend and i were walking down the river when we heard a man on that houseboat calling for help went on dan baxter glibly we went on board and found the captain had fallen down and hurt himself very much do you know anything about him  why yes said dora quickly it must be captain starr she added to nellie  hes in a bad way if you know him you had better look after him continued dan baxter  i will and dora leaped to the ground followed by nellie both ran towards the houseboat but at the gang plank they paused  ii think ill go back and get dick rover said dora she did not like the look in dan baxters eyes  yes and tom put in nellie  you shant go back roared dan baxter go on and help the poor captain  his manner was so rude that nellie gave a short sharp screamone which reached toms ears as already recorded  dontdont go on board just yet dora she whispered  you shall go on board went on dan baxter make her go flapp ill attend to this one and he caught hold of doras arm  at this both girls screamedanother signal of distress which reached toms ears but did no good  i dont see the reason began lew flapp  just do as i say flapp we can make money out of this answered dan baxter  he caught dora around the waist and lifted her into the air she struggled bravely but could do nothing and in a moment more he had her on the houseboat lew flapp followed with nellie who pulled his hair and scratched his face unavailingly  wherewhere you going to put em queried flapp  in here answered dan baxter leading the way to one of the stateroomsthat usually occupied by mrs stanhope and dora now you stay in there and keep quiet or it will be the worse for you baxter went on to the girls  as nellie was pushed into the stateroom she fainted and pitched headlong on the floor thoroughly alarmed dora raised her cousin in her arms at the same time baxter shut the door and locked it from the outside  now dont make a bit of noise or youll be sorry for it he fairly hissed and his manner was so hateful that dora was thoroughly cowed  whats the next move asked flapp when he and baxter were on the outside deck he was too weakminded to take a stand and placed himself entirely under the guidance of his companion  get the houseboat away from the shore and be quick about it was the reply somebody else may be on the way here  the order to push off was obeyed and soon the dora caught by the strong current of the river was moving down the ohio and away from the vicinity of skemport the mist was now so thick that in a few minutes the shore line was lost entirely to view  i must say i dont like this drifting in the dark said flapp what if we run into something  weve got to take some risk ill light the lanterns as soon as we get a little further away you stand by with that long polein case the houseboat drifts in toward shore again  the dora had been provided with several long patent sweeps and for a while both of the young rascals used these in an endeavor to get the houseboat out into the middle of the river in the distance they saw the lights of a steamboat and this was all they had to guide them  if we strike good and hard well go to the bottom said lew flapp  flapp you are as nervous as a cat  isnt it true  i dont think so most of these boats are built in compartments if one compartment is smashed the others will keep her afloat  oh i see and after that lew flapp felt somewhat relieved  when the houseboat was well away from skemport dan baxter walked to the door of the stateroom in which dora and nellie had been confined  hullo in there he called out  what do you want asked dora timidly  how is that other girl all right  yeyes came from nellie but oh mr baxter what does this mean  dont grow alarmed im not going to hurt you in the least  yes butbutwe dont want to go with you  im sorry but i cant help that if we let you go ashore youll tell the rovers that we took the houseboat  and is that why you took us along questioned dora  certainly  how far are you going to take us  that depends upon circumstances i dont know yet where or when we will be able to make a landing  it is horrid of you to treat us so  sorry you dont like it but it cant be helped answered dan baxter coolly he paused a moment say if i unlock that door and let you out will you promise to behave yourselves  what do you mean by that questioned dora  i mean will you promise not to scream for help or not to attack myself or lew flapp  i shant promise anything said nellie promptly  i dont think ill promise anything either joined in her cousin  humph you had better its rather stuffy in that little stateroom  we can stand it answered both  all right suit yourselves but when you want to come out let me know  with these words dan baxter walked away leaving the girls once more to themselves both sat down on the edge of a berth and nellie placed her head upon doras shoulder  oh dora what will become of us  im sure i dont know nellie  they may take us away down the rivermiles and miles away  i know that we must watch our chances and see if we cannot escape  do you think the rover boys are following the houseboat  let us hope so  thoroughly miserable the cousins became silent they felt the houseboat moving swiftly along with the current but could see nothing on account of the mist and the darkness soon they heard the rain coming down  it is going to be an awful night said dora i dont see how anybody could follow this houseboat in such a storm  both girls felt like crying but did their best to hold back the tears each was tired out by the doings of the day gone by but neither thought of going to sleep  the lanterns had been lit and both baxter and flapp stationed themselves at the front of the houseboat in an endeavor to pierce the mist occasionally they made out some distant light but could not tell where it belonged  we ought to be getting to somewhere pretty soon remarked lew flapp after a couple of hours had passed dont you think we had better turn her in toward shore  not yet flapp we ought to place as much distance as possible between the boat and skemport remember those rovers will be after us hotfooted when once they learn the truth of the situation  do you know anything about the river around here  a little but not much do you know anything  noi never cared for geography answered flapp its getting as black as pitch and the rainhullo theres another light  flapp pointed to the kentucky side of the river through the mist appeared a dim light followed by another  wonder if that is the shore or a boat mused baxter  better yell and see  boat ahoy  no answer came back and for the moment the lights appeared to fade from sight  must have been on shore and we are passing them baxter  more than likely and yetthere they are again  dan baxter was right the lights had reappeared and now they seemed to approach the houseboat with alarming rapidity  theyll run into us if they are not careful said flapp in fresh alarm boat ahoy he screamed keep off  keep off keep off there put in dan baxter  if those in the other craft heard they paid no attention the light came closer and closer and of a sudden a fairsized gasolene launch came into view she was headed directly for the dora and a moment later hit the houseboat a telling blow in the side causing her to careen several feet     chapter xxiv  the horse thieves   for the moment it looked as if the houseboat might be sent to the bottom of the ohio river and from the stateroom in which the two girls were confined came a loud cry of fright dan baxter and lew flapp were also scared and rushed toward the gasolene launch not knowing what to do  keep off  dont sink us  loud cries also came from the launch and those on the deck of the dora could see several men wearing raincoats moving about the bow of the launch was badly splintered but otherwise the craft remained undamaged  what do you mean by running into us in this fashion cried baxter seeing that the dora was in no danger of going down  running into you came in a rough voice from the launch you ran into us  not much we didnt  what boat is that came in another voice from the launch  a private houseboat what craft is that  none of your business  thank you baxter put on a bold front im going to report you for running into us just the same  not much you wont came from the launch there were a few hurried words spoken in a whisper and then a boathook was thrown on the dora and a man leaped aboard and tied fast  who is in command here he demanded confronting baxter and flapp  i am answered baxter  is she your houseboat  yes  where are you bound  down to the mississippi but what is that to you  how many of you on board of this craft went on the man ignoring altogether the last question  that is my business  well and im going to make it mine cried the man and pulled out a revolver answer up kid it will be best for you  he was a burly kentuckian all of six feet tall and with a bushy black beard and a breath which smelt strongly of whiskey  dontdont shoot us cried lew flapp in terror dont shoot  i wontif youll treat me properlike answered the kentuckian how many on board  fourtwo young ladies and ourselves answered dan baxter he was doing some rapid thinking say perhaps we can strike up a bargain with you he went on  a bargain what kind of a bargain and the kentuckian eyed him narrowly  we are looking for somebody to tow this houseboat down the river  at this the kentuckian gave a loud and brutal laugh  thanks but i aint in that ere business  all right then get aboard of your own boat and we will go on continued baxter  whats doing up there pick called another man from the launch remember we havent got all night to waste here  that other boat is coming cried a third man boys we are trapped as sure as guns  not much we aint said the kentuckian who had boarded the houseboat sculley  what next pick  youve got a new job this chap here wants somebody to tow him down the river  well  you start to do the towing and be quick about it hamp get on board at once remember sculley you aint seen or heard of us understand  all right pick  the gasolene launch came close once more and the fellow called hamp leaped on board he carried a rifle and was evidently a desperate character  see here i dont understand your game began baxter  didnt you say you wanted somebody to tow you down the river asked the fellow addressed as pick  i did but  well capn sculley of the firefly has taken the job hell take you wherever you please and at your own price you cant ask for more than that can you  no but  i havent got time to talk kidwith that other launch coming after us i dont know who you are and i reckon you dont know me and my bosom pard here but let me tell you one thing it wont be healthy for you to tell anybody that me and my pard are on board here understand  you are hiding away from somebody asked baxter quickly  i reckon thats the plain united states of it if you say a word it will go mighty hard with you and the kentuckian tapped his revolver  you can trust us replied baxter promptly tell me what you want done and ill agree to do it  you will the kentuckian eyed him more closely than ever say you cant play any game on meim too old for it  i shant play any game on you just say what you want done and ill help you all i canproviding that launch takes us down the river as quick as it can  ha maybe you want to get away too eh  i want to get down the river yes perhaps ill tell you moreafter i am certain i can trust you added baxter significantly  good enough ill go you if that other launch comes up tell em anything but that you have strangers on board or that you have seen us  i will  if you play us foul  i shant play you foul so dont worry  by this time the second launch was coming up through the mist and the two men from kentucky retired to the cabin of the houseboat in the meantime the first launch had tied fast to the dora and was beginning to tow the houseboat down the stream  boat ahoy there was the call  ahoy answered the man on the first launch  got any passengers on board  no  whats your tow  a houseboat  who is on board  i dont know exactly what do you want to know for  we are looking for a couple of horse thieves who ran away from kepples about two hours ago  i havent seen anything of any horse thieves  the second launch now came up to the houseboat as may be surmised dan baxter and lew flapp had listened to the talk with keen interest  those chaps are horse thieves muttered flapp  yesbut dont open your mouth flapp answered the leader of the evildoers  houseboat ahoy was the call  hullo the launch answered baxter  seen anything of any strangers within the past two hours  strangers repeated baxter yes i did  where  about a mile back two men in a small sailboat beating up the river  how were they dressed  in raincoats one was a tall fellow with a heavy beard  thats our game curly was the exclamation on the second launch about a mile up the river you say  about thator maybe a mile and a half replied dan baxter  thank you well get after them now and in a moment more the second launch sheered off and started up the ohio through the mist and rain  as soon as it was out of sight the men in the cabin of the dora came out again  that was well done kid cried he called pick and it was well you did it that way if you had said we were aboard you might have got a dose of lead in your head  i always keep my word replied baxter  youre a game young rooster and i reckon i cant call you kid no more whats your handle  whats yours  pick loring  youre a horse thief it seems  i dont deny it  my name is dan baxter and this is my friend lew flapp  glad to know you this is my pard in business hamp gouch we had to quit in a hurry but i reckon we fell in the right hands and pick loring closed one eye suggestively and questioningly  youre safe with us loringif youll give us a lift  i always stick to them as sticks to me  if you want to stay on this houseboat for a while you can do it  well have to stay on this craft its about the only place well be safefor a day or two at least  you can stay a couple of weeks if you want toall providing youll lend us your assistance  its a go now whats your game you must have one or you wouldnt act in this style said pick loring     chapter xxv  plotting against dora and nellie   in the first place said dan baxter perhaps we had better give some directions to that man on the launch  what kind of directions  we want to go straight down the river for the present  hell take you down i told him not to go near either shore  is he to be trusted  sure hell do anything i tell him to  very well then that is settled in the second place tell me if i am right you are both wanted for stealing sixteen horses over at a place called kepples  who told you we took sixteen horses  i read about it in the papers a couple of days ago  well the report is true i dont deny it  you were fleeing from the officers of the law  thats as straight as shooting came from hamp gouch  if we help you to escape will you stick by us in a little game we are trying to put through  i will answered pick loring promptly  so will i added hamp gouch no game too daring for me either  well its this way continued dan baxter supposing i told you i had a game on that beats horse stealing all to bits would you go in for half of what was in it  sure  trust me added gouch say he went on got any liquor aboard this rain is beastly  i guess there is some liquor well hunt around and see  ha exclaimed pick loring say perhaps you dont know much more about this houseboat than we did about them horses we took  as you just said i dont deny it  you and your pard are running off with the boat queried hamp gouch  yes  good enough we claim a halfinterest in the boat dont that go  thats pretty cheeky returned lew flapp  let it go at that flapp came from baxter yes you can have a halfinterest but that isnt our game  what is the game  on board of this houseboat are two girls who are mighty anxious to get back to their families and friends  run off with em did you cried pick loring and now it must be confessed that he was really astonished  we carried them off yes and we dont expect to let them get back home unless we can make considerable money out of it continued dan baxter  are they rich  they are fairly welltodo and they have close personal friends who i feel sure would pay a good price to see the girls get home again unharmed  youre putty young to be runnin a game like this came from hamp gouch  maybe but i know just what i am doing  they walked into the living room and lew flapp made an inspection of the pantry and then of captain starrs private apartment as it happened the captain used liquor and several bottles were brought out much to the satisfaction of the horse thieves  this makes me feel more like talking said hamp gouch after swallowing a goodly portion of the stuff  perhaps you had better give us the whole game straight from start to now said pick loring then we can make up our minds just what we can do  sitting down dan baxter told as much of himself and lew flapp as he deemed necessary and told about the trip on the houseboat which the rovers stanhopes and the lanings had been taking then he told how dora and nellie had been abducted and how the voyage down the ohio had been started in the mist and the darkness  youre a putty bold pair for your years said pick loring hang me if i dont admire you and he smiled in his coarse way  of course you can see the possibilities in this went on dan baxter supposing we can make the stanhopes and lanings and rovers pay over fifty or sixty thousand dollars for the return of the girls that means a nice sum for each of us  right you are came from hamp gouch as you say it beats horse stealing  have they got the money asked the other kentuckian  they have a good deal more than that between them the rovers are very rich  but they are only friends  more than that dick rover is very sweet on dora stanhope and tom rover thinks the world of nellie laning  then of course theyll help pay upespecially if they hear the girls are likely to suffer we can write to em and say well starve the girls to death if the money dont come our way  exactly but weve got to find some place to hide first we cant stay on the river any great length of time theyll send word about the houseboat from one town to another and the authorities will be on the lookout for us  i know where you can take this houseboat put in hamp gouch up shaggam creek there is a dandy hiding place there and nobody around but old jake shaggam and we can easily buy him off so as he wont open his mouth  how far is that creek from here  about thirtyfive miles  the matter was talked over for fully an hour and it was at last decided that the houseboat should go up shaggam creek at least for the time being if that place got too hot to hold them they could move further down the river during the nights to follow  the man on the launch was called up and matters were explained to him by pick loring  sculley is a good fellow said loring to baxter he will do whatever i say and take whatever i give himand keep his mouth shut  thats the kind of a follower to have was baxters answer  the horse thieves were hungry and a fire was started in the galley of the houseboat the men cooked themselves something to eat and baxter and flapp did the same it must be confessed that flapp did not like the newcomers and hated to have anything to do with them but he was too much of a coward to speak up and so did as baxter dictated thus is one rascal held under the thumb of another it was only when lew flapp was among those who were smaller and weaker than himself that he dared to play the part of the bully  dora and nellie heard the loud talking after the crashing of the launch into the houseboat and also heard part of what followed both wanted to cry out for assistance but did not dare fearing that something still worse might happen to them  they might bind and gag us said nellie that dan baxter is bad enough to do almost anything  yes and from the way lew flapp treated dick i should think he was almost as wicked as baxter answered her cousin  the girls wondered who the newcomers on board could be but had no means of finding out nobody came near them and at last tired nature asserted itself and both dropped into a troublous doze  when they awoke it was still dark a steam whistle had aroused them they looked out of the stateroom window it had stopped raining but the mist was just as thick as ever  oh if only it would clear up sighed dora nobody will be able to follow the houseboat in such a mist as this  where do you think they will take us dora questioned nellie  goodness only knows perhaps down the mississippi or maybe to the gulf of mexico  oh dora would they dare to do that and nellies face grew pale  dora shrugged her shoulders by way of reply and for the time being the cousins relapsed into silence both were thinking of their mothers and of the rovers what had the others said to their strange disappearance  it is perfectly dreadful cried nellie at last and burst into tears and dora followed the crying appeared to do them some good and after half an hour they became more at ease  we must escape if we possibly can nellie said dora we cannot afford to remain a moment longer on this houseboat than is necessary  but how are we going to escape it looks to me as if we were out in the middle of the river  that is true but both of us can row and there is a small rowboat on board if we could launch that and get away we might escape  well i am willing to try it if you think it can be done but we must get out of this stateroom first  the two girls listened but nobody appeared to be anywhere near them  i can hear them talking in the kitchen said nellie more than likely they are getting something to eat  i could eat something myself  so could i but id rather get away  both looked for some means of getting out of the stateroom and suddenly dora uttered a cry of delight  oh why didnt i think of it before  think of what  that key on the hook over there it fits the door  then we can get out  if that other key isnt on the outside  dora got down and looked through the keyhole it was clear and she quickly inserted the key taken from the hook it fitted perfectly and in a second more the door was unlocked  waituntil i make sure that nobody is around whispered dora she was so agitated she could scarcely speak  she opened the door cautiously and looked out not a soul was in sight from the galley came a steady hum of voices and a rattle of pots and dishes  they are too busy to watch us just nowthe way is clear she whispered come on  let us lock the door behind us and stuff the keyhole answered nellie then they will think we are inside and wont answer  this was done and with their hearts beating wildly the two girls stole to the end of the houseboat where lay the small rowboat dora had mentioned     chapter xxvi  the search on the river   as may be surmised the news which dick and tom had to tell to the others at the stock farm produced great excitement  dora and nellie gone gasped mrs stanhope oh dick what has become of them  they must have gotten into some trouble cried mrs laning you found no trace of them  we did not said tom but we tried hard enough i can assure you  oh what shall we do wailed mrs stanhope and then she fainted away and it was a good quarter of an hour before she could be restored  all the boys were highly excited and sam was for making a search for the missing houseboat without delay  they may have gone on board and captain starr may have sailed off with them said the youngest rover remember he is a queer stick to say the least  that doesnt explain the screams i heard said tom  i dink me dot paxter got somedings to do mit dis said hans he vos a rascals from his hair to his doenails alretty  the only thing to do is to make a search came from songbird powell im ready to go out rain or no rain  they were all ready and in the end it was decided that all of the boys should prosecute the hunt leaving mrs stanhope mrs laning and grace with the wife of the proprietor of the stock farm the proprietor himself a kentuckian named paul livingstone said he would go with them  if there has been foul play of any sort i will aid you to have justice done said paul livingstone to me this whole thing looks mightily crooked  one thing is certainif the houseboat was stolen the mist and rain will aid the thieves to get away with her said dick  it was a rather silent crowd that rode into skemport an hour and a half later here a doctor was roused up and sent to the stock farm to see if mrs stanhope needed him for she was weak and might collapse completely when least expected  once at the spot where the dora had been tied up another search was begun for the girls and the houseboat some went up the shore and others down each with a lantern which had been provided to dispel the gloom     oh where oh where    in dire despair      we search the shore in vain  came lowly from songbird but then he felt too heavyhearted to finish the verse and heaved a sigh instead this is simply heartrending he said  thats what it is answered dick  hans was not far off shambling along in his own peculiar fashion he held up his lantern and by the dim rays made out a building some distance away  i yonder vot is in dare he said to himself maype i go und look hey it tont cost me noddings  through the mist and rain he approached the building and walked around to the door which was closed he flung it open and held up his lantern to see inside  du meine zeit vot is dis he gasped cabtain starr or i vos treaming hi cabtain vot you vos doing here alretty he called out  is thatthat you mueller asked the captain in a trembling voice  sure it vos me vot you did here tole me dot  ithe rascals tied me fast they said theyd come and give me a hundred dollars in the morning but i dont think theyll do it  py chimanatics vait a minute hans ran outside and waved his lantern come here he bawled come here kvick eferybody  his cry summoned the others and they quickly gathered at the stable and released the captain while they were doing this they made the simpleminded fellow tell his story  describe those two fellows said dick and captain starr did so the description was perfect  dan baxter and lew flapp cried tom  of course you didnt send that message asked the captain of dick  i did not captain it was a trick to get you away from the dora and steal the houseboat  is the craft stolen  yes  oh dear captain starr wrung his hands please dont blame me  i dont know as i can blame you exactly but you want to have your wits about you after this  when captain starr heard about the disappearance of the two girls he was more interested than ever  i heard them scream he said  where was that  i think they must have been right in front of where the dora was tied up  when was this asked sam  not very long after the villains made me their prisoner  its as clear as day cried fred garrison baxter and flapp first stole the houseboat and then they abducted dora and nellie  its a wretched piece of business came from dick oh if i can only lay my hands on them they shall suffer for it  we must chase the houseboat thats all i know to do put in tom and the quicker we begin the better  thats easily said tom how are we going to locate the craft in this mist she may have gone up the stream and she may have gone down  more than likely she went down with the current they hadnt any steam tug handy to pull her  paul livingstone was appealed to and told them where they could find the coal docks at which their own tug was lying all hurried to the place and called up captain carson  ill get up steam just as soon as i can said the tug captain and hustled out his engineer and fireman soon the black smoke was pouring from the tugs stack and in less than half an hour they were ready to move  this seems like a wildgoose chase remarked sam but it is better than standing around with ones hands in his pockets  i wish i had dat dan baxter heah said aleck pop id duck him in the ribber an hold him undah bout ten minutes  all were soon on the steam tug which was crowded by the party the lanterns were lit and they moved down the ohio slowly and cautiously  we had better move from side to side of the river suggested dick then we wont be so liable to pass the houseboat without seeing her  as all of the party were wet they took turns in drying and warming themselves in the engineroom of the tug those on the lookout did what they could to pierce the gloom but with small satisfaction  half an hour later they passed a small river steamer and hailed the craft  whats wanted shouted somebody through a megaphone  seen anything of a houseboat around here  no was the prompt answer  all right thanks and then they allowed the river steamer to pass them  dis night vos so vet like neffer vos remarked hans  well we have got to make the best of it answered dick i dont care how wet i get if only we are successful in our chase  i am mit you on dot returned the german cadet quickly  two hours passed and they saw no other craft they had passed several settlements of more or less importance but not a sign of the missing houseboat appeared  here comes something cried tom presently as they heard a distant puffpuff  steer in the direction of that sound said dick to captain carson and this was done  out of the mist appeared the light of a long launch having on board several officers of the law  steam tug ahoy was the cry  ahoy shouted back captain carson  seen anything of another launch around here  no  see anything of a small sailboat  no  confound the luck came in another voice from the launch  whats the matter asked paul livingstone  hullo mr livingstone is that you called out one of the officers of the law on the launch  it is captain dixon whats the trouble  we are looking for those two horse thieves pick loring and hamp gouch i suppose you know they escaped  so i heard well i hope you get them answered the owner of the stock farm they took four of my horses once  so i understand what are you doing out here this time of night  we are looking for a houseboat that was stolen seen anything of such a craft  certainly we did  you did burst from dick and several of the others where  down the river four or five miles the fellows on board told us that they had seen a sailboat with two men in it beating up the river and from the description we took the men to be loring and gouch  how did the houseboat look asked tom  one of the officers of the law gave a brief description of the dora and told what he could of baxter and flapp  its our houseboat beyond a doubt said sam and those two fellows were flapp and baxter  did you see anybody else on the houseboat questioned dick  not a soul so the houseboat was stolen went on the police officer curiously  yes and worse than that two girls have been abducted  creation thats serious  it will be serious for those rascals if we catch them muttered tom where did the houseboat go to  it was heading straight down the river when we saw it last  then come cried dick let us go after the craft and lose no time  a moment later the steam tug parted company with the launch and the chase after the dora was resumed     chapter xxvii  caught once more   the two girls hardly dared to breathe as they stood at the rear of the houseboat trying to untie the small rowboat which lay on the deck  oh dora supposing they find us out gasped nellie  i dont think well be any worse off than we were answered her cousin  do you think we can launch the rowboat and get into it without upsetting  we can try  the small craft was soon unfastened and they dragged it to the edge of the houseboat there was a small slide on hinges and they had seen the boys use this more than once and knew how it worked down went the rowboat with a slight splash and they hauled the craft up close by aid of the rope attached to the bow  now the oars whispered dora  they were at hand in a rack at the back of the dining room and soon she had secured two pairs  you drop in first nellie went on dora be quick but dont fall overboard  nellie obeyed trembling in every limb she landed safely and in a few seconds dora followed just as this was done a man appeared on the deck of the houseboat followed by another  oh dora began nellie when her cousin silenced her then the rope was untied and the rowboat was allowed to drift astern of the larger craft  hullo there came suddenly out of the darkness whats up back there  who are you calling to hamp came from the galley  something doing back here answered hamp gouch somebody just cut loose from our stern  whats that burst out dan baxter and tumbled out on deck followed by the others  i said somebody just cut loose from this houseboat there they go and the horse thief pointed with his hand  it cant be the girls cried flapp  run to the stateroom and see answered baxter ill get the big lantern  lew flapp hurried to the door of the stateroom taking with him the key baxter handed over  hullo in there he shouted are you awake  receiving no answer he knocked loudly on the door  i say why dont you answer he went on im coming in  still receiving no reply he started to put the key in the lock and found that he could not do so  it wont do any good to block the lock he called out answer me or ill break down the door  still nothing but silence and in perplexity he ran back to baxter  i cant get a sound out of them and the keyhole is stuffed he said  well break in the door said the leader of the evildoers  it took but a minute to execute this threat for the door was thin and frail both gave a hasty look around  gone  they must have taken the rowboat and rowed away said lew flapp  both went back to where they had left pick loring and hamp gouch  the girls are gone said baxter they must have skipped in that rowboat  we can soon fix em muttered loring well get sculley to go after them  the launch ahead was signaled and soon came up alongside  whats wanted now  take me aboard and ill tell you answered baxter and he and pick loring boarded the launch  in the meantime the two girls had placed the oars into the rowlocks and were rowing off as fast as their strength would permit  oh dora do you think we can get away gasped nellie  we must do your best and keep time with me  but which way are we going  i dont know yet the best we can do is to keep away from the lights of the houseboat  stroke after stroke was taken in dire desperation and after a while they had the satisfaction of seeing the lights of the houseboat fading away in the distance  all was gloom and mist around them and they stopped rowing not knowing in which direction to turn next  we are lost on the river said nellie  yes but that is better than being in the hands of our enemies was doras answer  yes dora ten times over but what shall we do next  let us try to row crosswise with the current that is sure to bring us to shore sooner or later  this they set out to do and after a while felt certain that they were drawing close to the river bank on the north  we are getting there cried nellie oh dora arent you glad  scarcely had she spoken when they saw a light behind them and a long launch came unexpectedly into view in the bow stood dan baxter with a lantern  i thought i heard their oars cried that rascal here they are  pull pull nellie cried dora pull or we shall be captured  both of the girls rowed with all their strength but before they could gain the shore which was now less than two rods away the launch came up and made fast to the rowboat  might as well give it up said dan baxter sarcastically its no use as you can see  oh mr baxter do let us go pleaded nellie more terrorized than ever before  not much you have got to go back to the houseboat  at this nellie gave a loud scream and dora immediately followed with a prolonged call for help  shut them up came from pick loring there are a whole lot of people living around here  without answering dan baxter leaped into the rowboat and took dora by the arm roughly  if you dont shut up ill gag you he cried  let me go she said and struck at him feebly while this was going on pick loring came over and took hold of nellie  tow us along sculley called the horse thief get back to the houseboat as soon as you can  whats the matter out there came in an unexpected call from the shore the speaker could not be seen  help us shrieked dora we are two girls and some men are carrying us off  you dont say so ejaculated the speaker on shore  tell the rover boys called out nellie dan baxter is taking us down the river on the houseboat  save us and we will pay you well added dora and then baxters not over cleanly hand was clapped over her mouth and she could say no more lorings hand was likewise placed over nellies mouth and then the launch began to tow the rowboat back into midstream once more  the poor girls were utterly disheartened and dropped back on the seats in something close to a faint  this is a mess growled dan baxter have you any idea who that was that called from the shore  some kind of a watchman answered loring we have got to get out of this neighborhood in railroad time or the jigs up he added  well im willing  it did not take long to catch up to the houseboat which was drifting down the river in the fashion it had pursued before being towed by the lunch flapp and hamp gouch were waiting impatiently on the deck  got em asked lew flapp  yes but we had no time to spare returned dan baxter two minutes more and they would have been ashore  after this maybe we had better stand guard over them baxter  just what i have been thinking  once alongside of the houseboat the two girls were forced on board once more and taken to the stateroom next to that which they had before occupied  the window was locked up and nailed and after the girls were inside dan baxter placed a strong bolt outside  now if you try to escape again you may get hurt he called out after the job was done  mr baxter you shall suffer for this answered dora as spiritedly as she could  oh dont think you can scare me  the rovers will get on your track soon  i am not afraid of them  you said that before but youve always been glad enough to hide from them  its false cried baxter in a passion i never hid from them  you are hiding now you dare not face them openly  oh give us a rest i am doing this for the money that is in it  money  yes money  i do not understand you  well youll understand tomorrow or the day after  we havent any money to give you put in nellie  no but maybe your folks have  are you going to make them pay you for releasing us  thats it  perhaps they wont pay said dora  if they dont so much the worse for you but i know theyll payand so will the rovers pay chuckled baxter  what have the rovers to do with it or perhaps you want them to pay you for giving back the houseboat  theyll pay for bothfor the houseboat and for releasing you i know dick and tom rover wont want to see you remain in the power of me and flapp and our friends  dan baxter you are a villain burst out both girls  thank you for the compliment returned the rascal coolly i hope youll enjoy your stay in that stateroom  you ought to be in prison went on dora  if you talk that way youll get no breakfast in the morning  i dont want any of your breakfast and dora stamped her foot to show she meant it  oh youll sing a different tune when you get good and hungry growled dan baxter and he walked away leaving the girls once more to themselves     chapter xxviii  a messsage for the rovers   morning found the rovers and their friends still on the steam launch looking in all directions for the houseboat  the rain had ceased and there was every indication that the mist would blow away by noon but at present it was hard to see a hundred feet in any direction  nature has assisted them to escape said dick bitterly  oh well find them sooner or later answered sam  perhaps sam but think of how the girls may be suffering in the meantime  i know and mrs stanhope and mrs laning are suffering too  the steam tug carried only a small stock of provisions and it was decided to go ashore at a small place called gridleys for breakfast here there was a country hotel at which they obtained a breakfast which put all in a slightly better physical condition  the proprietor of the hotel was a bit curious to learn the cause of their unexpected appearance and became interested when dick told him about the missing houseboat  wonder if that had anything to do with a story bill daws told me an hour ago said he bill works at the mill clown by the river last night in the dark and mist he heard somebody in a rowboat and a launch having a row two gals screamed for help and somebody said something about a houseboat and tell somebody somethinghe couldnt tell exactly what i thought bill had em on but maybe he didnt  where is this bill daws now asked dick  gone home he works nights and sleeps in the daytime  where does he live  just up that street over yonderin the square stone house with the red barn back of it  waiting to hear no more dick set off for the house mentioned taking tom with him they rapped loudly on the door and an elderly woman answered their summons  is mr bill daws in asked dick  yes sir but he has gone to bed  i must speak to him a minute tell him its about the talking he heard on the river in the dark  oh is that so he told me something about it answered the woman  she went off and coming back invited them into the house soon bill daws appeared having slipped on part of his clothing  i cant tell ye a great deal said the watchman i heard two gals cry out and some men was trying to shet em up one gal said something about a houseboat and about telling somebody about it  did she say to tell the rovers  thets it thets it i couldnt think o thet name nohow but now you hev struck it fust clip  the girls were trying to escape in the rowboat  i reckon so and the men in the launch were after em  where did they go  out into the river and thets the last i see or heard o em  thank you answered dick and seeing that bill daws was poor he gave the fellow two dollars for which the watchman was profoundly grateful  it proves one thing said tom when the brothers were coming away we are on the right track  right you are tom i hope we stay on the trail until we run down our quarry  not long after this the entire party was on the steam launch once more they took with them provisions enough to last a couple of days and also an extra cask of drinking water  by one oclock in the afternoon the sun burst through the mist and an hour later the entire river was clear so that they could see steamboats and sailboats a long distance off the captain of the tug brought forth his spyglass and they took turns in looking through the instrument  nothing like a houseboat in sight said sam disconsolately it beats the nation where they have gone to  they may be hiding around some point or in some cove suggested fred they must know that we will follow them  i think you ought to telegraph up and down the river put in songbird  dots der dalk came from hans let eferypody know vot rascals da vos alretty  in the middle of the afternoon they made a stop at a town called smuggs landing and from this point dick sent messages in various directions one message was sent to a city ten miles further down the river and an answer came back in half an hour stating that so far as the authorities could find out nothing had been seen of the dora  now the question is has she gone past that town or is she between there and this point said dick  persackly came from aleck an i dun gib two dollahs to know de answer to dat cojumdrum  all we can do is to continue the search said tom but i must say it is getting a good deal like looking for a needle in a haystack  vot for you looks for a needle py a haystack questioned hans innocently needles tont vos goot for noddings in hay a hoss vot schwallows a needle vould die kvick i tole you dot and his innocence brought forth a short laugh  i move we make a swift run down the river for a distance of twenty or thirty miles came from tom we can go down on one side and come up the other and keep the spyglass handy so that nothing that can be seen escapes us  the matter was discussed a few minutes and it was decided to follow toms suggestion additional coal had been taken on and soon the steam tug was flying down the river under a full head of steam causing not a little spray to fly over the forward deck  say dot pow ist like a fountain was hans comment after he had received an unexpected ducking i shall sit py der pack deck after dis and he did  so far captain starr had said but little during the pursuit but now he began to show signs of interest  let me lay my hands on the villains who tied me fast in that stable and i shall teach them a lesson they will not forget in a hurry said he bitterly they made a fool of me  thats what they did captain said sam still they might have imposed upon anybody  ive been thinking of something youll remember about those two horse thieves went on the captain of the houseboat  to be sure  couldnt it be possible that they got on the dora too  its possible sam mused for a moment that sailboat story might have been a fake  he called dick and mr livingstone to him and repeated what captain starr had said  such a thing is possible said dick but we have no proofs  if we can catch those thieves as well as baxter and flapp it will be a good job done said the owner of the stock farm and from that moment he took a greater interest in the pursuit than ever  night came on and still they saw nothing of the houseboat they had gone down the river a distance of twenty miles and were now on their way back  weve missed them said dick soberly  it certainly looks like it returned tom every bit of fun had gone out of him its rough isnt it  im thinking of what to telegraph to mrs stanhope and mrs laning went on the eldest rover i hate to send bad news  tell them you are still following the houseboat and that you know dora and nellie are on board its the best we can do and when they landed a message was sent to that effect soon a message came back which read as follows  bring them back safe and sound no matter what the cost  we will if it can be done muttered dick and clenched his fists with a determination that meant a great deal  the night was spent at a hotel in one of the small towns and at daylight the search for the missing houseboat was renewed it had been decided to drop down the ohio further than ever and look into every smaller stream they came to by the way  thus several hours passed when they found themselves on the south side of the river not far from the entrance to a goodsized creek  down the stream came a worn and battered rowboat in which was seated an old man dressed in rags as he approached the steam tug he stopped rowing  say he drawled kin youuns tell me whar to find a party called the rovers  thats our party right here replied dick and he added excitedly what do you want to know for  so youuns are really the rovers  yes  searching fer somebody  yestwo young ladies  good nough got a message for ye  and the old man rowed toward the steam launch once more     chapter xxix  jake shaggam of shaggam creek   they will watch us more closely than ever now said dora after she and her cousin were left to themselves in the stateroom on board of the houseboat  i presume that is true answered nellie gloomily  they expect to make money by carrying us off nellie  i dont see how they can do it papa hasnt much money to pay over to them and wont have unless he sells the farm  mamma has quite some money of mine went on dora perhaps they will make her pay over that and then they are going to try to get something out of the rovers too  its a shame  they ought not to have a cent  the girls sat down and talked the matter over until daylight at about nine oclock lew flapp approached the stateroom door  dont you want something to eat he asked civilly  i want a drink answered nellie promptly for she was exceedingly thirsty  ive got a pitcher of ice water for you and some breakfast too you might as well eat it as not theres no sense in starving yourselves  i suppose that is true whispered nellie to her cousin she was hungry as well as thirsty having had no supper the night before  the door was opened and lew flapp passed the food and drink into them then he stood in the doorway eyeing them curiously  its too bad you wont be friends with us said he with a grin it would be much pleasanter to be friends  thank you but i dont want you for a friend mr flapp said dora frigidly  i aint so bad as you think i am  you are bad enough  i aint bad at all dick rover got me in a scrape at school and ever since that time hes been spreading evil reports about me  you robbed that jewelry store  no i didnt and i can prove it the rovers were the real thieves  you cannot make us believe such a tale we know the rovers too well said dora warmly  they are as honest as any boys can be added nellie  bah you do not know what you are talking about they are crafty that is alland half the cadets at putnam hall know it  to this neither of the girls would reply they wished to close the stateroom door but lew flapp held it open  i think you might give me a kiss for bringing you the eating he said with another grin  ill give youthis answered dora and pushed the door shut in his face there happened to be a bolt on the inside and she quickly shoved it into place  just you waitill get square on you growled lew flapp from the outside and then they heard him stamp off very much out of sorts  fortunately for the girls the breakfast brought to them was quite fair and there was plenty of it they ate sparingly resolved to save what was left until later in the day  he may not bring us anything more said dora perhaps i did wrong to shut the door on his nose  you did just right dora answered her cousin promptly i think he and baxter are horrid  but they have us in their power and have some men to aid them too  i wonder who those men can be  i do not know but they are very rough i suppose they would do almost anything for money they smell strongly of liquor  slowly the time went by they tried to look out of the stateroom window but dan baxter had placed a bit of canvas outside in such a position that they could see nothing  they do not want us to find out where they are taking us said dora and her surmise was correct  night was coming on once more when they felt a sudden jar of the houseboat followed by several other jars then they heard a scraping and a scratching  we have struck the bottom and are scraping along some trees and bushes said nellie where can we be  here is a fine shelter they heard pick loring exclaim theyll never spot the houseboat in such a cove as this  i believe you answered dan baxter it is certainly a dandy hiding place  those girls cant very well get ashore neither said hamp gouch if they tried it they would get into mud up to their waists  is this shaggam creekthe place you spoke about asked lew flapp  yes  you said there was an old man around here named jake shaggam  yes he lives in that tumbledown shanty over the hill i dont think he will bother us  does he live there alone  yes he is a bachelor and dont like to go down to the village  the girls heard this talk quite plainly but presently baxter flapp and the two horse thieves withdrew to another part of the houseboat and they heard no more  we are at a place called shaggam creek said dora that is worth remembering  if only we could get some sort of a message to the rover boys and the others sighed nellie dora cant we manage it somehow  perhaps we cananyway it wont do any harm to write out a message or two so as to have them ready to send off if the opportunity shows itself  paper and pencils were handy and the cousins set to work to write out half a dozen messages  we can set them floating on the river if nothing more said nellie somebody might pick one up and act on it  the hours slipped by and from the quietness on board the girls guessed that some of their abductors had left the houseboat  this was true baxter and flapp had gone off in company with pick loring to send a message to mrs stanhope and to mrs laning stating that dora and nellie were well and that they would be returned unharmed to their parents providing the sum of sixty thousand dollars be forwarded to a certain small place in the mountain inside of ten days  if you do not send the money the girls will suffer the message concluded beware of false dealings or it may cost them their lives  that ought to fetch the money said dan baxter after the business was concluded  if they can raise that amount answered loring of course you know more about how they are fixed than i do  they can raise itif they get the rovers to aid them  the prospects looked bright to the two horse thieves and as soon as loring returned to the houseboat he and hamp gouch applied themselves arduously to the liquor taken from captain starrs private locker  those fellows mean to get drunk whispered lew fiapp in alarm  im afraid so answered baxter but it cant be helped  late in the evening much to their surprise an old man in a dilapidated rowboat came up to the houseboat it was jake shaggam the hermit who had been out fishing  how are ye shaggam shouted pick loring who on account of the liquor taken felt extra sociable come on board old feller  against the wishes of baxter and flapp jake shaggam was allowed on board the houseboat and taken to the living room here he was given something to eat and drink and some tobacco  youre a good fellow jake said hamp gouch mighty good fellow show you something and he took the old man to where the girls were locked in  better stop this said flapp in increased alarm  oh its all right you can trust jake shaggam replied gouch with a swagger liquor had deprived him of all his natural shrewdness  he insisted upon talking about the girls and tried to open the door failing in this he took the hermit around to the window  nice old chap this is gals he said finest old chap in old kentucky think a sight o him i do shake hands with him  what are these yere gals doin here asked shaggam with interest  got em prisoners tell ye all bout it termorrow answered gouch thickly big deal onbettern stealin hosses  they seem to be very nice girls answered jake shaggam he was a harmless kind of an individual with a face that was far from repugnant  watching her chance dora drew close to the old man  take this please do she whispered and gave him one of the notes folded in a dollar bill  thank you answered jake shaggam  say nothinglook at it as soon as you get away added dora  the old hermit nodded and in a few minutes more he followed gouch to another part of the boat  do you think he will deliver that message asked nellie  let us pray heaven that he does answered her cousin     chapter xxx  the rescueconclusion   the rovers and the others on the steam tug could scarcely wait for the old man in the dilapidated rowboat to come up alongside  you have a message for us said dick hand it over quick  the message says as how youuns will pay me twentyfive dollars fer delivering of it in twentyfour hours said the old man cautiously  who is it from  it is signed dora stanhope and nellie laning  give it to meill pay you the money cried tom  all right reckon as how i kin trust youuns said the old man  it was jake shaggam who had received the message the evening before he had read it with interest and started out at daylight to find out something about the rovers and where they might be located good fortune had thrown him directly in our young friends way  this is really a message from the girls cried tom reading it hastily it is in nellie lanings handwriting  and dora stanhope has signed her name too added dick i know her signature well  of course you do put in fred dryly but nobody paid attention to the sally  they are on the houseboat and the craft is hidden up shaggam creek put in sam he turned to the captain of the tug where is shaggam creek  this ere is shaggam creek an im jake shaggam answered the hermit but youuns said youd pay me thet twentyfive dollars  i will said tom and brought out the amount at once  thank you very much  if youll take us to that houseboat without delay ill give you another five dollars put in dick  ill do it but i dont want them fellers on the houseboat to see me  why not  cos pick loring and hamp gouch thinks i am their friend ef they knowed as how i give em away theyd plug me full o lead  then the two horse thieves are with baxter and flapp said songbird if we bag the lot well be killing two birds with one stone as the saying goes  come on cried paul livingstone i want to get those two horse thieves by all means why there is a reward of one thousand dollars for their capture dead or alive  by golly ise out fo dat reward came from aleck and he pulled out a horse pistol which he was carrying jess let me see dem willains and he flourished the weapon wildly  the steam tug was led up the creek by jake shaggam for a distance of two miles  see that air turn yonder he said  yes said captain carson  thet houseboat is behind the trees and bushes around the pint now whars the five dollars  there you are said dick and paid him  much obliged now i reckon ill go home an let youuns fight it out added jake shaggam and tying up his rowboat he stalked off just as if he had accomplished nothing out of the ordinary  we had better approach with caution said paul livingstone those horse thieves are desperate characters they would not be above shooting us down rather than give up to the law  in the meantime baxter and flapp were much disturbed by the condition of affairs on board the houseboat both loring and gouch had been drinking more or less all night and were in far from a sober condition  i dont mind a drink myself but those chaps make me sick growled dan baxter  i guess we made a mistake to take them into our scheme said lew flapp look how gouch blabbed to that old man last night  where are they now  in the captains stateroom opening a new bottle of liquor neither of them can stand up straight  for two pins id pitch them overboard where is sculley  he is with them drinking hard too  if we only knew how to run that launch we could leave them behind and sail out of here  perhaps well have to do thatif the three keep on drinking  baxter and flapp were on deck they had had their breakfast but had given nothing more to the girls  im going to tame em grumbled flapp who had not forgotten how the door had been slammed in his face  thats right well make em come to terms added baxter well have em on their knees to us before we get through  presently both walked to the window of the stateroom dora and nellie occupied  well how do you feelpretty hungry questioned baxter  not so very hungry said dora as lightly as she could  dont you want a nice hot breakfast  id rather have some fruit  oh by the way weve got some nice harvest apples on boardand some berries wouldnt you like some berries with sugar and cream  and some fresh breakfast rolls put in flapp  not if you baked them came from nellie you can have a good breakfast if youll be a little more civil to us resumed dan baxter  we are more civil than you deserve said dora  do you want to be starved  at this both girls turned a trifle pale  would you dare to starve us cried nellie  why notif you wont be friendly asked lew flapp youve been treating us as if we were dogs  yes and we began dan baxter when he chanced to look through the bushes and down the creek great scott flapp he yelled  whats up  the game is up here comes a tug with the rovers and a lot of other people on board  the rovers faltered lew flapp and for the instant he shivered from head to feet  oh good good cried nellie help she screamed help  help help added dora help us this way  we are coming came back in dicks voice and a moment later the steam tug crashed into the side of the houseboat and the rovers and several others leaped on board  stand where you are lew flapp cried tom and rushed for the bully of putnam hall stand i say and then he hit flapp a stunning blow in the ear which bowled the rascal over and over  in the meantime dan baxter took to his heels and made for the front of the houseboat from this point he jumped into the branches of a tree and disappeared from view  come on after him cried sam and away he and fred went after baxter leaving the others to take charge of flapp and round up the horse thieves and sculley  but dan baxter knew what capture meanta long term of imprisonment in the future and possibly a good drubbing from the rovers on the spotand he therefore redoubled his efforts to escape  follow me at your peril he sang out and then they heard him crashing through the bushes gradually the sounds grew fainter and fainter  where did he go to sam  i cant say said sam well have to organize a regular party to run him down  it was an easy matter to make lew flapp a prisoner once captured the former bully of the hall blubbered like a baby  it was dan baxter led me into it he groaned it was all his doings not mine  when loring gouch and sculley were confronted by the party the intoxicated evildoers were in no condition to offer any resistance roundly did they bewail their luck but this availed them nothing and without ceremony they were made prisoners their hands being tied behind them with stout ropes  are you hurt asked dick of the girls anxiously  not in the least dick answered dora but oh how thankful i am that you came as you did  and i am thankful too came from nellie  and we are thankful to be on hand said tom  and the others said the same   here let me bring to a close the story of the rover boys on the river the trip had been full of adventures but it now looked as if all would end happily  without loss of time dora and nellie were taken care of and the houseboat was put into proper order for use by the rovers and their friends  dat galley am a mess to see said aleck pop but i dont careso long as dem young ladies am saved  as speedily as possible messages were sent to the lanings and to mrs stanhope carrying the news of the girls safety and the recovery of the missing houseboat after that paul livingstone saw to it that pick loring hamp gouch and their accomplice sculley were turned over to the proper authorities for this the whole party received the reward of one thousand dollars which was evenly divided between them  dots der first money i receive playing detecter said hans when he got his portion maybe i vos been a regular bolice detecter ven i got old enough hey  lew flapp was taken back to new york state to stand trial for the robbery of aaron fairchilds shop but through the influence of his family and some rich friends he was let out on bail when the time for his trial arrived he was missing  he is going to be as bad as dan baxter some day said sam  perhaps but he is more of a coward than baxter answered dick  wonder where baxter disappeared to came from tom  well find out some time said sam and he was right they soon met their old enemy again and what baxter did to bring them trouble will be told in the next volume of this series to be entitled the rover boys on the plains or the mystery of red rock ranch in this work we shall meet many of our old friends again and learn what they did towards solving a most unusual secret  two days after the missing houseboat was found there was a reunion on board in which all of our friends took part there was a grand dinner served in aleck pops best style and in the evening the craft was trimmed up with japanese lanterns from end to end and a professional orchestra of three pieces was engaged by the rovers to furnish music for the occasion mr livingstone and his family visited the houseboat bringing several young folks with them the girls and boys sang danced and played games while the older folks looked on songbird powell recited several original poems fred garrison made a really comic speech and hans mueller convulsed everybody by his good nature and his funny way of talking  i never felt so lighthearted in my life said tom after the celebration had come to an end  we owe you and the others a great deal said mrs laning  yes and i shall not forget it put in mrs stanhope all of you are regular heroes  heroes pooh sniffed tom nothing of the sort we are just wideawake american boys  and they are wideawake arent they kind reader  the end
