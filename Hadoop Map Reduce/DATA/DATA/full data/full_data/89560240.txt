     295   chapter i honours   oh theres that stick  what can he want sighed one of a pair of dignified elderly ladies in black silk to the other as in a quiet countrytown street they saw themselves about to be accosted by a man of about forty with the air of a managing clerk who came up breathlessly with a flush on his usually pale cheeks  miss lang i beg pardon  may i be allowed a few words with miss marshall  i know it is unusual but i have something unusual to tell her  nothing distressing i hope mr morton said one of the ladies startled  oh no quite the reverse he said with a nervous laugh in fact i have unexpectedly come into a property  indeed with great astonishment i congratulate you as the colour mounted in his face pleasant honest but with the subdued expression left by long years of patience in a subordinate position  may i ask began the other sister  i hardly understand it yet was the answer but i must go to town by the 510 train and i should like her to hear it from myself  oh certainly it does you honour mr morton  they were entering the sweep of one of those large substantial houses on the outskirts of country towns that have a tendency to become boardingschools and such had that of the misses lang been long before the days of the high school  fortunately it is recreationtime said miss lang as she conducted mr morton to the drawingroom hung round with coloured drawings in good taste if stiff and chiefly devoted to interviews with parents  poor little miss marshall murmured one sister when they had shut him in  what a loss she will be  she deserves any good fortune  she does  is it not twenty years  twentytwo next august sister  yes it was twentytwo years since mary marshall had been passed from the clergy orphan asylum to be english governess at miss langs excellent school at hurminster  in that town resided with her two sons mrs morton the widow of a horsedealing farmer in the late mr marshalls parish  on discovering the identity of the english governess with the little girl who had admired the foals lambs and chickens in past times mrs morton gave invitations to tea  she was ladylike the sons unexceptionable and no objection could reasonably be made by the misses lang though the acquaintance was regretted by them  mr morton the father had died in debt and distress and the eldest son had been thankful for a clerkship in the office of mr burford a solicitor in considerable practice and man of business to several of the county magnates  frank morton was not remarkable for talent or enterprise but he was plodding and trustworthy methodical and accurate and he had continued in the same position except that time had made him senior instead of junior clerk  partly from natural disposition partly from weight of responsibility he had always been a grave steady youth one of those whom their contemporaries rank as sticks and muffs because not exalted by youthful spirits or love of daring  his mother and brother had always been his primary thought and his recreations were of the sobersided sortthe chess club the institute the choral society he was a useful though not a distinguished member of the choir of st basils church and a punctual and diligent sundayschool teacher of the least interesting boys  to most of the world of hurminster he was almost invisible to the rest utterly insignificant  even his mother was far less occupied with him than with his brother charles who was much handsomer more amusing and spirited as well as far less contented or easy to be reckoned upon  but there was one person to whom he was everything namely little browneyed softvoiced mary marshall  she felt herself the happiest of creatures when after two years of occasional evening teas and walks to evensong at st basils it was settled that she should become his wife as soon as his salary should be increased and charlie be in condition to assist in supporting his mother  ever since mary had rested on that hope and the privileges it gave  she had loyally informed the misses lang who were scarcely propitious but could not interfere as long as their pupils or they believed so surmised nothing  so the sunday evening intercourse became more frequent and in the holidays when the homeless governess had always remained to superintend cleaning and repairs there were many pleasant hours spent with kind old mrs morton who if she had ever wished that frank had waited longer and chosen some one with means never betrayed it to the girl whom she soon loved as a daughter  two years had at first been thought of as the period of patience charles had a situation as clerk in a shipping office at westhaven a small seaport about twenty miles off and his mother was designing to go to keep house for him when he announced that his banns had been asked with the daughter of the captain and partowner of a small trading vessel of the port  the hurminster couple must defer their plans till further promotion and so far from helping his mother charles ere long was applying to her when in need for family expenses  then came a terrible catastrophe  charlie had been ill and in his convalescence was taken on a voyage by his fatherinlaw  there was a collision in the channel and the emma jane and all on board were lost the insurance did not cover the pecuniary loss debts came to light and nothing was left for the widow and her three children except a seaside lodginghouse in which her father had invested his savings  the childrens education and great part of their maintenance must fall on their uncle and again his marriage must wait till this burthen was lessened  old mrs morton died and meetings thus became more difficult and infrequent  frank had hoped to retain the little house where he had lived so long but his sisterinlaws demands were heavy and he found himself obliged to sell his superfluous furniture and commit himself to the rough attendance of the housekeeper at the office where two rooms were granted to him  thus had year after year gone by unmarked except by the growth of the young people at westhaven and the demand of their mother on the savings that were to have been a nestegg while gray threads began to appear in marys hair and franks lighter locks to leave his temples bare  so things stood when on this strange afternoon miss marshall was summoned mysteriously from watching the due performance of an imposition and was told outside the door that mr morton wanted to speak to her  it was startling news for though the misses lang were kindly women and had never thrown obstacles in the way of her engagement they had merely permitted it and almost ignored it except when old mrs morton was dying and they had freely facilitated her attendance  surely something as dreadful as the running down of the emma jane must have happened thought mary as she sped to the drawingroom  she was a little brown mouse of a woman with soft dark eyes smooth hair and a clear olive complexion on which thirtyeight years of life and eighteen of waiting had not left much outward trace for the mistresses were good women who had never oppressed their underling and though she had not met with much outward sympathy or companionship the one well of hope and joy might at times suffer drought but had never run dry any more than the better fountain within and beyond  in she came with eyes alarmed but ready to console  oh frank what is it  what can i do for you  it is no bad news was his greeting as he put his arm round her trembling little figure and kissed her brow  only too good  oh is mrs charles going to be married the only hopeful contingency she could think of  no he said but mary an extraordinary incident has taken place  i have inherited a property  a property  you are well off  oh thank god and she clasped her hands then held his  at last  but what  how  did you know  i knew of the connection but that the family had never taken notice of my father  as to the rest i was entirely unprepared  my greatgrandfather was a younger son of the first lord northmoor but for some misconduct was cast off and proscribed  as you know my grandfather and father devoted themselves to horses on the old farm and made no pretensions to gentility  the elder branch of the family was once numerous but it must have since dwindled till the old lord was left with only a little grandson who died of diphtheria a short time before his grandfather  poor old man began mary  thenoh do you mean that he died too  yes he was ill before and this was a fatal blow  it appears that he was aware that i was next in the succession and after the boys death had desired the solicitor to write to me as heiratlaw  heiratlaw  frank do you mean that you are she said turning pale  baron northmoor he answered and you my patient mary will be the baroness as soon as may be  oh frankand there was a rush of tearsdear frank your hard work and cares are all over  i am not sure of that he said gravely but at least this long waiting is over and i can give you everything  but oh she cried sobbing uncontrollably with her face hidden in her handkerchief  mary mary what does this mean  dont you understand  theres nothing to hinder it now  she made a gesture as if to put him back from her and struggled for utterance  it is very dear very good butbut it cant be now  you must not drag yourself down with me  that is just nonsense mary  you are far fitter for this than i am you are the one joy in it to me  you think so now she said striving to hold herself back but you wont by and by  do you think me a mere boy to change so easily said the new lord earnestly  i look on this as a heavy burthen and very serious responsibility but it is to you whom i look to sweeten it help me through with it and guard me from its temptations  if i could  come mary i am forced to go to london immediately and then on to the funeral  i shall miss the train if i remain another minute  dont send me away with a sore heart  tell me that your affection has not been worn out by these weary years  you cannot think so frank she sobbed  you know it has only grown i only want to do what is best for you  not another word he said with a fresh kiss  that is all i want for the present  he was gone while mary crept up to her little attic there to weep out her agitated uncertain feelings  oh he is so good  he deserves to be great  that i should be his first thought  dear dear fellow  but i ought to give him up  i ought not to be a drag on him  it would not be fair on him  i can love him and watch him all the same but oh how dreary it will be to have no sunday afternoons  is this selfish  is this worldly  oh help me to do right and hold to what is best for him  and whenever poor mary had any time to herself out of sight of curious eyes she spent it in concocting a letter that went near to the breaking of her constant heart     chapter ii honours reflected   on the beach at westhaven beyond the town and harbour stood a row of houses each with a garden of tamarisk thrift and saltloving flowers frequented by lodgers in search of cheap sea breezes and sometimes by families of yachting personages who liked to have their headquarters on shore  two girls were making their way to one of these  one was so tall though very slight that in spite of the dark hair streaming in the wind she looked more than her fifteen years and her brilliant pinkandwhite complexioned face confirmed the impression  her sister keeping as much as she could under her lee was about twelve years old much more childish as well as softer smaller with lighter colouring and blue eyes  going round the end of the house they entered by the back door and turning into a little parlour they threw off their hats and gloves the younger one began to lay the table for dinner while the elder throwing herself down panting called out  ma heres a letter from uncle  ill open it  i hope hes not crusty about that horrid low millinery business  yes do called back a voice across the tiled passage  ive had no time  this girl has put me about so with mrs leesons luncheon that ive not had a moment  of all the sluts ive ever been plagued with shes the very worst and so i tell her till im ready to drop  what is it then ida as an inarticulate noise was heard                       picture frontispiecema ma  ma ma uncle is a lord came back in a gasp  what  uncles a lord  oh  your uncle  that stick of a man  dont be putting your jokes on me when im worrited to death exclaimed mrs morton in fretful tones  no joke  its truelord northmoor  and this brought mrs morton out of the kitchen in her apron and bib with a knife in one hand and a bunch of parsley in the other  she was a handsome woman in the same style as ida but her complexion had grown harder than accorded with the slightly sentimental air she assumed when she had time to pity herself  it is it is persisted ida reading scraps from the letter title and estates devolve on mefamily bereavementselder line extinct  give me the letter  oh you gave me such a turn said mrs morton sinking into a chair  whats the row said another voice as a sturdy brighteyed boy between the ages of his sisters came bouncing in  i say i want my gruband be quick  oh herbert my dear boy and his mother hugged him your uncle is a lord and youll be one one of these days  i say dont lug a mans head off  who has been making a fool of you  uncle frank is lord northmoor said ida impressively  i say thats a good one and herbert threw himself into a chair in fits of laughter  it is quite true herbert said his mother  here is the letter  a bell rang sharply  bless me i shall not hear much more of that bell i hope  run up conny and say mrs leesons lunch will be up in a moment but we were hindered by unexpected news said mrs morton bustling into the kitchen  oh dear one doesnt know where one is  let her ring said ida  send her off bag and baggage  weve done with lodgings and milliners and telegraphs and all thats low  we shall all be lords and ladies and ever so rich  hold hard said herbert who had got possession of the letter  he doesnt say so  hell be nasty and mean i daresay said ida  what does he say  i hadnt time to see  herbert read from the neat formal distinct writing i do not yet know what is in my power nor what means i may be able to command but i hope to make your position more comfortable and to give my nephew and nieces a really superior education  you had better however not take any steps till you hear from me again  there ida lots of schooling thats all  nonsense bertie he mustif he is a lord what are we  hunger postponed this great question for a little while but dinner had been delayed till the afternoon school hour had passed and indeed the young people agreed that they were far above going to their present teachers any more  we must acquire a few accomplishments said ida  uncle never would afford me lessons on the pianosuch a shame but he cant refuse me now dancing lessons too we will have and then oh conny we will go to court and how they will admire us  at which herbert burst out laughing loudly and his mother rebuked him you will be a nobleman herbert and your sisters a noblemans sisters why should they not go to court like the best of them  thats all my eye said herbert  the governor has got a young woman of his own hasnt he  that dowdy old teacher said ida  of course he wont marry her now  she will be artful enough to try to hold him to it you may depend on it said mrs morton but i shall take care he knows what a shame and disgrace it would be  oh no he will not dare  she is awfully old said ida  not near so old as miss pottle who was married yesterday said constance who at the time of her fathers death and at other times when the presence of a young child was felt to be inconvenient at home had stayed with her grandmother at hurminster and had grown fond of miss marshall  dont talk about what you know nothing about constance broke in her mother  your uncle lord northmoor aint going to lower and demean himself by dragging a mere school teacher up into the peerage to cut out poor herbert and all his family  theres that bell again  i shall go and let mrs leeson know how we are situated and that i shall give her notice one of these days  clear the table girls we dont know who may be dropping in  this done chiefly by constance the sisters put on their hats and sallied forth with their astounding news to such of their friends as were within reach and by the time they had finished their expedition they were convinced of their own nobility and prepared to be called lady ida and lady constance northmoor on the spot  when they came in they found the parlour being prepared for company and were sent to procure sausages and muffins for tea  mrs morton had on reflection decided that it was inexpedient to answer her brotherinlaw till she had ascertained as she said her just rights and she had invited to tea mr and mrs rollstone and to constances delight his little daughter rose their neighbours a few doors off but as rose was attending classes it had been useless to go to her before  mr rollstone was a great authority for he had spent the best part of his life in what he termed the first families of the highest circles  he had been hall boy to a duke footman to a viscountess valet to an earl butler to a right honourable baronet mp and when he had retired on the death of the baronet and marriage with the housekeeper he had brought away a red volume by name burkes peerage by which as well as by his previous knowledge he was enabled to serve as an oracle respecting all owners of yachts worthy of consideration  if their names were not recorded in that book he scorned them as parvenoos however perfect their vessels might be in the eyes of mariners  the edition was indeed a quarter of a century old but he had kept it up to date by marking in neatly all the births deaths and marriages from the gazettehis daily study  his daughter a nice modestlooking girl of fourteen constances chief friend came too  his wife was detained by her lodgers but when he rolled in with the book under his arm there was a certain resemblance between himself and it for both were broad and slightly dilapidatedthe one from gout the other from wear and the red cover had faded into a nondescript whitybrown or brownywhite not unlike the complexion of a closeshaven face  he was carefully arrayed in evening costume and was very choice in his language being in fact much grander than all his aristocratic masters rolled into one so that though mrs morton tried to recollect that she was a great lady and he had been a servant force of habit made her feel his condescension when he held out his puffy white hand and with a gracious bend of his yellowgray head said allow me to offer my congratulations mrs morton  i little suspected my proximity to a lady so nearly allied to the aristocracy  i am sure you are very kind mr rollstone  i had no notionida can tell you i was quite overcomethough when i came to think of it my poor dear morton always did say he had high connections but i always thought it was one of his jokes  then as i understand mrs morton the lamented deceased was junior to the present lord northmoor  yes poor dear  oh if he had but lived and been eldest he would have become his honours ever so much better  and oh mr rollstone what are we put in ida breathlessly while rose squeezed constances hand in schoolgirl fashion  indeed miss ida i fear i cannot flatter you with any change in your designation  if your respected parent had survived he might have become the honourable charles but only by special grant from her majesty  it was so in the case of the honourable frances fordingham when her brother inherited the title  then at least i am an honourable exclaimed mrs morton  i am afraid not mrs morton  i know of no precedent for such honours being bestowed on a relict but as i understand that lord northmoor is no longer in his first youth your son might succeed to the title and in that case his sisters might behe paused for a wordennobled  then does not it really make any difference to us exclaimed mrs morton  that would rest in the bosom of his lordship said mr rollstone solemnly  i declare it is an awful shame burst out ida while constance cooed dear uncle  hush hush ida said her mother  your uncle has always treated us handsomely and we have every reason to expect that he will continue to do so  he ought to have us to live with him in his house in london and take us to court said ida  oh mr rollstone is he not bound to do that  and constance breathed how delicious  mr rollstone perhaps had his doubts of the figures mrs and miss morton would cut in society but he contented himself with saying it may be well to moderate your expectations miss ida and to remember that lord northmoor is not compulsorily bound to consult any interests but his own  if he does not it is perfectly abominable cried mrs morton towards his poor only brothers children with herbert his next heirapparent  heirpresumptuous solemnly corrected mr rollstone at which ida looked at constance but constance respected rosies feelings and would not return her sisters glance only blushed and sniggered  heirapparent is only the eldest son who cannot be displaced by any contingency  and theres a horrid little artful school teacher who drew him in years agobefore i was married even said mrs morton  no doubt she will try to keep him now  most likely she always knew what was going to happen  cannot he be set free from the entanglement  oh gasped constance  that is serious observed mr rollstone gravely  it would be an unfortunate commencement to have an action for breach of promise of marriage  she would never dare said mrs morton  she is as poor as a rat and could not do it  well mrs morton said mr rollstone if i may be allowed to tender my poor advice it would be that you should be very cautious and careful not to give any offence to his lordship or to utter what might be reported to him in a sinister manner  oh i know every one has enemies said mrs morton tossing her head  after this disappointment there was rather less interest displayed when mr rollstone proceeded to track out and explain the whole northmoor pedigree from the great lawyer sir michael morton who had gained the peerage down to the failure of the direct line tracing the son from whom francis and charles morton were descended  certainly miss marshall must have been wonderfully foresighted if she had engaged herself with a view to the succession for at the time it began the last lord northmoor had two sons and a brother living  there was also a daughter the honourable bertha augusta  is she married demanded mrs morton  it is not marked here and if it had been mentioned in the papers i should not have failed to record it  and how old is she  the author of this peerage would never be guilty of the solecism of recording a ladys age said mr rollstone gravely but as the honourable arthur was born in 1848 and the honourable michael in 1850 we may infer that the young lady is no longer in her first youth  and not married  nearly frlord northmoors age  she must be an old cat who will set her mind on marrying him sighed mrs morton and will make him cut all his own relations  then mary marshall might be the better lookout said ida  she could never be unkind breathed little constance  there is no knowing said mr rollstone oracularly but the result of my observations has been that the true highbred aristocracy are usually far more affable and condescending than those elevated from a lower rank  oh i do hope for miss marshall said constance in a whisper to rose  nasty old thinga horrid old governess returned ida and they tittered scarcely pausing to hear mr rollstones announcement of the discovery that he had entered the marriage in 1879 of the honourable arthur michael to lady adela emily only daughter of the earl of arlington and the death of the said honourable arthur by a carriage accident four years later  then herbert tumbled in bringing a scent of tea and tar and was greeted with an imploring injunction to brush his hair and wash his handsboth which operations he declared that he had performed spreading out his brown hands which might be called clean except for ingrained streaks of tar  mr rollstone tried to console his mother by declaring that it was aristocratic to know how to handle the ropes and herbert sitting among the girls began while devouring sausages to express his intention of having a yacht in which rose should be taken on a voyage  no not ida she would only make a fool of herself on board and besides she had such horrid stickingout ears with a pull at them which made her scream and her mother rebuke him while mr rollstone observed that the young gentleman had much to learn if he was to conform to aristocratic manners and herbert under his breath hung aristocratic manners and added that he was not to be bored at any rate till he was a lord and then to salve any shock to his visitor proceeded to say that his yacht should be the rose and invite her to a voyage  certainly not till you can behave yourself replied rose and there was a general titter among the young people     chapter iii what is honour   here is a bit of news for you said sir edward kenton as after a morning of work with his agent both came in to the family luncheon mr burford tells me that the northmoor title has descended on his agent morton  that stick exclaimed george the son and heir  not altogether a stick mr kenton said the baldheaded gentlemanly agent  he is very worthy and industrious  frederica kenton and her brother looked at each other as if this character were not inconsistent with that of a stick  poor man said their mother  is it not a great misfortune to him  i should think him sensible and methodical said sir edward  by the way did you not tell me that it was his diligence that discovered the clause to which our success was owing in the stockpen suit  yes sir edward through his indefatigable diligence in reading over every document connected with the matter  i take shame to myself he added smiling for it was in a letter that i had read and put aside missing that passage  then i am under great obligations to him said sir edward  i could also tell of what only came to my knowledge many years later and not through himself of attempts made to tamper with his integrity and gain private information from him which he had steadily baffled  there must be much in him said lady kenton if only he is not spoilt  i am afraid he is heavily weighted said mr burford  his brothers widow and children are almost entirely dependent on him more so in my opinion than he should have allowed  exactly what i should expect from such a sheep said george kenton  there is this advantage said the lawyer it has prevented his marrying  at least that fatal step has been averted said the lady smiling  but unluckily there is an entanglement an endless engagement to a governess at miss langs  oh cried freda who once during a long absence of the family abroad had been disposed of at miss langs there was always a kind of whisper among us that miss marshall was engaged though it was high treason to be supposed to know  was that the one you called creepmouse asked her brother  george you should not bring up old misdeeds  she was a harmless old thing  i believe the tinies were very fond of her but we elders had not much to do with her only we used to think her horridly particular  does that mean conscientious asked her father  perhaps it does and though i was rather a goose then i really believe she was very kind and did not want to be tiresome  a lady asked her mother  i suppose so but she was so awfully quiet there was no knowing  poor thing observed lady kenton in a tone of commiseration  i think morton told me that she was a clergyorphan said mr burford and considered her as rather above him for his father was a ruined farmer and horsebreeder and i only took him into my office out of respect for his mother though i never had a better bargain in my life of course however this unlucky engagement cannot stand  indeed said the baronet drily  would you have him begin his career with an act of baseness  nono sir edward i did not mean said mr burford rather abashed but the lady might be worked on to resign her pretensions since persistence might not be for the happiness of either party and he really ought to marry a lady of fortune say his cousin miss morton for i understand that the northmoor property was never considerable  the late mr morton was very extravagant and there are heavy burthens on the estate by the settlement on his widow lady adela and on the late lords daughter  miss lang tells me likewise that miss marshall is full of doubts and scruples and is almost persuaded that it is incumbent on her to drop the engagement at any cost to herself  she is very conscientious  poor thing sighed more than one voice  it is a serious question continued the solicitor and i own that i think it would be better for both if she were induced to release him  has she no relations of her own  none that i ever heard of  she has always spent her holidays at miss langs  well mr burford exclaimed freda i think you are frightfully cruel to my poor little creepmouse  nay freda said her mother all that mr burford is considering is whether it would be for the happiness or welfare of either to be raised to a position for which she is not prepared  i thought you were on her side mother  there are no sides freda said her father reprovingly  the whole must rest with the persons chiefly concerned and no one ought to interfere or influence them in either direction  having thus rebuked mr burford quite as much as his daughter he added where is lord northmoor now  he wrote to me from northmoor after the funeral sir edward saying that he would return on saturday  of course though three months notice would be due i should not expect it as i told him at first but he assures me that he will not leave me till my arrangements for supplying his place are complete and he will assist me as usual  it is very proper of him said sir edward  it will be awkward in some ways said mr burford  yet i do not know what i could otherwise have done he had become so necessary to me  stick or no stick was the family comment of the kentons there must be something in the man if only his head is not turned  which observed sir edward is not possible to a stick with a real head but only too easy to a sham one     chapter iv honours waning   and who is the man  so asked a lady in deep mourning of another still more becraped as they sat together in the darkened room of a northmoor house on the day before the funeral  the speaker had her bonnet by her side and showed a kindly clever middleaged face  she was mrs bury a widow niece of the late lord the other was his daughter bertha morton a few years younger  she was not tearful but had dark rings round her eyes and looked haggard and worn  the man  i never heard of him till this terrible loss of poor little mikey  then did he put in a claim  oh no but hailes knew about him and so indeed did my father  it seems that three generations ago there was a son who followed the instincts of our race further than usual and married a jockeys daughter or something of that sort  he was set up in a horsebreeding farm and cut the connection but it seems that there was always a sort of communication of family events so that hailes knew exactly where to look for an heir  not a jockey  oh no nothing so diverting  that would be fun bertha said with a laugh that had no merriment in it  he is a clerkan attorneys clerk what do you think of that lettice  better than the jockey  oh very respectable they saywith a sound of disgust  is he young  no caught early something might be done with him but theres not that hope  he is not much less than forty  fancy a creature that has pettifogged as an underling too all his life  married  thank goodness no and all the mammas in london and in the country will be running after him  not that he will be any great catch for of course he has nothingand the poor place will be brought to a low ebb  and what do you mean to do birdie  get out of sight of it all as fast as possible  forget that horses ever existed except as means of locomotion and bertha got up and walked towards the window as if restless with pain then came back  i shall get rid of all i canand come to live as near as i can to whitechapel and slum  im free now  then looking at her cousins sorrowful wistful face work work work thats all thats good for me  soberly lettice this is my plan she added sitting down again i know how it all is left  this new man is to have enough to go on upon so as not to be too beggarly and bring the title into contempt  he is only coming for tomorrow having to wind up his business but i shall stay on till he comes back and settle what to do with the things here adela and i have our choice of them and dont want to leave the place too bare  then i shall sell the london house and all the rest of the encumbrances and set up for myself  not with adela  oh no adela means to stick by the old place and i couldnt do that for a constancyoh no with a shudder  does she in some wonder  her own people dont want her  the arlingtons are with her now but i fancy she would rather be sitting with usor alone best of all poor dear  you see she is a mixture of the angel that is too much for some people  how she got it i dont know not among us i should think though she came to us straight out of the schoolroom or i fancy she would never have come at all  but oh lettice if you could have seen her how patient she has been throughout with my father reading him all about every race just because she thought it was less gall and wormwood to her than to me and going out to the stables to satisfy him about his dear night hawk and all the rest of it  when she was away for that fortnight over poor little michael i found to the full what she had been and then after that back she comes again as white as a sheet but all she ever was to my father and more wonderful than all setting herself to reconcile him to the notion of this new heir of hisand i do believe if my father had not so suddenly grown worse she would have made us have him up to be introducedall out of rectitude and duty you know for adela is the shyest of mortals and recoils by nature from the underbred far more than we do  in fact i rather like it  it gives me a sensation  i had ten times rather this man were a common sailor or a tinker than just a stupid stick of a clerk  then adela means to stay at the dower house  yes she has rooted herself there by all her love to her poor people and i fancy too that she does not want to bring amice up among all the arlington children who are not after her pattern so she intends to bear the brunt of it and not leave northmoor unless the newcomers turn out unbearable  she goes away with her brother now  oh yes she must and lord arlington is fond of her in a way  cant you stay on with me lettice  i wish i could my dear birdie but i am anxious about mary i dont think i must stay later than sunday  yes you are too devoted a mother for me to absorb  never mind you will be in london and i shall soon be within reach of you  you are a comfortable person lettice     chapter v the peer   poor miss lang  after all her care that her young pupils heads should not be turned by folly about marriage and noblemen the very event she had always viewed as most absurdly improbable had really occurred and it was impossible to keep it a secret though miss marshall did her very best to appear as usual heard lessons with her accustomed diligence conducted the daily exercises watched over the instructions by masters and presided over the needlework  but she grew whiter more pinched and her little face more mouselike every day and the elder girls whispered fancies about her  she had no doubt heard that lord northmoor had broken it offa little poky attorneys clerk of course he wouldpoor dear thing she will go into a consumption  didnt you hear her cough last nightand then well all throw wreaths into her graveoh that was only elsie harrisnonsense mabel im sure it was her poor thing  prenez garde la vieille dragonne vient  that lord northmoor was to come back by the mail train was known and miss lang had sent a polite note to invite him to afternoon tea on the sunday  the church to which he had been for many years devoted was a district one and miss langs establishment had their places in the old parish church so there was not much chance of meeting in the morning though one pupil observed to another that she should think him a beast if they did not meet him on the way to church  it is to be feared that she had to form this opinion but on the other hand by the early dinnertime tidings pervaded the school that lord northmoor had been at st basils and sung in his surplice just as if nothing had happened  the more sensational party of girls further averred that he had been base enough to walk thither with miss burford and that miss marshall had been crying all church time  whether this was true or not it was certain that she ate scarcely any dinner and that miss lang insisted on administering a glass of wine  moreover when dinner was finally over she quietly crept up to her own room and resumed her churchgoing bonneta little black net with a longenduring bunch of violets  then she knelt down and entreated oh show me thy will and give me strength and judgment to do that which may be best for him and may neither of us be beguiled by the world or by ambition  then she peeped out to make sure that the coast was clearnot that she was not quite free to go where she pleased but she dreaded eyes and tittersout at the door to the corner of the lane where for many a sunday afternoon there had been a quiet tryste and walk  her heart beat so as almost to choke her and she hardly durst raise her eyes to see if the accustomed figure awaited her  was it the accustomed figure  her eyes dazzled so under her little holland parasol that she could hardly see and though there was a movement towards her she felt unable to look up till she heard the words mary at last and felt the clasp of the hand  oh franki mean  you mean frank your own frank nothing else to you  ought you  and as she murmured she looked up  it was the same but still a certain change was there almost indescribable but still to be felt as if a line of toil and weariness had passed from the cheek  the quiet gray eyes were brighter and more eager the bearing as if ten years had been taken from the forty and though mary did not perceive the details the dress showing that his mourning had not come from the country town tailor and outfitter even the soft hat a very different article from that which was wont to replace the wellcherished tall one of sunday mornings  i had not much time he said but i thought this would be of the most use and he began clasping on her arm a gold bracelet with a tiny watch on it  i thought you would like best to keep our old ring  ifif i ought to keep it at all she faltered  now mary i will not have an afternoon spoilt by any folly of that sort he said  is it folly  nay listen  should you not get on far far better without such a poor little stupid thing as i am  i always thought i was the stupid one  youbut you are a man  so much the worse  yes but frank dont you see what i mean  this thing has come to you and you cant help it and you are descended from these people really but it would be choice for me and i could not bear to feel that you were ashamed of me  never he exclaimed  look here mary  what should i do without you to come back to and be at rest with  all the time i was talking to those ladies and going through those fine rooms i was thinking of the one comfort i should have when i have you all to myself  see he added going over the arguments that he had no doubt prepared it is not as if you were like poor emma  you are a lady all over and have always lived with ladies and yet you are not too grand for me  think what you would leave me toto be wretched by myself or else  i could never be at home with those highbred folk  i felt it every moment though miss morton was very kind and even wanted me to call her birdie  i did feel thankful i could tell her i was engaged  you did  yes and she was very kind and said she was glad of it and hoped soon to know you  oh frank dear i am sure no one ever was more really noblehearted than you she almost sobbed you know how i shall always feel it but yet but yet i cant help thinking you ought to leave it a little more unsettled till you have looked about a little and seen whether i should be a very great disadvantage to you  seen whether i could find such a dear unselfish little woman eh  no no mary put all that out of your head  we have not loved one another for twenty years for a trumpery title to come between us now  and you need not fear being too well off for the position  the agent hailes has been continually apologising to me for the smallness of the means he says either we must have no house in london or else let northmoor he cannot tell me yet exactly what income we shall have but the farms dont let well and there is not much ready money  every one says you ought to marry a lady of fortune  my dear mary to what would you condemn me  what sort of lady of fortune do you think would take an old stick like me for the sake of being my lady  i really shall begin to believe you are tired of it  stick oh no no  staff ifand the manner in which she began to cling was answer full and complete indeed as she saw that her resistance had begun to hurt him as much as herself she felt herself free to throw herself into the interests and ask is northmoor a very nice place  not so pretty as cotes kenton outside  a great white house with a portico for carriages to drive under and not kept up very well patches of plaster coming off but there is a beautiful view over the woods with a purple moor beyond  and inside  well rather dreary waiting for you to make it homelike  they have not lived there much for some time past  lady adela has lived in the dower house and will continue there  did you see much of them  not lady adela  poor lady she had her own relations with her  she had not by any means recovered the loss of her little boy and i can quite understand that it must have been too trying for her to see me in his place  i understand from hailes  your mr burford said mary smiling  that she is a very refined rather exclusive and domestic lady devoted to her little girl and extremely kind to the poor  indeed so is miss morton but she prefers the london poor and is altogether rather flighty and what hailes calls an unconventional young lady  there was a very nice lady with her mrs bury the daughter of a brother of the late lord a widow and very kind and friendly  both were very goodnatured miss morton always acted hostess and talked continually  about her father  oh no i do not think he had been a very affectionate father and their habits and tastes had been very different  lady adela seems to have latterly been more to him  miss morton was chiefly concerned to advise me about politics and social questions and how to deal with the estate and the tenants  he seemed somewhat to shudder at the recollection and mary certainly conceived a dread of the ladies of northmoor  it was further elicited that he meant to help mr burford through all the work and arrangements consequent on his own succession indeed to remain at his post either till a successor was found or the junior sufficiently indoctrinated to take the place  of course as he said six months notice was due but mr burford has waived this  during this time he meant to go to see poor emma at westhaven but it was not an expedition he seemed much to relish and he wished to defer it till he could definitely tell what it would be in his power to do for her and her children for whose education he was really anxious rejoicing that they were still young enough to be moulded  then came the tea at miss langsa stately meal when the two ladies were grand lord northmoor became shy and frozen monosyllabic and only spasmodically able to utter and mary felt it in all her nerves and subsided into her smallest self under the sense that nobody ever would do him justice     chapter vi the weight of honours   the next was a fortnight of strange and new experiences  lord northmoor spent most of his days over the papers in the office so much his usual self that mr burford generally forgot and called to him as morton so naturally that after the first the other clerks left off sniggering  there sir edward called on him and in an interview in his sittingroom at the office asked him to a quiet dinner together with the solicitor but this was hardly a success for mr burford being at home with the family did all the talking and frank could not but feel in the presence of his master and had not a word to say for himself especially as george and freda looked critical and as if that stick was in their minds if not on their lips  the only time when he approached a thaw was when in the hot summer evening lady kenton made him her companion in a twilight stroll on the terraces when he looked at the roses with delight and volunteered a question about the best sorts saying that the garden at northmoor had been much neglected and he wanted to have it in good order that isblushing and correcting himselfif we can live there  lady kenton noted the we and was sorry to be here interrupted  we shall do nothing with him till we get him alone she said  we must have him apart from mr burford  before this however they had to meet him at a very splendid party given with all the resources of the burford family at their villa when the county folks who had no small curiosity to see the new peer were invited in full force and the poor peer felt capable of fewer words than ever to throw at them  lady kenton ventured on asking mrs burford to introduce her to miss marshall taking such presence for granted  oh lady kenton really now i did not think that foolish affair should be encouraged  it is such an unfortunate thing for him and as miss lang and i agreed it would be so much better for both of them if it were given up  is there anything against her  oh no not at all only that poor thing she is quite unfitted for the position and between ourselves in the condition of the property it is really incumbent on his lordship to marry a lady of fortune  at his age he cannot afford romance she added with a laugh being in fact rather inferior to her husband in tone or perhaps in manners  indeed she was of all others the person who most shrivelled up the man whom she had always treated like a poor dependent till her politeness became still more embarrassing  among all the party sir edward and lady kenton were those with whom he was most nearly at ease for they had nothing to revoke in their manners towards him and could without any change treat him as an equal whom they respected nor did they try to force him forward into general conversationas did his hostwith the best intentions  lady kenton under cover of miss burfords piano asked him whether she might call on miss marshall and saw him flush with gratitude and pleasure as he answered it will be very kind in you  lady kenton knew enough of the ways of the school to understand when to make her visit so as to have a previous conversation with miss lang whom of course she already knew  that lady received her in one of the drawingrooms the folding doors into the other were shut  i have told miss marshall said miss lang that the room is always at her service to receive lord northmoor though in fact he never comes till after business hours  he is behaving very well  very honourably indeed but poor miss marshall is in a very distressing position  indeed  is she not very happy in his constancy  she is in great doubt and difficulty said miss lang and we really hardly know how to advise her  she seems sure of his affection but she shrinks from entering on a position for which she is so unfit  is she really unfit  miss lang hesitated  she is a complete lady and as good and conscientious a creature as ever existed but you see lady kenton her whole life has been spent here ever since she was sixteen she has known nothing beyond the schoolroom and how she is ever to fulfil the duties of a peeress and the head of a large establishment i really cannot see it might be just misery to her and to him too  has she good sense  yes very fair sense  we can trust to her judgment implicitly in dealing with the girls and she teaches well but she is not at all clever and could never shine  perhaps a person who wanted to shine might be embarrassing said lady kenton rather amused  well it might be so  the poor man is certainly no star himself but surely he needs some one who would draw him out and push him forward make a way in society in fact  that might not be for his domestic happiness  perhaps not but your ladyship has not seen what a poor little insignificant creature she isthough indeed we are both very fond of her and should be very much relieved not to think we ought to strengthen her scruples  for indeed and tears actually came into the good ladys eyes i am sure that though she would release him for his good that it would break her heart  shall i call her  ah as a voice began to become very audible on the other side of the doors she has a visitor  not lord northmoor  it is a womans voice and a loud one  presently indeed there was a tone that made lady kenton say people do scent things very fast  it must be some one wanting to apply for patronage  i am a little afraid it is that sisterinlaw of his said miss lang lowering her voice  i saw her once at the choral festivalandand i wasnt delighted  perhaps i had better come another day said lady kenton  we seem to be almost listening  even as the lady was taking her leave the words were plainly heard  artful meanspirited timeserving viper as you are bent on dragging him down to destruction     chapter vii mortons and manners   shillyshally quoth mrs charles morton over her brotherinlaws letter  does he think a mother is to be put off like that  so she arrayed herself in panoply of glittering jet and nodding plumes and set forth by train to hurminster to assert her rights and those of her children armed with a black sunshade and three pockethandkerchiefs  she did not usually wear mourning but this was an assertion of her nobility  in his sittingroom wearing his old office coat pale wearied and worried the frank morton who could be turned round the finger of any one who knew how appeared at her summons  she met him with an effusive kiss of congratulation  dearest frank no i must not say frank  i could hardly believe my eyes when i read the news  nor i said he  nor the dear children  oh if your dear brother were only here  we are longing to hear all about it she said as she settled herself in the armchair a relic of his mother  he repeated what he had told mary about the family the park and the london house  i suppose there is a fine establishment of servants and carriages  the servants are to be paid off  as to the carriages and the rest of the personal property they go to miss morton but the executors are arranging about my paying for such furniture as i shall want  and jewels  there are some heirlooms but i have not seen them  how are the children  very well very much delighted  dear herbert is the noblest boy  he was ready to begin on his navigation studies this next term but of course there is no occasion for that now  it is a pity with his taste for the sea that he is too old to be a naval cadet  the army is a gentlemans profession if he must have one  i must consider what is best for him  yes my lord impressively  i am hoping to know what you mean to do for your dear brothers dear orphans and her handkerchief went up to her eyes  i hope at any rate to give herbert the education of a gentleman and to send his sisters to good schools  how are they getting on  dear ida she is that clever and superior that a master in music and french is all she would want  besides you know she is that delicate connie is the bookish one she is so eager about the examination that she will go on at her school though i would have taken her away from such a low place at once  it is a good school and will have given her a good foundation  i must see what may be best for them  and of course you will put us in a situation becoming the family of your dear brother she added with another application of the handkerchief  i mean to do what i can you may be sure but at present it is impossible to name any amount  i neither know what income is coming to me nor what will be my expenses  i meant to come and see you as soon as there was anything explicit to tell you but of course this first year there will be much less in hand than later  well she said pouting i can put up with something less in the meantime for of course your poor dear brothers widow and children are your first consideration and even a nobleman as a bachelor cannot have so many expenses  i shall not long continue a bachelor was the answer given with a sort of shy resolution  now lord northmoor  you dont mean to say that you intend to go on with that ridiculous affair when if you marry at all it ought to be one who will bring something handsome into the family  once for all emma i will hear no more on that subject  a twenty years engagement is not lightly to be broken  a wretched little teacher she began but she was cut short  remember i will hear no more of this and nothing but despair of other means could have inspired him it is for your own interest to abstain from insulting my future wife and myself by such remonstrances  even then she muttered very hard  not even goodlooking  that is as one may think said he mentally contrasting the flaunting hardened complexion before him with the sweet countenance he had never perceived to be pinched or faded and as he heard something between a scornful sniff and a sob he added i am wanted in the office so if you have no more to say of any consequence i must leave you and hannah shall give you some tea  oh oh that you should leave your poor brothers widow in this way and she melted into tears and sobs  i cant help it emma he said distressed and perplexed  they want me about some business of mr claughtons and i cant keep them waiting these are office hours you know  have some tea and i will come to you again  but mrs emma swallowed her sobs as soon as he was gone and instead of waiting for the tea set forth for miss langs  on asking for miss marshall she was shown into the drawingroom where after she had waited a few minutes nursing her wrath to keep it warm the small figure appeared whom she had no hesitation in accosting thus  now miss marshall do i understand that you are resolved to attempt thrusting yourself on his lordship lord northmoors family  mary entirely taken by surprise could only falter i can only do whatever he wishes  that is just a mere pretence  i wonder you are not ashamed to play on his honourable feelings when you know everything is changed and that it is absolutely ridiculous and derogatory for a peer of the realm to stoop to a mere drudge of a teacher  it is owned mary but she went back to her formulary it must be as he wishes  if he is infatuated enough to pretend to wish it i tell you it is your simple duty to refuse him  whatever might be marys own views of her duty to have it inculcated in such a manner stirred her whole soul into opposition which was shown not in words but in a tiny curve of the lips such as infuriated her visitor so that vulgarity and violence were under no restraint and whether all selfcommand was lost in passion or whether there was an idea that bullying might gain the day mrs mortons voice rose into a shrill scream as she denounced the nasty meanspirited viper worming herself  the folding doors suddenly opened and in a dignified tone miss lang announced lady kenton wishes to be introduced to you miss marshall  mary made her little formal bend as well as her trembling limbs would allow her  her cheeks were hot her eyes swam her hand shook as lady kenton took it kindly while mrs morton too strong in her own convictions to perceive how the land lay exclaimed your ladyship is come for the same purpose as me to let miss marshall know how detrimental and improper it is in her to persist in holding my brother lord northmoor to the unfortunate engagement she inveigled him into  to utter this with moderate coolness cost such an effort that she thought mr rollstone could not have done it better and was astonished when lady kenton replied indeed i came to have the pleasure of congratulating miss marshall on if it be not impertinent to say so a beautiful and rare perseverance and constancy being rewarded  as if she had not known what she was about muttered mrs morton not even yet quite confounded but as she saw the lady lay another hand over that of still trembling mary she added well if that is the case my lady and she is to be encouraged in her obstinacy i have no more to say except that it is a cruel shame on his poor dear brothers children thatthat he has made so much of and have the best right and she began to sob again  come said miss lang as if talking to a naughty girl if you are overcome like that you had better come away  wherewith authoritative habits made it possible to her to get mrs morton out of the room while mary well used to selfrestraint was struggling with choking tears but when warmhearted lady kenton drew her close and kissed her they began to flow uncontrollably so that she could only gasp oh i beg your pardon my lady  never mind was the answer i dont wonder  theres no word for that language but brutal  oh dont was marys cry  she is his lord northmoors sisterinlaw and he has done everything for her ever since his brothers death  that is no reason she should speak to you in that way  i must ask you to excuse me but we could not help hearing she was so loud and then i felt impelled to break in  it was very very kind  but oh i wish i knew whether she is not in the right after all  i am sure lord northmoor is deeply attachedquite in earnest said lady kenton feeling rather as if she was taking a liberty  yes i know it would grieve him most dreadfully if it came to an end now dear fellow  i know it would break my heart too but never mind that i would go away out of his reach and he might get over it  would it not be better than his being always ashamed of an inferior incompetent creature always dragging after him  i do not think you can be either after what my daughter and miss lang have told me  you see it is not even as if i had been a governess in a private family i have always been here  i know nothing about servants or great houses or society not so much as our least little girl who has a home  may i tell you what i think my dear said lady kenton greatly touched  you have nothing to unlearn and there is nothing needful to the position but what any person of moderate ability and good sense can acquire and i am quite sure that lord northmoor would be far less happy without you even in the longrun besides the distress you would cause him now  it is not a brilliant showy person that he needs but one to understand and make him a real home  that is what he is always telling me said mary somewhat cheered  yes and he could not help showing where his heart is said the lady now the holidays are near are they not  the 11th of july  then if you have no other plans will you come and stay with me  we are very quiet people but you would have an opportunity of understanding something of the kind of life  oh how very kind of you  nobody has been so good to me  i think i can help you in some of the difficulties if you will let me said lady kenton quite convinced herself and leaving a much happier woman than she had found     chapter viii second thoughts   though miss lang was shocked and indignant at mrs mortons violence she was a wise woman and felt that it would be better tact not to let such a person depart without an attempt at pacification so she did her best at dignified soothing and listened to a good deal of grumbling and lamentation  she contrived however to give the impression that as things stood mrs morton would be far wiser to make no more resistance but to consult family peace by accepting miss marshall who she assured the visitor was a very kind and excellent person not likely to influence lord northmoor against his own family except on great provocation  mrs morton actually yielded so far as to declare she had only spoken for her dear brotherinlaws own good and that since he was so infatuated she supposed for her dear childrens sake she must endure it  having no desire to encounter him again she went off by the next train leaving a message that she had had tea at miss langs  she related at home to her expectant daughter that lord northmoor had grown that high and stuckup there was no speaking to him and that there miss marshall was an artful puss as knew how to play her cards and get in with the quality  i wish you had taken me ma said ida i should have known what to say to them  i cant tell child you might only have made it worse  i see how it is now and we must be mum or it may be the worse for us  he says he will do what he can for us but i know what that means  she will hold the pursestrings and make him meaner than he is already  he will never know how to spend his fortune now he has got it  if your poor dear pa had only been alive now he would never have let you be wronged  but you gave it to them cried ida  that i did  only that lady lady kenton came in all stuckup and haughty and cut me short interfering as she had no business to or i would have brought miss mary to her marrowbones  she hadnt a word to say for herself but now she has got those fine folks on her side the thing will go on as sure as fate  however ive done my dooty thats one comfort and now i suppose i shall have to patch it up as best i can  i wouldnt said ida hotly  ah ida my dear you dont know what a mother wont do for her children  a sigh that was often reiterated as mrs morton composed a letter to her brotherinlaw with some hints from ida on the spelling and some from mr rollstone on the address  the upshot was that her dear brother and his fiancee were to believe her actuated by the purest sense of the duty and anxiety she owed to them and her dear children the orphans of his dear deceased brother  now that she had once expressed herself she trusted to her dear franks affectionate nature to bury all in oblivion and to believe that she should be ready to welcome her new sisterinlaw with the warmest affection  therewith followed a request for five pounds to pay for her mourning and darling idas which they had felt due to him  lord northmoor did not quite see how it was due to him nor did he intend to give whatever his dear sisterinlaw might demand but she had made him so angry that he felt that he must prove his forgiveness to himself mary had not thought it needful to describe the force of the attack upon herself or perhaps his pardon might not have gone so far  he sent the note and added that as he was wanted at northmoor for a day or two he would take his nephew herbert with him  this was something like as mrs morton said a kind of tangible acknowledgment of their relationship and of herbert as his heir and it was a magnificent thing to tell all her acquaintances that her son was gone to the family seat with his uncle lord northmoor  she would fain have obtained for him some instructions in the manners of the upper ten thousand from mr rollstone but herbert entirely repudiated listening to that old fogey observing that after all it was only old frank and he wasnt going to bother himself for the like of him  the uncle was fond of his brothers boy and had devised this plan partly for the sake of the pleasure it would give and partly because it was impossible to form any judgment of his character while with the mother he was a fine wellgrown manly boy and when seen among his companions had an indefinable air of good blood about him  he had hitherto been at a good dayschool which prepared boys for the merchant service and his tastes were so much in the direction of the sea that it was much to be regretted that at fourteen and a half it was useless to think of preparation for a naval cadetship  he was sent up by train to join his uncle at hurminster and the first question after the greeting was i say uncle shant you have a yacht  i could not afford it if i wished it was the answer while punch was handed over to him and lord northmoor applied himself to a long blue letter  landlubber sighed herbert to himself with true marine contempt for a man who had sat on an officestool all his life  he doesnt look a bit more of a swell than he used to  it is well theres some one with some pluck in the family     chapter ix the heirpresumptuous   herbert began to be impressed when on the train arriving at a little country station a servant in mourning with finger to his hat inquired after his lordships luggage and another was seen presiding over a coroneted brougham  i say he breathed forth when they were shut in is this yours  it is miss mortons i believe at present  i am to arrange whether to keep it or not  they were driving over an open heath in its summer carpetlike state of purple heather dwarf gorse and bracken  lord northmoor looked out with thoughtfulness in his face  by and by there was a gate a lodge a curtseying woman and as they passed it he said now this is northmoor  yours uncle  yes  my was all herbert could utter  it semed to his townbred eyes a huge space before they reached through some rather scanty plantations another lodge and a park not very extensive but with a few fine trees and they thundered up beneath the pillars to what was to his idea a palacewith servants standing about in a great hall  his uncle would have turned one way but a servant said miss morton is in the morningroom my lord and ushered them into a room where a lady in black came forward  you did not expect to find me here still she said cordially but adela is gone to her brothers and i thought i had better stay for the division ofof the things  oh certainlyi amglad he stammered with a blush as one not quite sure of the correctness of the proceeding  i wouldnt have intruded  bosh  im the intruder  letitia bury is gonealasbut said she laughing hailes is herestaying she added to relieve him and to lessen the confusion that amused her and i see you have a companion your nephew  yes herbert my late brothers son  i would not have brought him if i had known  a cousin she said smiling and shaking hands with him  boys are my delight  this is quite a new experience  herbert looked up surprised not much liking to become an experience  he had had less intercourse with ladies than many boys of humbler pretensions for his mother had always scouted the idea of sending her children to a sundayschool and she was neither like his mothers friends nor his preconceived notions  there for want of an introduction i must introduce myself  your cousin bertha or birdie whichever you like best  frank was by no means prepared to say even bertha and was in agonies lest herbert should presume on the liberty given him but if the boy had been in the palace of truth he would have said you old girl you are awfully old to call yourself birdie  for birdie had been a pet name of rose rollstone and bertha morton though slim and curlyheaded had a worn look about her eyes and a countenance such as to show her fiveandthirty years and to the eyes of fourteen was almost antediluvian indeed older observers might detect a worn haggard strained look  he was somewhat disgusted too at the thin rolls of breadandbutter on the low table whence she proceeded to hand teacups as he thought of the substantial meals at home  when they had been conducted to their rooms and his uncle followed to his he broke out with his perpetual i say uncle is this all the grub great swells have  im awfully peckish  thats early tea my boy was the answer with a smile  theres dinner to come and i hope you will behave yourself well and not use such expressions  dinner thats not such a bad hearing but i suppose one must eat it like a judge  certainly i am afraid i am not a very good model but dont you do anything you dont see me do  and herbert dont take wine every time the servants offer it  at which herbert made a face  have you got any evening shoes  no  if i had only known that the lady was here  it cant be helped today only wash your face and hands well theres some hot water  why they aint dirty said the boy surveying them as one to whom the remains of a journey were mere trifles then with a sigh its no end of a place but you swells have a lot of bores and no mistake  upstairs herbert roamed about studying with great curiosity the appliances of the first bedchamber he had ever beheld beyond the degree of his mothers first floor but downstairs he was in the mood of the savage too proud to show wonder or admiration or the sense of awe with which he was inspired by being waited on by the very marrow of mr rollstone always such grand company at home  this daunted him far more than the presence of the lady and though his was a spirit not easily daunted he almost blushed when that personage peremptorily resisted his endeavour to present the wrong glass for champagne which fortunately he disliked too much at the first taste to make another attempt  lord northmoor for the first time at the foot of his own table was on thorns all the time lest he should see his nephew commit some indiscretion and left most of the conversation to miss morton and mr hailes the solicitor a finelooking old gentleman who was almost fatherly to her very civil to him but who cast somewhat critical eyes on the cub who might have to be licked into a shape befitting the heir  they tried to keep their host in the conversation but without much success though he listened as it drifted into immediate interests and affairs of the neighbourhood and made response as best he could to the explanations which like wellbred people they from time to time directed to him  he thus learnt that lady adela with her little amice had been carried off by main force bertha said by her brother  but she will come back again she added  she is devoted to the place and her gravesand the poor people  i do not know what they would do without her said mr hailes  no  she is ladyofallwork and proparsonesswith all her might then seeing or thinking she saw a puzzled look she added i dont know if you discovered northmoor that our vicar mr woodman has no wife and adela has supplied the lack to the parish having a soul for country poor whereas they are too tame for me  i care about my neighbours of course after a sort but the jolly city sparrows of the slums for me  i long to be away  what to say to this lord northmoor knew as little as did his nephew and with some difficulty he managed to utter are not they very uncivilised  thats the beauty of it said bertha ive spotted my own special preserve of matchgirls newsboys etc and mr hailes is going to help me to get a scrumptious little house whence i can get to it by underground rail  oh you may shake your head mr hailes but if you will not help me i shall set my unassisted genius to work and youll only suffer agonies in thinking of the muddle i may be making  what does lady adela say asked mr hailes  she thinks me old enough to take care of myself whatever you do mr hailes besides she knows i can come up to breathe  i long for it  the dinner ended by bertha rising and proposing to herbert to come with her  it was not too dark she said to look out into the park and see the rabbits scudding about  ah said mr hailes shaking his head as they went the rabbits ought not to be so near but there has been sad neglect since poor mr mortons death  it was much easier to get on in a teteatete and before long mr hailes had heard some of the perplexities about herbert the foremost of which was how to make him presentable for ladies society in the evening if miss mortons presence had been anticipated either his uncle would not have brought him or would have fitted him out beforehand for though he looked fit for the fields and woods in male company evening costume had not yet dawned on his imagination  mr hailes recommended sending him in the morning to the town at colbeam under charge of the butler prowsewho would rather enjoy the commission and was quite capable of keeping up any needed authority  for the future training the more important matter on which he was next consulted mr hailes mentioned the name of a private tutor who was likely to be able to deal with the boy better under present circumstances than a public school could dosince at herberts age his ignorance of the classics on the one hand and of gentlemanly habits on the other would tell too much against him  but said mr hailes miss morton will be a very good adviser to you on that head  she is very goodnatured to him said frank  no one living has a better heart than miss morton said mr hailes heartily a little eccentric owing toto circumstances  she has had her troubles poor dear but she has as good a heart as ever was as you will find my lord in all arrangements with her  nevertheless lord northmoors feelings towards her might be startled the next morning when he descended to the diningroom  a screen cut off the door and as he was coming round it followed by his nephew berthas clear voice was heard saying yes he is inoffensive but he is a stick theres no denying it mr hailes he is a dreadful stick  frank was too far advanced to retire before the meaning dawned on him partly through a little explosion of herbert behind him and partly from the guilty consternation and colour with which the other two turned round from the erection of plants among which they were standing  yet it was the shy man who spoke first in the predicament like a timid creature driven to bay  yes miss morton i know it is too true no one is more sensible of it than myself  i can only hope to do my best such as it is  oh northmoor it was very horrid and unguarded in me and i can only be sorry and beg your pardon and while she laughed and held out her hand there was a dew in her eyes  truths do not need pardon he said as he gave a cousinly grasp and i think you will try kindly to excuse my deficiencies and disadvantages  there was a certain dignity in his tone and bertha said heartily  thank you  it is all right in essentials and chatter is of very little consequence  now come and have some breakfast  they got on together far better after that and began to feel like relations before herbert was sent off with mr prowse to colbeam indeed throughout the transactions that followed bertha showed herself far less devoted to her own interests than to what might be called the honour of the family  her fathers will had been made in haste after the death of his little grandson and was as concise as possible her influence having told upon it  knowing that the new heir would have nothing to begin with and aware that if he inherited merely the title house and land he would be in great straits the old lord had bequeathed to him nearly what would have been left to the grandson a fair proportion of the money in the funds and bank and all the furniture and appurtenances of northmoor house excepting such articles as bertha and lady adela might select each up to a certain value  lady adelas had been few and already chosen and berthas were manifestly only matters of personal belonging and not up altogether to the amount named so as to avoid stripping the place which at the best was only splendid in utterly unaccustomed eyes  horses and carriages had to be bought of her and it was she who told him what was absolutely necessary and fixed the price as low as she could so as not to make them a gift  and he was not so ignorant in this matter as she had expectedfor the old habits of his boyhood served him he could ride well and his scruples at miss mortons estimate proved that he knew a horse when he saw itas she said  she would perhaps have liked him better if he had been a dissipated horsey man like his father  he would have given her sensationsand on his side considering the reputation of the family he was surprised at her eager almost passionate desire to be rid of the valuable horses and equipages as soon as possible  when in the afternoon she went out of doors to refresh herself with a solitary ramble in the park after her morning of business she heard an altercation and presently encountered a keeper dragging after him a trespasser in whom to her amazement she recognised herbert morton at the same moment as he exclaimed cousin bertha  miss  look at this impudent fellow though i told him i was lord northmoors own nephew  and i told him maam said the keeper touching his hat that if he was ten nephews i wouldnt have him throwing stones at my pheasants nor his lordship wouldnt neither and then he sauced me and i said i would see what his lordship said to that  you must excuse him this time best said miss morton he is a townbred boy and knows no better and you had better not worry his lordship about it  very well miss morton if it is your pleasure but them pheasants are my province and i must do my dooty  of course quite right best she answered but my cousin here did not understand and you must make allowance for him  best touched his hat again and went off with an undercurrent of growl  oh herbert this is a pity miss morton exclaimed  cheeky chap said herbert sulkily  what business had he to meddle with me  a great big wild bird gets up with no end of a row and i did nothing but shy a stone and out comes this fellow at me in a regular wax and didnt care half a farthing when i told him who i was  i fancy he did not believe me  i dont wonder said bertha you have yet to learn that in the eyes of any gentleman nothing is much more sacred than a pheasant  i never meant to hurt the thing only one just chucks a stone muttered herbert abashed but still defensive and offended  i thought my uncle would teach the rascal how to speak to me  ill tell you what herbert if you take that line with good old servants who are only doing their duty you wont have a happy time of it here  i suppose you wish to take your place as a gentleman  well the greatest sign of a gentleman is to be courteous and wellbehaved to all about him  he wasnt courteous or wellbehaved to me  no because you did not show yourself such a gentleman as he has been used to  if you acted like a tramp or a poacher no wonder he thought you one then after a pause you will find that much of your pleasure in sport depends on the keepers and that it would be a great disadvantage to be on bad terms with them so i strongly advise you on every account to treat them with civility and put out of your head that there is any dignity in being rude  herbert liked miss morton and had been impressed as well as kindly treated by her and though he sulked now there was an aftereffect     chapter x coming honours   with great trepidation did mary marshall set forth on her visit to coles kenton  she had made up her mindand a determined mind it could be on occasionthat on it should turn her final acceptance of her twenty years lover  utterly inexperienced as she was even in domestic not to say high life she had perhaps an exaggerated idea alike of its requirements and of her own deficiencies and she was resolved to use her own judgment according to her personal experience whether she should be hindrance or help to him whom she loved too truly and unselfishly to allow herself to be made the former  she was glad that for the first few days she should not see him and should thus be less distracted and biased but it was with a sinking heart that she heard that lady kenton had called to take her up in the carriage  grateful as she was for the kindness which saved her the dreariness of a solitary arrival she was a strange mixture of resolution and selfdistrust of moral courage and timidity as had been shown by her withstanding all miss langs endeavours to make her improve her dress beyond what was absolutely necessary for the visit lest it should be presuming on the future  lady kenton had a manner such as to smooth away shyness and with tact that perceived with what kind of nature she had to deal managed to make the teatable serve only as a renewal of acquaintance with frederica and an introduction to sir edward after which mary was taken to the schoolroom and made known to the governess a kindly sensible woman who according to previous arrangement made the visitor free of her domains as a refuge  the prettiness and luxury of the guestchamber was quite a shock and mary would rather have faced a dozen naughty girls than have taken sir edwards arm to go in to dinner  however her hostess had decided on a quiet course of treatment such as not to frighten this pupil and it had been agreed only to take enough notice of her to prevent her from feeling herself neglected until she should begin to be more at ease  nor was it long before a certain sparkle in the brown eyes showed that she was amused by and appreciative of the family talk  it was true as lady kenton had told her that she had nothing to unlearn all she wanted was confidence experience and ease and in so humble gentle and refined a nature as hers the acquisition of these could not lead to the disclosure of anything undesirable  so after the first day of novelty when she had learnt the hours could distinguish between the young people knew her way about the house so as to be secure of not opening the wrong doors and when she had learnt where and when she would be welcome and even helpful she began to enjoy herself and the life the beauty and the leisure  she made friends heartily with the governess fraternised with freda taught the younger girls new games could hold a sort of conversation with sir edward became less afraid of george and daily had more of filial devotion to lady kenton  the books on the tables were a real delight and pleasure to her when she found that it was not illmannered to sit down and read in the forenoon and the discussion of them was a great help in what freda called teaching her to talk  visitors were very gradually brought upon her a gentleman or two at first who knew nothing about her perhaps thought her the governess and merely bowed to her there was only one real contretemps when some guests who lived rather beyond the neighbourhood arrived for afternoon tea and moreover full of curiosity about lord northmoor  was it true that he was an attorneys clerk and was not he going to marry a very inferior person  certainly not said lady kenton  he is engaged to my friend miss marshall  the said miss marshall was handing the sugar while freda was pouring out the tea  she had been named on the ladies entrance and the colour rose to her eyes but she said nothing while there was a confusion of i beg pardon  i understand  report makes a good many mistakes said lady kenton coolly  mary my dear you have given me no sugar  it was the first time of calling her by her christian name and done for the sake of making the equal intimacy apparent  in fact mary was behaving herself better than the visitors as lady kenton absolutely told her when a sort of titter was heard in the hall where they were expressing to freda their horror at the scrape and extorting that miss marshall was really a governess  but quite a lady said freda stoutly and we are all as fond of her as possible  it showed how much progress she had made that even this shock did not set her to express any more fainthearted doubts and when lord northmoor arrived the next day the involuntary radiance on both their faces was token enough that they were all the world to each other  mary allowed herself to venture on getting lady kentons counsel on the duties of household headship that would fall on her and instead of being terrified at the great gardenparty and dinnerparty to be held at coles kenton eagerly availed herself of instruction in the details of their management  she had accepted her fate and when the two were seen moving about among the people of the party they neither of them looked incongruous with the county aristocracy  quiet retiring and insignificant they might be but there was nothing to remark by the most curious eyes of those who knew they were to see the new peer and his destined bride in fact as george and freda privately remarked they were just the people that nobody ever would see at all unless they were set up upon a pedestal  mary still feebly suggested when the marriage was spoken of that it might be wiser for frank to wait a year get over his first expenses and feel his way but he would not hear of her going back to her work and pleaded his solitude so piteously that she could not but consent to let it take place as soon as possible  they would fain have kept it as private as possible but their good friends were of opinion that it was necessary to give them a start with some eclat and insisted that it should take place with all due honours at coles kenton where mary was treated like a favoured niece and assisted with counsel on her trousseau  the savings she had made during the long years of her engagement were enough to fit her out sufficiently to feel that she was bringing her own wardrobe and lady kenton actually went to london with her to superintend the outlay  whom would they like to have asked to the wedding the lady inquired herself naming the langs and burfords  of course she added smiling freda and alice will be only too happy to be bridesmaids  have you any one whom you would wish to ask  your old scholars perhaps  i think said mary hesitating that one reason why we think we ought to decline your kindness wasabout his relations  lady kenton had given full license to the propriety of calling him frank with intimate friends but mary always had a shyness about it  indeed i should make no question about asking them if i had not doubted whether after what passed  that is all forgotten said mary gently  i have had quite a nice letter since and  of course they must be asked said lady kenton i should have proposed it before but for that scene  that is nothing said mary the doubt is whether considering the style of people it would not be better for us to manage it otherwise and not let you be troubled  oh thats nothing  on such an occasion theres no fear of their not behaving like the rest of the world  there are girls i think they should be bridesmaids  this very real kindness overcame all scruples and indeed a great deal might be forgiven to miss marshall in consideration of the glory of telling all westhaven of the invitation to be present at my brother lord northmoors wedding at sir edward kentons baronet  he gave the dresses not only the bridesmaids white and cerise fredas choice but the chocolate moire which for a minute mrs morton fancied the little spiteful cat had chosen on purpose to suppress her till assured by all qualified beholders especially mrs rollstone and a dressmaker friend that in nothing else would she have looked so entirely quite the lady  and lady kentons augury was fulfilled  the whole family were subdued enough by their surroundings to comport themselves quite well enough to pass muster     chapter xi possession   so francis morton baron northmoor of northmoor and mary marshall daughter of the late reverend john marshall were man and wife at last their honeymoon was ideally happy  it fulfilled a dream of their life when frank used in the holidays spent by mary with his mother to read aloud the waverley novels and they had calculated almost as an impossible castle in the air the possibility of visiting the localities and now they went as assuredly they had never thought of going and not much impeded by the greatness that had been thrust on them  the goodnatured kentons had dispensed his lordship from the encumbrance of a valet and though my lady could not well be allowed to go maidless lady kenton had found a sensible friendly person for her of whom she soon ceased to be afraid and thus felt the advantage of being able to attend to her husband instead of her luggage  tourists might look and laugh at their simple delight as at that of a pair of unsophisticated cockneys  this did not trouble them as they trod what was to them classic ground tried in vain the impossible feat of seeing melrose aright but revelled in what they did see stood with bated breath at dryburgh by the minstrels tomb and tracked his magic spells from the tweed even to staffa feeling the full delight for the first time of mountain sea and loch  their enjoyment was perhaps even greater than that of boy and girl for it was the reaction of chastened lives and hearts at leisure from themselves nor were spirit and vigour too much spent for enterprise  they tasted to the full every innocent charm that came in their way and above all the bliss of being together in the perfect sympathy that had been the growth of so many years  their maid harte might well confide to her congeners that though my lord and my lady were the oldest couple she had known they were the most attached in a quiet way  they were loth to end this state of felicity before taking their new cares upon them and were glad that the arrangements of the executors made it desirable that they should not take possession till october when they left behind them the gorgeous autumn beauty of the western coast and journeyed southwards  the bells were rung the gates thrown wide open and lights flashed in the windows as lord and lady northmoor drove up to their home but it was in the dark and there was no demonstrative welcome the indoor servants were all new the cookhousekeeper hired by lady kentons assistance and the rest of the maids chosen by her the butler and his subordinate acquired in like manner  it was a little dreary  the rooms looked large and empty  miss mortons belongings had been just what gave a homelike air to the place and when these were gone even the big fires could not greatly cheer the huge spaces  however these two months had accustomed the new arrivals to their titles and likewise to being waited upon and they were less at a loss than they would have been previously though to mary especially it was hard to realise that it was her own house and that she need ask no ones leave  also that it was not a duty to sit with a fire  she could not well have done so considering how many were doing their best to enliven the house and finally she spent the evening in the library not a very inviting room in itself but which the late lord had inhabited and where the present one had already held business interviews  it was of course lined with the standard books of the last generation and mary who had heard of many but never had access to them flitted over them while her husband opened the letters he had found awaiting him  to her what some one has called the tea tobacco and snuff of an old library where the books are chiefly viewed as appropriate furniture were all delightful discoveries  even to humes history of englandnine volumes  i did not know it was so long  our first class had the students hume  is there much difference  rather to the students advantage i believe  half these letters at least are mere solicitations for custom  and advertisements  how the books stick together  i wonder when they were opened last  never i suspect said he  i do not imagine the mortons were much disposed to read  well they have left us a delightful store  whats this  smolletts don quixote  i always wanted to know about that  is it not something about giants and windmills  have you read it  i once read an odd volume  he was half mad and too good for this world and thought he was living in a romance  i will read you some bits  you would not like it all  oh i do hope you will have time to read to me  gibbons decline and fall of the roman empire  all these volumes  they are quite damp  you have read it  yes and i wish i could remember all those emperors  i must put aside this letter for hailesit is a man applying for a house  how strange it sounds  look here is such an immense shakespeare oh full of engravings as she fell upon boydells shakespeareanother name reverenced though she only knew a few selected plays prepared for elocution exercises  her husband having had access to the institute library and spent many evenings over books was better read than she whose knowledge went no farther than that of the highest class but who knew all very accurately that she did know and was intelligent enough to find in those shelves a delightful promise of pasture  he was by this time sighing over requests for subscriptions  such numbers  such good purposes  but how can i give  cannot you give at least a guinea asked mary after hearing some  i do not know whether in this position a small sum in the list is not more disadvantageous than nothing at all  besides i know nothing of the real merits  i must ask hailes  ah and here is emma i thought that she would be a little impatient  she says she shall let her house for the winter and thinks of going to london or to brighton where she may have masters for the girls  oh i thought you meant them to go to a good school  so i do if i can get emmas consent but i doubt her choosing to part with ida  she wants to come here  i suppose we ought to have her  yes but not immediately  i do not mean to neglect herat least i do hope to do all that is right but i think you ought to have a fair start here before she comes so that we will invite her for christmas and then we can arrange about ida and constance  dear little connie i hope she is as nice a little girl as she used to be  with good training i think she will be and the tutor gives me good accounts of herbert in this letter  shall we have him here on sunday week  yes i am very anxious to see him  i hope his master gives him more religious instruction than he has ever had poor boy  though not brilliant or playful lord and lady northmoor had it may be perceived no lack of good sense in their strange new surroundings  it was hard not to feel like guests on sufferance and next morning a sunday was wet  however under their waterproofs and umbrellas trudging along they felt once more as mary said like themselves as if they had escaped from their keepers  nobody on the way had the least idea who the two cloaked figures were and when they crept into the seat nearest the door they were summarily ejected by a fat redfaced man who growled audibly youve no business in my pew  however with the words beg your pardon they stepped out with a little amusement in their eyes when a spruce young woman sprang up from the opposite pew with a scandalised whisper  mr ruddiman its his lordship  allow me my lordyour own seat  and she marshalled them up to the choir followed closely by mr ruddiman ruddier than ever and butcher all over in a perfect agony of apology which lord northmoor in vain endeavoured to suppress or silence till when the guide had pointed to a handsome heavy carved seat with elaborate cushions he gave a final gasp of youll not remember it in the custom my lord and departed leaving his lordship almost equally scarlet with annoyance at the place and time of the demonstration though happily the clergyman had not yet appeared in his long and muchtumbled surplice  it was a case of a partial restoration of a church in the dawn of such doings when the horsebox was removed but the great family could not be routed out of the chancel so there were the seats where the choir ought to have sat beneath a very ugly east window bedecked with the morton arms  in the other division of the seat was a pale lady in black with a little girl lady adela morton no doubt and opposite were the servants and the school children sat crowded on the steps  it was not such a service as had been the custom of the hurminster churches and the singing such as it was depended on the thin shrill voices of the children assisted by lady adela and the mistress the sermon was dull and long and altogether there was something disheartening about the whole  lady adela had a gentle sweet countenance and a simple devout manner but it was disappointing that she did not attempt to address the newcomers though they passed her just outside the churchyard talking to an old man  lady kenton would surely have welcomed them     chapter xii the burthen of honours   a fearful affair to the new possessors of northmoor was the matter of morning calls  the first that befell them as in duty bound was that from the vicar  they were peaceably writing their letters in the library and hoping soon to go out to explore the park when mr woodman was announced and was found a lonely black speck in the big dreary drawingroom a very state room indeed which nobody had ever willingly inhabited  the vicar was accustomed to be overridden he was an elderly widower left solitary in his old age and of depressed spirits and manner  however frank had been used to intercourse with clergy though his relations with them seemed reversed and instead of being patronised he had to take the initiative or rather they touched each others cold shy limp hands and sat upright in their chairs and observed upon the appropriate topic of early frosts which really seemed to be affecting themselves  there was a little thaw when lord northmoor asked about the population larger alas than the congregation might have seemed to show and mary asked if there were much poverty and was answered that there was much suffering in the winter there was not much done for the poor except by lady adela  you must tell us how we can assist in any way  the poor man began to brighten  it will be a great comfort to have some interest in the welfare of the parish taken here my lord  the influence hitherto has not been fortunate  miss morton indeedlatterlybut poor thing if i may be allowed to say so she is flightyand uncertainno wonder  at that moment lady adela was ushered in and the vicar looked as if caught in talking treason while a fresh nip of frost descended on the party  not that the lady was by any means on stiff terms with the vicar whom indeed she daily consulted on parochial subjects and she had the gracious hereditary courtesy of high breeding but she always averred that this same drawingroom chilled her and she was fully persuaded that any advance towards familiarity would lead to something obnoxious on the part of the newcomers so that the proper relations between herself and them could only be preserved by a judicious entrenchment of courtesy still it was more the manner of the vicar than of herself that gave the impression of her being a formidable autocrat  after the frost had been again languidly discussed mr woodman faltered out his lordship was askingwas so good as to askhow to assist in the parish  lady adela knew how scarce money must be so she hesitated to mention subscriptions and only said thank youvery kind  is there any one i could read to ventured mary  have you been used to the kind of thing asked lady adela not unkindly but in a doubting tone  no i never could before but i do wish to try to do something  the earnest humility of the tone was touching the vicar and the autocrat looked at one another and the former suggested old swan  yes said lady adela old swan lives out at linghill which is not above half a mile from this house but too far off for me to visit constantly  i shall be very much obliged if you can undertake the cottages there  thank you said mary as heartily as if she were receiving a commission from the bishop of the diocese  did not miss morton mention something about a boys class said frank i have been accustomed to a sunday school  mr woodman betrayed as much surprise as if he had said he was accustomed to a coal mine and lady adela observed graciously most of them have gone into service this michaelmas but no doubt it will be a relief to mr woodman if you find time to undertake them  this was the gist of the first two morning calls and there were many more such periods of penance for the bride and bridegroom were not modern enough in their notions to sit up to await their visitors and thankful they were to those who would be at the expense of finding conversation though this was not always the case for much of the neighbourhood was of a description to be awed by the mere fact of a great house and to take the shyness of titled people for pride  those with whom they prospered best were a goodnatured merry old dowager duchess with whom they felt themselves in the altitude to which they were accustomed at hurminster a loudvoiced eager old squire who was bent on being lord northmoors guide and prompter in county business also an eager gushing lady the echoes of whose communications made frank remark after her departure we must beware of encouraging gossip about the former family  oh i wish i had the power of setting people down when they say what is undesirable like miss lang or lady adela sighed mary  try to think of them like your school girls he said  the returning of the calls was like continually pulling the string of a showerbath and glad were the sighs when people proved to be not at home but on the whole being entertained was not half so formidable as entertaining and a bride was not expected to do more than sit in her white silk beside the host  but the return parties were an incubus on their minds  only they were not to be till after christmas     chapter xiii the dower house   over the hearth of the drawingroom of the dower house in the sociable twilight that had descended on the afternoon teatable sat three ladiesfor lady adela and miss morton had just welcomed mrs bury who though she had her headquarters in london generally spent her time in visits to her married daughters or expeditions abroad  amice had just exhibited her doll elmiras last acquisition a little chest of drawers made of matchboxes and buttons that constance morton had taught her to make and then she had gone off to put the said elmira and her companions to bed after giving it as her grave opinion that lady northmoor was a great acquisition  do you think so said mrs bury after the laugh at the sedate expression  she is very kind to amice and i do not think she will do her any harm said lady adela  governessing was her metier added bertha so it is not likely  and how does it turn out  oh it might be a good deal worse  i see no reason for not living on here  and you birdie  no i couldnt  ive been burning to get away these seven years and as northmoor actually seems capable of taking my boys my last tie is gone  im only afraid hell bore them with too much sabbatarianism and temperance  he is just the cut of the model sabbathschool teacher only he vexes addies soul by dashes of the ritualist  well said mrs bury the excellent mr woodman is capable of improvement  but how said lady adela  narrow ritualism without knowledge or principle is a thing to be deprecated  is it without knowledge or principle  how should an attorneys clerk get either  but i understand you that they are worthy people and not obnoxious  worthy exclaimed bertha  yes worthy to their stiff backbones worthy to the point of utter dulness they havent got enough vulgarity even to drop their hs or be any way entertaining  i should like them ever so much better if they ate with their knives and drank out of their saucers but she cant even mispronounce a french word worse than most english people  no pretension even  oh no if there were one could get some fun out of it  i have heard of bearing honours meekly but they dont even do that they just let them hang on them like the stick and stock they are  if i were addie it would be the deadly liveliness that would drive me away  nay said adela one grows to be content with mere negations if they are nothing worse  i could be driven away or at least find it an effort to remain if lady northmoor were like her sisterinlaw  ah now thats just what would make it tolerable to me  i could get a rise or two out of that mrs morton  i did get her to be confidential and to tell me how much better the honours would have sat upon her dear husband  i believe she thinks that if he were alive he would have shared them like the spartan kings  she wishes that her brother lord northmoor you should hear the tone were more worldly and she begs me to impress on him the duty of doing everything for her dear herbert who in the nature of things must be the heir to the peerage  i am sure i hope not said lady adela  he is an insufferable boy the people about the place cant endure him  he is quite insolent  the animal man when in certain stages of development has a peculiar tendency to be unpleasant observed bertha philosophically  to my mind master herbert is the most promising of the specimens  birdie  he is much worse than his uncle  promising i said not performing  whatever promise there may have been in northmoor must have been nipped upon the top of a high stool but if he has sense enough to put that boy into good hands he may come to something  i like him enough myself to feel half inclined to do what i can towards licking him into shape for the honour of the family  it is that girl ida that riles me most  yes said lady adela she behaved fairly well in company but i saw her tittering and whispering with emily trotman in a tone that i thought very bad for emily  shes spoilt her mother worships her said bertha  i had a pleasing confidence or two about how she is already admired or as mrs morton calls it how the gentlemen are after her but now she shall not put up with anything but a real gentleman and of course her uncle will do something handsome for her  poor man  i wish him joy  has he more belongings  providentially no  we have the honour of standing nearest to him and she seems to have none at all unless they should be attracted by the scent  that is not likely said lady adela she was a clergy orphan and never heard of any relations  then you really know no harm of them in these four or five months said mrs bury  no except having these relations said adela  except being just sensible enough not to afford even the pleasure of laughing at them said bertha  nay just worthy enoughshe said it spitefullynot even to give the relief of a good grumble  well i think you may be thankful  exactly what one doesnt want to be said bertha  i like sensations now letitia is going to come down with a prediction that they are to become the blessings of our lives so i am off  and as the door closed on her lady adela sighed and mrs bury said  poor birdie is she always in that tone  yes said lady adela there seems to be always a bitter spot in her heart  i am glad she should try to work it out  i suppose living here with her father tended to brooding  yet she has always done a good deal  not up to her powers  lord northmoor never ceased to think her a mere girl and obstructed her a good deal besides all his interest being in horses she never could get rid of the subject and wounds were continually coming back on uson her  on you as well poor addie  he did not understand  besides to me these things were not the raw scene they were to her  it has been a very sad time for her  you see there is not much natural softness in her and she was driven into roughness and impatience when he worried her over racing details and other things  and then she was hurt at his preferring to have me with him  it has been very good and generous in her not to have been jealous of me  i think she was glad he could find comfort in you  and you have never heard of captain alder  never  in justice and for the sake of dear arthurs wishes i should be glad to explain but i wonder whether as she is now it would be well that they should meet  if it is so ordained i suppose they will  whats that  it was lord and lady northmoor formally announced and as formally introduced to mrs bury  they had come the lady said when they were seated with a message from old swan to ask for a bit of my ladys plaster for his back to ease his rheumatism at night  his daughter was only just come in from work so they had ventured to bring the message  is any one coming for it  i said we would bring it back replied mary if you would kindly let us have it  why it is a mile out of your way  it is moonlight and we do so enjoy a walk together she answered  well adela said mrs bury when they were gone with the roll of plaster i agree that they might be worseand by a great deal  did he speak all the time  yes once  but there are worse faults than silence and she seems a bonny little woman  honeymooning stillthat moonlight walk too  i can fancy that it is a treat to escape from mrs morton  she is depths below them in refinement  on the whole i think you may be thankful adela  i hope i am  i believe you would soon be intimate with them but then you always could get on with all sorts of people and i have a shrinking from getting under the surfaceif i could  and indeed further intercourse though not without shocks and casualties made mary northmoor wish that letitia bury had been the permanent inhabitant above all when she undertook to come and give her counsel and support for that first tremendous undertakingthe dinnerparty  lady kenton was equally helpful at their next and sir edward gave much good advice to his lordship as to not letting himself be made the tool of the loudvoiced squire who was anxious to be his guide philosopher and friend in county businessadvice that made franks heart sink for thus far he felt only capable of sitting still and listening     chapter xiv westhaven versions of honours   thank you a bit of partridge mr rollstone if you please  excuse me mrs grover  this is a grouse from lord northmoors own moors i presume replied mr rollstone to the tune of a peal of laughter from herbert and exclamationnot know a grousefor which ida frowned at him  yes indeed said his mother we had so much game up at my brothers lord northmoors that i shall quite miss it now i am come away  flimsy sort of grub growled an old skipper  only fit for this sort of a teanot to make a real meal on fit for a man  the young folk laughed  captain purdy was only invited as a messmate of mrs mortons father  youll excuse this being only a tea went on mrs morton  i hope to have a dinner in something more of style if ever i return here but i could not attempt it with my present establishment after what we have got accustomed to  why we never sat down to dinner without two menservants  only two said mr rollstone  i have never been without three men under me and i always had two to wait even when the lady dined alone  mrs grover who had been impressed for a moment took courage to say  i dont think so much of your grouse mrs morton  its tasty and igh  high game goes with high families wickedly murmured herbert causing much tittering at his corner of the table and this grew almost convulsive while another matron of the party observed  mrs macdonald mr holts sister in scotland once sent us some and really mrs morton if you boil them down they are almost as good as a patridge  oh really now mrs holt  i hope you didnt tell mrs macdonald so said mrs morton  it is a real valuable article such as my brother lord northmoor would only send to us and one or two old friends that he wishes to compliment at hurminster  but one must be used to high society to know how such things should be relished  are lord northmoors moors extensive asked mr rollstone  theres about four or five miles of them responded herbert and these grouse are awfully shy  ah the earl of blackwing owns full twenty miles of heather said the exbutler  barren stuff growled the skipper breeding nothing worth setting ones teeth into  there are seven farms besides put in mrs morton  my brother is going to have an auditday next week  you should have seen the earls audits said mr rollstone fiveandtwenty substantial tenantfarmers besides artisans and all the family plate on the sideboard  ah you should see the northmoor plate said mrs morton  there are racing cups four of themnot that any one could drink out of them for they are just centrepieces for the table  theres a man in armour galloping off headlong with a girl behind him  who did your uncle say it was conny  the templar and rowena mamma said constance  yes that was the bestall frosted  i liked that better than the one where the girl with no clothes to speak of was running like mad after a golden ball  they said that was an heirloom worth five hundred  lord burnsides yachting cups are valued at five thousand said mr rollstone  i should know for i had the care of them and it was a responsibility as weighed on my mind  so whatever mrs morton described as to the dignities and splendours of northmoor mr rollstone continued to cap with more magnificent experiences so that though he never pretended to view himself in the light of a participator in the grandeur he described he continued quite unintentionally so to depreciate the glories of northmoor that mrs morton began to recollect how far above him her sphere had become and to decide against his future admission to her parties  the young ladies as soon as tea was over retired into corners in pairs having on their side much to communicate  rose rollstone was at home for a holiday after having begun to work at an establishment for art and ecclesiastical needlework and it was no small treat to her and constance to meet and compare their new experiences  rose always well brought up by her father was in a situation carefully trained by a lady head and watched over by those who deepened and cultivated her religious feeling and constance had to tell of the new facilities of education offered to them  ida was too delicate for school their mother said and was only to have music lessons at brighton or in london whenever the present house could be parted with but herbert had already begun to work with a tutor for the army and constance was to go to the high school at colbeam and spend her sundays at northmoor where a prettilyfurnished room was set apart for her  she described it with so much zest that rose was seized with a sort of alarm  you will live there like all the lords and ladies that papa talks of and grow worldly and fashionable  oh no no cried constance and there was a girlish kissing match but rose seemed to think worldliness inevitable  the earl my papa lived with used to bet and gamble and come home dreadfully late at night and so did my lady and her daughters and their poor maid had to sit up for them till four oclock in the morning  then their bills  they never told his lordship but they sold their diamonds and wore paste  his lordship did not know but their maid did and told papa  constance opened her eyes and declared that uncle frank and aunt mary never could do such things  moreover she averred that lady adela was always going about among the cottages and that miss morton had not a bit of pride and was going to live in london to teach the dustpickers and matchbox makers  indeed i dont think they are half as worldly in themselves she said as ida is growing with thinking about them  ah dont you remember the sermon that said worldliness didnt depend on what one has but what one is  talking of nothing better than sermons said herbert coming on them have you caught it of the governor con  i believe he thinks of nothing but sermons  and constance exclaimed i am sure he doesnt preach  oh no nothing comes out of his mouth that he can help trust him for that  then how do you know  by the stodgy look of him  he would be the awfullest of prosers if he had the gift of the gab  you are an ungrateful boy said rose  i am sure he must be very kind to you  cant help it said herbert  the old fellow would be well enough if he had any go in him  i am sure he took you out hunting exclaimed constance indignantly the day they took us to the meet  and he leapt all the ditches when you  he broke in well what was i to do when ive never had the chance to learn to sit a horse  youll see next winter  did you hurt yourself asked rose rather mischievously  to which herbert turned a deaf ear and began to expatiate upon the game of northmoor till other sounds led him away to fall upon the other teteatete between ida and sibyl grover  in idas mind the honours of northmoor were dearly purchased by the dulness and strictness of the life there  my uncle was as cross as two sticks if ever herbert or i were too late for prayers and he said it was nonsense of herbert to say that kneeling at church spoilt his trouserskneeling just like a school child  it made me so faint  and it looks so  i tried because lady adela and miss bertha and all do said ida and they looked at me  but it made me faint as i knew it would and she put her head on one side  poor dear  so they were so very religious  did that spoil it all  well we had pretty things off the christmastree and we lived quite as ladies and drove out in the carriage  no parties nor dances  or were they too religious  ma says it is their meanness but my aunt lady northmoor did say perhaps it would be livelier another year and then we should have had some dancing and deportment lessons  i up and told her i could dance fast enough now but she said it would not be becoming or right to lady adelas and miss mortons feelings  do they live there  not in the house  lady adela has a cottage of her own and miss morton stops with her  lady adela is as high and standoffish as the monument said ida pausing for a comparison  high and haughty said sibyl impressed  and the other lady  oh she is much more goodnatured  we call her bertha at least she told us that we might call her anything but that horrid cousin bertha as she said  but shes old thirtysix years old and not a bit pretty and she says such odd things one doesnt know what to do  she thought i made myself useful and could wash and iron said ida as if this were the greatest possible insult in which sibyl acquiesced  and she thought i should know the factory girls just the hands added ida greatly disgusted  as if i should  but ma says low tastes are in the family for she is going to live in london and go and sit with the shopgirls in the evening  still i like her better than lady adela who keeps herself to herself  mamma says it is pride and spite that her plain little sickly girl hasnt come to be my lady  what doesnt she speak to them said sibyl quite excited  oh yes she calls and shakes hands and all that but one never seems to get on with her  and emily trotman shes the doctors daughter such a darling told me such a historyso interesting  tell me ida theres a dear  she says they were all frightfully dissipated ida said it quite with a relishthe old lord and mr morton lady adelas husband you know and miss berthaalways racing and hunting and gambling and in debt then there came a captain alder who was ever so much in love with miss bertha but most awfully in debt to her brother and very passionate besides  so he took him out in his dogcart with a fiery horse that was sure to run away  who did  captain alder took mr morton though they begged and prayed him not and the horse ran away and mr morton was thrown out and killed  oh with extreme zest  on purpose  miss bertha was sure it was so that she might have all the fortune and so she told him and flung the betrothal ring in his face and he went right off and never has been heard of since  well that is interesting  do you think he shot himself  no he was too mean  most likely he married a hideous millionaire but the mortons were always dreadful and did all sorts of wicked things  i declare its as good as any talelike the sweet one in the young ladies friend nowthe pride of pedro  have you seen it  no indeed uncle and aunt only have great old stupid books  they wanted me to read those horrid tiresome things of scotts and dickenss too who is as old as the hills  why they could not think of anything better to do on their wedding tour but to go to all the places in the waverley novels  why they are as bad as history  jim brought one home once and pa wanted me to read it but i could not get on with itall about a stupid king of france  im sure if i married a lord id make him do something nicer  i mean ma to do something more jolly said ida when we get more money and i am come out  i mean to go to balls and tennis parties and i shall be sure to marry a lord at some of them  and you will take me cried sibyl  only you must be very genteel said ida  try to learn style do dear  it must be learnt young you know  why theres aunt mary when she has got ever so beautiful a satin dress on she does not look half so stylish as lady adela walking up the road in an old felt hat and a shepherdsplaid waterproof  but they all do dress so as i should be ashamed  only think what a scrape that got herbert into  he was coming back one saturday from his tutors and he saw walking up to the house an awfully seedy figure of fun in an old old ulster and such a hat as you never saw with a knapsack on her back and a portfolio under her arm so of course he thought it was a tramp with something to sell and he holloaed out youd better come out of this  we want none of your sort  she just turned round and laughed which put him in such a rage that though she began to speak he didnt wait but told her to have done with her sauce or he would call the keepers  he thinks she said youd better and i believe he did move his stick a little  ida have done with that cried herberts voice close to her  hold your tongue or ill and his hand was near her hair  oh dont dont herbert  let me hear cried sibyl  thats the way girls go on said herbert fiercely with their nonsense and stuff  but who  if you go on ida he was clutching her braid  sibyl sprang to the defence and there was a general struggle and romp interspersed with screams which was summarily stopped by mr rollstone explaining severely if you think that is the deportment of the aristocracy miss ida you are much mistaken  bother the aristocracy broke out herbert  calm was restored by a summons to a round game but sibyls curiosity was of course insatiable and as she sat next to herbert she employed various blandishments and sympathetic whispers and after a great deal of fuss and what will you give me if i tell to extract the end of the story did he call the keeper  oh yes the old beast  his names best but it ought to be beast  he guffawed ever so much worse than she did  well but who was it  and after he had tried to make her guess and teased his fill he owned mrs burya sort of cousin staying with lady adela  she isnt half a bad old party but she makes a guy of herself and goes about sketching and painting like a blessed old drawingmaster  a lady and not a young lady  not as old asas methuselah or old rolypoly there but i believe shes a grandmother  if shed been a boy we should have been cut out of it oh yes shes a ladya born morton and when it was over she was very jolly about itno harm donebears no malice only ida makes such an absurd work about every little trifle     chapter xv the pied rook   constance morton was leaning on the rail that divided the gardens at northmoor from the park which was still rough and heathery  of all the morton family perhaps she was the one who had the most profited by the three years that had passed since her uncles accession to the title she had been at a good boardinghouse attending the high school in colbeam and spending saturday and sunday at northmoor  it had been a happy life she liked her studies made friends with her companions and enjoyed to the very utmost all that northmoor gave her in country beauty and liberty in the kindness of her uncle and aunt and in the religious training that they were able to give her satisfying longings of her soul so that she loved them with all her heart and felt northmoor her true home  the holiday time at westhaven was always a trial  mrs morton had tried brighton and london but neither place agreed with ida and she found herself a much greater personage in her own world than elsewhere and besides could not always find tenants for her house  so there she lived at her ease called by many of her neighbours the honourable mrs morton and finding listeners to her alternate accounts of the grandeur of northmoor and murmurs at the meanness of its master in only allowing her 300 pounds a year besides educating her children and clothing two of them  ida considered herself to be quite sufficiently educated and so she was for the society in which she was or thought herself a star chiefly consisting of the families of the shipowners coalowners and the like she was pretty with a hectic prettiness of bright eyes and cheeks and had a following of the young men of the place and though she always tried to enforce that to receive attentions from a smart young mate a clerk in an office a doctors assistant or the like was a great condescension on her part she enjoyed them all the more  learning new songs for their benefit together with extensive novel reading were her chief employments and it was the greater pity because her health was not strong  she dreamt much in a languid way and had imagination enough to work these tales into her visions of life  her temper suffered and constance found the atmosphere less and less congenial as she grew older and more accustomed to a different life  she was a gentle ladylike girl with her brown hair still on her shoulders as on that summer saturday she stood looking along the path but with her ears listening for sounds from the house and an anxious expression on her young face  presently she started at the sound of a gun which caused a mighty cawing among the rooks in the trees on the slopes and a circling of the black creatures in the sky  a whistling then was heard and her brother herbert came in sight in a few minutes more a fine tall youth of sixteen with quite the air and carriage of a gentleman  he had a gun on his shoulder and carried by the claws the body of a rook with white wings  oh herbert cried constance in dismay did you shoot that by mistake  no stanhope would not believe there was such a crittur and betted half a sov that it was a cram  but how could you  our uncle and aunt thought so much of that poor dear whitewing and best was told to take care of it  they will be so vexed  nonsense  hell come to more honour stuffed than ever he would flying and howling up there  when ive shown him to stanhope i shall make that old fellow at colbeam come down handsomely for him  what a row those birds kick up  ill send my other barrel among them  oh no dont bertie  uncle frank has one of his dreadful headaches today  seems to me he is made of headaches  yes aunt mary is very anxious  oh i would have done anything that you had not vexed them now and killed this poor dear pretty thing said constance stroking down the glossy feathers of the still warm victim and laying them against her cheek almost tearfully  well you are not going to tell them  perhaps they wont miss it  i would not have done it if stanhope had not been such a beast said herbert  i shall not tell them of course said constance but if i were you i should not be happy till they knew  oh thats only girls way  i cant have the old stick upset now for im in horrid want of tin  oh bertie was it true then  what you dont mean that they have heard  that you were out at those colbeam races  to be sure i was with stanhope and hailes and a lot more  we all went except the little kids and sisson who is in regular training for as great a muff as the governor there  who told him  mr hailes who is very much concerned about his grandson  old sneak i wonder how he ferreted it out  is there no end of a jaw coming con  i dont know  uncle frank seemed quite knocked down and wretched over it  he said something about feeling hopeless and the old blood coming out to be your ruin  of course its the old blood  how did he miss it and turn into the intolerable old dry fogey that he is without a notion of anything fit for a gentleman  now herbert  oh yes  you should just hear what the other fellows say about him their mothers and their sisters say there is not so stupid a place in the county he hasnt a word to say for himself and they would just as soon go to portland at once as to a party here  then it is a great shame  i am sure aunt mary works hard to make it pleasant for them  oh yes good soul she does she cant help it but when people have stuck in the mud all their lives they cant know any better and it is abominably hard on a fellow who does to be under a man who has been an office cad all his life and doesnt know what is expected of a gentleman  screwing us all up like beggars  herbert for shame for shame  as if he was obliged to do anything at all for us  oh isnt he  a pretty row my mother would kick up about his ears if he did not when i must come after him at this place too  i think you are very ungrateful said constance with tears when they are so good to us  oh they are as kind as they know how but they dont know  thats the thing or old frank would be ashamed to give me such a dirty little allowance  he has only himself to thank if i have to come upon him for more  found out about the blackbird colt has he  what a bore  and tin i must have out of him by hook or by crook if he cuts up ever so rough i must send off this bird first by the post to confute stanhope and make him eat dirt and then see whats to be done  indeed bertie i dont think you will see him tonight  his head is dreadful and aunt mary has sent for mr trotman  whew  you have not got anything worth having i suppose conny  only fifteen shillings  i meant it for  but you shall have it dear bertie if it will only save worrying them  fifteen bob  fifteen farthings you might as well offer  no no you soft little monkey i must see what is to be made of him or her ladyship one or the other today or tomorrow  if they know i have been at the place it is half the battle  consequence was  provided they dont smell out this unlucky piebald  i wish stanhope hadnt been such a beast  at that moment too late to avoid her lady northmoor pale and anxious came up the path and was upon them  your uncle is asleep she began but then starting oh conny  poor whitewing  did you find him  constance hung her head and did not speak  then her aunt saw how it was  herbert you must have shot him by mistake your uncle will be so grieved  herbert was not base enough to let this pass  he muttered a fellow would not take my word for it so i had to show him  she looked at him very sadly  oh herbert i did not think you would have made that a reason for vexing your uncle  the boy was more than half sorry under those gentle eyes  he muttered something about didnt think he would care  she shook her head instead of saying that she knew this was not the truth and unable to bear the sting he flung away from her carrying the rook with him and kicking the pebbles trying to be angry instead of sorry  and just then came a summons to lady northmoor to see the doctor  yet herbert morton was a better boy than he seemed at that moment his errors were chiefly caused by understanding noblesse oblige in a different way from his uncle  moreover it would have been better for him if his tutor had lived beyond the neighbourhood of northmoor where he heard losing nothing in the telling the remarks of the other pupils mothers upon his uncle and aunt more especially as it was not generally the highest order of boy that was to be found there  if he had heard what the fathers said he would have learnt that though shy and devoid of small talk and of the art of putting guests together lord northmoor was trusted and esteemed  he might perhaps be too easily talked down he could not argue and often gave way to the noisy squire but he was certain in due time to see the rights of a question and he attended thoroughly to the numerous tasks of an active and useful county man taking all the drudgery that others shirked  while if by severe stress he were driven to public speaking he could acquit himself far better than any one had expected  the bishop and the chairman of the quarter sessions alike set him down on their committees not only for his rank but for his industry and steadiness of work  nor had any one breathed any imputation upon the possession of what used to be known as gentility before that good word was degraded to mean something more like what mrs morton aspired to  lord and lady northmoor might not be lively nor a great accession to society but the anticipations of either amusement or annoyance from vulgarity or arrogance were entirely disappointed  no one could call them underbred or anything but an ingrain gentleman and lady while there were a few who could uphold lady northmoor as thoroughly kind sweet sensible and helpful to her utmost in all that was good  all this however was achieved not only unconsciously but with severe labour by a man whose powers could only act slowly and who was not to the manner born  conscientiousness is a costly thing and straffords watchword is not to be adopted for nothing  the balance of duties the perplexities of managing an impoverished and involved estate the disappointment of being unable to carry out the responsibilities of a landlord towards neglected cottagers the incapacity of doing what would have been desirable for the church and the worry and harass that his sisterinlaw did not spare all told as his office work had never done and in spite of quiet happy hours with his mary and her devoted and efficient aid whenever it was possible a course of disabling neuralgic headaches had set in and a general derangement of health which had become alarming and called for immediate remedy     chapter xvi what is rest   rest there is nothing for it but immediate rest and warm baths said lady northmoor to constance who was waiting anxiously for the doctors verdict some hours later  it is only being overdoneno my dear there is nothing really to fear if we can only keep business and letters out of his way for a few weeks my dear child  for constance who had been dreadfully frightened by the sight of the physicians carriage which seemed to her inexperienced eyes the omen of something terrible fairly burst into tears of relief  oh i am so glad she said as caresses passedwhich might have been those of mother and daughter for heartfelt sympathy and affection  you will miss your saturdays and sundays my dear continued the aunt for we shall have to go abroad so as to be quite out of the way of everything  never mind that dear aunt if only uncle frank is better  will it be long  i cannot tell  he says six weeks dr smith says three months  it is to be bracing airswitzerland most likely  oh how delightful  how you will enjoy it  it has always been a dream and it is strange now to feel so downhearted about it said her aunt smiling  uncle frank is sure to be better there said constance  only think of the snowy mountains      mont blanc is the monarch of mountains        they crownd him long ago     on a throne of rocks in a robe of clouds        with a diadem of snow  and the girls eyes brightened with an enthusiasm that the elder woman felt for a moment nor did either of them feel the verse hackneyed  ah i wish we could take you my dear said lady northmoor then do you know where herbert is  no said constance  oh aunt i am so sorry  i dont think he would have done it if the other boys had not teased him  perhaps not but indeed i am grieved not only on the poor rooks account but that he should have the heart to vex your uncle just now however perhaps he did not understand how ill he has been all this week and i am afraid that young stanhope is not a good companion for him  i do not think he is said constance it seems to me that stanhope leads him into that betting and makes him think it does not signify whether he passes or not and so he does not take pains  herbert was not to be found either then or at dinnertime  it turned out that he had taken from the stables the horse he was allowed to ride and had gone over to display his victim to stanhope and then on to the birdstuffer had got a meal no one wished to know how only returning in time to stump upstairs to bed  he thus avoided an interview with his uncle over the rook unaware that his aunt had left him the grace of confession being in hopes that unless he did speak of his own accord the vexatious knowledge might be spared to one who did not need an additional annoyance just then  lord northmoor was not however to be spared  he was much better the next day sunday a good deal exhilarated by the doctors opinion and though concerned at having to break off his work ready to enjoy what he was told was absolutely essential  the headkeeper had no notion of sparing him  mr best regarded him with a kind of patronising toleration as an unfortunate gentleman who had the illhap never to have acquired a taste for sport and was unable to do justice to his preserves but towards mr morton there was a very active dislike  the awkward introduction might have rankled even had herbert been wise enough to follow miss mortons advice but his nature was overbearing and his selfopinion was fostered by his mother and ida while he was edged on by his fellowpupils to consider best a mere old woman who could only be tolerated by the ignorance of a regular stick  with the underkeeper herbert fraternised enough to make him insubordinate and the days when lord northmoor gave permission for shooting or for inviting his companions for a share in the sport were days of mutual offence when the balance of provoking sneer and angry insult would be difficult to cast though the keeper was the most forbearing since he never complained of personal illbehaviour to himself whereas herberts demonstrations to his uncle of that old fool were the louder and more numerous because they never produced the slightest effect  however best felt aggrieved in the matter of the rook which had been put under his special protection and being moreover something of a naturalist he had cherished the hope of a special northmoor breed of pied rooks  so while on the way from church lady adela was detaining lady northmoor with inquiries as to dr smith best waylaid his master with your lordship gave me orders about that there rook with white wings as was not to be mislested  has anything happened to it said frank wearily  well my lord i sees mr morton going up to the rookery with his gun and i says to him that it werent time for shooting of the branchers and the white rook werent to be touched by nobody and he swears at me for a meddling old leggings and uses other language as ill not repeat to your lordship and by and by i hears his gun and i sees him apicking up of the rook that her ladyship set such store by so it is due to myself my lord to let you know as i were not to blame  certainly not best was the reply  i am exceedingly displeased that my nephew has behaved so ill to you and i shall let him know it  his lordship will give it to him hot and strong the young upstart muttered best to himself with great satisfaction as he watched the languid pace quicken to overtake the boy who had gone on with his sister  perhaps the irritability of illness had some effect upon the ordinary gentleness of lord northmoors temper and besides he was exceedingly annoyed at such ungrateful slaughter of what was known to be a favourite of his wife so when he came upon herbert sauntering down to the stables he accosted him sharply with what is this i hear herbert  i could not have believed that you would have deliberately killed the creature that you knew to be a special delight to your aunt  herbert had reached the state of mind when a third if not a fourth reproach on the same subject on which his conscience was already uneasy was simply exasperating and without the poor excuse he had offered his aunt and sister he burst out that it was very hard that such a beastly row should be made about a fellow knocking down mere trumpery vermin  speak properly herbert or hold your tongue said his uncle  i am extremely displeased at finding that you do not know how to conduct yourself to my servants and have presumed to act in this lawless heartless manner in defiance of what you knew to be your aunts wishes and my orders and that you replied to bests remonstrance with insolence  thats a good one  insolent to an old fool of a keeper muttered herbert sullenly  insolence is shameful towards any man returned his uncle  and from a foolish headstrong boy to a faithful old servant it is particularly unbecoming  however bad as this is it is not all that i have to speak of  then herbert recollected with dismay how much his misdemeanour would tell against his pardon for the more important act of disobedience and he took refuge in a sullen endeavour at indifference while his uncle thoroughly roused spoke of the sins of disobedience and the dangers of betting  perhaps the only part of the lecture that he really heard was remember it was these habits in those who came before us that have been so great a hindrance in life to both you and me and made you my poor boy so utterly mistaken as to what becomes your position  how much have you thrown away  herbert looked up and muttered the amounttwelve pounds and some shillings  very well i will not have it owed  i shall pay it deducting two pounds from your allowance each term till it is made up  give me the address or addresses  at this herbert writhed and remonstrated but his uncle was inexorable  the fellows will be at me he said as he gave stanhopes name  you will see no more of stanhope after this week  i have arranged to send you to a tutor in hertfordshire who i hope will make you work and where i trust you will find companions who will give you a better idea of what becomes a gentleman  in point of fact this had been arranged for some time past though by the desire of herberts present tutor it had not been made known to the young people so that coming thus there was a sound of punishment in it to herbert  the interview ended there  the annoyance enhanced in his mind by having come on a sunday brought on another attack of headache but late in the evening he sent for herbert who always had to go very early on the monday  it was to ask him whether he would not prefer the payment being made to stanhope and the other pupil after he had left them  herberts scowl passed off  it was a great relief  he said they were prepared to wait till he had his allowance and the act of consideration softened him as did also the manifest look of suffering and illness as his uncle lay on the couch hardly able to speak and yet exerting himself thus to spare the lad  thank you sir actually herbert said and then with a gulp i am sorry about that birdi wish id never told them but it was stanhope who drove me to it not believing  i thought it was not your better mind said his uncle holding out his hand  i should like you to make me a promise herbert not to make a bet while i am away  i should go with an easier mind  i will uncle said herbert heartily reflecting perhaps it must be owned on the fewer opportunities in that line at westhaven except at the regatta but really resolving as the only salve to his conscience and there was that in his face and the clasp of his hand that gave his uncle a sense of comfort and hope     chapter xvii on the surface   lady adela though small and pale was one of the healthy women who seem unable to believe in any ailments short of a raging fever and when she heard of neuralgia decided that it was all a matter of imagination and a sort of excuse for breaking off the numerous occupations in which she felt his value but only as she would have acknowledged that of a good schoolmaster  their friendly intercourse had never ripened into intimacy and was still punctiliously courteous each tacitly dreaded the influence of the other on the vicarinchurch matters and every visit of the westhaven family confirmed lady adelas belief that it was undesirable to go below the surface  bertha who came down for a day or two to assist at the breakingup demonstration of the high school at colbeam was as ever much more cordial  the chief drawbacks with her were that cynical tone which made it always doubtful whether she were making game of her hearers and the philanthropy not greatly tinged with religion so as to confuse oldfashioned minds  she used to bring down strange accounts of her startling adventures in the slums and relate them in a rattling style interluded with slang being evidently delighted to shock and puzzle her hearers but still she was always goodnatured in deed if not in word and lord northmoor was very grateful for her offer of hospitality to herbert who was coming to london for his preliminary examination  she had come up to call determined to be of use to them and she had experience enough of travelling to be very helpful  finding that they shuddered at the notion of fashionable german baden she exclaimed  ill hit you off  theres that place in the austrian tyrol that lettice bury frequentsa regular primitive place with a nameoh what is it addie like rats and mice  ratzes said adela  yes  the tourists have not molested it yet and only natives bathe there so she goes every year to renovate herself and sketch and comes back furbished up like an old snake with lots of drawings of impossible peaks like titians backgrounds  well write and tell her to make ready for the head of her house  oh but began frank looking to his wife  would it not be intruding said mary  she will be enchanted  she always likes to have anything to do for anybody and she says the scenery is just a marvel  you care for that you are so deliciously fresh beauties arent a bore to you  we are glad of the excuse said frank gravely  you look ill enough to be an excuse for anything and mary too  how about a maid  is harte going  no said mary she says that foreign food made her so ill once before that she cannot attempt going again  i meant to do without  that would never do cried bertha  you have quite enough on your hands with northmoor and the luggage and the languages  is not an english maid apt to be another trouble said mary  i do not suppose my french is good but i have had to talk it constantly and i know some german if that will serve in the tyrol  ill reconcile it to your consciences said bertha triumphantly  it will be a real charity  theres a bonny little swiss girl whom some reckless people brought home and then turned adrift  it will be a real kindness to help her home and you shall pick her up when you come up to me on your way and see my child  oh didnt i tell you  we had a housemaid once who was demented enough to marry a scamp of a stoker on one of the thames steamers  he deserted her and i found her living or rather dying in an awful place at rotherhithe surrounded by tipsy women raging in opposite corners  i got her into a decent room but too late to save her lifeand a good thing too so i solaced her last moments with a promise to look after her child such a jolly little mortal in spite of her nameboadicea ethelind davidina jones  she is two years old and quite deliciousthe darling of all the house  i hope you will have no trouble with the father said frank  i trust he has gone to his own locker or if not he is only too glad to be rid of her  i can tackle him said bertha confidently  the child is really a little duck  she spoke as if the little one filled an empty space in her heart and even though there might be trouble in store it was impossible not to be glad of her present gladness and her invitation was willingly accepted moreover her recommendations were generally trustworthy and mary only hesitated because she said  i thought if i could do without a maid we might take constance  she is doing so very well and likely to pass so well in her examinations that it would be very nice to give her this pleasure  good little girl  so it would  i should like nothing better but i am afraid that if you took her without a maid emma would misunderstand it and say you wanted to save the expense  would it make much difference  not more than we could bear now that we are in for it but i fear it would excite jealousies  is that worse than leaving the poor child to westhaven society all the holidays  perhaps not and conny is old enough now to be more injured by it than when she was younger  you know i have always hoped to make her like a child of our own when her school education is finished  frank smiled for he was likewise very fond of little constance  there was a public distribution of prizes at which all the grandees of the neighbourhood were expected to assist and it was some consolation to the northmoors for the dowager duchess being absent that the pleasure of taking the prize from her uncle would be all the greaterif  the whole party wentlady adela miss morton and alland were installed in chairs of state on the platform with the bright array of books before themthe headmistress telling lady northmoor beforehand that her niece would have her full share of honours  no one could be a better or more diligent girl  it quite nerved lord northmoor when he looked forth upon the sea of waving tresses of all shades of brown while his wife watched in nervousness both as to how he would acquit himself and how the exertion would affect him and bertha as usual was anxious for the credit of the name  he did what was needed  nobody wanted anything but the sensible commonplace kindly spoken about the advantages of good opportunities the conscientiousness of doing ones best  and after all the inferiority of mere attainments in themselves to the discipline and dutifulness of responding to trainingit was slowly but not stammeringly spoken and bertha did not feel critical or ashamed but squeezed marys hand and said just the right thing  one by one the girls were summoned for their prizes the little ones first  lord northmoor had not the gift of inventing a pretty speech for each he could do no more than smile as he presented the book and read its name but the smile was a very decided one when in the class next to the highest three out of the seven prizes were awarded to constance elizabeth morton and it might be a question which had the redder cheeks the uncle or the niece as he handed them to her  it was one of the few happinesses that he had derived from his brothers family  after such achievements on constances part it was impossible to withholdas they drove back to northmoorthe proposal to take her with them and the effect was magical  constance opened her eyes bounded up as if she were going to fly out of the carriage and then launched herself first on her uncle then on her aunt for an ecstatic kiss  take care take care we shall have the servants thinking you a little lunatic  i am almost  oh i am so glad  to be with you and aunt mary all the holidays  that would be enough  but to go and see all the places she added somehow perceiving that the desire to escape from home was at least ought not to be approved of and yet there was some exultation when she hazarded a supposition that there was no time to go home     chapter xviii desdichado   homethat is to say westhavenwas in some commotion when herbert came back and grimly growled out his intelligence as to his own personal affairs  mrs morton had been already apprized in one of lord northmoors wellconsidered letters of his intentions of removing his nephew to a tutor more calculated to prepare for the army and she had accepted this as promotion such as was his due  however when the pride of her heart the tall gentlemanly son made his appearance in a savage mood her feelings were all on the other side and those of ida exaggerated hers  so im to go to some disgusting hole where they grind the fellows no end was herberts account of the matter  but surely with your connection theres no need for grinding said his mother  herbert laughed much you know about it  nobody cares a rap for connections nowadays even if old frank were a connection to do a man any good  but youll not go and study hard and hurt yourself my dear said his mother though herberts looks by no means suggested any such danger while ida added it is not as if he had nothing else to look to you know  he cant keep you out of the peerage  cant he then  why he can and will too for thirty or forty years more at least  i thought his health was failing said ida putting into words a hope her mother had a little too much sense of propriety to utter  bosh its only neuralgia just because he is such a stick he cant take things easy and lark about and do every ones workhe hasnt the least notion what a gentleman ought to do  it is bred in the bone said his mother he always was a shabby poor creature  i always said he would not know how to spend his money  he is a regular screw responded herbert  what do you think now  he was in no end of a rage with me just because i went with some of the other fellows to the colbeam races and one cant help a bet or two you know  so i lost twelve pound or so and what must he do but stop it out of my allowance two pound at a time  there was a regular outcry at this and mrs morton declared her poor dear boy should not suffer but she would make it up to him and herbert added that it had been unlucky half of it was that they were riled with him first because he had shot a ridiculous rook with white wings that my lady made no end of a fuss about  ah then it is her spite said ida  shes a sly cat with all her meek ways  herbert was not displeased with this evenings sympathy as he lay outspread on the sofa with the admiring and pitying eyes of his mother and sister upon him but he soon began to feelwhen he had had his grumble out and could take his swing at homethat there could be too much of it  it was all very well to ease his own mind by complaining but when he heard of ida announcing that he had been shamefully treated all out of spite for killing a white rook his sense of justice made him declare that the notion was nothing but girls folly such as no person with a grain of sense could believe  the more his mother and her friends persisted in treating him as an illused individual the victim of his uncles avarice and his aunts spite the more his better nature revolted and acknowledged inwardly and sometimes outwardly the kindness and justice he had met with  it was really provoking that any attempt to defend them or explain the facts were only treated as proofs of his own generous feeling  idas partisanship really did him more good than half a dozen lectures would have done and he steadily adhered to his promise not to bet though on the regatta day ida and her friend sibyl derided him for not choosing to risk even a pair of gloves and while one pitied him the other declared that he was growing a skinflint like his uncle  he talked and laughed noisily enough to idas friends but he had seen enough at northmoor to feel the difference and he told his sister that there was not a lady amongst the whole kit of them except rose rollstone who was coming down for her holiday  rose cried ida tossing her head  a servants daughter and a hand at a shop  what will you say next i wonder  lady is as lady acts said herbert making a new proverb whereat his mother and sister in chorus rebuked him and demanded to know whether ida were not a perfect lady  at which he laughed with a sound of scoffing and being tired of the discussion sauntered out of the house to that inexhaustible occupation of watching the boats come in and smoking with old acquaintances who were still congenial to him and declared that he had not become stuckup though he was turned into an awful swell  perhaps they were less bad for him than stanhope for they inspired no spirit of imitation  when he came back a later post had arrived bringing the news of constances successes and of the invitation to her to share the expedition of her uncle and aunt  there was no question about letting her go but the feeling was scarcely of congratulation  well little conny knows how to play her cards  stuffchild wouldnt know what it meant said herbert glumly  well said his sister she always was the favourite and i call it a shame  what because youve been such a good girl and got such honours and prizes demanded herbert  nonsense herbert said his mother  idas education was finished you know  oh she wasnt a bit older than conny is now  and i dont hold with all that study science and logic and what dye call it thats no use to any one continued his mother  its not as if your sisters had to be governesses  give me a girl who can play a tune on the piano and make herself agreeable  your uncle may do as he pleases but hell have constance on his hands  the men dont fancy a girl that is always after books and lectures  not of your sort perhaps said herbert but i dont care what i bet that conny gets a better husband than ida  it stands to reason ida said almost crying when uncle takes her about to all these fine places and sets her up to be the favouritejust the youngest  its not fair  as if she wasnt by a long chalk the better of the two said herbert  now bertie interposed his mother ill not have you teasing and running down your sister though i do say it is a shame and a slight to pick out the youngest when poor ida is so delicate and both of you two have ever so much better a right to favours  thats a good one muttered herbert while ida exclaimed  of course you know aunt has always been nasty to me ever since i said ma said i was not strong enough to be bothered with that horrid school and as to poor herbert they have spited him because he shot that  shut up ida shouted herbert  i wouldnt go with them if they went down on their knees to me  what should i do loafing about among a lot of disputing frogeaters without a word of a christian language and old frank with his nose in a guidebook wanting me to look at beastly pictures and rum old cathedrals  you would be a fish out of water too ida  now conny will take to it like a house afire and whats more she deserves it  well ma put in the provoked ida i wonder you let conny go when it would do me so much good and it is so unfair  my dear you dont understand a mothers feelings  i feel the slight for you but your uncle must be allowed to have his way  he is at all the expense and to refuse for conny would do you no good  except that she will be more set up than ever murmured ida  oh come now  i wonder which looks more like the setup one said herbert whose wider range had resulted in making him much alive to idas shortcomings and who looked on at her noisy style of flirtation with the eye of a grave censor  whatever he might be himself he knew what a young lady ought to be  he triumphed a little when during the few days spent in london constance wrote of a delightful evening when while her uncle and aunt and miss morton had gone to an entertainment for berthas matchbox makers she had been permitted to have rose rollstone to spend the time with her the carriage by their kind contrivance fetching the girl both in going and coming  the two young things had been thoroughly happy together  rose had gone on improving herself her companions in the art embroidery line were girls of a good class with a few ladies among them and their tone was good and refined  it was the fashion among them to attend the classes bible and secular put in their way and their employers conscientiously attended to their welfare so that rose was by no means an unfitting companion for the high school maiden and they most happily compared notes over their very different lives when they were not engaged in playing with little cea as the unwieldy name of miss mortons protegee had been softened  she was a very pretty little creature with big blue eyes and hair that could be called golden and very full of life and drollery so that she was a treat to both and when the housemaid whose charge she was insisted on her coming to bed they begged to superintend her evening toilet and would have played antics with her in her crib half the night if they had not been inexorably chased away  then they sat down on low stools in the balcony among the flowers in convenient proximity for the caresses they had not yet outgrown and had what they called a sweet talk  constance had been much impressed with the beauty of the embroidery and thought it must be delightful to do such things  yes for the forewoman said rose but theres plenty of dull work the same over and over again and one little stitch ever so small gone amiss throws all wrong  miss grey told us to recollect it was just like our lives  thats nice said constance  and it is for the church and almighty gods service  some of it said rose but theres a good deal only for dresses and furniture and screens  dont you feel like sunday when you are doing altarcloths and stools asked constance reverently  i wish i did said rose but i dont do much of that kind yet and one cant keep up the being serious over it always you know  indeed miss grey does not wish us to be dull she reads to us when there is time and explains the symbols that have to be done but part of the time it is an amusing book and she says she does not mind cheerful talk only she trusts us not to have gossip she would not like to hear  i wonder said constance whether i should have come with you if all this had not happened  it must be very nice  but your school is nice  oh yes  i do love study and those saturdays and sundays at northmoor they are delicious  uncle frank reads with me about religion you know  like our dear bible class  yes i never understood or felt anything before he puts it so as it comes home said constance striving to express herself  then i have a dear little class at the sunday school  i am to have one by and by  mine are sweet little things and i work for them on saturdays while aunt mary reads to me  i do like teachingand do you know rose i think i shall be a high school teacher  oh conny i thought you were all so rich and grand  no we are not said constance lazily we have nothing but what uncle frank gives us and i cant bear the way mamma and ida are always trying to get more out of him when i know he cant always do what he likes and nasty people think him shabby  i am sure i ought to work for myself  but if herbert is a lord  i hope he wont be for a long long time cried constance  besides i am sure he would want all his money for himself  and as to being a teacher aunt mary was and miss arden who is so wise and good is one if i was like them i think it would be doing real work for god and goodwouldnt it rose  oh dear oh dear theres the carriage stopping for you     chapter xix the dolomites   the summer was a very hot one and the travellers in spite of the charm of new scenes and the wonders of everything to their unsophisticated eyes found it trying  constance indeed was in a state of constant felicity and admiration undimmed except by the flagging of her two fellowtravellers in the heated and close german railway cars  her uncles head suffered much and lady northmoor secretly thought her maids refusal to accompany them showed her to be a prudent woman however the first breath of mountain air was a grand revival to lord northmoor and at innsbruck he was quite alive and walked about in fervent delight not desisting till he and constance had made out every statue on maximilians monument  his wife was so much tired and wornout that she heartily rejoiced in having provided him with such a good little companion though she was disappointed at being obliged to fail him and get what rest she could at the hotel  but then as she told him if he learnt his way about it now he would be able to show it all to her when they had both gained strength at ratzes  bertha had obtained full instructions and a welcome for them from mrs bury a kindly person who having married off her children while still in full health and vigour remained at the service of any relation who needed her and in the meantime resorted to outoftheway places abroad  the railway took them to botzen which was hotter still and thence on to castelruth whence there was no means of reaching ratzes but by mule or chaise a porteux  both alike were terrible to poor mary however she made up her mind to the latter and all the long way was to her a dream of terror and discomfort and of trying to admirewhat she knew she ought to admirethe wonderful pinnaclelike aiguilles of the schern cleaving the air  for some time the way lay over the great plateau of the scisser alpa sea of rich grass full of cattle where her husband and niece kept on trying to bring their mules alongside of her to make her participate in their ecstasy and partake of their spoilsmountain pink celestially blue gentian brilliant poppy or the like  here the principal annoyance was that their mules were so obstinately bent on not approaching her that she was in constant alarm for them while constance was absolutely wild with delight and even grave frank was exhilarated by the mountain air into boyish spirits such as impressed her though she resolutely prevented herself from lowering them by manifesting want of sympathy though the aiguilles that they admired seemed to her savage and the descent along a perilous winding road cut out among precipices horrified heron on through endless pine forests where the mules insisted on keeping her in solitude and where nothing could be seen beyond the rough jolting path  at last when a whole day had gone by and even constance sat her mule in silence and looked very tired the fir trees grew more scanty  the aiguilles seemed in all their wildness to be nodding overhead there was a small bowlinggreen a sort of chalet in two divisions united by a gallery but mary saw no more for at that moment a loose slippery stone gave way and the bearers stumbled and fell dragging the chair so that it tipped over  constance who had ridden on in front with her uncle first heard a cry of dismay and as both leaped off and rushed back they saw her aunt had fallen and partly entangled in the chair  do not touch her cried frank forgetting that he could not be understood and raising her in his arms as the chair was withdrawn but she did not speak or move and there was a distressing throng and confusion of strange voices seeming to hem them in as constance looked round unable to call up a single word of german or to understand the exclamations  then as she always said it was like an angels voice that said what is it as through the crowd came a tall lady in a white hat and black gown and knelt down by the prostrate figure saying i hope she is only stunned let us carry her in  it will be better to let her come round there  the lady gave vigorous aid and giving a few orders in german helped lord northmoor to carry the inanimate form into the hotel a low building of stone with a highpitched shingle roof  constance followed in a bewilderment of fright together with lenchen the swiss maid who as well as could be made out was declaring that a swiss bearer never made a false step  lady northmoor was carried into a bedroom and constance was shut out into a room that photographed itself on her memory even in that momenta room like a box with a rough table a few foldingchairs an easel watercoloured drawings hung about in all directions a big travellingcase a few books a writingcase mrs burys sittingroom in fact which as a regular sojourner she had been able to secure and furnish after her need  from the window tall narrow latticed with a heavy outside shutter she saw a village green a little church with a sharp steeple and pointedroof houses covered with shingle groups of people a few in picturesque tyrolese costume but others in the ordinary badly cut edition of cosmopolitan human nature  there was a priest in a big hat and white bordered bands discussing a newspaper with a man with a big red umbrella a party drinking coffee under a pine tree and beyond those strange wild pointed aiguilles pointing up purple and red against the sky               picture there was a priest in a big hat     how delightful it would all have been if this quarter of an hour could be annihilated  she could find out nothing  lenchen and the goodnaturedlooking landlady came in and out and fetched things but they never stayed long enough to give her any real information the landlady shouting for hemzel etc and lenchen calling loudly in german for the boxes which had been slung on mules  she heard nothing definite till her uncle came out looking pale and anxious  she is better now he said with a gasp of relief throwing himself into a chair and holding out his hand to constance who could hardly frame her question  yes quite sensiblecame round quickly  the blow on the head seems to be of no consequence but there may be a strain or it may be only the being worn out and overdone  they are going to undress her and put her to bed now  mrs bury is kindness itself  i did not look after her enough on that dreadful road  isnt there a doctor constance ventured to ask  no such thing within i know not how many miles of these paths  but mrs bury seems to think it not likely to be needed  overfatigue and the shake  what was i about  this air and all the rest were like an intoxication making me forget my poor mary  he passed his hand over his face with a gesture as if he were very much shocked and grieved at himself and constance suggested that it was all the mules fault and aunt mary never complained  the more reason she should not have been neglected he said and it was well for the excluded pair that just then the boxes were reported as arrived and he was called on for the keys so that wild searching for things demanded occupied them  after a considerable time mrs bury came and told lord northmoor that he might go and look at his wife for a few moments but that she must be kept perfectly quiet and not talked to or agitated  constance was not to go in at all but was conducted off by the good lady to her own tiny room to get herself ready for the muchneeded meal that was imminent  they met again in the outer room  there was a great speise saal a separate building where the bathers dived en masse but since mrs bury had made the place her haunt she had led to the erection of an additional building where there was a little accommodation for the travellers of the better class who had of late discovered the glories of the dolomites though the baths were scarcely ever used except by artizans and farmers  she had this sittingroom chiefly made at her own expense with these few comforts in the way of easy foldingchairs a vase of exquisite flowers on the table a few delicate carvings an easel and drawings of the mountain peaks and ravines suspended everywhere  besides this there were only the bedrooms as small as they well could be  they were summoned down to the evening meal and the maid lenchen was left with lady northmoor  there was only one other guest a spectacled and rather silent german and constance presently gathered that mrs bury was trying to encourage and inspirit lord northmoor but seemed to think there might be some delay before a move would be possible  they sent her to bed for she was really very tired after the long walk and ride and she could not help sleeping soundly but the first thing she heard in the morning was that the guide had been desired to send a doctor from botzen and the poor child spent a dreary morning of anxiety with nothing to do but to watch the odd figures disporting themselves or resting in the shade after their baths to try a little sketching and a little letterwriting but she was too restless and anxious to get on with either  all the comfort she got was now and then mrs bury telling her that she need not be frightened and giving her a book to read and after the midday meal her uncle was desired by mrs bury who had evidently assumed the management of him to take the child out walking for the doctor could not come for hours and lady northmoor had better be left to sleep  so they wandered out into the pinewoods preoccupied and silent gazing along the path as if that would hasten the doctor  constance had perceived that questions were discouraged and did her best to keep from being troublesome by trying to busy herself with a bouquet of mountain flowers  the little german doctor came so late that he had to remain all night but his coming as well as that of a brisk american brother and sister seemed to have cheered things up a good deal  mrs bury talked to the german and the americans asked so many questions that answering them made things quite lively  indeed constance was allowed to wish her aunt goodnight and seeing her look just like herself on her pillows much relieved her mind     chapter xx ratzes   things began to fall into their regular course at ratzes lady northmoor was in a day or two able to come into mrs burys sittingroom for a few hours every day but there she lay on a folding chaiselongue that had been arranged for her languid but bright reading working looking at mrs burys drawings and keeping the diary of the adventures of the others  her husband would fain never have left her but he had to take his baths these were in the lower story of the larger chalet  they were taken in rows of pinewood boxes in the vault  he muttered that it felt very like going alive into his coffin when like others he laid himself down in the rustcoloured liquid each in his narrow cell in iron laid with his head on a shelf and a lid closing up to his chin and he was uncheered by conversation as all the other patients were austrians of the lower middle class and their tyrolean dialect would have been hard to understand even by german scholars  however the treatment certainly did him good and entirely drove away his neuralgia he walked rode and climbed a good deal with constance and a lad attached to the establishment whose german constance could just understand  and while he stayed with his wife mrs bury took constance out showed her many delights helped her crude notions of drawing and being a good botanist herself taught the whole party fresh pleasures in the wonderful flora of the dolomites  now and then an english traveller appeared and lord northmoor was persuaded to join in expeditions for his nieces sake that took them away for a night or two  thus they saw caprile cadore st ulrich that town of toys full of dolls of every tone spotted wooden horses carts and the like  they beheld the tall points of monte serrata and the wonderful horse teeth with many more such marvels and many were the curiosities they brought back and the stories they had to tell with regrets that aunt mary had not been there to enjoy and add to their enjoyment  so the days went on and the end of constances holidays was in view the limit that had been intended for the kur at ratzes but aunt mary had not been out of doors since their arrival and seemed fit for nothing save lying by the window  constance had begun to wonder what would be done when she was told that a goodnatured pair of english travellers like herself bound to school terms would escort her safely to london and see her into the train for colbeam just in time for the high school term  this will be the best way said her aunt kissing her  you have been a dear good girl conny and a great pleasure and comfort to us both  oh auntie i have not done anything mrs bury has done it all  mrs bury is most kind unspeakably kind but my dear dear girl your companionship has been so much to your dear uncle that i have been most thankful to you  always recollect dearest conny you can be more comfort to your uncle than anybody else whatever may come  you will always be a good girl and keep up your tone and make him your great considerationafter higher things promise me  oh yes indeed auntie dear said the girl somewhat frightened and bewildered as the last kisses and goodbyes were exchanged  since the travellers were to start very early the next morning on their mules for botzen whither mrs bury meant to accompany them in order to make some purchases lord northmoor went with the party to the limits of his walking powers and on the slope of the alp amid the firwoods took his leave mrs bury telling him cheerfully that she should return the next day while he said that he could not thank her enough  he bade farewell to his niece telling her that he hoped she would by and by be spending her holidays at northmoor if all went well  constance had begun to grow alarmed and watched for an opportunity of imploring mrs bury to tell her whether aunt mary were really very ill  mrs bury laughed and confided to her a secret which made her at once glad alarmed and important  oh and is no one to know said little constance with rosy cheeks  not till leave is given said mrs bury  you see there is still so much risk of things going wrong that they both wish nothing to be said at present  i thought they had spoken to you  oh no  butbut and constance could not go on as her eyes filled with tears  is there special cause for anxiety you mean my dear  hardly for her though it was unlucky that she was as unknowing as you and i dont see how she is to be taken over these roads into a more civilised place  but i shall stay on and see them through with it and i daresay we shall do very well  i am used enough to looking after my own daughters and nobody particularly wants me at home  thats what aunt mary meant by saying you were so very good  well it would be sheer inhumanity to leave them to themselves and the mercies of ratzes and there seems to be no one else that could come  im glad i know said constance with a long breath  only what shall i do if any one asks me about her  say she had a nasty fall which makes it undesirable to move her just yet  it is the simple truth and what you would have naturally said but for this little communication of mine  i suppose said constance in a tone mrs bury did not understand it will be all known before my christmas holidays  oh yes my dear long before that  ill write to you when i have anything to tell  for which constance thanked her heartily and thenceforth felt a great deal older for the confidence which delighted as well as made her anxious for she was too fond of her uncle and aunt as well as too young and simple for it to have occurred to her how the matter might affect her brother  after seeing much more on her road than she had done before and won golden opinions from her escort for intelligence and obligingness she was safely deposited in the train for colbeam without having gone home  she had made up her mind to pass sunday at her boardinghouse and was greatly surprised when lady adela called on saturday to take her to northmoor for the sunday  now tell me about your uncle and aunt the good lady began when constance was seated beside her  yes i have heard from mrs bury but i want to know whether the place is tolerably comfortable  mrs bury has made it much better said constance  and it is so beautiful no one would care for comfort who was quite well  and is your uncle well  has he got over his headaches she asked solicitously  in fact the absence of lord and lady northmoor had done more than their presence to make lady adela feel their value  she was astonished to find how much she missed the power of referring to him and leaning on his support in all questions small or great that cropped up and she had begun to feel that the stick might be a staff besides which having imbibed more than an inkling of the cause of detention she was anxious to gather what she could of the circumstances  she was agreeably surprised in constance to whom the journey had been a time of development from the mere school girl and who could talk pleasantly showing plenty of intelligence and observation in a modest ladylike way  moreover she had a game in the garden which little amice enjoyed extremely and she and her little sunday class were delighted to see one another again  it resulted in her sundays being spent at northmoor as regularly as before and in amice a companionless child thinking saturday brought the white afternoon of the week     chapter xxi the heirapparent       my dear addie      you have no doubt ceased from your exertions in the way of finding     nurses since the telegram has told you that the son and heir has     considerately saved trouble and expense by making his appearance on     michaelmas morning  it was before there was time to fetch anybody     but the ancient village bettina  everything is most prosperous and     i am almost as proud as the parentsand to see them gloat over the     morsel is a caution  they look at him as if such a being had never     been known on the earth before and he really is a very fine healthy     creature most ridiculously like the portrait of the original old     michael morton northmoor in the fullbottomed wig  he seems to be     almost equally marvellous to the ratzes population being the first     infant seen there unswaddledor washed  bettinas horror at the     idea of washing him is worth seeing  her brown old face was almost     convulsed and she and our frauwirthin concurred in assuring me that     it would be fatal to der kleine baron if he were washed except     with white wine and milk at a fortnight old nor would they accept my     assurance that my three daughters and seven grandchildren had     survived the process  i have to do it myself and dress him as i     can for his wardrobe as made here is not complete and whatever you     can send us will be highly acceptable  it is lucky that northmoor is     a born nurse for the womens fear of breaking the child is really     justifiable as they never handled anything not made up into a mummy     moreover they wish to let all the world up into marys room to     behold the curiosity i met the priest upon his way and turned him     back  so we have pretty well all the nursing on our hands and     happily it is of the most satisfactory kind with the one drawback     that we have to call in the services of a valia but on the other     hand we have all been so much interested in a poor little widow     hedwig grantzen whose husband was lost last spring in a snowstorm     that it is pleasant to have some employment for her  such a creature     as came over on chance and speculationa great coarse handsome girl     in exaggerated costume all new with lacy ribbons down her back but     i rode over to botzen and interviewed her parish priest about her     and that was enough to settle her  every one is asleep except     myself and marys face is one smile as she sleeps      this is going to be posted by the last of the tourists luckily a     clergyman whom we begged to baptize the boy as there is a     possibility that snows may close us in before we can get away      so he is named michael kenton partly after my own dear brother as     well as the old founder partly in honour of the day and of sir     edward kenton who they say has been their very kind friend  it     really is a feast to see people so wonderingly happy and thankful     the little creature has all the zest of novelty to them and they coo     and marvel over it in perfect felicity  when you will be introduced     to the hero i cannot guess for though he has been an earlier     arrival than his mothers inexperience expected i much doubt her     being able to get out of this place while the way to botzen is     passable according to the prognostics of the sages  what splendid     studies of ice peaks i shall have  your affectionate cousin                                                                  l bury  a telegram had preceded the letter  one soon followed by mrs burys promised note had filled constances honest little heart with rapture another had set all the bells in northmoor church ringing and best rejoicing that that there harbuts nose was put out of joint a feeling wherein lady adela could not but participate though of course she showed no sign of it to constance  a sharplyworded letter to the girl soon came from her mother demanding what she had known beforehand  mrs morton had plainly been quite unprepared for what was a severe blow to her and it was quite possible to understand how in his shyness lord northmoor had put off writing of the hope and expectation from day to day till all had been fulfilled sooner than had been expected  it was the first thing that brought home to constance that the event was scarcely as delightful to her family as to herself  she wrote what she knew and heard no more for none of her home family were apt to favour her with much correspondence  miss morton however had written to her sisterinlaw  poor herbert  i am sorry for him though you wont be  he takes it very well he really is a very good sort at bottom and it really is the very best thing for him as i have been trying to persuade him  bulletins came with tolerable frequency from ratzes with all good accounts of mother and child and a particular description of little michaels beauties but it was only too soon announced that snow was falling and this was soon followed by another letter saying that consultation with the best authorities within reach had decided that unless the weather were extraordinarily mild the journey after november set in was not to be ventured by lady northmoor or so young a child there would be perils for any one even the postmen and the guides and if it were mild in one valley it might only render it more dangerous over the next alp  still mrs bury a practised and enterprising mountaineer might have attempted it but though mary was rapidly recovering and the language was no longer utterly impracticable the good lady could not bear to desert her charges or to think what might happen to them if left alone in case of illness or accident so she devoted herself to them and to her studies of ice and snow and wrote word to her family that they were to think of her as hibernating till easter if not whitsuntide     chapter xxii out of joint   constance had of course to spend her christmas holidays at home where she had not been for nine months  her brother met her at the london terminus to go down with her and there to her great joy she also saw rose rollstone on the platform herbert whose dignity had first prompted him to seek a smoking carriage apart from his sister thereupon decided to lay it aside and enter with them looking rather scornful at the girls mutual endearments  come conny miss rollstone has had enough of that he said and here are a lot going to get in  oh my the cads  i shall have to get into the smoking carriage after all  no dont  sit opposite and we shall do very well  then came the exchange of news andyouve heard of course rosie  i should think i had then an anxious glance at herbert who answered  oh yes mother and ida have been tearing their hair ever since but it is all rot  the governors very welcome to the poor little beggar  oh thats right  thats very noble of you herbert said both the girls in a breath  well you see old frank is good to live these thirty or forty years yet and what was the good of having to wait  better have done with it at once i say and he has written me a stunning jolly letter  oh i was sure he would cried constance  im to go on just the same and he wont cut off my allowance pursued herbert  it is just as my papa says put in rose he is always the gentleman and youll be in the army still  when ive got through my exams but they are no joke miss rose i can tell you  it is conny there that likes to sap  what have you been doing this time little one  i dont know yet but miss astley thinks i have done well and shall get into the upper form said constance shyly  i got on with my german while i was abroad trying to teach uncle frank  at which herbert laughed heartily and demanded what sort of scholar he made  not very good owned constance he did forget so from day to day and he asked so many questions and was always wanting to have things explained  but it made me know them better and mrs bury had such nice books and she helped me  if you want to take up french and german bertie  he shrugged his shoulders  dont spoil the passing hour child  i should think you would be glad enough to get away from it all  i do want to get on said constance  i must you know more than ever now  oh you mean that mad fancy of going and being a teacher  it is not a bit mad herbert  rose does not think it is and i want you to stand by me if mamma and ida make objections  girls are always in such a hurry grumbled herbert  you need not make a stir about it yet  you wont be able to begin for ever so long  rose agreed with him that it would be much wiser not to broach the subject till constance was old enough to begin the preparation though with the impatience of youth to express its designs and give them form she did not like the delay  i tell you what con finally said herbert if you set mother and ida worrying before their time i shall vote it all rot and not say a word to help you  which disposed of the subject for the time and left them to discuss happily constances travels and herberts new tutor and companions till their arrival at westhaven where constances welcome was quite a secondary thing to herberts as she well knew it would be nor felt it as a grievance though she was somewhat amazed at seeing him fervently embraced and absolutely cried over with oh my poor injured boy  herbert did not like it at all and disengaging himself rapidly growled out his favourite expletive of rot  have done with that  he was greatly admired for his utter impatience of commiseration but there was no doubt that the disappointment was far greater to his mother and ida than to himself  he cared little for what did not make any actual difference to his present life whereas to them the glory and honour of his heirship and the future hopes were everythingand constances manifest delight in the joy of her uncle and aunt and her girlish interest in the baby were to their eyes unfeeling folly if not absolute unkindness to her brother  dear little baby indeed said ida scornfully  nasty little wretch i say  one good thing is up in that cold place all this time hes sure not to live  herbert whistled  thats coming it rather strong  and constance with tears starting to her eyes said for shame ida how can you be so wicked  think of uncle frank and aunt mary  i believe you care for them more than for your own flesh and blood exclaimed her mother  well and havent they done a sight deal more for her said herbert  you turning on me too you ungrateful boy cried mrs morton  herbert laughed  if it comes to gratitude he said and looked significantly at the decorations  and what is it but the due to his brothers widow said mrs morton just a pittance and you may depend that will be cut down on some pretext now  i should think so if they heard idas tongue said herbert  and constance there is spitefulness enough to go and tell themfavourite as she is said ida  i should think not said constance indignantly  as if i would do such a mean thing  come come ida said her mother your sister knows better than that its not the way when she is only just come home so grown too and improved quite the lady  mrs morton had a mothers heart for constance though only in the third degree and was really gratified to see her progress  she had turned up her pretty brown hair and the last year had made her much less of a child in appearance her features were of delicate mould she had dark eyes and a sweet mouth with a roseblush complexion and was pleasing to look on though in her mothers eyes no rival to the thin rather sharplydefined features bright eyes and pinkandwhite complexion that made ida the belle of a certain set at westhaven  the party were more amicable over the dinnertablefor dinner it was called as an assertion of gentility  are you allowed to dine late asked ida patronisingly of her sister when you are not at school  lady adela dines early said constance  oh for your sake i suppose  always i believe said constance  yes always said herbert  fine people neednt ask whats genteel you see ida  that was almost the only breeze and after dinner herbert rushed out for a smell of sea interspersed with pipe and to look up the inevitable old jack  constance was then subjected to a crossexamination on all the circumstances of the detention at ratzes and all she had heard or ought to have heard about the arrival of the unwelcome little michael while her mother and sister drew their own inferences  really said ida at last it is just like a thing in a book  constance was surprised  because it was such a happy surprise for them she added hastily  no nonsense child but it is just what they always do when they want a supposititious heir  ida how can you say such things  but it is conny  there was the wicked sir ronald macronald  he took his wife away to belgrade right in the ukraine mountains and it  belgrade is in hungary and the cossacks live in the ukraine in russia suggested constance  oh never mind your schoolgirl geography it was bel something an outoftheway place in the mountains anyway and there he pretended she had a child just out of malice to the right heiress that lovely lilian and he got killed by a stag and then she confessed on her deathbed  i declare it is just like  my dear dont talk in that way your sister is quite shocked  your uncle never would  bless me ma i was only in fun  i could tell you ever so many stories like that  theres broughtons on the table there  i knew from the first it was an impostor and the old nurse dressed like a nun was his mother  i believe you always know the end before you are half through the first volume said her mother admiringly but of course it is all right only it is a terrible disappointment and misfortune for us and not to be looked for after all these years  the last three christmastides had been spent at northmoor where it had been needful to conform to the habits of the household which impressed ida and her mother as grand and conferring distinction but decidedly dull and religious  so as they were at westhaven perforce they would make up for it christmas eve was spent in a tumult of preparation for the diversions of the next day  mrs morton had two maids now but to her they were still gals not to be trusted with the more delicate cookeries and ida was fully engaged in the adornment of the room and herself while constance ran about and helped both and got more thanks from her mother than her sister  ida was to end the day with a dance at a friends house but she was not desirous of taking constance with her having been accustomed to treat her as a mere child and constance though not devoid of a wish for amusement knew that her uncle and aunt would have taken her to church where she would have enjoyed the festal service  her mother would not let her go out in the dark alone and was too tired to go with her so she had to stay at home while herbert disported himself elsewhere and constance underwent another crossexamination over the photographs she had brought home but mrs morton was never unkind when alone with her and she had all the natural delight of youth in relating her adventures  mrs morton however showed offence at not having been sent for instead of mrs buryso much less of a relation and constance found herself dwelling on the ruggedness of the pass and the difficulties of making oneself understood but mrs morton still persisted that she could not understand why they should have got into such a place at all when there were plenty of fashionable places in the newspaper where they could have had society and attendance and everything  ah but that was just what uncle frank didnt want  well if they choose to be so eccentric and close and shy they cant wonder that people talk  mamma you cant mean that horrid nonsense that ida talked about  it was only a joke  oh my dear i dont say that i suspect anythingoh noonly if they had not been so close and queer one would have been able to contradict it  i like people to be straightforward thats all i have to say  and it is terribly hard on your poor brother to be so disappointed after having his expectations so raised and mrs morton melted into tears leaving constance with nothing to say for in the first place she did not think herbert as yet at least was very sensible of his loss and in the next she did not quite venture to ask her mother whether she thought little michael should have been sacrificed to herberts expectations  so she took the wiser course of producing a photograph of vienna     chapter xxiii velvet   constance created quite a sensation when she came down dressed for church on christmas day in a dark blue velvet jacket deeply trimmed with silver fox and a hat and muff en suite matching with her serge dress and though unpretending yet very handsome  up jumped ida from lacing her boots by the fire  well i never  they are spoiling you  real velvet i declare and real silkwadded lining look ma  what made them dress you like that  it wasnt them said constance it was lady adela  one sunday in october it turned suddenly cold and i had only my cloth jacket and she sent up for something warm for me  this was just new before she went into black when husband died and she had put it away for amice but it fitted me so well and looked so nice that she was so kind as to wish me to keep it always  castoff clothes  thats the insolence of these swells said ida  i wonder you had not the spirit to refuse  sour grapes muttered herbert while her mother sighedah thats what we come to  must not i wear it mamma said constance who had a certain attachment to the beautiful and comfortable garment  she told me she had only worn it once in london and she was so very kind  oh if you call it kindness said ida i call it impertinence  if you had only heard faltered constance  no no said their mother you could not refuse of course my dear and no one here will know  it becomes her very well too  doesnt it ida  ida made a snort  if people choose to make a little chit of a schoolgirl ridiculous by dressing her out like that she said  there isnt time now before church said constance almost tearfully or i would take it off  no such thing said herbert  come on conny  you shall walk with me you look stunning and i want westhaven folk to see for once what a lady is like  constance was very glad to be led away from idas comments and resolved that her blue velvet should not see the light again at westhaven but she did not find this easy to carry out for perhaps for the sake of teasing ida herbert used to inquire after it and insist on her wearing it and her mother liked to see her and to show her in it  it was only ida who seemed unable to help saying something disagreeable till almost in despair constance offered to lend the bone of contention but lady adela was a small woman and constance would never be on so large a scale as her sister so that the jacket refused to be transferred except at the risk of being spoilt by alteration and here mrs morton interfered it would never do to have them say at northmoor that lady mortons gift had been spoilt by their meddling with it  constance was glad though she suspected that lady adela would never have found it out  then ida consulted sibyl grover who was working with a dressmaker and with whom she kept up a sort of patronisingly familiar acquaintance as to making something to rival it and sibyl was fertile in devices as to doing so cheaply but when she consulted her superior she was told that without the same expensive materials it would evidently be only an imitation and moreover that the fashion was long gone out of date which enabled ida to bear the infliction with some degree of philosophy  this jacket was not however constances only trouble  her conscience was already uneasy at the impossibility of getting to evensong on christmas day  she had been to an early celebration without asking any questions and had got back before herbert had come down to breakfast and very glad she was that she had done so for she found that her mother regarded it as profane to take the sacrament when she was going to have a party in the evening and when constance was in the midst of the party she felt thatif it were to beher mother might be right  it was a dinner firstat which constance did not appearchiefly of older people who talked of shipping and of coals  afterwards if they noticed the young people joked them about their imaginary loversbeaux as the older ladies called them young men as the younger ones said one the most plain spoken of all asked herbert how he felt at which the boy wriggled and laughed sheepishly and his mother had a great confabulation with various of the ladies who were probably condoling with her  later there were cards for the elders and sundry more young people came in for a dance  the rollstones were considered as beneath the dignity of the mortons but herbert had loudly insisted on inviting rose for the evening and had had his way but after all she would not come  herbert felt himself aggrieved and said she was as horrid a little prig as constance who on her side felt a pang of envy as she thought of rose going to church and singing hymns and carols to her father and mother while she after a struggle under the mistletoe which made her hot and miserable had to sit playing waltzes  one goodnatured lady offered to relieve her but she was too much afraid of the hero of the mistletoe to stir from her post and the daughter of her kindly friend had no scruple in exclaiming  oh no ma dont  you always put us out you know and constance morton is as true as old time  i am sure constance is only too happy to oblige her friends said mrs morton  and she is not out yet she added as a tribute to high life  if constance at times felt unkindly neglected at others she heard surges of giggling and suppressed shrieking and protests that made her feel the piano an ark of refuge  the parting speech from a goodnatured old merchant captain was why you demure little pussy cat you are the prettiest of them all  what have yon lads been thinking about to let those little fingers be going instead of her feet  or is it all miss idas jealousy eh  all this in a speakingtrumpet voice put the poor child into an agony of blushes which only incited him to pat her on the cheek and the rest to laugh hilariously under the influence of negus and cheap champagne  constance could have cried for very shame but when she was waiting on her mother who tired as she was would not go to bed without locking up the spoons and the remains of the wine mrs morton said kindly you are tired my dear and no wonder  they were a little noisy tonight  those are not goingson that i always approve you know but young folk always like a little pleasure extra at christmas  dont you go and get too genteel for us conny  come come dont cry  drink this my love youre tired  oh mamma it is not the being genteeloh no but christmas day and all  come come my dear i cant have you get mopy and dull religion is a very good thing but it isnt meant to hinder all ones pleasure and when youve been to church on a christmas day what more can be expected of young people but to enjoy themselves  come go to bed and think no more about it  to express or even to understand what she felt would have been impossible to constance so she had to content herself with feeling warm at her heart at her mothers kind kiss  all the other parties she saw were much more decorous even to affectation except that at the old skippers and he was viewed by the family as a subject for toleration because he had been a friend and messmate of mrs mortons father  all the good side of that lady and ida came out towards him and his belongings  he had an invalid granddaughter with a spine complaint and feeble eyesight and ida spent much time in amusing her teaching her fancy works and reading to her unluckily it was only trashy novels from the circulating library that they read ida had no taste for anything else and protested that louie would be bored to death if she tried to read her the african adventures which were just then the subject of enthusiasm even with herbert  ida was not a dull girl  unlike some who do not seem to connect their books with life she made them her realities and lived in them and as she hardly ever read anything more substantial her ideas of life and society were founded on them though in her own house she was shrewd in practical matters and though not strong was a useful active assistant to her mother whenever there was no danger of her being detected in doing anything derogatory to one so nearly connected with the peerage  indeed she seemed to regard her sisters dutiful studies as proofs of dulness and want of spirit  she was quite angry when constance objected to the unconscious impostorvery yellow with a truculent flaming design outsidethat she did not think she ought to read that kind of bookaunt mary would not like it  well if i would be in bondage to an old governess  you are not such a child now  dont ida  uncle frank would not like it either  perhaps not said ida with an ugly meaning laugh as she glanced again at the title  constance might really have liked to read more tales than she allowed herself  the house on the marsh tempted her but she was true to the advice she had received and rose rollstone upheld her in her resolution  ida thought it rather low in herbert and constance to care for the old butlers daughter but their mother had a warm spot in the bottom of her heart and liked a gossip with mrs rollstone too much to forbid the house to her daughter besides that she shrank from inflicting on her so much distress  so during the fortnight that rose spent at home the girls were together most of the morning  after constance well wrapped up had practised in the cold drawingroom where economy forbade fires till the afternoon she sped across to rose in the little stuffy parlour where mr rollstone liked to doze over his newspaper to the lullaby of their lowvoiced chatter  often they walked together and were sometimes joined by herbert who on these occasions always showed that he knew how to behave like a gentleman  herbert was faithfully keeping his promise not to bet though as he observed he had not expected to be in for it so long  but it was satisfactory to hear that his present fellowpupils did not go in for that sort of thing and constance felt sure that her uncle and aunt would be pleased with him and think him much improved     chapter xxiv the revenge of sordid spirits   i am quite convinced said ida morton it is quite plain why we are not invited  my dear you see what your aunt says that mrs burys daughters husband is ordered to india and that having the whole family to stay at northmoor gives them the only chance of being all together for a little while and after their obligations to mrs bury  ma how can you be so green  obligations indeed  it is all a mere excuse to say there is not room for us in that great house  i see through it all  it is just to prevent us from being able to ask inconvenient questions of the german nurse and mrs bury and all  now ida i wish you would put away that fancy  your uncle and aunt were always such good people  and there was mrs bury  mother you will never understand the revenge of sordid souls said ida tragically quoting from the unconscious impostor  revenge  what can you mean  of course you know mrs bury never forgave herberts taking her for a tramp and you know how nasty uncle was about that white rook and the bets  oh it is quite plain  he was to be deprived of his rights and so this journey was contrived and they got into this outoftheway inaccessible place and sent poor conny away and then had no doctor or nurseexactly as people always do  oh ida only in stories  your novels are turning your head  novels are transcripts of life again said ida solemnly quoting  i dont believe it if they put such things into your head said her mother  asking herbert to be godfather too  such a compliment  an empty compliment to hoodwink us and the poor boy said ida  no no ma the keeping you away settles it in my mind and it shall be the business of my life to unmask that  so spoke ida conscious of being a future heroine  it was quite true that herbert had been asked to stand godfather to his little cousins admission into the church after of course a very good report had been received from his tutor  you are the little fellows nearest kinsman wrote lord northmoor and i trust to you to influence him for good  herbert wriggled blushed thought he hated it was glad it had been written instead of spoken but was really touched  his uncle had justly thought responsibility would be wholesome and besides herbert represented to him his brother for whom he had a very tender feeling  it was quite true that northmoor was as full as it would hold  mrs burys eldest daughter was going out to india and another had a husband in the civil service the third lived in ireland and the only way of having the whole family together for their last fortnight was to gather them at northmoor as soon as its lord and lady returned nor had they been able to escape from their dolomite ravine till the beginning of may for the roads were always dangerous often impassable so that there had been weeks when they were secluded from even the post and had had difficulties as to food and fire  however it had done them no harm and was often looked back upon as metaphorically as well as literally the brightest and whitest time in their lives  frank had walked and climbed both with mrs bury and on his own account and had drunk in the wild glories of the mountain winter and the fantastic splendours of snow and ice on those wondrous peaks and with that new joy and delight to be found in the queer wooden cradle his heart was free to bound as perhaps it had never done before in exulting thankfulness as he looked up to those foretastes of the great white throne  never had he had such a rest before from toil care and anxiety as in those months in the dry bracing air and it was the universal remark that lord northmoor came back years younger and twice the man he had been before with a spirit of cheerfulness and enterprise such as had always been wanting while as to his wife she was less strong than before but there was a certain peaceful yet exulting happiness about her and her face had gained wonderfully in sweetness and expression  the child was a fine plump little fellow old enough to laugh and respond to loving faces and gestures  mary had feared the sight might be painful to lady adela and was gratified to find her too true a babylover and too generous a spirit not to worship him almost as devotedly as did constance  perhaps the heads of the family had never seen or participated in anything like the domestic mirth and enjoyment of that fortnights visit bertha was with lady adela and the intimacy and confidence in which frank and mary had lived with mrs bury had demolished many barriers of shyness and made them hosts who could be as one with their guestsguests with whom the shadow of parting made the last sunshine seem the more bright  i did not know what i was letting you in for said bertha in apology to mrs bury  my dear i would not have been without the experience on any account  i never saw such a refreshing pair of people  surely it must have been awfully slowregular penal servitude  you confuse absence of small talk with absence of soul birdie  when we had once grown intimate enough to hold our tongues if we had nothing to say we got on perfectly  and what you had to say was about master michael  not entirely though i must say the mingled reverence and curiosity with which they regard the little monster and their own fear of not bringing up their treasure properly were a very interesting study  more so than your snowy peaks  ah if the proper study of mankind is man the proper study of womankind is babe  well it was not at all an unsatisfactory study in this case  and let me tell you miss birdie it is no bad thing to be shut in for a few months with a few good books and a couple of thoroughly simplehearted people who have thought a good deal in their quiet humdrum way  why lettice you must have been quite an education to them  i hope they were an education to me  i hope your conscience is not going to be such a rampant and obstructive thing as that which they possess in common said bertha  i wish it had been said mrs bury gravely  at any rate the deadly lively time has brisked you all up said bertha laughing  constance on her saturdays and sundays looked on with a kind of wonder she was not exactly of either set  the children were all so young as to look on her as a grownup person though willing to let her play with them and she was outside the group of young married people and could not enter into their family fun but this kind of playfulness and merriment was quite a revelation to her  she had never before seen mirth except of course childish and schoolgirl play that had not in it something that hurt her taste and jarred on her feeling as much as did idas screeching laughter in comparison with the soft ripplings of these young matrons  still little michael was her chief delight and she could hardly be detached from him  she refreshed her colloquial german or rather austrian with his nurse who had much to say of the goodness of die gnadigen frauen  poor thing she was the youthful widow of a guide and the efforts of the two frauen had been in vain to keep alive her only child after whose death she had found some consolation in taking charge of lady northmoors baby on the way home  constance hoped ida might never hear this fact  some degree of prosperity was greeting the little heir  a bit of moorland hitherto regarded as worthless had first been crossed by a branch line and the primary growth of a station had been followed by the discovery of good building stone and the erection of a crop of houses of all degrees which promised to set the northmoor finances on a better footing than had been theirs for years and set their conscientious landlord to work at once on providing church room and schools  all this and that most precious possession at home combined to give lord northmoor an amount of spirit and life that enabled him to take his place in the county emancipate himself from the squire show an opinion of his own and open his mouth occasionally  as bertha observed no one would ever have called him a stick if he had begun like this  to people like these humbled and depressed in early life a little happiness was a great stimulus     chapter xxv the love   it was not till christmas that ida had the opportunity of making her observations  by that time mite as he was supposed to have named himself had found the use of his feet and was acquiring that of his tongue  in fact he was a very fine forward child who might easily have been supposed to be eighteen months old instead of fifteen as ida did not fail to remark  he was a handsome little creature round and fair with splendid sturdy legs and mottled arms hair that stood up in a pale golden crest round blue eyes and a bright colour without much likeness as yet to either parent though lord northmoor declared that there was an exact resemblance to his own brother charles herberts father as he first remembered him  ida longed to purse up her lips but did not dare and was provoked to see her mother taken completely captive by his charms and petting him to the utmost extent  indeed lady northmoor who was very much afraid of spoiling him was often distressed when such scenes as this took place  mite mite dear no when his fat little hands had grasped an ivory papercutter and its blade was on the way to the button mouth  no as he paused and looked at her  heres mites ball poor little dear do let him have itand mite reading sympathy in his aunts face laughed in a fascinating triumphant manner and took a bite with his small teeth  mite mother said no and it was gently taken from his hand but before the fingers had embraced the substituted ball a depreciating look and word of remonstrance gave a sense of illusage and there was a roar  oh poor little dear  hereaunties goody goody  no no please emma he has had quite as many as he ought  no no mite and he was borne off sobbing in her arms while ida observed there is that the way people treat their own children  some people never get rid of the governess observed mrs morton quite unconscious that but for her interference there would have been no contest and no tears  but she herself had no doubts and was mollified by marys plea on her return  he is quite good now but you see there is so much danger of our spoiling him we feel that we cannot begin too soon to make him obedient  i could not bear to keep a poor child under in that way  i believe it saves them a great deal if obedience is an instinct said mary  it had not been mrs mortons method and she was perfectly satisfied with the result so she only made some inarticulate sound but she thought frank quite as unnatural when he kept michael on his knee at breakfast but with only an empty spoon to play with  all the tossing and playing the radiant smiles between the two did not in her eyes atone for these small beginnings of discipline even though her brotherinlaws first proceeding whenever he came home was to look for his son and if the child were not in the drawingroom to hurry up to the nursery and bring him down laughing and shouting  the tyrolean nurse had been sacrificed to those notions of training which the westhaven party regarded as so harsh  her home sickness and pining for her mountains had indeed fully justified the rampant consciences as to the humanity as well as the expedience of sending her home before her indulgence of the kleiner freiherr had had time to counteract his parents ideas and her place had been supplied by the nurse whom amice was outgrowing so that ida was disappointed of her intentions of examining her and laid up the circumstances as suspicious though on the other hand her mother was gratified at exercising a bit of patronage by recommending a nursery girl from westhaven  the next winter however was not marked by a visit to northmoor  ida had been having her full share of the summer and early autumnal gaieties of westhaven and among the yachts who were given to putting in there was a certain morna belonging to sir thomas brady who had become a baronet by force of success in speculation  his son who chiefly used it showed evident admiration of miss mortons bright cheeks and eyes and so often resorted to westhaven and dropped in at what she had named northmoor cottage that there was fair reason for supposing that this might result in more than an ordinary flirtation  however at the regatta when she had looked for distinguished attention on his part she felt herself absolutely neglected and the very next day the morna sailed away without a farewell  ida at first could hardly believe it  when she did the conviction came upon her that his sons attachment had been reported to sir thomas and that the young man had been summoned away against his will  it would have been different no doubt had herbert still been heirpresumptive  that horrid little mite said she  whether her heart or her ambition had been most affected might be doubtful  at any rate the disappointment added to the oppression of a heavy cold on the chest which she had caught at the regatta and which became severe enough to call for the doctor  thus the mother and daughter did not go to northmoor  at a ball given on board a steam yacht just before christmas ida caught a violent cold on the chest the word congestion was uttered and an opinion was pronounced that as she had always weak lungs a spring abroad would be advisable  mrs morton wrote a letter with traces of tears upon it appealing to her brotherinlaw to assist her as the only hope of saving her dearest child and the quarries had done so well during the last year that he was able to respond with a largesse sufficient for her needs though not for her expectations  mrs morton would have liked to have taken constance as interpreter and general aid and assistant but constance was hard at work aspiring to a scholarship at a ladies college and it was plain that her sister was not so desirous of her company as to make her mother overrule her wishes as a duty  in fact ida had found a fellowtraveller who would suit her much better than constance  living for the last year in lodgings near at hand was a miss gattoni daughter of an italian courier and french ladys maid  as half boarder at a thirdrate english school she had acquired education enough to be first a nurserygoverness and later a companion and in her last situation when she had gone abroad several times with a rheumatic old lady she had recommended herself enough to receive a legacy which rendered her tolerably independent  she was very goodnatured and had graduated in the art of making herself acceptable and as she really wished to go abroad again she easily induced mrs morton and ida to think it a great boon that she should join forces with them and as she was an experienced traveller with a convenient smattering of various tongues she really smoothed their way considerably and lived much more at her ease than she could have done upon her own resources always frequenting english hotels and boardinghouses  mrs morton and ida were of that order of tourists who do not so much care for sights as for being on a level with those who have seen them and besides ida was scarcely well or in spirits enough for much exertion till after her first month at nice which restored her altogether to her usual self and made her impatient of staying in one place  it is not however worth while to record the wanderings of the trio until in the next summer they reached venice where ida declared her intention of penetrating into the dolomites  there was an outcry  what could she wish for in that wild and savage country where there was no comfortable hotel no society no roadsnothing in short to make life tolerable whereas an hotel full of americans of extreme politeness to ladies and expeditions in gondolas when one could talk and have plenty of attention were only too delightful  that peaks should be more attractive than flirtations was inexplicable but at last in secret confabulation ida disclosed her motive and in another private consultation mrs morton begged miss gattoni to agree to it as the only means of satisfying the young lady or putting her mind at rest about a fancy her mother could not believe in though even as she said it would be so very shocking it is perfectly ridiculous to think my brother lord northmoor would be capable the shrewd confidante detected a lingering wish that it might be so  maps and routes were consulted and it was decided that whereas to go from venice through cadore would involve much muleriding and rough roads the best way would be to resort to the railway to verona and thence to botzen as the nearest point whence ratzes could be reached     chapter xxvi idas warning   botzen proved to be very hot and full of smells nor did mrs morton care for its quaint old medieval houses but idas heart had begun to fail her when she came so near the crisis and on looking over the visitors book she gave a cry  ah if we had only known  it is all of no use  how she was asked  that horrid mrs bury  there  of course she is  only a week ago she was here  if she is at ratzes of course we can do nothing  and the road is affreux perfectly frightful said mademoiselle  i have been inquiring about it  no access except upon mules  a whole days journeyand the hotel  bah it is vilain  if ida is bent on going she must go without me said mrs morton ii have had enough of those horrid beasts  idas nonsense will be the death of me  i dont see much good in going on with that woman there said ida gloomily  she would be sure to stifle all inquiry  a good thing too muttered poor weary mrs morton  ida turned the leaves of the visitors book till she found the names of lord and lady northmoor and then growing more eager as obstructions came in her way and not liking to turn back as if on a fools errand she suggested to miss gattoni that questions might be asked about their visit  the tyrolean patois was far beyond her and not too comprehensible to her friend but there was a waiter who could speak french and the landladys german was tolerable  the milord and miladi were perfectly remembered as well as their long detention but the return had been by way of italy so they had not revisited botzen with their child the next spring  but said the hostess there is a young woman in the next street who can tell you more than i  she offered herself as a nurse  this person was at once sent for  she was the same who had been mentioned by mrs bury but she had exchanged the peasant costume which had perhaps only been assumed to please the english ladies for the townswomans universal endeavour at french fashion which by no means enhanced her rather coarse beauty which was more italian than austrian  italian was the tongue which chiefly served as a medium between her and miss gattoni though hers was not pure enough to be easily understood mrs morton and ida put questions which miss gattoni translated as best she could and made out as much as possible of the answers  it was elicited that she had not been allowed to see the english miladi  all had been settled by the signora who came yearly and they had rejected her after all her trouble the doctor had recommended her and though her creatura would have been just the right age and that little ipocrilas child was older ever so much oldershe spread out her hands to indicate infinity  ah said ida i always thought so  ask her how much older demanded mrs morton  the replies varied from nearly un sanestre to tre settimaneand no more could be made of that question  where was the fosterchild  again the woman threw up her hands to indicate that she had no notionwhat was it to her  she could not tell if it were alive or dead but upon a leading question it had not been seen since hedwiges departure nor after return  was it boy or girl and after some hesitation it was declared to have been un maschio  there was more which nobody quite understood but which sounded abusive and they were glad to get rid of her with a couple of thalers  well said ida triumphantly  well echoed her mother in a different tone  i dont know what you were all saying but im sure of this that that woman was only looking to see what you wanted her to say  i watched the cunning look of her eyes and i would not give that for her word with a gesture of her fingers  but ma you didnt understand  nothing could be plainer  the doctor recommended her and sent her over in proper time but she never saw any one but mrs bury who no doubt had made her arrangements  then this other womans child was oldernobody knows how muchbut we always agreed that nobody could believe mite as they call him was as young as they said  and then that other child was a boy and it has vanished  i dont believe she knew  no i do not think she did chimed in miss gattoni  this canaille will say anything  i believe the woman said ida obstinately  her evidence chimes in with all my former conclusions  the older ladies both had a strong misgiving that the conclusions had formed the evidence and mrs morton though she had listened all along to idas grumbling was perfectly appalled at the notion of bringing such a ridiculous accusation against the brotherinlaw against whom she might indeed murmur but whom she knew to be truthful and selfdenying she ventured to represent that it was impossible to go upon this statement without ascertaining whether the grantzen child was alive or really dead and buried at ratzes and that the hostess of the inn would have been better evidence but      he that of purpose looks beside the mark     might as well hoodwinked shoot as in the dark  and ida was certain that all the people at ratzes had been bribed and that no one would dare to speak out while mrs bury kept guard there indeed for that lady to guess at such suspicions and inquiries would have been so dreadful that ratzes was out of the question much to the relief of the elders dragged along by the masterful maiden against their better judgment though indeed miss gattoni gave as much sympathy in her teteatetes with ida as she did to her mother in their consultations  they were made to interview the doctor but he knew as little about the matter as the disappointed balia and professed to know much less  in point of fact though he had been called in after the accident mrs bury had not thought much of his skill and had not promoted aftervisits there had not been time to summon him when the birth took place and mrs bury thought her experience more useful afterwards than his treatment was likely to be  so he was a slighted and offended man whose testimony given in good german only declared the secretiveness selfsufficiency and hardneckedness of englander  and idas state of mind much resembled that of the public when resolved to believe in the warmingpan     chapter xxvii the young pretender   the denunciation of the young pretender was not an easy matter even in idas eyes  it was one thing to have a pet grievance and see herself as a heroine righting her dear injured brothers wrongs and another to reproach two of the quietest most matteroffact people in the world with the atrocious frauds of which only a wicked baronet was capable  she was not sorry that the return to england was deferred by the tenants of the house at westhaven wanting to stay on and when at length a christmas visit was paid at northmoor mite was an animated little personage of three and a quarter and except that he could not accomplish a k perfect in speaking plainly and indeed with that pretty precision of utterance that children sometimes acquire when baby language has not been foolishly fastened  indeed his pet name of mite was only for strictly private use  except to his nearest relatives he was always michael  mrs morton was delighted with him and would have liked to make up for her knowledge of idas suspicions by extra petting and by discovering resemblances to all the family portraits as well as to his parents none of which any one else could see  she lived upon thorns lest ida should burst out with some accusation but ida had not the requisite impudence and indeed in sight of the boy with his parents her evidence faded into such stuff as dreams are made of  there was some vexation indeed that louisa the nurserymaid whom mrs morton had recommended had had to be dismissed  i am sorry said mrs morton for as i told you her father was the mate aboard the emma jane my poor fathers ship you know and went down with poor pa and my poor dear charlie  and her mother used to char for us which was but her due  yes i know said mary frank and i were both very sorry and we would have found her another place but she would go home  you see we could not keep her in the nursery for we must have a thoroughly trustworthy person to go out with michael  what  cant your fine nurse  eden  it is her one imperfection  it is some weakness of the spine and neither she nor i can be about with michael as long as it is good for him  i thought he must be safe in the garden but it turned out that louisa had been taking him down to the village and there meeting a sailor who i believe came up in a collier to colbeam  oh an old friend from westhaven  sam rattler suggested ida  dont you remember mamma mrs hall said they were sweethearting and she wanted to get her out of the way of him  perhaps said lady northmoor but i should have forgiven it if she had told me the truth and not tempted mite  she used to make excuses to eden for going down to the village and at last she took mite there and they gave him sweets at the shop not to tell  did he said ida rather hoping the model boy would have failed  oh yes  the dear little fellow did not understand keeping things back and when his papa was giving him his nightly sugarplum he said blue man gave me a great striped sweet and it stuck in my little teeth and then when we asked when and where he said down by bettys when i was out with cea and louie and so it came out that she had taken him into the village met this man brought him into the grounds by the little gate and tried to bribe mite to say nothing about it  cea told us all about itthe little girl who lives with miss morton  of course we could never let him go out with her again and you would hardly believe what an amount of falsehoods she managed to tell eden and me about it  ah if you had lived at westhaven you would have found out that to be so particular is the way to make those girls fib said mrs morton  i hope not  i think we have a very good girl now trained up in an orphanage  oh those orphanage girls are the worst of all  ive had enough of them  they break everything to pieces and they run after the lads worst of all because they have never seen one before  to which mary answered by a quiet i hope it may not turn out so  there were more agitating questions to be brought forward  herbert had behaved very fairly well ever since the escapade of the pied rook the lad kept his promise as to betting faithfully in his uncles absence and though it had not been renewed he had learnt enough good sense to keep out of mischief  unfortunately however he had not the faculty of passing examinations he was not exactly stupid or idle but any kind of study was a bore to him and the knowledge he was forced to get up was not an acquisition that gave him the slightest satisfaction for its own sake or that he desired to increase beyond what would carry him through  naturally he had more cleverness than his uncle and learning was less difficult to him but he only used his ability to be sooner done with a distasteful task which never occupied his mind for a moment after it was thrown aside  thus time after time he had failed in passing for the army and now only one chance remained before being reduced to attempting to enter the militia  and suppose that there he failed  he remained in an amiable passive goodhumoured state rather amused than otherwise at his mothers impression that it was somehow all his uncles fault and ready to be disposed of exactly as they pleased provided that he had not the trouble of thinking about it or of working extra hard  mrs morton was sure that something could be done  could not his uncle send him to oxford  then he could be a clergyman or a lawyer or anything  oh dear were there those horrid examinations there too  and then those gentlemen that belonged to the ambassadors and envoysshe was sure mr rollstone had told her any one who had connection could get that sort of appointment to what they called the civil service  what examinations again connection no good  well it was shame  what would things come to  as mr rollstone said it was mere ruin  merchants office  bah such a gentleman as her herbert was so connected  what was his uncle thinking of taking him up to put him down in that way  it was hard  and lord northmoor was thankful to the tears that as usual choked her while he begged her at present to trust to that last chance  it would be time to think what was to come next if that failed  wherewith the victim passed the window whistling merrily apparently perfectly regardless of his doom be it what it might and with mite clinging to his hand in ecstatic admiration  constance too was in question  here she was at eighteen a ladylike pleasant good girl very nicelooking sweetfaced and thoughtful having finished her course at the high school with great credit but alas it was not in the family to win scholarships  she did things well but not so brilliantly as cleverer girls having something of her uncles tardiness of power  her determination to be a governess was as decided as ever and it was first brought before her mother by an offer on lady adelas part to begin with her at once for amice who was now eleven years old  really now said mrs morton stopping short to express her offence  that is added ida equally at a loss  but what do you mean mamma said constance  i always intended to be a teacher i think it noble useful work  oh my poor child what have they brought you to  pretending such affection too  indeed mamma i have meant this always  i could not be dependent all my life you know  do listen mamma dont ida  that my lady adela should insult us that way when you are as good as she  nonsense ida  that has nothing to do with it  it is the greatest possible compliment and i am very much pleased  just to live there at her beck and call drudging at that childs lessons sneered ida  yes and when i made sure at least after all the fuss they have made with you that your aunt would present you at court and make you the young lady of the house and marry you well but theres no trust to be placed in themnone  oh mamma dont cry  i should not feel it right unless aunt mary really needed me and though she is so kind and dear she does not really  my only doubt is  you have a doubt then  yes  i should be so much fitter if i could go to one of the ladies colleges and then come back to dear little amice but now i have failed i dont like to let uncle frank spend all that money on me when i might be earning eighty pounds for myself  well you are a strange girl with no proper pride for your family said her mother  and ida chimed in yes  do you think any one will be likely to marry you or if you dont care about yourself you might at least think of me  mrs morton shed her ready tears when talking it over with lady northmoor  you see said mary gently i should like nothing better than to have dear little conny to live with me like a daughter but for one thing it would not be fair towards ida and besides it would not be good for her in case she did not marry to have wasted these years  mrs morton by no means appreciated the argument  however lord northmoor put off the matter by deciding to send constance to st hughs hall thinking she really deserved such a reward to her diligence     chapter xxviii two bundles of hay   ida was as all agreed much improved in looks style and manners by her travels  her illness had begun the work of fining her down from the bouncing heartiness of her girlhood and she really was a handsome creature with dark glowing colouring her figure had improved whether because or in spite of her efforts in that way might be doubtful and she had learnt how to dress herself in fairly good taste  though neither mademoiselle gattoni nor the boardinghouse society she had frequented was even secondrate in style still there was an advance over her former westhaven circle with a good deal more restraint so that she had almost insensibly acquired a much more ladylike air and deportment  moreover the two years absence had made some changes  the young men who had been in the habit of exchanging noisy jests with ida had mostly drifted away in different directions or sobered down girl companions had married off and a new terrace had been completed with inhabitants and sojourners of a somewhat higher grade who accepted mrs and miss morton as well connected  mr rollstones lodgings were let to mr deyncourt a young clergyman who had come full of zeal to work up the growing district  he had been for a short time in the northmoor neighbourhood and had taken the duty there for a few weeks so that he heard the name of morton as prominent in good works and had often seen lady adela and constance with the sundayschool  as mr rollstone was not slow to mention the connection he was not slow to call on mrs morton and miss morton in hopes of their cooperation and as mr rollstone had informed them that he was of high family and of good private means mrs morton had a much better welcome for him than for his poor little predecessor who lived over a shoemakers shop and as she averred never came except to ask subscriptions for some nonsense or other  mr deyncourt was a tall finelooking man and did not begin by asking subscriptions but talked about northmoor constance and lady adela so that ida found herself affecting much closer knowledge of both than she really had  i found he said that your sister is most valuable in the sundayschool  i wonder if you would kindly assist us  mrs morton began my daughter is not strong mr deyncourt  and ida simpered and said hesitating ii dont know  if poor mr brown had ever been demented enough even to make the same request he would have met with a very different answer  i do not think it will be very fatiguing said mr deyncourt  do you know mrs brandon  no  i will ask her to call and explain our plans she is kind enough to let me meet the other teachers in her diningroom once a week to arrange the lessons for the sunday  there are miss selwood and mrs and miss hume  these were all in the social position in which ida was trying to establish her footing and though she only agreed to think about it her mind was pretty well made up that it would be a very different thing from the old parish school where rose rollstone used to work among a set of small tradesmens daughters  when she found herself quite the youngest and bestlooking of the party she was entirely won over  there was no necessity for speaking so as to betray ones ignorance during mr deyncourts instructions and she was a person of sufficient force and spirit to impose good order on her class and thus she actually obtained the gratitude of the young clergyman as an efficient assistant  their domiciles being so near together there were many encounters in going in and out nor were these avoided on either side  ida had a wonderful amount of questions to ask and used to lie in wait to get them solved  it was very interesting to lay them before a handsome young clergyman with a gentle voice sweet smile and ready attention and religion seemed to have laid aside that element of dulness and moping which had previously repelled her  she was embroidering a stole for easter and wanted a great deal of counsel for it and she undertook to get a basket of flowers for easter decorations from northmoor where her request caused some surprise and much satisfaction in the simple pair who never thought of connecting the handsome young mission priest with this sudden interest in the church  and mr deyncourt had no objection to drop in for afternoon tea when he was met on the sands and had to be consulted about the stole or to be asked who was worthy of broth or as time went on to choose soup and practise a duet for the mission concert that was to keep people out of mischief on the bankholiday  ida had a voice and music was the one talent she had cared to cultivate she had had good lessons during her second winter abroad and was an acquisition to the amateur company  besides what she cared for more it was a real pleasure and rest to the curate to come in and listen to her or sing with her  she had learnt what kind of things offended good taste and she set herself to avoid them and to school her mother into doing the same  what mr deyncourt thought or felt was not known though thus much was certain that he showed himself attentive enough to this promising young convert and made mrs brandon and other prudent highbred matrons somewhat uneasy  and in the midst the morna put in at westhaven and while ida was walking home from mrs brandons she encountered mr brady looking extremely well turnedout in yachting costume and smoking a short pipe  there was something very flattering in the sound of the exclamation with which he greeted her and then as they shook hands i should not have known you miss morton you are and he hesitated for a complimentsuch a stunner  what have you been doing to yourself  at the gate of the narrow garden mr deyncourt overtook them carrying idas bag of books for her  she introduced them and was convinced that they glared at each other  and there ensued a time of some perplexity but much enjoyment on idas part  mr brady reviled the parson and all connected therewith in not very choice language and the parson on his side though saying nothing seemed to her to be on the watch and gratified if not relieved when she remained steady to her parochial work  and what was her mind  personally she had come to like and approve mr deyncourt the most and to have a sense that there was satisfaction in that to which he could lead her while the better taste that had grown in her was sometimes offended almost insulted by tom bradys tendency to coarseness and to treating her not as a lady but as the westhaven belle he had honoured with his attentions two years before  yet she had an old kindness for him as her first love  and moreover he could give her eventually a title and very considerable wealth a house in london and all imaginable gaiety  while as to mr deyncourt he was not poor and had expectations but the utmost she could look to for him with confidence was northmoor vicarage after mr woodmans time and anywhere the dull sober hardworking life of a clergymans wife  which should she choosethat is if she had her choice or if either were in earnest  she was not sure of the curate and therefore perhaps longed most that he should come to the point feeling that this would anyway increase her selfesteem and if she hesitated to bind herself to a life too high and perhaps too dull there was the dread on the other hand that his family who she understood were very grand people would object to a girl with nothing of her own and a governess sister  on the other hand the bradys were so rich that they had little need to care for fortuneonly the richer people were the greater their expectationsand she was more at ease with tom than with mr deyncourt they would probably condone the want of fortune if she could write honourable before her name or had any prospect of so doing and the governessship might be a far greater drawback in their eyes than in those of the deyncourts  however thank goodness said she to herself that wont begin for two or three years and one or other will be hailed long before thatif  oh it is very hard to be kept out of everything by an old stick like uncle frank and a little wretch like mite who after all is a miserable tyrolese and not a morton at all  it really is too bad     chapter xxix jones or rattler   when lord northmoor had occasion to be in london he usually went alone for to take the whole party was too expensive and not good for little michael  besides bertha morton had so urgently begged him to regard her house as always ready for him that the habit had been established of taking up his quarters there  some important measures were coming on after easter and he had some other business so that in the form of words of which she longed to cure him he told her that he was about to trespass on her hospitality for a week or fortnight  as long as ever you please she said  i am glad to have some one to sit opposite to me and tell me home news and they met at the station she having been on an expedition on her own account so that they drove home together  no sooner were they within the house door than the parlourmaid began that man has been here again maam  what jones said bertha in evident annoyance  yes maam and i am sorry to say he saw little cea  the child had run down after me when i answered the door and he asked her if she did not know her own father and if she would come with him  no she says im miss mortons and he broke out with his ugly laugh and says he you be be you you unnatural little vagabondthose were his very words maambut a father is a father and if he gives up his rights he must know the reason why  he wanted me the goodfornothing to give him half a sovereign at once or he would take off the child on the spot but by good luck she had been frightened and run away the dear and i had got the door between me and him so i told him to be off till you came home or i would call for the police  so he was off for that time  quite right alice said miss morton and then leading the way upstairs and throwing herself down on a chair she exclaimed there it ought to be a triumph to you northmoor  you told me that i should have trouble about poor little ceas father the brute  is he levying blackmail on you  yes  it is horribly weak of me i know and i can scarcely believe it of myself but one cant abandon a child to a wretch like that and he has the law on his side  are you quite sure of that  he deserted her i think you said  if you could establish that or prove a conviction against him  oh i know she might be sent to an industrial school if i took it before a magistrate but if the other alternative would be destruction that would be misery to her  see and there was a little tap at the door come in cea  there make your curtsey to his lordship  a pretty little fairhaired palecheeked girl daintily but simply dressed came in and made her curtsey very prettily and replied nicely to lord northmoors goodnatured greeting and information that michael had sent her a basket of primroses and a cowslip ball which she would find in the hall  what do you say cea said bertha anxious to demonstrate her manners  thank you my lord and master michael she uttered but she was evidently preoccupied with what she had to tell miss morton  ohm there was such a nasty man here  and he wanted me and said he was my father but he wasnt  he was the same man that gave master mite and me the bullseyes when we were naughty and louisa went away  are you sure cea both exclaimed but to the child of six the very eagerness of the question brought a certain confusion and though more gently lord northmoor asked her to describe him she could not do it and indeed she had been only five when the encounter had taken place  the urgency of the inquiry somehow seemed to dispose her to cry as if she thought she had been naughty and she had to be dismissed to the cowslip ball  if the child is right that man cannot be her father at all said lord northmoor  that mans name is rattler and he is well known at westhaven  should you know him  i never saw him but i could soon find those who have done so  if we could only prove it  oh what a relief it would be  i dare not even send the child to schoolas i meant to do northmoor for indeed we dont spoil herfor fear she should be kidnapped and i dont know if the schoolboard officer wont be after her and i cant give as a reason for fear she should be stolen by her father  not exactly  it ought to be settled once for all  perhaps the child will tell more when you have her alone  is not rattler only too like a nickname or is he a native of westhaven  this lord northmoor thought he could find out but the dinner was hardly over before a message came that the man jones had called again  perhaps i had better see him alone said the guest and bertha was only too glad to accept the offer so he proceeded to the little room opening into the hall where interviews with tradesfolk or petitioners were held  the man had a blue jersey a cap and an evidently sailor air or rather that of the coasting lower stamp of seaman but he was tall rather handsome and youngerlooking than would have been expected of ceas father  he looked somewhat taken aback by the appearance of a gentleman but he stood his ground  so i understand that you have been making demands upon miss morton lord northmoor began  well sir my lord a father has his feelings  there is a situation offered me in canada and i intend to take the little girl with me  oh indeed  and there was a pause  or if the lady has taken a fancy to her id not baulk her for a sum down of twenty or fiveandtwenty once for all  oh indeed again then what do you say is the childs name  jones my lord  her christian name i mean  he scratched his head  cissy my lordceliacecilia  blest if im sure as he watched the expression of the questioner  you see the women has such fine names and she was always called baby when her poor mother was alive  where was she baptized  well you see my lord the womenfolk does all that and i was at sea and by and by i comes home to find my poor wife dead and the little one gone  i suppose you are aware that you can have no legal claim to the child without full proof of her belonging to youthe certificate of your marriage and a copy of the register of her birth  the man was scarcely withheld from imprecations upon the work that was made about it when miss morton had been quite satisfied on a poor fellows word  yes ladies may be satisfied for a time but legally more than your word is required and you will remember that unless you can bring full proof that this is your child there is such a thing as prosecution for obtaining money on false pretences  and how is a poor fellow to get the fees for them register clerks and that said the man in a tone waxing insolent  i will be answerable for the fees if you will tell me where the certificates are to be applied for  well how is a cove to know what the women did when he was at sea  she died at rotherhithe anyway so the child will be registered there  and the marriage  you were not at sea then i suppose  but the man averred that there were so many churches that there was no telling one from another and with a knowing look declared that the gals were so keen after a man that they put up the banns and hauled him where they would  he was at last got rid of undertaking to bring the proofs of his paternity without which lord northmoor made it clear to him that he was to expect neither child nor money  i greatly doubt whether you will see any more of him said lord northmoor when describing the interview  oh frank cried bertha calling him thus for the first time i do not know how to thank you enough  you have done me an infinite kindness  do not thank me yet he answered for though i do not in the least believe that this fellow is the childs father he may find his way to the certificates or get them forged and it would be well to trace what has become of the real jones as well as to make out about this rattler is it true that the wife died at rotherhithe  quite true poor thing  i believe they had lived there since the marriage  i will run down there if you can give me the address and see if i can make out anything about her husband and see whether any one can speak to his identity with this man  you are a man of gold  to think of your taking all this trouble  i only hope i may succeed  it is a return to old habits of hunting up evidence  bertha was able to give the address of the lodginghouse where poor mrs jones had died and the next morning produced another document which had been shut up in the bible that had been rescued for the child namely the marriage lines of david jones and lucy smith at the parish church of the last lord northmoors residence in town  to expect a clergyman or clerk to remember the appearance of a bridegroom eight years ago was too much even if they were the same who had officiated but bertha undertook to try and likewise to consult a former fellowservant of poor lucy who was supposed to have abetted her unfortunate courtship  frank after despatching a letter of inquiry to his sisterinlaw about sam rattler set forth by train and river steamer for rotherhithe  when they met again in the evening bertha had only made out from the fellowservant that the stoker was rather small and had a reddish beard and hair wherewith ceas complexion corresponded  the rotherhithe discoveries had gone farther  lord northmoor had penetrated to the doleful den where the poor woman had died and no wonder for it seemed as bertha had warned him a nest of fever and horrible smells  the landlady remembered her death which had been made memorable by miss mortons visits but knew not whence she had come though stimulated by halfacrown she mentioned a small grocery shop where more might be learnt  there the woman did recollect mrs jones as a very decent lady and likewise her being in better lodgings until deserted by her husband the scamp who had gone off in an australian steamer  at these lodgings the inquiry resulted in the discovery of the name of the steamer and there was still time to look up the agent and the date approximately enough to obtain the list of the crew with david jones among them  it further appeared that this same david jones had fallen overboard and been drowned but as he had not entered himself as a married man his wife had remained in ignorance of his fate  it was however perfectly clear that the little girl was an orphan and that bertha might be quite undisturbed in the possession of her  and thus lord northmoor came home a good deal fagged and shocked by the interior he had seen at rotherhithe but quite triumphant  bertha was delighted and declared herself eternally grateful to him and she could not but entertain the hope that the soidisant parent would make another application in which case she was quite prepared to give him into custody and she proceeded to reckon up the number of times that he had applied to her and the amount that he had extracted wondering at herself for not having asked for proofs but owning that she had been afraid of being thus compelled to give up the child to perdition  the applications had all been within the last year so that the man had probably learnt from louisa hall the nurserymaid that cea was the child of a deserted wife  a letter from mrs morton gave some of the antecedents of sam rattler as learnt from mrs hall the charwoman whose great dread he was  his real surname was jones and he was probably a samuel jones whose name lord northmoor had noted as a boy on board davids ship  he belonged to a decent family in a country village but had run away to sea and was known at westhaven by this nickname  he had a brother settled in canada who had lately written to propose to him a berth on one of the ontario steamers and it was poor mrs halls dread that her daughter should accompany him though happily want of money prevented it  as to his appearance as to which there had been special inquiries he was a tall finelooking man with a black beard and half the girls at westhaven were fools enough to be after him  all this tallied with what had been gathered from the child and this last had probably been a bold attempt to procure the passagemoney for his sweetheart  he never did call again having probably been convinced of the failure of his scheme and scenting danger so that every day for a fortnight bertha met her cousin with a disappointed no rattler     chapter xxx scarlet fever   there was a meeting of one of the many charitable societies to which bertha had made lord northmoor give his name and she persuaded him to stay on another day for it though he came down in the morning with a sore throat and heavy eyes and contrary to his usual habits lay about in an easychair and dozed over the newspaper all the morning  when he found himself unable to eat at luncheon she allowed that he was not fit for the meeting but demurred when he declared that he should go home at once that afternoon to let mary nurse his cold  the instinct of getting back to wife and home were too strong for bertha to contend with and he started telegraphing to northmoor to be met at the station  perhaps there were delays as in his oppressed and dazed state he had mistaken the trains for he did not arrive at home till nine oclock instead of seven and then he looked so ill as he stumbled into the hall dazzled by the lights that mary looked at him in much alarm  yes he said hoarsely i have a bad cold and sore throat and i thought i had better come home at once  indeed you had  if only you have not made it worse by the journey  which apparently he had done for he could scarcely swallow the warm drinks brought to him and had such a night that when steps were heard in the house he said  mary dear dont let mite come in  i am afraid it is too late to keep you away but if i had felt like this yesterday i would have gone straight to the fever hospital  oh no no what should you do but come home to me  was it that horrible place at rotherhithe  perhaps  it is just a fortnight since and i felt a strange shudder and chill as i was talking  but it may be nothing only keep mite away till i have seen trotman  my mary dont look like that  it may be nothing and we have been very happythank god  poor mary in a choking state hurried away to send for the doctor and to despatch orders to nurse eden to confine master michael to the nursery and garden for the present her sinking and foreboding heart forbidding her to approach the child herself  the verdict of the doctor confirmed these alarms for all the symptoms of scarlet fever had by that time manifested themselves  mary had gone through the disease long before and had nursed through more than one outbreak at miss langs so her husband might take the comfort of knowing that there was little anxiety on her account though the doctor evidently expecting a severe attack insisted on sending in a trained nurse to assist her  as the little boy had fortunately been in bed and asleep long before his father came home there was as yet no danger of infection for him though he must be sent out of the house at once  lady adela was not at home and mary would have doubted about sending him to the cottage even if she had been there so she quickly made up her mind that eden and the young nurserymaid should take him at once to westhaven to be either in the hotel or at northmoor cottage according as his aunt should decide  how little she had thought when she heard him say his prayers and exchanged kisses with him at the side of his little bed that it was the last time for many a long day and that her hungry spirit would have to feed itself on that last smile and kiss of the fat hand as she looked out of her husbands window as the carriage drove away  lady adela knew too well what it was to be desolate not to come home so as to be at hand though she left her little daughter at her uncles bertha came on the following day  i feel as if it were all my doing she said  i could not bear it if it does not go well with him after being the saving of poor little cea  there is nothing to reproach yourself with said soberminded lady adela  neither you nor he could guess that he was running into infection  no said bertha of course one never thinks of such things with grownup people especially one whom one has always thought of as a stick and to whom perhaps ascribed some of its toughness she added smiling but he did come home looking very white and wornout and complained of horrible smells  no dear man he was far too punctilious to use the word he only said that he should like to send the sanitary commission down the alley  i ought to have dosed him with brandy on the spot for of course he was too polite to ask for it so i only gave him a cup of tea said bertha with an infinite tone of scorn in the name of the beverage  will it be any comfort to tell you that most likely it would have been too late even if he would have accepted it  come bertha how often are we told that we are not to think so much of consequences as of actions and there was nothing blameworthy in the whole business  except that i was such a donkey as not to have begun by asking for the mans proofs but i was so much afraid that he would pounce on the child that i only thought of buying him off from time to time  i did not know i was so weak  well at any rate with little mite to the fore the place will be left in good hands  i like herbert on the whole but to have that woman reigning as madame mere would be awful  nay i trust we are not coming to that  trotman says it is a thoroughly severe attack but not abnormally malignant as he calls it  it is a matter of nursing he tells me and that he has of the besta matter of nursing and of prayer and that added adela her eyes filling with tears i am sure he has  and yetand yet bertha broke off  ah you are thinking how we prayed before  and yet birdie after these six years of seeing his rule and recognising what mine would have been i see it was for the best that my own little michael was taken to his happy home  youll call it for the best now said bertha grimly  if it be so it will prove itself but i really do not see any special cause for extra fear  lady adela and bertha both thought themselves as far safe as any one can be with scarlet fever and would gladly have taken a share in the nursing  bertha however had far too much of the whirlwind in her to be desirable in a sick house and on the principle that needless risk was wrong was never admitted within the house doors but lady adela insisted on seeing mary every day and was assured that she should be a welcome assistant in case of need but at present there was no necessity of calling in other help the form of fever being lethargic with much torpidity but no violence of delirium and requiring no more watching than the wife and nurse could give  frank never failed to know his mary and to respond when she addressed him but she was told never to attempt more than rousing him when it was needful to make him take food  he had long ago with the precaution of his legal training made every needful arrangement for her and for his son and even on the first day he had not seemed to trouble himself on these points being too heavy and oppressed for the power of looking forward  so the days rolled on in one continual watch on marys part during which she seemed only to live in the present and secure that her boy was safe would not risk direct communication with him or with his nurse  lady adela had undertaken to keep constance the person who really loved her uncle best daily informed and she also wrote at intervals to mrs morton by special desire of lady northmoor and likewise to her own old servant eden the nurse  she wrote cheerfully but eden had other correspondents in the servants hall who dwelt sensationally on the danger as towards whitsun week the fever began to run higher towards the crisis the strength was reduced the torpor became heavier and anxiety increased as to whether there would be power of rally in a man who though healthy had never been strong  the anxiety manifested by the entire neighbourhood was a notable proof of the estimation in which the patient was held and was very far from springing only from pity or humanity  half the people who came to lady adela for further information had some cause going on in which that stick was one of the most efficient of props     chapter xxxi mite   little michael morton was in the meantime installed in his aunts house for him to be anywhere else was not to be thought of and mrs morton was softhearted enough to be very fond of such a bright little boy so much in her own hands and very amusing with the oldfashioned formal ways derived from chiefly consorting with older people  besides the pretty little fellow was an object of great interest to all her acquaintances especially as it was understood at westhaven that it was only too possible that he might any day become lord northmoor and never had mrs mortons drawingroom been so much resorted to by visitors anxious for bulletins or perhaps more truly for excitement  mite was a young gentleman of some dignity  he sat elevated on a hassock upon a chair to dine at luncheontime comporting himself most correctly but his aunt was sorely chafed at edens standing behind his chair like sanchos physician to regulate his diet and placing her veto upon lobsters cucumbers pastry and glasses of wine with lumps of sugar in them  it amounted to a trial of strength between aunt and nurse  michael submitted once or twice when told that his mamma would not approve but the lobster struck him with extreme amazement and admiration and he could not believe but that the red longwhiskered monster was not as good as he was beautiful  he has got a glove like what peter wears to cut the holly hedge exclaimed the boy to the general amusement  wheres his hand  my mite shall have a bit of his funny hand said mrs morton and ida was dealing with the claw when eden interposed and said she did not think her ladyship would wish master michael to have any  just a taste nurse with some of the cream said mrs morton  here mitey dear  no master michael mamma would say no said eden  really eden you might let mrs morton judge in her own house said ida  master morton is under my charge maam and i am responsible for him said eden respectfully but firmly  but ida held out the claw and michael made a dart at it  eden again said no but he looked up at her with an exulting roguish grin and clasped it whereupon she laid hold of him by the waist and bore him off kicking and roaring amid the pitiful and indignant exclamations of his aunt and cousin  it may be that the faithful eden was somewhat wanting in tact by her determined attention to the routine that chafed her hosts but she had been forced to come away without directions and could only hold fast to the discipline of her wellordered nursery under all obstacles  master michael was to have his cup of milk and run on the beach with the nurserymaid long before the usual awakening of the easygoing household which regarded late hours as belonging to gentility then after the general breakfast his small lessons over which there often was a battle first because he felt injured by not doing them with his mother and next because his hostesses regarded them as a hardship and taught him to cry over reading without tears besides detaining him as late as they could over the breakfast or proposing to take him out at once without waiting for that quarter of an hours work  or when outofdoors they would not bring him home for the siesta on which his nurse insisted though it was often only lying down in the dark nor had mrs morton any scruple in breaking it if she wanted to exhibit him to her friends though if it were interrupted or omitted the childs temper was the worse all the afternoon  that nurse is a thorough tyrant over the poor little darling and a very impertinent woman besides said mrs morton  a regular little spoiled brat ida declared him  while certainly the worse his father was said to be the more his aunt tried to spoil and indulge him as a relief to her pity and grief  he had missed his home and parents a good deal at first had cried at his lessons and cried more at not having father to carry him to the nursery nor mother to hear him say his prayers and kiss him at night but time wore off the association and he was full of delight at the sea the ships the little crabs and all the other charms of the shore  above all he was excited about the little boys  his own kind had never come in his way before his chief playfellow being amice who was so much older as to play with him condescendingly and always give way to him there was a large family in a neighbouring lodging containing what he respectfully called big knickerbocker boys who excited his intense admiration and drew him like a magnet  for once mrs morton and eden were agreed as to the propriety of the companionship since rollstone had pronounced them of high family and the governess who was in charge of them was quite ready to be interested in the solitary little stranger even if he had not been the honourable michael  so was the elder girl of the party but unluckily michael was just of the age to be a great nuisance to children who played combined and imaginative games which he could not yet understand  when they were making elaborate approaches to a sand fortification erected with great care and pains he would dash on it with a coup de main break it down at once with his spade and stand proudly laughing and mixing up the ruins together heedless of the howls of anger of the besiegers and believing that he had done the right thing  and once when a wrathful boy of eight had shaken the troublesome urchin as he would have done his own junior had this last presumed to stir up his clear pool of curiosities most of the female portion of the family had taken the part of the intruder and cried shame on any one who could hurt or molest a poor dear little boy away from a father who was so ill  thus the lincoln family for the sake of peace and selfdefence used sedulously to flee at the approach of mite and seek for secluded coves to which he was not likely to penetrate  mr rollstone was edens great solace  they discovered that they had once been staying in the same countryhouse and had a great number of common acquaintances in the upperservant world and they entirely agreed in their estimate of mrs morton and ida whom mr rollstone pronounced to be neither fish flesh nor fowl though as for miss constance she was a lady all over and always had been and there might have been hopes for mr herbert if only he could have got into the army  to sit with mr rollstone whom the last winters rheumatics had left very infirm was edens chief afternoon employment as she could not follow her charges wanderings on the beach but had to leave him to the nurserymaid ellen  the old butler wanted much to show miss eden his daughter who took advantage of whitsunday and the bankholiday to run down and see her parents though at the next quarter she was coming home for good extremely sorry to leave her advantages in london and the friends she had made there but feeling that her parents needed her so much that she must pursue her employment at home  they were all very anxious on that whitsunday and rose carried with her something of constances feeling as with tears in her eyes she looked at the little fellow at the childrens service standing by his nurse with wide open inquiring eyes chiefly fixed upon willie lincoln in satisfaction whenever an answer proceeded from that object of his unrequited attachment  with the young maidens love of revelling in supposed grief rose already pitied the fairfaced unconscious child as fatherless and weighted with heavy responsibilities  another pair of eyes looked at the boy not with pity but indignant impatience  perhaps even already that little pretender was the only obstacle between herbert and the coronet that was his by right between ida herself and  ida had walked from the school to the church with mr deyncourt and he had talked so gently and pitifully of the family distress and assumed so much grief on her part that his sympathy made her heart throb above all when he told her that his two sisters were coming to stay with him mrs rollstone had contrived to make room for them and they would show her better than he could some of the plans he wished to have carried out with the little children  so he wished to introduce her to his sisters  what did that mean  if the deyncourts were ever so high they could not sneer at lord northmoors sisters  then she thought of many a novel and in real life of what she believed respecting that lost lover of miss mortons  and later in the day tom brady lounged up to northmoor cottage and leaning with one elbow on the windowsill while the other arm held away the pipe he had just taken from his lips he asked if they would give him a cup of tea the whole harbour was so full of such beastly staring cads that there was no peace there  one ought to give such places a wide berth at whitsuntide  i wonder you did not said ida as she hastened to compound the tea  forgot it he lazily droned forgot it  attractions you know and as she brought the cup to the window with a lump of sugar in the tongs when sugar fingers are and the speech ended in a demonstration at the fingers that made ida laugh blush and say oh for shame mr brady  you had better come in mr brady called mrs morton  you cant drink it comfortably there and youll be upsetting it  we are down in the diningroom today because  the cause necessary to her gentility was lost as ida proceeded to let him in at the front door and he presently deposited himself on the sofa grumbling complacently at the bore of holidays especially bank holidays his crew would have been ready to strike he declared if he had taken them out of harbour or he would have asked the ladies to come on a cruise out of the way of it all  why thank you very much mr brady but really in my poor brother lord northmoors state i dont know that it would be etiquette  ah yes  by the bye hows the governor  very sad strength failing  i hardly expect to hear he is alive tomorrow and mrs mortons handkerchief was raised  oh ay sad enough you know  i say will it make any difference to you  my poor dear brother  well it ought you know  indeed it would if it had not been for that dear little boy  my poor herbert  it must have been an awful sell for him  yes said ida and some people think there was something very odd about it allthe child being born out in the dolomites with nobody there  dont ida i cant have you talk so protested her mother  supposititious by all thats lucky  i should strangle him and mr brady put back his head and laughed a loud and hearty laugh by no means elegant but without much sound of truculent intentions     chapter xxxii a shock   it was on the thursday of whitsunweek when lady adela and bertha came down from their visit of inquiry a little more hopeful than on the previous day though they could not yet say that recovery was setting in  but a great shock awaited them  the parlourmaid met them at the door pale and tearful  oh my lady mrs edens come and  poor eden herself was in the hall and nothing was to be heard but oh my lady and another tempest of sobs  come in eden scolded bertha in her impatience  dont keep us in this way  what has happened to the child  let us have it at once  the worst or you wouldnt be here  for all answer eden held up a little wooden spade a sailor hat and a shoe showing traces of sand and seawater  it is so then said lady adela  oh his mother  but after that one wail she thought of the poor woman before her i am sure you are not to blame eden  oh my lady if i could but feel that  but that i should have trusted the darling out of my sight for a moment  presently they brought her to a state in which she could tell her lamentable history  she had been spending the afternoon at mr rollstones leaving master michael as usual in the care of the underling ellen and after that she knew no more till neither child nor maid came home at his suppertime and mrs morton was slowly roused to take alarm while eden half distracted wandered about seeking her charge and found ellen calling and shouting in vain for him  ellen confessed that she had seen him running after the lincoln children and supposing him with them had given herself up to the study of a penny dreadful in company with another young nursemaid  when they had awakened to real life the first idea had been that he must be with these children but they were gone and ellen fancying that he might have gone home with them asked at their lodging but no he was not there  the tide was by this time covering the beach and driving away the miserable maids with the aunt cousin and others who had been on the fruitless quest  no more could be done then and they went home with desolation in their hearts  miss ida as eden declared stayed out long after everybody else when it was clearly of no use and came back so tired and upset that she went up straight to bed  there was still a hope that some one might have met the little boy and taken him home unable clearly to make out to whom he belonged more especially as the lincolns in terror and compunction had confessed that they had seen him and his nurse from a distance and had rushed headlong round a projecting rock into a cove hoping that he had not seen them because he was so tiresome and spoilt all their games  and when that morning the spade hat and shoe were discovered upon the shore not far from the very rock the poor children had to draw plenty of morals on the consequences of selfishness no doubt that poor little michael had pursued them barefooted and gone too near the waves  there was nothing more but the forlorn hope that the waves would restore the little body they had carried off and mrs morton was watching for that last sad satisfaction  in case of that contingency ellen as the last person known to have seen the boy had been left at westhaven in agonies of despair vowing that she would never speak to any one nor look at a storybook again in her life  she had attempted the excuse that she thought she saw miss ida going in that direction but the young lady had declared that she had never been on the beach at all that afternoon till after the alarm had been given and had been extremely angry with ellen for making false excuses and trying to shift off the blame and the girl had been much terrified and owned that she was not at all sure  and oh my lady entreated eden dont send me up to the house  dont make me face her ladyship  i should die of it  we must think what is to be done about that said lady adela  can you tell whether any one from the house has seen you  eden thought not and after she had been consigned to her friend lady adelas maid to be rested fed and comforted as far as might be possible the sistersinlaw held sad counsel and agreed that it was not safe to keep back the terrible news from the poor mother who expected daily tidings of her child and might hear some report in spite of her shutup state  poor adela i pity you almost as much as her said bertha  oh i know now how much i have to be thankful for  no uncertaintyand my little ones grave  besides amice  let me drive you up addie  your heart is beating enough to knock you down  well i believe it is  but not up to the front door  i will go in by the garden  oh may he be spared to her at least  very pale then lady adela crept in meeting a weeping maid who was much relieved to see her but was hardly restrained from noisy sobs  mr trotman she said had come just before the garden boy had inevitably dashed up with the tidings and the household had been waiting till he came out to secure that he should be near when lady northmoor was told  adela felt that this might be the safest opportunity and sent a message to the door to beg that her ladyship would come and speak to her for a few minutes in the study  marys soft step was soon there and her lips were framing the words no ground lost when at sight of adelas face the light went out of her eyes and setting herself firmly on her feet she said you have bad news  my boy  adela came near and would have taken her hand sayingmy poor marybut she clasped them both as if to hold herself together and said the fever  no nosadder still  drowned  ah then there was not all that suffering and without me thankworthy  oh no no pleaseas lady adela with eyes brimming over would have pressed her to her bosomdontdont upset me or i could not attend to frank  it all turns on this one day they say and i musti must be as usual  there will be time enough to know all about itifwith a long oppressed gasphe is saved from the hearing it  i think you are right dear said adela if you keep him but she could not go on  well any way said mary either he will be given back or he will be saved this  let me go back to him please  then at the door putting her hand to her headwho is here  poor eden  ah let her and emma know that i am sure it is not their fault  come again tomorrow please i think he will be better  she went away in that same gliding manner perfectly tearless  adela waited to see the doctor who assured her that the patient had rather gained than lost during the last twentyfour hours and that if he could be spared from any shock or agitation he would probably recover  lady northmoor seemed so entirely absorbed by his critical state that she was not likely to betray the sad knowledge she had put aside in the secret chamber of her heart more especially as her husband was still too much weighed down and too slumberous to be observant or to speak much and knowing the child to be out of the house he did not inquire for him  nevertheless mr trotman gladly approved of lady adelas intention of sleeping in the house in case of any sudden collapse and the servants who were not to let lady northmoor know evidently felt this a great relief  yes it is a comfort to think some one will be within that poor things reach said bertha as they went back together and if you can bear it you are the right person  she will not let herself dwell on it  she never even looked at mrs mortons letter  and i really hope they wont find the poor little dear to have all the fuss and heartrending  oh birdie  theres only one thing that would make me wish it  im quite sure that that miss ida knows more about it than she owns  no you need not say oh birdie again i dont suspect her of the deed but i do believe she saw the boy and kept out of his way and now wants that poor ellen to have all the blame  you will believe nothing against a girl out of an orphanage  i had rather any day believe ellen mole than ida morton  theres something about that girl which has always revolted me  i would never trust her farther than i could see her  prejudice birdie because she is in bad style  you to talk of prejudice addie who hardly knew how to go on living here under the poor stick  dont birdie  he has earned esteem by sheer goodness  poor man i dont know what to wish for him when i think of the pang that awaits him  you know what to wish for yourself and northmoor  not but that herbert may come to good if he doesnt come into possession for many a long year  and now i must write to that poor child constance  but oh bertha dont condemn hastily  havent i had enough of that     chapter xxxiii darkness   full a week later frank looked up from his pillow and said i wonder when it will be safe to have mite back  mary sweet what is it  i have been sure something was burthening you  come and tell me  if he has the fever you must go to him  no as she clasped his hand and laid her face down on the pillow  ah frank he does not want us any more  my mary my poor mary have you been bearing such knowledge about with you  for how long  since that worst day yesterday week  oh but to see you getting better was the help  can you tell me  she told him in that low steady voice all she knew  it was very little for she had avoided whatever might break the composure that seemed so needful to his recovery and he could listen quietly partly from the lulling effect of weakness partly from his anxiety for her and the habit of selfrestraint in which all the earlier part of their lives had been passed made utterance come slowly to them  life will be different to us henceforth he once said  we have had three years of the most perfect happiness  he gave and he hath taken away  blessed  and there he stopped for he saw the working of her face  otherwise they hardly spoke of their loss even to one another  it went down deeper than they could bear to utter and their hearts and eyes met if their lips did not  only lord northmoor lay too dejected to make the steps expected in the recovery of strength for a few days after the grievous revelation and on the day when at last he was placed on a couch by the window his wife collapsed and almost unconscious was carried to her bed  it was not a severe or alarming attack and all she wanted was to be let alone but there was enough of sore throat and other symptoms to prolong the quarantine and lady adela could no longer be excluded from giving her aid  she went to and fro between the patients and comforted each with regard to the other telling the one how her husbands strength was returning and keeping the other tranquil by the assurance that what his wife most needed was perfect rest especially from the necessity of restraining herself  those eyes showed how many tears were poured forth when they could have their free course  lady adela had gone through enough to feel with ready tact what would be least jarring to each  she had persuaded bertha to go back to london both to her many avocations and to receive amice who must still be kept at a distance for some time  lord northmoor as soon as he had strength and selfcommand for it read poor mrs mortons letters and also saw eden for whom there was little fear of infection  she managed to tell her history and answer all his questions in detail but she quite broke down under his kind tone of forgiveness and assurance that no blame attached to her and that he was only grateful to her for her tender care of his child and she went away sobbing pitifully  adela came back after taking her from the room where frank was sitting in an easychair by the window and looking out on the summer garden which seemed to be stripped of all its charm and value for him  poor thing she said she is quite overcome by your kindness  i do not think any one is more to be pitied said he  no indeed but she wishes you would have heard what she had to say about the supposing ida to have gone in that direction  i thought it better not  it would not have exonerated the poor little maid from carelessness and there is no use in fostering a sense of injury or suspicion when what is done cannot be undone he said wearily  indeed you are quite right said adela earnestly  you know how to be in charity with all men  oh the needless misery of hasty unjust suspicions  then as he looked up at herdo you know our own story  only the main facts  i think you ought to know it  it accounts for so much said she moved partly by the need of utterance and partly by the sense that the turn of his thoughts might be good for him  you know what a passion for horses there has always been in this family  i knowi could have had it if my life had begun more prosperously  and you have done your best to save herbert from it  well my arthur had it to a great degree and so indeed had bertha  they were brought up to nothing else bertha was i really think a better judge than her brother she was not so reckless  they became intimate with a captain alder who was in the barracks at copingtonmuch the nicest as i used to think of the set though i was not very glad to see an attachment growing up between him and bertha  there was always such a capacity of goodness in her that i longed to see her in the way of being raised altogether  she has always been most kind to us  there is much to admire in her  her present life has developed all that is best but  she hesitated wondering whether the good simple man were sensible of that warp in the nature that she had felt  she went on then she was a masterful highspirited girl to whom it seemed inevitable to come to high words with any one about whom she cared  and i must sayshe and my husband while they were passionately fond of one another seemed to have a sort of fascination in provoking one another not only in words but in deeds ah you can hardly believe it of her  how people get tamed  well arthur bought a horse a beautiful creature but desperately vicious captain alder had been with him when he first saw it and admired it but i do not think gave an opinion against it  bertha however from the moment she saw its eyes and ears protested against it in her vehement way  i remember imploring her not to make arthur defy her but really when they got into those moods i dont think they could stop themselves and she thought captain alder encouraged him  so arthur went out on that fatal drive in the dogcart and no sooner were they out on the colbeam road than the horse bolted they came into collision with a hay waggon and  i know  captain alder was thrown on the top of the hay and not hurt  he came to prepare me to receive arthur and then went up to the house  bertha poor girl in her wild grief almost flew at him  it was all his doing she said he had egged arthur on she supposed arthur had bets  in short she knew not what she said but he left the house and never has been near her again  were they engaged  not quite formally but they understood one another and were waiting for a favourable moment with old lord northmoor who was not easy to deal with and it was far from being a good match anyway  we all thought i believe that the drive was the fault or rather the folly of captain alder and arthur was too ill to explainunconscious at firstthen not rousing himself  at last he asked for his friend and then he told me that captain alder had done all in his power to prevent his taking the creature outhad told him he had no right to endanger his life and when only laughed at had insisted on going with him in hopes i suppose of averting mischief  i wrotelord northmoor wrote to him at his quarters but our letters came back to us  we had kept no watch on the gazette and he had retired and left no address with his brotherofficers  bertha knew that his parents were dead and that he had a sister at school at clifton  i wrote to her but the mistress sent back my letter and we found that he had fetched away his sister and gone  even his money was taken from couttss as if to cut off any clue  he should not have so attended to a girl in her angry grief  no but i think there was some selfblame in him though not about that horse  i believe he thought he might have checked arthur more  and he had debts which he seems to have paid on selling out his capital  so as i have told poor bertha whenever she would let me there may have been other reasons besides her stinging words  and it has preyed on her  more than any one would guess who had not known her in old times  i was glad that you secured that child cea to her  she seems to have fastened her affections on her  alder presently repeated frank  alderi was thinking how the name had come before me  there were some clients of oursof mr burfords i meanof that name i think they sold an estate  some day i will find out whether he knows anything about them and i shall remember more by and by  it would be an immense relief if you could find out anything good about the poor fellow said adela very glad to have found any topic of interest and pleased to find that it occupied his thoughts afterwards when he asked whether she knew the christian name of this young man without mentioning any antecedent as if he had been going on with the subject all the time  in a few days the pair were able to meet and to take up again the life over which a dark veil had suddenly descended contrasting with the sunshine of those last few years  to hold up one another and do their duty on their way to the better world was evidently the one thought though they said little  still neither was yet in a condition to return to ordinary life and it was determined that as soon as they were disinfected they should leave the house to undergo the same process and spend a few weeks at some health resort  only mary shuddered at the notion of hearing the sound of the sea and malvern was finally fixed upon  lady adela would go with them and she wrote to beg that constance so soon as her term was over might bring amice thither to be in a separate lodging at first till there had been time to see whether the little girls company would be a solace or a trial to the bereaved parents  bertha as soon as the chief anxiety was over joined mrs bury in a mountaineering expedition  she declared that she had never dared to leave cea before lest the wretched father now proved to be a myth should come and abstract the child     chapter xxxiv the phantom of the station   there was a crash in mrs mortons kitchen where an elegant five oclock tea was preparing not only to greet herbert who had just come home to await the news of his fate after the last military examination open to him but also for a friend or two of his mothers who to his great annoyance might be expected to drop in on any wednesday afternoon  every one ran out to see what was the matter and the maid was found picking up mrs mortons silver teapot the basketwork handle of which had suddenly collapsed under the weight of tea and tealeaves  the mistresss exclamations and objurgation of the maid for not having discovered its frail condition need not be repeated  it had been a weddingpresent and was her great pride  after due examination to see whether there were any bruises or dents she said  well ida we must have yours run and fetch it out of the box  you have the key of it  and she held out the key of the cupboard where the spoons were daily taken out by herself or ida  the teapot had been left to ida by a godmother who had been a farmers wife with a small legacy but was of an unfashionable make and seldom saw the light  that horrid great clumsy thing said ida  you had much better use the blue china one  ill never use that crockery for company when theres silver in the house  what would mrs denham say if she dropped in  i wont pour out tea in that ugly heavy brute of a thing  then if you wont i will  give me the key this instant  it is mine and i am not going to give it up  come ida said herbert weary of the altercation any one would think you had made away with it  let us have it for peaces sake  its no business of yours  he whistled  however at that moment the doorbell rang  it was to admit a couple of old ladies whom both the young people viewed as very dull company and the story of the illness of my brother lord northmoor as related by their mother had become very tedious so that as soon as possible they both sauntered out on the beach  i wonder when uncle will send for you ida said  he must give you a good allowance now  dont talk of it ida it makes me sick to think of it  i sayis that the old red rock where they saw the last of the poor little kid  yes that was where his hat was  did you find it  was it washed up  dont talk of such dreadful things bertie i cant bear it  and theres rose rollstone  ida would have done her utmost to keep her brother and rose rollstone apart at any other time but she was at the moment only too glad to divert his attention and allowed him without protest to walk up to rose shake hands with her and rejoice in her coming home for good but do what ida would she could not keep him from recurring to the thought of the little cousin of whom he had been very fond  such a jolly little kid he said and full of spirit  you should have seen him when i picked him up before me on the cob  how he laughed  so good too said rose  he looked so sweet with those pretty brown eyes and fair curls at church that last sunday  i cant make out how it was  the tide could not have been high enough to wash him off going round that rock or the other children would not have gone round it  oh i suppose he ran after a wave said ida hastily  do you know said rose mysteriously i could have declared i saw him that very evening and with his nurserymaid too  nonsense rose  we dont believe in ghosts said ida  it was not like a ghost said rose  you know i had come down for the bankholiday and went back to finish my quarter at the art embroidery well when we stopped at the north westhaven station i saw a man woman and child get in and it struck me that the boy was master michael and the woman louisa hall  i think she looked into the carriage where i was and i was going to ask her where she was taking him  nonsense rose  how can you listen to such folly herbert  but thats not all  i saw them again under the gas when i got out  i was very near trying to speak to her but i lost sight of her in the throng but i saw that face so like master michael only scared and just ready to cry  youll run about telling that fine ghoststory said ida roughly  but louisa could not have been a ghost said rose bewildered  i thought she was his nurserymaid taking him somewhere  didnt she then with a sudden flashoh  turned off long ago for flirting with that scamp rattler said herbert now she has run off with him  there was a sailorlooking man with her said rose  i never heard such intolerable nonsense burst out ida  mere absurdity  herbert looked at her with surprise at the strange passion she exhibited he asked  did you say the hall girl had run away  oh never mind herbert cried ida as if unable to command herself what is it to you what a nasty horrid girl like that does  hold your tongue ida he said resolutely  if you wont speak let rose  she did said rose in a low anxious terrified voice  i only heard it since i came home  she was married at the registrars office to that man jones whom they call the rattler and went off with him  it must have been her whom i saw really and truly and oh herbert could she have been so wicked as to steal master michael  somebody else has been wicked then said herbert laying hold of his sisters arm  i dont know what all this means exclaimed ida in great agitation nor what you and rose are at  making up such horrible abominable insinuations against me your poor sister  but rose rollstone always hated me  she does not know what she is saying sighed rose and with much delicacy she moved away  let me go herbert cried ida as she felt his grip on her hand  not i idatill you have answered me  is this sothat michael is not drowned but carried off by that woman demanded herbert holding her fast and looking at her with manly gravity not devoid of horror  he is a horrid little impostor palmed off to keep you out of the title and everything  thats why i did it sobbed ida trying to wrench herself away  oh you did it did you  you confess that  and what have you done with him  i tell you he is no morton at alljust the nursewomans child taken to spite you  i found it all out atwhats its namebotzen only ma would not be convinced  i should suppose not  to think that my uncle and aunt would do such a thingwhy i dont know whether it is not worse than stealing the child  herbert  herbert do you want to bring your sister to jail talking in that way  it is no more than you deserve  i would bring you there if it is the only way to get back the child  i do not know what is bad enough for you  my poor uncle and aunt  to have brought such misery on them  he clenched his hands as he spoke  everybody said she didnt minddidnt ask questions didnt cry didnt go on a bit like his real mother  she could not or it might have been the death of my uncle  bertha wrote it all to me but youyou would never understand  ida i cant believe that you my sister could have done such an awfully wicked thing  i wouldnt only i was sure he was not  no more of that stuff said herbert  you dont know what they are  i do  so strictnot a bit like a mother  if our mother had been like them you might not have been such a senseless monster said herbert pausing for a word  come now tell me what you have done with him or i shall have to set on the police  oh herbert how can you be so cruel  it is not i that am cruel  come speak out  did you bribe her with your teapot  ah i see what has she done with him  he gripped her arm almost as he used to torture her when they were children and insisted again that either she must tell him the whole truth or he should set the police on the track  you wouldnt she said awed  think of the exposure and of mother  i can think of nothing but saving mite  i saymy mother knows nothing of this  oh no no  herbert breathed more freely but he was firm and seemed suddenly to have grown out of boyishness into manly determination and gradually he extracted the whole story from her  he would not listen to the delusion in which she had worked herself into believing founded upon the negations for which she had sedulously avoided seeking positive refutation and which had been bolstered up by her imagination and wishes working on the unsubstantial precedents of novels  she had brought herself absolutely to believe in the imposture and at a moment when her uncles condition seemed absolutely to place within her grasp the coronet for herbert with all possibilities for herself  then came the idea of louisa hall inspired by seeing her speak to little michael on the beach and obtain his pretty smiles and exclamation of lou lou mine lou for he had certainly liked this girl better than ellen who was wanting in life and animation  ida knew that sam jones alias rattler was going out to join his brother in canada and that louisa was vehemently desirous to accompany him but had failed to satisfy the requirements of government as to character so as to obtain a free passage and was therefore about to be left behind in desertion and distress  she might beguile michael away quietly and carry him to canada where as it seemed there were any amount of farmers ready to adopt english childrena much better lot in idas eyes than the little tyrolese impostor deserved  she even persuaded herself that she was doing an act of great goodness when at the price of her teapot she obtained that louisa should be married by the registrar to sam jones and their passage paid on condition of their carrying away michael with them  the man was nothing loth having really a certain preference for louisa and likewise a grudge against lord northmoor for having spoilt that game with miss morton which might have brought the means for the voyage  they were married on whit monday and ida was warned that if she and louisa could not get possession of the child by wednesday he would be left behind  louisa was accordingly on the watch and ida hovered about just enough completely to put the nurses off their guard  they heard michaels imploring call of willie  willie and then louisa descended on him with coaxings and promises and ida knew no more except that as she had desired a parcel had been sent her containing the hat and shoes the spade she had herself picked up  when rose had seen them they had no doubt been on their way to liverpool  it seemed to be herberts horrorstricken look that first showed his sister the enormity of what she had done and when she pleaded for your sake he made such a fierce sound of disgust that she only durst add further oh herbert you will not tell  not find him he thundered  no no i didnt mean that  but dont let them know about me  just think  i must think  get away now i cant bear you near  and just then a voice was heard miss hider miss hider your ma wants you     chapter xxxv the quest   herbert had made no promises but as he paced up and down the shingle after his sister had gone in he had time to feel that though he was determined to act at once the scandal of her deed must be as much as possible avoided  indeed he believed that she might have rendered herself amenable to prosecution for kidnapping the child and he felt on reflection that his mother must be spared the terror and disgrace  his difficulties were much increased by the state of quarantine at northmoor for though the journey to malvern had been decided upon neither patient was yet in a state to attempt it and as one of the servants had unexpectedly sickened with the disease all approach to the place was forbidden nor did he know with any certainty how far his uncles recovery had advanced since bertha his chief informant had gone abroad with mrs bury and constance was still at oxford  he went home and straight up to his room feeling it intolerable to meet his sister and there the first sleepless night he had ever known convinced him that to the convalescents it would be cruelty to send his intelligence when it amounted to no more than that their poor little boy had been made over to an unscrupulous woman and a violent goodfornothing man  no said herbert as he tossed over it would be worse than believing him quietly dead now they have settled down to that  i must get him back before they know anything about it  but how  i must hunt up those wretches people here and find where they are gone if they knowas like as not they wont  but ill throw everything up till i find the boy  he knelt up in his bed laid his hand on his biblehis uncles giftand solemnly swore it  and herbert was another youth from that hour  when he had brought his ideas into some little order the foremost was that he must see rose rollstone discover how much she knew or guessed and bind her to silence  no fear of her jolly little thing said he to himself but playfellows as they had been private interviews were not easy to secure under present circumstances  however the tinkling of the bell of the iron church suggested an idea she is just the little saint of a thing to be always off to church at unearthly hours  ill catch her thereif only that black coat isnt always after her  so herbert hurried off to the iron building satisfied himself with a peep that roses sailor hat was there and thento make sure of hercrept into a seat by the door and found his plans none the worse for praying for all needing help in mind body or estate  rose came out alone and he was by her side at once  i say rose you did not speak about that last night  oh no indeed  youre a brick  i got it all out of that sister of mine  im only ashamed that she is my sister  and where is the dear little boy  thats the point and herbert briefly explained his difficulties and rose agreed that he must try to learn where the emigrants had gone from their relations  and when he expressed his full intention of following them even if he had to work his passage before telling the parents she applauded the nobleness of the resolution and all the romance in her awoke at the notion of his bringing home the boy and setting him before his parents  she was ready to promise secrecy for the sake of preventing the prosecution that might as herbert saw be a terrible thing for the whole family and besides it must be confessed the two young things did rather enjoy the sharing of a secret  herbert promised to meet her the next morning and report his discoveries and plans as in fact she was the only person with whom he could take counsel  he did meet her accordingly going first to the church  he had to tell her that he had been able to make nothing of mrs hall  he was not sure whether she knew where her daughter had gone at any rate she would not own to any knowledge being probably afraid  besides when acting as charwoman master herbert had been such a torment to her that she was not likely to oblige him  he had succeeded better with the jones family and perhaps had learnt prudence for he had not begun by asking for the rattler but for the respectable brother who had invited him out and had thus learnt that the destination of the emigrant was toronto where the elder brother was employed on the british empress ontario steamer  mrs jones the mother and her eldest son were decent people and there was no reason to think they were aware of the encumbrances that their scapegrace had taken with him  so herbert had resolved without delay to make his way to toronto where he hoped to find the child and maybe bring him back in a months time  only said rose timidly did you really mean what you said about working your way out  well rose thats the hitch  i had to pay up some bills after i got my allowance and unluckily i changed my bicycle and the rascals put a lot more on the new one and i havent got above seven pounds left and i must keep some for the rail from new york and for getting home for i cant take the kid home in the steerage  the bicycles worth something and so is my watch if i put them in pawn so i think i can do it that way and im quite seaman enough to get employment only i dont want to lose time about it  i was thinking said rose shyly they made me put into the post office savings bank after i began to get a salary  i have fiveandtwenty pounds there that i could get out in a couple of days and i should be so glad to help to bring that dear little boy home  oh rose you are a girl  you see you are quite safe not to lose it for my uncle would be only too glad to pay it back even if i came to grief any way and it would make it all slick smooth  i would go to liverpool straight off and cross in the first steamer and the things done  and can you get at it at once with nobody knowing  yes i think so said rose  my father asked to see my book when first i came home and he is not likely to do so again till i can explain all about it and i am sure it cannot be wrong  wrongno  right as a trivet  rose rose if ever that poor child sees his father and mother again it is every bit your doing  no one can tell what i think of it or what my uncle and aunt will say to you  youve been the angel in this if ida has been the other thing  but rose found difficulties in the way of her angelic part for her father addressed her in his most solemn and sententious manner rose i have always looked on you as sensible and discreet but i have to say that i disapprove of your late promenades with a young man connected with the aristocracy  rose coloured up a good deal but cried out its not that papa not that  i do not suppose either you or he is capable at present of forming any definite purpose said mr rollstone not to be baulked of his discourse but you must bear in mind that any appearance of encouragement to a young man in his position can only have a most damaging effect on your prospects and even reputation however flattering he may appear  i know it papa i know it  there has been nothing of the kind i assure you said rose who during the last discourse had had time to reflect and he is going away tomorrow or next day so you need not be afraid though i must see him or send to him once more before he goes  well if you are helping him to get some present for his sisters i do not see so much objection for this once only it must not occur again  rose was much tempted to let this suggestion stand but truth forbade her and she said no papa i cannot say it is that but you will know all about it before long and you will not disapprove if you will only trust your little rose and she looked up for a kiss  well i never found you not to be trusted though you are a coaxing puss said her father and so the matter ended with him but she had another encounter with her mother  mind rose if that churchingwhich sunday was enough for any good girl in my timeis only to lead to walking with young gents which has no call to you i wont have it done  mrs rollstone was not cultivated up to her husbands mark neither had she ever inspired so much confidence and rose made simple answer it is all right mamma i have spoken to papa about it  oh if your pa knows i suppose he is satisfied but men arent the same as a mother and if that there young mr morton comes dangling and gallanting after you he is after no good  he is doing no such thing said rose in a resolutely calm voice that might have shown that she was with difficulty controlling her temper and besides he is going away  wherewith mrs rollstone had to be satisfied  rose took a bold measure when she had taken her five fivepound notes from the savings bank  she saw her father preparing to waddle out for his daily turn on the beach and she put the envelope containing them addressed to h morton esq into his hand begging him to give it to mr morton himself  which he did when he met herbert trying to soothe his impatience with a cigar  here sir he said my daughter wishes me to give you this  i dont ask what it is mind but i tell you plainly i dont like secrets between young people  herbert tried to laugh naturally then said your daughter is no end of a trump mr rollstone  only recollect this siri know my station and i know yours and i will have no nonsense with her  all right said herbert shortly with a laugh his head too full of other matters to think what all this implied  he wished to avoid exciting any disturbance so he told his mother that he should be off again the next day  it is very hard grumbled mrs morton that you can never be contented to stay with your poor mother  i did hope that with the regatta and the yachts and mr brady you would find amusement enough to give us a little of your company but nothing is good enough for you now  which of your fine friends are you going to  herbert was not superior to an evasion and said im going up to town first and shall see dacre and ill write by and by  she resigned herself to the erratic movements of the son who being again in her eyes heir to the peerage was to her like a comet in a higher sphere     chapter xxxvi idas confession   the move to malvern was at last made and the air seemed at once to invigorate lord northmoor though the journey tried his wife more than she had expected and she remained in a very drooping state in spite of her best efforts not to depress him  nothing seemed to suit her so well as to lie on a couch in the garden of their lodging with constance beside her talking and sometimes smiling over all her little mites pretty ways though at other times she did her best to seem to take interest in other matters and to persuade her husband that his endeavours to give her pleasure or interest were successful because the exertions he made for her sake were good for him  he was by this time anxioussince he was by the end of three weeks quite well and fairly strongto go down to westhaven and learn all he could about the circumstances of the fate of his poor little son and only delayed till he thought his wife could spare him  lady adela urged him at last to go  she thought that mary lived in a state of effort for his sake and that there was a certain yearning and yet dread in the minds of both for these further details so that the visit had better be over  thus it was about six weeks after herberts departure that mrs morton received a note to tell her that her brotherinlaw would arrive the next evening  it was terrible news to ida and if there had been time she would have arranged to be absent elsewhere but as it was she had no power to escape and had to spend her time in assisting in all the elaborate preparations which her mother thought due to the barona very different personage in her eyes from the actual frank  he did not come till late in the day and then mrs morton received him with a very genuine gush of tears and anxious inquiries  he was thin and looked much older his hair was grayer and had retreated from his brow and there was a bent worn dejected air about the whole man which as mrs morton said made her ready to cry whenever she looked at him but he was quite composed in manner and tone so as to repress her agitation and confirm idas inexperienced judgment in the idea that michael was none of his  he was surprised and concerned at herberts absence which was beginning to make his mother uneasy and he promised to write to some of the boys friends to inquire about him  to put off the evil day ida had suggested asking mr deyncourt to meet him but that gentleman could not come and dinner went off in stiff efforts at conversation for just now all the power thereof that lord northmoor had ever acquired seemed to have forsaken him  afterwards in the august twilight he begged to hear all  ida withdrew glad not to submit to the ordeal while her mother observed poor dear ida  she was so fond of her dear little cousin she cannot bear to hear him mentioned  she has never been well since  then with copious floods of tears and all in perfect good faith she related the history of the loss as she knew it withon his leading questionsa full account of all the childs pretty ways during his stay and how he had never failed to say his prayer about making papa better and how he had made friends with mr deyncourt in spite of having pronounced his church like a big tin box all up in frills and how he had admired the crabs and run after the waves and had been devoted to the willie who had thought him troublesomegiving all the anecdotes to which frank listened with set face and dry eyes storing them for his wife  he thanked mrs morton for all her care and tenderness and expended assurances that no one thought her to blame  it is one of those dispensations he said that no one can guard against  we can only be thankful for the years of joy that no one can take from us and try to be worthy to meet him hereafter  mrs morton had wept so much that she was very glad to seize the first excuse for wishing goodnight  she said that she had put all michaels little things in a box in his fathers room for him to take home to his mother and bade frankas once more she called himgoodnight kissing him as she had never done before  the shock had brought out all that was best and most womanly in her  that box had an irresistible attraction for frank  he could not but open it and on the top lay the white woolly headless dog that had been mites special darling had been hugged by him in his slumbers every night and been the means of many a joyous game when father and mother came up to wish the noisy creature goodnight and tarlo had been made to bark at them  somehow the never more overcame him completely  he had not before been beyond the restraint of guarding his feelings for marys sake and tired with the long day and torn by the evenings narration all his selfcommand gave way and he fell into a perfect anguish of deepdrawn almost hysterical sobbing              picture what and he threw the door wide open  those sobs were heard through the thin partition in idas room  they were very terrible to her  they broke down the remnant of her excuse that the child was an imposition  they woke all her womans tenderness and the impulse to console carried her in a few moments to the door  uncle  uncle frank  im not ill answered a broken heaving impatient voice  i want nothing  oh let me in dear uncleive something to tell you  not now came on the back of a sob  go  oh now now and she even opened the door a little  he is not drowned  at least rose rollstone thinks  what and he threw the door wide open  rose rollstone is sure she saw him with louisa hall in london that day hurried out ida still bent on screening herself  shes gone to canada its there that herbert is gone to find him and bring him home  and whywhy were we never told  you were too ill uncle and rose did not know about it till she came home  then she told herbert and he hoped to find him and write  when was this  when herbert came homethe 29th or 30th of june said ida trembling he must find him uncle dont fear  it was a strange groaning sigh that answered then with a great effort  thank you ida i cant understand it yeti cant talk  goodnight then with an afterthought when he had almost shut his door he turned the handle again to say who did you say sawthought she sawmy boy where  rose rollstone uncle first at the north stationthen at waterloo and louisa hall too  i thank you goodnight  and for what a night of strange dreams prayers and uncertainties did frank shut himself inonly forcing himself by resolute will into sleeping at last because he knew that strength and coolness were needful for tomorrows investigation     chapter xxxvii hope   that last sleep lasted long till the sound of the little tinkling bell came through the open window and then the first waking thought that mite was alive was at first taken for a mere blissful dream  it was only the sight of the woolly dog that recalled with certainty the conversation with ida  to pursue that strange hint was of course the one impulse  the bell had ceased before frank had been able to finish dressing but the house was so far from having wakened to full life that remembering the lateness of the breakfast hour he decided on hastening out to lay his anxious throbbing feelings before his god if only to join in the prayer that our desires may be granted as may be most expedient for us  nor was he without a hope that the girl whom constance described as so devout and religious might be found there  and she was he knew her by sight well enough to accost her when she came out with miss rollstone i believe  she bowed her heart thumping almost as much as the fathers in the importance of what she had to tell and the doubt how much she had a right to speak without betrayal  i am told lord northmoor said with a tremble in his voice that you think you saw my poor little boy  i am almost sure i did said rose  and when may i ask  on the evening of the wednesday in whitsun week said rose  just when he was lostand where  at the north station  i had got into the train at the main station  i saw him put into the train at the north one and taken out at waterloo  and whywhy may i ask have we been lefthave we never heard this before  his voice shook as he thought of all the misery to himself and his wife that might have been spared as well as the danger of the child  rose hesitated doubting how much she ought to say and mr deyncourt came out  may i introduce myself said frank hoping for an auxiliarylord northmoor  i have just heard that miss rollstone thinks she saw my little boy in the london train the day he disappeared and i am trying to understand whether there is really any hope that she is right and that we can recover him  mr deyncourt was infinitely surprised and spoke a few words of wonder that this had not been made known  rose found it easier to speak to him  i saw louisa hall with him i did not know she was not still his maid i thought she had been sent to take him somewhere  and when i heard from home that hehe wasdrowned i only thought the likeness had deceived me  it was not till mr morton came home and we talked it over that i understood that louisa hall was dismissed long ago and was eloping to canada  and then for she had spoken falteringly and with an effort as their sounds of inquiry elicited each sentenceand then mr morton said he would follow her to canada  he did not want lady northmoor to be tortured with uncertainty  very strange said the gentlemen one to the other lord northmoor adding  thank you miss rollstone i will not detain you unless you can tell me more  rose was glad to be released though pained and vexed not to dare to express her reasons for full certainty  is this only a girls fancy sighed the father  i think she is a sensible girl  and my nephew herbert is a hardheaded fellow not likely to fly off on a vague notion  is this hall girls mother still living here  certainly  it has been a bad business her going off with that jones but i ascertained that she was married to him  jonessam jones or rattler  even so  ah  she was dismissed on his account  and i detected him in imposing on miss morton  yetwhere does this mrs hall live  along this alley  shall i come with you  thank you  it may induce her to speak out if there is anything to hear  i dare not hope  it is too incredible and i dont understand those childrens silence  he spoke it almost to himself and the clergyman thought it kinder not to interrupt his thoughts during the few steps down the evilsmelling alley that led to the house where mrs hall was washing up her cup after breakfast  it was mr deyncourt who spoke seeing that the swelling hope and doubt were almost too much for his companion  good morning mrs hall we have come to you early but lord northmoor is very anxious to know whether you can throw any light on what has become of his little boy  mrs hall was in a very different state of mind from when she had denied all knowledge to herbert a mere boy whom she did not like and when she was anxious to shelter her daughter whose silence had by this time begun to offend her  the sight of the clergyman and the other gentleman alarmed her and she began by maundering out  i am sure sir i dont know nothing  my daughter have never writ one line to me  he was with her gasped out lord northmoor  i am sure sir it was none of my doing no nor my daughter wouldnt neither only the young lady over persuaded her  tis she as was the guilty party as ill always say  shewho  miss mortonmiss hida sir and my gal wouldnt never have done it sir but for the stories she told fictious stories they was im sure that the child wasnt none of my ladys only a brat picked up in foreign parts to put her brother out of his chance  what are you saying exclaimed lord northmoor  my niece never could have said any such thing  indeed but she did sir my lord and thats what worked on my daughter though i always told her not to believe any such nonsense but then you see she couldnt get her passage paid to go out with rattler and miss hida give her the money if so be she would take off the child to canada with her  and where hoarsely asked the father  that i cant tell my lord louey have never written and i knows no more than nothing at all  sheve not been a dutiful gal to me as have done everything for her  there was no more to be made out of mrs hall and they went their way  there is no doubt that the little fellow is alive said mr deyncourt  who can guess what those wretches have done to him said lord northmoor under his breath  not that i am unthankful for the blessed hope he added uncovering his head but i am astounded more than i can say by this  it must be invention of the woman said mr deyncourt  i hope so was the answer  could miss rollstone have suspected it  she was very unlike what i have seen of her before  they separated for breakfast agreeing to meet afterwards to hunt up the jones family  ida had suffered a good deal all the night and morning as she wondered what her confession might entail on her  sometimes she told herself that since it would come out in herberts letters on the discovery of the child it was well to have the honour of the first disclosure and her brother was certain to keep her part in the matter a secret but on the other hand she did not know how much louisa might have told her mother nor whether mrs hall might persist in secrecynay or even rose indeed she was quite uncertain how much rose had understood  she could not have kept back guesses and she did not believe in honour on roses part  so she was nervous on finding that her uncle was gone out  when he came in to breakfast he merely made a morning greeting afterwards he scarcely spoke except to answer an occasional remark from her mother  to herself he neither looked nor spoke but when mrs morton declared that he looked the better for his morning walk there was a half smile and light in his eye and the weight seemed gone from his brow  mrs morton asked what he was going to do  i am going out with mr deyncourt he answered  and ida breathed more freely when he was gone  but she little knew that mr deyncourt had gone to rose rollstone in her fathers presence and told her of mrs halls revelations asking her if this had been the cause of her silence  she had to own how the truth had flashed at once on her and mr morton  it would be so very dreadful for them if it were known she said  he thought if he brought back the boy his sisters part need not be known  then that was the secret exclaimed mrs rollstone  well ill not blame you child but you might have told us  secrets were safe with the exbutler but not quite so much so with his wife though all three tried to impress on her the need of silence before mr deyncourt hastened out to rejoin lord northmoor  the inquiry took a much longer time than they had expected for the family wanted did not live in mr deyncourts district and they were misdirected more than once to people who disdained the notion of being connected with the rattler if they had ever heard of such a person  at last they did find a sisterinlaw who pronounced george jones to be a good fellow so far as she knew  he sent home to his mother regularly and lately had had out his brother sam and a good job too to have him out of the way only what must he do but go and marry that there trollopy girl as was no good  yes george had written to say they had come safe to toronto but she did not hear as he said anything about a child  the letter was to his mother who had taken it into the country when she went to stay with her daughter  this deponent didnt know the address and her husband was out with a yacht  nothing could be done but to pursue the mother to a village about five miles off where she was traced out with some difficulty and persuaded to refer to her son georges letter where he mentioned the safe arrival of mr and mrs sam but without a word about their bringing a child with them  this omission seemed to dash all former hopes so as to show frank how strong they had been and besides there had been more than time for herbert to have written after reaching toronto  however the one step of knowing george joness address had been gained and with no more than this they had to return intending to see whether ida had any notion as to what was to be done  it was evening when lord northmoor came in  mrs morton was alone and as she looked up was answered by his air of disappointment as he shook his head  oh it is so dreadful she exclaimed it is all over the place  we met mr brady and his sisters and they cut ida dead  she is quite brokenhearted indeed she is  then she has told you all  she could not help it  mrs rollstone came to ask me if it was trueas a friend she said i should say it was more like an enemy and mrs hall came too wanting to see ida but i saw her instead  the wicked woman to have given in  and they have gone and told every one and the police will be after my poor child  no they would not interfere unless i prosecuted and that i certainly should not do unless it proved the only means of tracing my child  i came home intending to ask ida if she gave any directions about him  it seems certain that he was not brought to toronto  indeed  she made sure that he would be there exclaimed mrs morton much dismayed  let me go and see  she is so much upset altogether that she declares that she cannot see you this evening  mrs morton went and presently brought word that ida was horrified at hearing that little michael was not with the joneses  she had trusted louisa to treat him kindly and only dispose of him to some of those canadian farmers who seemed to have an unlimited appetite for adopted children and the last hope was that this might have been the case though opportunities could have been few on the way to toronto  ida had cried over the tidings  it must have been worse than she had ever intended that the child should be treated and the shock was great both to her and to her mother  mrs morton really seemed quite broken down both by sorrow and fear for the boy and by the shame the dread of the story getting into the papers and the sense that she could never go on living at westhaven and her brotherinlaw quite overwhelmed her by saying that he should do all in his power to prevent publicity and that he entirely exonerated her from all blame in the matter  ah frank dear she said you are so good it makes me feel what a sinful woman i am  i dont mean that i ever gave in for a moment to that nonsense of poor idas which was her only bit of excuse  no one that had ever been a mother could you know but i wont say that i did not grumble at my boy losing his chances  i dont wonder  andand i never would listen to you and mary about poor ida  i let her idle and dress and read all those novels and it is out of them she got that monstrous notion  you little know what i have gone through with that girl frank so different from the other two  oh if i could only begin over again  perhaps said frank full of pity this terrible shock may open her eyes and by gods blessing be the beginning of better things  oh frank you are a perfect angel ever to bear the sight of us again cried the poor woman ever violent in her feelings and demonstrations hark  whats thati cant see any one  please maam its miss rollstone with a letter for his lordship     chapter xxxviii the clue       best of roses      i dont know where my uncle is so please send him this  i got to     toronto all right and had not much trouble in finding out the     steadygoing jones who is rather a swell chief mate on board the     british empress  he was a good deal taken aback by my story and     said that his brother had come out with his wife but no child  it     was quite plain that he was a good deal disappointed in the rattler     and not at all prepared for mrs louisa whom neither he nor his wife     admired at all at all  he had got his brother a berth on a summer     steamer that had just been set up on lake winnipegbeing no doubt     glad to get rid of such an encumbrance as the wife and he looked     very blue when he heard that i was quite certain that she had taken     the kid away with her and been paid for it  there was nothing for     it but to go after them and find out from them what they had done     with poor little mite  he is a right good fellow and would have     gone with me but that he is bound to his boat and a stunner she is     but he gave me a letter to sam so i had to get on the canadian     pacific railway so that i should have been nonplussed but for your     loan  splendid places it goes through you never saw such trees nor     such game      as good luck would have it i was in the same car with an     englishmana gentleman one could see with half an eye and we     fraternised so that i told him what i was come about  he was     awfully goodnatured and told me he lived a mile or two out of     winnipeg and had a share in the steam company and if i found any     difficulty i was to come to him mr forman at northmoor  i stared     at the name as you may guess  there was a fine horse and buggy     waiting for him at the station and off he went  i put up at the     hoteltheres sure to be that whatever there is notand went after     the joneses next  i got at the woman first she looked ill and     fagged as if she didnt find life with rattler very jolly  she     cried bucketsful and said she didnt know anything since she put     the poor little mite to sleep after supper in a publichouse at     liverpool  she was dead tired and when she woke he was gone and     her husband swore at her and never would tell her what he had done     with the boy except that he had not hurt him  then i interviewed     sam rattler himself  he cut up rough as he said my lord had done     him an ill turn and he had the game in his hands now and was not     going to let him know what was become of his child without he came     down handsome enough to make up for what he had done him out of  so     then i had to go off to mr forman  he has such a place a house     such as any one might be delighted to havepine trees behind a     garden in front no end of barns and stables with houses and cows     fine wheat fields spreading all round such as would do your heart     good  that is what mr forman and his brotherinlaw captain alder     have made and theres a sweet little lady as ever you saw alders     sister  the captain was greatly puzzled to hear it was lord     northmoors son i was looking for  he is not up in the peerage like     your father you see and i had to make him understand  he thought     lord n must be either the old man or lady adelas little boy  he     said some of his happiest days had been at northmoor and he asked     after lady adela and if miss morton was married  he came with me     and soon made mr rattler change his note by showing him that it     would be easy to give him the sack even if he was not laid hold of     by the law on my information for stealing the child  they are both     magistrates and could do it  so at last the fellow growled out that     he wasnt going to be troubled with another mans brat and just     before embarking he had laid it down asleep at the door of liverpool     workhouse  so no doubt poor little michael is there  i would have     telegraphed at once but i dont know where my uncle is or whether     he knows about it but you can find out and send him this letter at     once  i have asked him to pay your advance out of my quarter and as     to the rest of it it is all owing to you that the poor little kid is     not to grow up a pauper      i am staying on at northmoorit sounds natural they want another     hand for their harvesting so i am working out my board as is the     way here at any rate till i hear from my uncle and i shall ask him     to let me stay here for good as a farmingpupil  it would suit me     ever so much better than the militia even if i could get into it     which i suppose i havent done  it is a splendid country big enough     to stretch oneself in and i shall never stand being cramped up in an     island after it besides that i dont want to see ida again in a     hurry though there is some one i should like no end to see again     there i must not say any more but send this on to my uncle  i wish     i could see his face  i did look to bring mite back to him but that     cant be as i have not tin enough to carry me home  i hope your     loan has not got you into a scrape                                                    yours ever i mean it                                                               h morton  the letter to lord northmoor which the servant put into his hand was shorter and began with the more important sentencethe rascal dropped michael at liverpool workhouse  the father read it with an ejaculation of thank god the aunt answered with a cry of horror so that he thought for a moment she had supposed he said dropped him into the sea and repeated liverpool workhouse  oh yes yes but that is so dreadful  the honourable michael morton in a workhouse  he is safe and well taken care of there no doubt said frank  i have no fears now  there are much worse places than the nurseries of those great unions  then as he read on there emma your boy has acted nobly  he has fully retrieved what his sister has done  be happy over that dear sister and be thankful with me  my mary my mary will the joy be too much  oh my boy  how soon can i reach liverpool  there you will like to read it  i must go and thank that good girl who found him the means  he was gone and found rose in the act of reading her letter aloud all but certain bits that made her falter as if the writing was bad to her parents and mr deyncourt  and there in full assembly he found himself at a loss for words  no one was so much master of the situation as mr rollstone  my lord i have the honour to congratulate your lordship he said with a magnificence only marred by his difficulty in rising  ii stammered his lordship with an unexpected choke in his throat have to congratulate you mr rollstone on having such a daughter then grasping roses hand as in a vice miss rollstone what we owe to youis past expression  i am sure she is very happy my lord to have been of service said her mother with a simper  mr deyncourt to relieve the tension of feeling said miss rollstone was reading the letter about mr mortons adventures  would you not like her to begin again  and while rose obeyed lord northmoor was able to extract his chequebook from his pocketbook and as rose paused to say  i have a debt of which my nephew reminds me  miss rollstone furnished the means for his journey  will you let me fill this up  this can be repaid he added with a smile the rest never  mr rollstone might have been distressed at the venture on which his daughters savings had gone but he was perfectly happy and triumphant now except that even more than mrs morton he suffered from the idea of the honourable michael being exposed to the contamination of a workhouse and was shocked at his lordships thinking it would have been worse for him to be with the rattler  then hastily looking at his watch lord northmoor asked when the post went out and hearing there was but half an hour to spare begged mr deyncourt to let him lose no time by giving him the wherewithal to write to his wife  she would miss a note and be uneasy he said  yet i hardly know what i dare tell her  only not mourning paper he added with an exultant smile  in the curates room he wrote      dearest wife      i have been out all day and have only a moment to say that i am     quite well and trust to have some most thankworthy news for you     dont be uneasy if you do not hear tomorrowyour own                                                                    frank  there was still time to scribble      dear lady adela      i trust to you to prepare mary for wellnigh incredible joy but do     not agitate her too soon  i cannot come till friday afternoon                                                          yours gratefully                                                               northmoor  having sent this off his next search was for a timetable  he would fain have gone by the mail train that very night but mr deyncourt and mrs morton united in persuading him that his strength was not yet equal to such a pull upon it and he yielded  they hardly knew the man usually so equable and quiet as to be almost stolid  he smiled and declared he could neither eat nor sleep but he actually did both sleeping indeed better and longer than he had done since his illness and coming down in the morning a new man as he called himself but the old one still in his kindness to mrs morton  he promised to telegraph to her as soon as he knew all was well assured her that he would do his best to keep the scandal out of the papers that he would never forget his obligations to herberts generosity and that if she made up her mind to leave westhaven he would facilitate her so doing  ida was not up  she had had a very bad night and indeed she had confessed that she had been miserable under dreams worse than waking ever since the child was carried off  her mother had observed her restlessness and nervousness but had set a good deal down to love and perhaps had not been entirely wrong  at any rate she was now really ill and could not bear the thought of seeing her uncle though he sent a message to her that now he did not find it nearly so hard to forgive her and that he felt for her with all his heart  it was this gentleness that touched mrs morton above all  years had softened her perhaps too his patience and the higher tone of mr deyncourts ministry and she was in many respects a different woman from her who had so loudly protested against his marrying mary marshall     chapter xxxix the honourable pauper   lord northmoors card was given to the porter with an urgent request for an interview with the master of the workhouse  he steadied his voice with difficulty when on entering the office he said that he had come to make inquiry after his son a child of three and a half years old who had been supposed to be drowned but he had now discovered had been stolen by a former nurse and left at the gate of the workhouse and as the master paused with an interrogative yes my lord he addedon the night between the wednesday and thursday of whitsun week may the  children are so often left said the master  i will ascertain from the books as to the date  after an interval really of scarcely a minute but which might have been hours to the fathers feeling he read  may 18thboy of apparently four years old left on the steps asleep apparently drugged  ah  calls himself mitel tentname probably michael trenton  michael kenton morton  then he reflected no doubt he thought he was to say his catechism  does not seem to know parents name nor residence  dressmans old rough coat over a brown holland pinaforeno markfeet bare talks as if carefully brought up  may i ask you to describe him  brown eyes light hair a good deal of colour sturdy large child said lord northmoor much agitated  there holding out a photograph  ah said the master in assent  and whereis he here  he is at the childrens home at fulwood lodge  perhaps i had better ask one of the guardians who lives near at hand to accompany you  this was done the guardian came much interested in the guest and a cab was called  lord northmoor learnt on the way that the routine in such cases which were only too common was the child was taken by the police to the bellmans office till night and there taken care of in case he should be a little truant of the place but being unclaimed he spent a few days at the union and then was taken to the childrens home at fulwood  inquiries had been made but the little fellow had been still under the influence of the drug that had evidently been administered to him at first and then was too much bewildered to give a clear account of himself  he was in confusion between his real home and westhaven and the difference between his appellation and that of his parents was likewise perplexing nor could he make himself clear even as to what he knew perfectly well when interrogated by official strangers who alarmed him  lord northmoor was himself a poor law guardian and had no vague superstitions to alarm him as to the usage of children in workhouses but he was surprised at the pleasant aspect of the nursery of the liverpool union a former gentlemans house and grounds with free air and beautiful views  the matron on being summoned said that she had from the first been sure in spite of his clothes that little mike was a wellborn tenderlynurtured child with good manners and refined habits and she had tried in vain to understand what he said of himself though night and morning he had said his prayers for papa and mamma and at first added that papa might be well and he might go home but where home was there was no discovering except that there had been journeys by puff puff and louey and aunt emma and nurse and sea and north something and nasty man were in an inextricable confusion  she took them therewith into a large airy room where the elder children whole rows of little beings in red frocks were busied under the direction of a lively young nurse in building up coloured cubes gifts in kindergarten parlance  there was a few moments of pause as all the pairs of eyes were raised to meet the newcomers  with a little sense of disappointment but more of anxiety frank glanced over them and encountered a rounded somewhat puzzled stare from two brown orbs in a rosy face  then he ventured to say mite and there followed a kind of laughing yell a leap over the structure of cubes and the warm solid rosy boy was in his arms on his breast the head on his shoulder in indescribable ecstasy of content on both sides of thankfulness on that of the father  no doubt there said the guardian and the matron to one another between smiles and tears  mite asked no questions  fate had been far beyond his comprehension for the last five months and it was quite enough for him to feel himself in the familiar arms and hear the voice he loved  would he go to mamma  the boy raised his head looked wonderingly over his fathers face and said in a puzzled voice  louey said she would take me home in the puff puff  come now with father my boy  only kiss this good lady first who has been so kind to you  kiss tommy too and fanny said michael struggling down and beginning a round of embraces that sufficiently proved that his nursery had been a happy one while his father could see with joy that he was as healthy and freshlooking as ever perhaps a little less plump but with the natural growth of the fourth year and he was much the biggest of the party with the healthfulness of country air and wholesome tendance while most of the others were more or less stunted or undergrown  lord northmoors longing was to take his recovered son at once to gladden his mothers eyes but michaels little red frock would not exactly suit with the manner of his travels  so he accepted the guardians invitation to come to his house and let michael be fitted out there an invitation all the more warmly given because it would have been a pity to let wife and daughters miss the interest of the sight of the lost child and his father  so all formalities being complied with and in true official spirit the account for the boys maintenance having been asked for a hearty and cordial leave was taken of the matron and michael kenton morton was discharged from liverpool union  the lady and her daughters were delighted to have him and would have made much of him but the poor little fellow proved that his confidence in womankind had been shaken by clinging tight to his father and showing his first inclination to cry when it was proposed to take him into another room to be dressed  indeed his father was as little willing to endure a moments separation as he could be and looked on and assisted to see him made into a little gentleman again in outward costume  after luncheon there was still time to reach malvern by a reasonable hour of the evening and frank felt as if every moment of sorrow were almost a cruelty to his wife  the guardians wife owned that she ought not to press him to sleep at her house and forwarded his departure with strong fellowfeeling for the mothers hungry bosom  from the station frank sent telegrams to herbert to mrs morton and to rose rollstone besides one to lady adela containing only the reference luke xv 32  people looked somewhat curiously at the thin wornlooking elderly man with the travelling bag in one hand and the little boy holding tight by the other each with a countenance of radiant gladness and again to see how when seated he allowed himself to be climbed over and clasped by the sturdy being who seemed almost overwhelming to one so slight  when the september twilight darkened into night michael who had been asleep awoke with a scream and flung both arms round his fathers neck exclaiming  oh louey ill not cry  dont let him throw me out  oh the nasty man  and even when convinced that no nasty man was present and that it was papa not louey whom he was grappling he still nestled as close as possible while he was only pacified in recurring frights by listening to a story  never good at storytelling the only one that for the nonce his father could put together was that of joseph and this elicited various personal comparisons  mine wasnt a coat of many colours it was my blue frock  did they dip it in blood papa  not quite my darling but it was the same thing  then presently it wasnt a camel but a puff puff and he was so cross  by and by i didnt tell anybodys dreams papa  they didnt make me ride in a charot but nurse made me monitor cause i knew all my letters  i should like to have a brother benjamin  maynt tommy be my brother  wasnt josephs mamma very glad  michaels egypt had not been a very terrible house of bondage and the darker moments of his abduction did not dwell on his memory but years later when first he tasted beer he put down the glass with a shudder as the smell and taste brought back a sense of distress confusion and horror in a gaslit crowded bar full of loudvoiced rough figures and resounding with strange language and fierce threats to make him swallow the draught which no doubt had been drugged     chapter xl joy wellnigh incredible   the midday letters were a riddle to the ladies at malvern  out all day said mary that is well  he will get strong out boating  i hope herbert has come home to take him out said constance  or he may be yachting  i wonder he does not say who is taking him out i am glad that he can feel that sense of enjoyment  yet that rejoicing seemed to be almost an effort to the poor mother who craved for a longer letter and perhaps almost felt as if her frank were getting out of sympathy with her griefand what could be the good news  herbert must have passed said constance  i hope he has but the expression is rather strong for that said lady adela  perhaps ida is engaged to that mr deyncourt  was that his name said lady northmoor languidly  oh that would be delicious cried constance and ida has grown much more thoughtful lately so perhaps she would do for a clergymans wife  is ida better asked her aunt who had been much drawn towards the girl by hearing that her health had suffered from grief for michael  mamma does not mention her in her last letter but poor ida is really much more delicate than one would think though she looks so strong this would be delightful  yet joy wellnigh incredible said her aunt meditatively  were not those the words  it would not be like your uncle to put them in that way unless it were somethingeven more wonderful and besides why should he not write it to me  ohh cried constance with a leap rather than a start  it can be only one thing  dont dont dont cried poor mary you must not constance it would kill me to have the thought put into my head only to be lost  constance looked wistfully at lady adela but the idea she had suggested had created a restlessness and her aunt presently left the room  then constance said  lady adela may i tell you something  you know that poor dear little mite was never found  oh a boat must have picked him up cried amice and he is coming back  gently amy hush said the mother constance has more to tell  yes said constance  my friend rose rollstone who lives just by our house at westhaven and was going back to london the night that mite was lost wrote to me that she was sure she had seen his face just then  she thought and i thought it was one of those strange things one hears of sights at the moment of death  so i never told of it but now i cannot help fancying  oh i am sure cried amice  lady adela thought the only safe way would be to turn the two young creatures out to pour out their rapturous surmises to one another on the winding paths of the malvern hills and very glad was she to have done so when by and by that other telegram was put into her hands  then when mary unable to sit still though with trembling limbs came back to the sittingroom with a flush on her pale cheek excited by the sound at the door lady adela pointed to the yellow paper which she had laid within the gospel open at the place  mary sank into a chair  it cant be a false hope she gasped  he would never have sent this if it were not a certainty said adela kneeling down by her and holding her hands while repeating what constance had said  a few words were spent on wonder and censure on the girls silence more unjust than they knew but hardly wasted since they relieved the tension  mary slid down on her knees beside her friend and then came a silence of intense heartswelling choking and unformed but none the less true thanksgiving and ending in a mutual embrace and an outcry of marys  oh adela how good you are you with no such hopeand that great blessed shower of tears that relieved her was ostensibly the burst of sympathy for the bereaved mother with no such restoration in view  then came soothing words and then the endeavour with dazed eyes and throbbing hearts to look out the trains from liverpool whence to their amazement they saw the telegram had started undoubtedly from lord northmoor there was not too large a choice and finally lady adela made the hope seem real by proposing preparations for the childs supper and bedthings of which mary seemed no more to have dared to think than if she had been expecting a little spirit but which gave her hope substance and inspired her with fresh energy and a new strength as she ran up and downstairs directing her maid who cried for joy at the news and then going out to purchase those needments which had become such tokens of exquisite hope and joy  after this had once begun she seemed really incapable of sitting still for every moment she thought of something her boy would want or would like or hurried to see if all was right  constance begged again and again to run on the messages but she would not allow it and when the girl looked grieved and said she was tiring herself to death lady adela said  my dear sitting still would be worse for her  however it may turn out fatigue will be best for her  surely it cant mean anything else cried constance  i dont see how it can  your uncle weighs his words too much to raise false hopes  so dark as it was by the time the train was expected adela promoted the ordering a carriage and went herself with the trembling mary to the station not without restoratives in her bag in case of she knew not what  not a word was spoken but hands were clasped and hearts were uplifted in an agony of supplication as the two sat in the dark on the drive to the station  of course they were too soon but the driver manoeuvred so as to give them a full view of the exitand then came that minute of indescribable suspense when the sounds of arrival were heard and figures began to issue from the platform  it was not longthanks to freedom from luggagebefore there came into full light a wellknown form with a little halfawake boy holding his hand  then adela quietly let herself out of the brougham and in another moment her clasping hand and swimming eyes had marked her greeting  she pointed to the open door and the white face in it and in one moment more a pair of arms had closed upon michael and with a dreamy murmur mammam mamma the curly head was on her bosom the precious weight on her lap her husband by her side the door had closed on them they were driving away  oh is it real  is he well  perfectly well  only sleepy  strong grown well cared for  my boy my boy and she felt him all over gazed at the rosy face whenever a tantalising flash of lamplight permitted then kissed and kissed till the boy awoke more fully with another mamma mamma putting his hand to feel for her chain as if to identify her  then with a coo of content mite has papa and mamma and he seemed under the necessity of feeling them both  only at their own door did those happy people even recollect lady adela with shame and dismay which did not last long for she came on them laughing with pleasure and saying it was just what she had intended while mite was recognising his amy and his conny and being nearly devoured by them  he still was rather confused by the strange house  its not home he said staring round and blinking at the lights and wheres my big horse  you shall soon go home to the big horseand nurse eden poor nurse shall come to you my own  to which michael responded holding out a plump leg and foot for admiration  i can do mine own socks and bootses now and wash mine own hands and face  nevertheless he was quite sleepy enough to be very happy and content to be carried off to his mothers bedroom where he sat enthroned on her lap constance feeding him with bread and milk while amice held the bowl and the maid almost equally blissful hovered round and there again he sat with the two admiring girls one at each foot disrobing him as best they might  nearly asleep at last he knelt at his mothers knee with the murmured prayer but woke just enough to say mite neednt say make papa better nor bring mite home  no indeed my boy  say thank god for all his mercy  he repeated it and added of himself bless nursey and let tommy and fan have papas and mammas again  amen  he was nodding again by that time but he held his mothers hand fast with dont go mam  nor did she  she had asked no questions  to be alone with her boy and him whom she thanked with her whole soul was enough for her at present     chapter xli the canadian northmoor   it was not till lord northmoor began to answer in detail the questions that were showered on him as he ate his late dinner that he fully realised the history of his recovered son even to himself  liverpool workhouse and all owing to herbert were his first replies and he had eaten his soup before adela and constance had discovered the connection between the two nay they were still more bewildered when constance asked then herbert found him there  herbert  oh no good fellow  he is in canada he went after him there  to canada  yes that woman the nursery girl hall kidnapped the child herbert followed her there and found he had been dropped at liverpool  then on further inquiries frank became sensible that he must guard the secret of idas part in the transaction  he hoped to conceal it from all except his wife for it was hardly injustice to the jones pair in another hemisphere to let their revenge bear the whole blame  indeed he did not himself know that it was idas passion or roses mention of having seen michaels face that had roused herberts suspicion  he had heard herberts account of his adventures in the letter to rose with mere impatience to come to what related to his son and it had made no impression on his mind but when he took out his own much briefer letter the address at northmoor and the sentences that followed the brief explanation where to seek for michael suggested much  i doubt whether i could ever have got the rascal to speak out if it had not been for captain alder with whose brotherinlaw mr forman i had the luck to meet on the way  they were some of the first settlers here and have a splendid farm export no end of wheat and ice and have a share in the steam company  i am working out my board here for them till you are good enough to send me my quarters allowance deducting the 25 pounds that miss rollstone helped me to as there was no one else to whom i could apply  i should like to stay here for good and all and they would take me for a farmingpupil for less than you have been giving to my crammers all in vain i am afraid  the life would suit me much better they let me live with the family and they are thorough right sort of people religious and all thatand alder seemed to take an interest in me from the time he made out who i was and indeed the place is named after our northmoor where he says he spent his happiest days  if you can pacify my mother and if you would consent i am sure i could do much better here than at home and soon be quite off your hands  for the present lord northmoor who could only feel that he owed more than he could express to his nephew sent the youth a bill such as to cover his expenses with permission so far as he himself was concerned to remain with these new friends at least until there was another letter and time to consider this proposal  at the same time he wrote to rose rollstone not only the particulars of michaels history but a request for those details about herberts friends to which he had scarcely listened when she read them  he sent likewise a paragraph to several newspapers explaining that the honourable m k morton whose watery grave had been duly recorded had in fact been only abducted by a former maidservant and bestowed in liverpool workhouse where he had been discovered by the generous exertions of his cousin herbert morton esquire  it was hoped that this would obviate all suspicion of ida who was reported as still so unwell that her mother was anxious to carry her abroad at once to try the effect of change of scene  upon which frank consulted mr hailes as to whether the prosperity that had begun to flow in upon northmoor would justify him in at once taking the house at westhaven off her hands and making it a thankoffering as a parsonage for the district of st james  this breakup seemed considerably to lessen her reluctance to the idea of herberts remaining in canada as in effect neither she nor ida felt inclined as yet to encounter his indignation or to let him hear what westhaven said  there would be no strong opposition on her part except the tears which he would not see and she was too anxious to carry ida away to think of much besides  frank had however made up his mind that he could not let the son of his only brother the youth whom he had regarded almost as a son and who had lost so much by the discovery of the child drift away into expatriation without being personally satisfied as to these new companions  this was ostensible reason enough for a resolution to go out himself to the transatlantic northmoor to make arrangements for his nephew  moreover he was bent on doing so before the return of mrs bury and bertha from whom the names of alder and northmoor were withheld in the joyful letters  from mr hailes he obtained full confirmation of what he had heard from lady adelaa story which the old gentlemans loyalty had withheld as mere gossipabout the young people who had been very dear to him  he confessed that poor arthur morton had a bad set about himindeed his fathers tastes had involved him in the kind of thing and lady adela had been almost a child when married to him by relations who were much to blame  captain alder had belonged to the set but had always seemed too good for them and as if thrown among them from association  there was no doubt that he and bertha were much in love but there was sure to be strong opposition from her father and even her brother had shown symptoms of thinking his friend had no business to aspire to his sisters hand  moreover it appeared afterwards that the captain was heavily in debt to arthur morton  it was under these circumstances that the accident occurred  bertha had mistrusted the horses eye and ear and implored her brother not to venture on driving it and had been bantered goodhumouredly on her unusual fears  at the first shock the untamed girl had spoken bitter words making captain alder accountable for the accident  what they were neither mr hailes nor any one else exactly knew but they had cut deep  when on poor arthurs recovery of consciousness there was an endeavour to find captain alder he had left the army and though somewhat later the full amount of the debt was paid it was conveyed in a manner that made the sender not easily traceable and as it came just when arthur was again past communication and sinking fast no great effort was made to seek one who was better forgotten  it had not then been known how berthas life would be wrecked by that sense of injustice and crueltynor what a hold the love of that man had taken on her but like lady adela mr hailes averred that she had never been the same since that minute of stormy grief and accusation and that he believed that whatever might come of it the being able to confess her wrongs and to know the fate of her lover was the only thing that could restore the balance of her spirits or heal the sore  from his own former employer mr burford frank procured that other link which floated in his memory when lady adela spoke  the name had come into mr burfords office because he had been engaged on the part of one of his clients in purchasing an estate of the alder family at a time which corresponded with arthur mortons death and the payment of the debt  there was a second instalment of the price which had to be paid to a quebec bank  this was all that could be learnt but it confirmed lord northmoors impression that it would be right to see him and as far as explanation could go to repair the injustice which had stung him so deeply  a letter could not do what an interview could and herberts plans were quite sufficient cause for a journey to winnipeg  of course it was a wrench to leave his wife and newlyrecovered son but he had made up his mind that it was right both as an act of justice to an injured man incumbent upon him as head of the family and likewise as needful in his capacity of guardian to herbert while the possibility of bringing healing to bertha also urged him  however frank said little of all this only quite simply as if he were going to ride to the petty sessions at colbeam mentioned that he thought it right to go out to canada to see about his nephew  and as soon as he had brought the party home and seen his boy once more in his own nursery he set forth leaving mary to talk and wonder with lady adela over the possible consequences     chapter xlii humble pie   bertha had just arrived from her tour having rushed home on the tidings of a quarrel between the doctors and the lady nurses of her pet hospital and she had immediately dashed down to northmoor to secure her cousin as one of the supporters  she sat by lady adelas fire very much disconcerted at hearing that he was not come home yet though expected every day  what should he have gone off to canada for  he might have been contented to stay at home after having lost all this time by his illness  oh yes i know that sounds ungrateful when it was all in the cause of my little cea  i shall be thankful to him all my life but all the same he ought to be at home when he is wanted and i wonder he liked to fly off just when he had got his dear little boy back again  he did not like it but thought it his duty  dutywhat to herbert  certainly the boy has come out very well in this matter considering that the finding mite was to his own detriment but probably he has found his vocation as a colonist  still northmoor might have let him find that for himself  do you know where the home he found is bertha  somewhere about lake winnipeg isnt it  yes and the name is northmoor  named by herbert eh  or didnt john tulse go out  did he name the place in loyalty to us  not john tulse but one who told herbert that his happiest days were spent here  adela you mean something  dont tantalise me  is it fred alder  and was he kind to the boy for old sakes sake because he bore the old name did he think he was your mike  bertha was leaning forward now devouring adela with her eyes  he was much puzzled to understand who herbert was but he gave him great help  the man could hardly have been made to speak if he had not brought him to his bearings  herbert has been living with him and his brotherinlaw ever since and is going to remain as a farmingpupil  married of course to a nasal yankee  no  there was a pause  bertha drew herself back in her chair adela busied herself with the teacups  presently came the question  did northmoor know  yes he did  and was that the reason of his going out  herbert was one motive but i do not think he would have gone if there had not been another reason  you did not ask him she said hotly  certainly not  i dont want any one to interfere said bertha in a suddenly changed mood especially not such a stick as that  he might have let it alone  and if you heard that captain alder was  a repentant prodigal eh  a soberminded sponsible easygoing steady moneymaking canadian interrupted bertha vehemently such as approved himself to his lordships jogtrot mind  well what then  oh birdie perverse child as ever  and so you actually despatched my lord to eat humble pie in my name you might have waited to see what i thought of the process  bertha jumped up as if to go and take off her hat but just at that moment some figures crossed the twilight window and in another second adela had sprung into the hall meeting mary and frank whom she beckoned into the diningroom  bertha had followed as far as the room door when in the porch she beheld a tall large form and bearded countenance  one moment more and those two were shut into the drawingroom  mary frank and adela stood together over the diningroom fire all smiles and welcome  doesnt he look well was marys cry as she displayed her husband  better than ever  nothing like bracing air  oh i am glad you brought him indicating the other room down at once she might have had a naughty fit and tormented herself and everybody  you think it will be all right said frank anxiously  it was a venture but when he heard that she was at the dower house there was no holding him  he thinks she has as much to forgive as he has  you wrote something of thatthough the actual misery and accident were no fault of his poor fellow and yetyet all that selfacted and reacted on one another and did each other harm said adela  yes said frank harm that he only fully understood gradually after he had burst away from it all in the shock and was living a very different life with his little sister and afterwards with her husband a thoroughly good man  to whom you have trusted your nephew  entirely  herbert is very happy there much more so than ever before useful and able to follow his natural bent  i am very glad he will do well there  a sudden interruption here came on them in the shape of amice who had not been guarded against  she flew into the room in a fright exclaiming  mamma mamma theres a strange man like a black bear in the drawingroom and he has got his arm round aunt berthas waist  oh as she perceived lord northmoor  a canadian bear i have just brought home eh amy said he exhilarated into fun for once while lady adela indulged in a quiet smile at the manner of partaking of humble pie  amice had however broken up the teteatete and all were soon together again lady adela greeting captain alder as an old friend and he in the restraint of good breeding betraying none of his feeling at the contrast between the girlish wife and the faded widow although perhaps in very truth adela morton was a happier certainly a more peaceful woman now than in those days  all must spend the evening together  where  the northmoors carried the day adela and bertha must come up to dinner yes and amice too  it was fine moonlight and the captain would stay and escort them  meantime lord and lady northmoor revelled in a moonlight walk together exactly as they had done seven years before as a bride and bridegroom but with that further ingredient in joy before themthat nightly romp with their mite to which frank had been looking forward all through his voyage  their mite all the happier because his tom and fanny were at the keepers lodge and allowed to play with him in the garden and on the heath  six weeks later lord northmoor acted as father at berthas wedding a quiet one with constance and amice as bridesmaids with as supernumerary little boadicea who was to share the new canadian home  michael was there in the glory of his first knickerbockers and mrs bury was there and her last words ere the bride came down dressed for the journey were how about that stick my dear  ah sticks are sometimes made of good material  there is a tree that groweth by the water side said adela     chapter xliii the staff   five years later almost all the members of the morton family were met once more at westhaven  ida was slowly dying  she had always been more or less delicate and she had never entirely recovered the effect of the distress she had brought upon herself by that foolish crime towards her little cousin  her mother had joined miss gattoni and they had roamed about the continent in the various resorts of seekers of health and of pleasure hoping to distract her mind and restore her strength and spirits  for a time this sometimes seemed to succeed and she certainly became prettier but disappointment always ensued a little overexertion or excitement was sure to bring on illness and there were even more painful causes for her collapses  her uncles care had not been entirely able to prevent the publication of such a sensational story known as it was to most people at westhaven in fact he was only able to reach the more respectable papers and the society to which miss gattoni introduced them was just that which revelled in the society papers  so every now and then whispers would go about that miss morton was the heroineor rather the villainof the piece and these were sure ultimately to reach miss gattoni  and at genoa they had actually been at the same tabledhote with tom bradys sisternay they had seen the morna in the harbour  gradually each summer brought less renovation each winter wherever spent brought ida lower till at length she was ill enough for her mother thankfully to reply to constances entreaty to come out to them at biarritz  constance had grown to be in her vacation more and more the child of the house at northmoor and since her college career had ended with credit externally and benefit inwardly she had become her aunts right hand besides teaching amice music and beginning michaels latin but it was plain that her duty lay in helping to nurse her sister and her uncle escorted her  they were greatly shocked at the change in the once brilliant girl and her broken dejected manner apparently incapable of taking interest in anything  she would scarcely admit her uncle at first but when she discovered that even constance was in perfect ignorance of her part in the loss of michael she was overcome with the humiliation of intense gratitude and the sense of a wonderful forgiveness and forbearance  he never exactly knew what he had said to her but for the two days that he was able to remain she wished for him to sit with her as much as possible though often in silence and she let him bring her the english chaplain  no one expected her to live through the spring but with it came another partial revival and therewith a vehement desire to see westhaven again it was as if her uncle had extracted the venom of the sting of remorse and when that had become repentance the old affection for the home of her childhood was free to revive  good mr rollstone was dead but his wife and daughter kept on the lodginghouse and were affectionately glad to welcome their old friends  herbert who had been happily farming for two years on his own account on an estate that his uncle had purchased for him came for the first time on a visit from the dominiontall broad bearded handsome and manly above all in his courtesy and gentleness to the sick sister who valued his strong and tender help more than any other care  mary came with her husband and boy from northmoor for the farewell  when ida tearfully asked her forgiveness the injury was so entirely past that it was not hard to say in the spirit of joseph  oh my poor child do not think of that  no one has suffered from it so much as you have  it really did michael no harm at all only making a little man of him and as to herbert his going out was the best thing in the world for him dear noble generous fellow  and after all ida she added presently i do believe you had rather be as you are now than the girl you were then  oh aunt mary it is what uncle frank and you arethatmakes one feel  ida could say no more  she once saw michaels bright boyish face awed into pity and had the kiss that sealed her earthly pardon unconscious as he was of the evil she had attempted  there was the pledge of higher pardon before her uncle and aunt left her to those nearer who could minister to her as she went down to the river ever flowing  before that time however herbert had made known to rose one of his great reasons for settling in canada namely that he meant to take her back with him  he had told his uncle long ago and mrs alder was quite ready and eager to welcome her as a cousin  even mr rollstone could hardly have objected under these circumstances and rose only doubted about leaving her mother  it presently appeared however that mrs morton wished to remain with mrs rollstone  westhaven was more to her than any other place and her vanity had so entirely departed that she could best take comfort in her good old friends congenial society constance offered to remain and obtain some daily governess or high school employment there but it was to her relief that she found that the two old ladies did not wish it  there was a sense that her tastes and habits were so unlike theirs that they would always feel her to be like company and be on their best behaviour and decidedly her mother would not stand in her light and would be best contented with visits from her and to northmoor  so after the quietest of weddings in the beautiful st jamess church herbert and rose went out to be welcomed at winnipeg and constance returned with her uncle to be a daughter to aunt marytill such time as she was sought by the young vicar of northmoor                                   the end
