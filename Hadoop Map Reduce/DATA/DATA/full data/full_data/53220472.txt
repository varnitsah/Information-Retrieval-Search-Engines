53220472	the lady of the lake  by sir walter scott bart    edited with notes by william j rolfe  formerly head master of the high school cambridge mass   boston  1883     preface    when i first saw mr osgoods beautiful illustrated edition of the lady of the lake i asked him to let me use some of the cuts in a cheaper annotated edition for school and household use and the present volume is the result  the text of the poem has given me unexpected trouble when i edited some of grays poems several years ago i found that they had not been correctly printed for more than half a century but in the case of scott i supposed that the text of blacks socalled authors edition could be depended upon as accurate almost at the start however i detected sundry obvious misprints in one of the many forms in which this edition is issued and an examination of others showed that they were as bad in their way the shilling issue was no worse than the costly illustrated one of 1853 which had its own assortment of slips of the type no two editions that i could obtain agreed exactly in their readings i tried in vain to find a copy of the editio princeps 1810 in cambridge and boston but succeeded in getting one through a london bookseller this i compared line by line with the edinburgh edition of 1821 from the harvard library with lockharts first edition the globe edition and about a dozen others english and american i found many misprints and corruptions in all except the edition of 1821 and a few even in that for instance in i 217 scott wrote found in each cliff a narrow bower and it is so printed in the first edition but in every other that i have seen cliff appears in place of clift to the manifest injury of the passage in ii 685 every edition that i have seen since that of 1821 has i meant not all my heart might say which is worse than nonsense the correct reading being my heat in vi 396 the scottish boune though it occurs twice in other parts of the poem has been changed to bound in all editions since 1821 and eight lines below the old word barded has become barbed scores of similar corruptions are recorded in my notes and need not be cited here  i have restored the reading of the first edition except in cases where i have no doubt that the later reading is the poets own correction or alteration there are obvious misprints in the first edition which scott himself overlooked see on ii 115 217 vi 527 etc and it is sometimes difficult to decide whether a later readinga change of a plural to a singular or like trivial variationis a misprint or the authors correction of an earlier misprint i have done the best i could with the means at my command to settle these questions and am at least certain that the text as i give it is nearer right than in any edition since 1821 as all the variae lectiones are recorded in the notes the reader who does not approve of the one i adopt can substitute that which he prefers  i have retained all scotts notes a few of them have been somewhat abridged and all those added by lockhart 1 my own i have made as concise as possible there are of course many of them which many of my readers will not need but i think there are none that may not be of service or at least of interest to some of them and i hope that no one will turn to them for help without finding it  scott is much given to the use of elizabethan words and constructions and i have quoted many parallelisms from shakespeare and his contemporaries i believe i have referred to my edition of shakespeare in only a single instance on iii 17 but teachers and others who have that edition will find many additional illustrations in the notes on the passages cited  while correcting the errors of former editors i may have overlooked some of my own i am already indebted to the careful proofreaders of the university press for the detection of occasional slips in quotations or references and i shall be very grateful to my readers for a memorandum of any others that they may discover  cambridge june 23 1883     argument   the scene of the following poem is laid chiefly in the vicinity of loch katrine in the western highlands of perthshire the time of action includes six days and the transactions of each day occupy a canto      the lady of the lake     canto first  the chase         harp of the north that mouldering long hast hung         on the witchelm that shades saint fillans spring      and down the fitful breeze thy numbers flung         till envious ivy did around thee cling      muffling with verdant ringlet every string         o minstrel harp still must thine accents sleep      mid rustling leaves and fountains murmuring         still must thy sweeter sounds their silence keep      nor bid a warrior smile nor teach a maid to weep       not thus in ancient days of caledon 10         was thy voice mute amid the festal crowd      when lay of hopeless love or glory won         aroused the fearful or subdued the proud      at each according pause was heard aloud         thine ardent symphony sublime and high      fair dames and crested chiefs attention bowed         for still the burden of thy minstrelsy      was knighthoods dauntless deed and beautys matchless eye       o wake once more how rude soeer the hand         that ventures oer thy magic maze to stray      o wake once more though scarce my skill command         some feeble echoing of thine earlier lay      though harsh and faint and soon to die away         and all unworthy of thy nobler strain      yet if one heart throb higher at its sway         the wizard note has not been touched in vain      then silent be no more enchantress wake again        i       the stag at eve had drunk his fill      where danced the moon on monans rill      and deep his midnight lair had made      in lone glenartneys hazel shade      but when the sun his beacon red      had kindled on benvoirlichs head      the deepmouthed bloodhounds heavy bay      resounded up the rocky way      and faint from farther distance borne      were heard the clanging hoof and horn        ii       as chief who hears his warder call      to arms the foemen storm the wall      the antlered monarch of the waste      sprung from his heathery couch in haste      but ere his fleet career he took      the dewdrops from his flanks he shook      like crested leader proud and high      tossed his beamed frontlet to the sky      a moment gazed adown the dale      a moment snuffed the tainted gale      a moment listened to the cry      that thickened as the chase drew nigh      then as the headmost foes appeared      with one brave bound the copse he cleared      and stretching forward free and far      sought the wild heaths of uamvar        iii       yelled on the view the opening pack      rock glen and cavern paid them back      to many a mingled sound at once      the awakened mountain gave response      a hundred dogs bayed deep and strong      clattered a hundred steeds along      their peal the merry horns rung out      a hundred voices joined the shout      with hark and whoop and wild halloo      no rest benvoirlichs echoes knew      far from the tumult fled the roe      close in her covert cowered the doe      the falcon from her cairn on high      cast on the rout a wondering eye      till far beyond her piercing ken      the hurricane had swept the glen      faint and more faint its failing din      returned from cavern cliff and linn      and silence settled wide and still      on the lone wood and mighty hill        iv       less loud the sounds of sylvan war      disturbed the heights of uamvar      and roused the cavern where t is told      a giant made his den of old      for ere that steep ascent was won      high in his pathway hung the sun      and many a gallant stayed perforce      was fain to breathe his faltering horse      and of the trackers of the deer      scarce half the lessening pack was near      so shrewdly on the mountainside      had the bold burst their mettle tried        v       the noble stag was pausing now      upon the mountains southern brow      where broad extended far beneath      the varied realms of fair menteith      with anxious eye he wandered oer      mountain and meadow moss and moor      and pondered refuge from his toil      by far lochard or aberfoyle      but nearer was the copsewood gray      that waved and wept on loch achray      and mingled with the pinetrees blue      on the bold cliffs of benvenue      fresh vigor with the hope returned      with flying foot the heath he spurned      held westward with unwearied race      and left behind the panting chase        vi       t were long to tell what steeds gave oer      as swept the hunt through cambusmore      what reins were tightened in despair      when rose benledis ridge in air      who flagged upon bochastles heath      who shunned to stem the flooded teith      for twice that day from shore to shore      the gallant stag swam stoutly oer      few were the stragglers following far      that reached the lake of vennachar      and when the brigg of turk was won      the headmost horseman rode alone        vii       alone but with unbated zeal      that horseman plied the scourge and steel      for jaded now and spent with toil      embossed with foam and dark with soil      while every gasp with sobs he drew      the laboring stag strained full in view      two dogs of black saint huberts breed      unmatched for courage breath and speed      fast on his flying traces came      and all but won that desperate game      for scarce a spears length from his haunch      vindictive toiled the bloodhounds stanch      nor nearer might the dogs attain      nor farther might the quarry strain      thus up the margin of the lake      between the precipice and brake      oer stock and rock their race they take        viii       the hunter marked that mountain high      the lone lakes western boundary      and deemed the stag must turn to bay      where that huge rampart barred the way      already glorying in the prize      measured his antlers with his eyes      for the deathwound and deathhalloo      mustered his breath his whinyard drew      but thundering as he came prepared      with ready arm and weapon bared      the wily quarry shunned the shock      and turned him from the opposing rock      then dashing down a darksome glen      soon lost to hound and hunters ken      in the deep trosachs wildest nook      his solitary refuge took      there while close couched the thicket shed      cold dews and wild flowers on his head      he heard the baffled dogs in vain      rave through the hollow pass amain      chiding the rocks that yelled again        ix       close on the hounds the hunter came      to cheer them on the vanished game      but stumbling in the rugged dell      the gallant horse exhausted fell      the impatient rider strove in vain       to rouse him with the spur and rein      for the good steed his labors oer      stretched his stiff limbs to rise no more      then touched with pity and remorse      he sorrowed oer the expiring horse      i little thought when first thy rein      i slacked upon the banks of seine      that highland eagle eer should feed      on thy fleet limbs my matchless steed      woe worth the chase woe worth the day      that costs thy life my gallant gray        x       then through the dell his horn resounds      from vain pursuit to call the hounds      back limped with slow and crippled pace      the sulky leaders of the chase      close to their masters side they pressed      with drooping tail and humbled crest      but still the dingles hollow throat      prolonged the swelling buglenote      the owlets started from their dream      the eagles answered with their scream      round and around the sounds were cast      till echo seemed an answering blast      and on the hunter tried his way      to join some comrades of the day      yet often paused so strange the road      so wondrous were the scenes it showed        xi       the western waves of ebbing day      rolled oer the glen their level way      each purple peak each flinty spire      was bathed in floods of living fire      but not a setting beam could glow      within the dark ravines below      where twined the path in shadow hid      round many a rocky pyramid      shooting abruptly from the dell      its thundersplintered pinnacle      round many an insulated mass      the native bulwarks of the pass      huge as the tower which builders vain      presumptuous piled on shinars plain      the rocky summits split and rent      formed turret dome or battlement      or seemed fantastically set      with cupola or minaret      wild crests as pagod ever decked      or mosque of eastern architect      nor were these earthborn castles bare      nor lacked they many a banner fair      for from their shivered brows displayed      far oer the unfathomable glade      all twinkling with the dewdrop sheen      the briarrose fell in streamers green      kind creeping shrubs of thousand dyes      waved in the westwinds summer sighs        xii       boon nature scattered free and wild      each plant or flower the mountains child      here eglantine embalmed the air      hawthorn and hazel mingled there      the primrose pale and violet flower      found in each cliff a narrow bower      foxglove and nightshade side by side      emblems of punishment and pride      grouped their dark hues with every stain      the weatherbeaten crags retain      with boughs that quaked at every breath      gray birch and aspen wept beneath      aloft the ash and warrior oak      cast anchor in the rifted rock      and higher yet the pinetree hung      his shattered trunk and frequent flung      where seemed the cliffs to meet on high      his boughs athwart the narrowed sky      highest of all where white peaks glanced      where glistening streamers waved and danced      the wanderers eye could barely view      the summer heavens delicious blue      so wondrous wild the whole might seem      the scenery of a fairy dream        xiii       onward amid the copse gan peep      a narrow inlet still and deep      affording scarce such breadth of brim      as served the wild ducks brood to swim      lost for a space through thickets veering      but broader when again appearing      tall rocks and tufted knolls their face      could on the darkblue mirror trace      and farther as the hunter strayed      still broader sweep its channels made      the shaggy mounds no longer stood      emerging from entangled wood      but waveencircled seemed to float      like castle girdled with its moat      yet broader floods extending still      divide them from their parent hill      till each retiring claims to be      an islet in an inland sea        xiv       and now to issue from the glen      no pathway meets the wanderers ken      unless he climb with footing nice      a farprojecting precipice      the brooms tough roots his ladder made      the hazel saplings lent their aid      and thus an airy point he won      where gleaming with the setting sun      one burnished sheet of living gold      loch katrine lay beneath him rolled      in all her length far winding lay      with promontory creek and bay      and islands that empurpled bright      floated amid the livelier light      and mountains that like giants stand      to sentinel enchanted land      high on the south huge benvenue      down to the lake in masses threw      crags knolls and mounds confusedly hurled      the fragments of an earlier world      a wildering forest feathered oer      his ruined sides and summit hoar      while on the north through middle air      benan heaved high his forehead bare        xv       from the steep promontory gazed      the stranger raptured and amazed      and what a scene were here he cried      for princely pomp or churchmans pride      on this bold brow a lordly tower      in that soft vale a ladys bower      on yonder meadow far away      the turrets of a cloister gray      how blithely might the buglehorn      chide on the lake the lingering morn      how sweet at eve the lovers lute      chime when the groves were still and mute      and when the midnight moon should lave      her forehead in the silver wave      how solemn on the ear would come      the holy matins distant hum      while the deep peals commanding tone      should wake in yonder islet lone      a sainted hermit from his cell      to drop a bead with every knell      and bugle lute and bell and all      should each bewildered stranger call      to friendly feast and lighted hall        xvi       blithe were it then to wander here      but nowbeshrew yon nimble deer      like that same hermits thin and spare      the copse must give my evening fare      some mossy bank my couch must be      some rustling oak my canopy      yet pass we that the war and chase      give little choice of restingplace      a summer night in greenwood spent      were but tomorrows merriment      but hosts may in these wilds abound      such as are better missed than found      to meet with highland plunderers here      were worse than loss of steed or deer      i am alonemy buglestrain      may call some straggler of the train      or fall the worst that may betide      ere now this falchion has been tried        xvii       but scarce again his horn he wound      when lo forth starting at the sound      from underneath an aged oak      that slanted from the islet rock      a damsel guider of its way      a little skiff shot to the bay      that round the promontory steep      led its deep line in graceful sweep      eddying in almost viewless wave      the weeping willow twig to rave      and kiss with whispering sound and slow      the beach of pebbles bright as snow       the boat had touched this silver strand      just as the hunter left his stand      and stood concealed amid the brake      to view this lady of the lake       the maiden paused as if again      she thought to catch the distant strain      with head upraised and look intent      and eye and ear attentive bent      and locks flung back and lips apart      like monument of grecian art      in listening mood she seemed to stand      the guardian naiad of the strand        xviii       and neer did grecian chisel trace      a nymph a naiad or a grace      of finer form or lovelier face      what though the sun with ardent frown      had slightly tinged her cheek with brown      the sportive toil which short and light      had dyed her glowing hue so bright      served too in hastier swell to show      short glimpses of a breast of snow      what though no rule of courtly grace      to measured mood had trained her pace      a foot more light a step more true      neer from the heathflower dashed the dew      een the slight harebell raised its head      elastic from her airy tread      what though upon her speech there hung       the accents of the mountain tongue      those silver sounds so soft so dear      the listener held his breath to hear        xix       a chieftains daughter seemed the maid      her satin snood her silken plaid      her golden brooch such birth betrayed      and seldom was a snood amid      such wild luxuriant ringlets hid      whose glossy black to shame might bring      the plumage of the ravens wing      and seldom oer a breast so fair      mantled a plaid with modest care      and never brooch the folds combined      above a heart more good and kind      her kindness and her worth to spy      you need but gaze on ellens eye

eye      or woe or pity claimed a sigh      or filial love was glowing there      or meek devotion poured a prayer      or tale of injury called forth      the indignant spirit of the north      one only passion unrevealed      with maiden pride the maid concealed      yet not less purely felt the flame      o need i tell that passions name        xx       impatient of the silent horn      now on

shallop from the shore      and when a space was gained between      closer she drew her bosoms screen      so forth the startled swan would swing      so turn to prune his ruffled wing      then safe though fluttered and amazed      she paused and on the stranger gazed      not his the form nor his the eye      that youthful maidens wont to fly        xxi       on his bold visage middle age      had slightly pressed its signet sage      yet had not quenched the open truth      and fiery vehemence of youth      forward and frolic glee was there      the will to do the soul to dare      the sparkling glance soon blown to fire      of hasty love or headlong ire      his limbs were cast in manly could      for hardy sports or contest bold      and though in peaceful garb arrayed      and weaponless except his blade      his stately mien as well implied      a highborn heart a martial pride      as if a barons crest he wore      and sheathed in armor bode the shore      slighting the petty need he showed      he told of his benighted road      his ready speech flowed fair and free      in phrase of gentlest courtesy      yet seemed that tone and gesture bland      less used to sue than to command        xxii       awhile the maid the stranger eyed      and reassured at length replied      that highland halls were open still      to wildered wanderers of the hill      nor think

oar      yet with main strength his strokes he drew      and oer the lake the shallop flew      with heads erect and whimpering cry      the hounds behind their passage ply      nor frequent does the bright oar break      the darkening mirror of the lake      until the rocky isle they reach      and moor their shallop on the beach        xxv       the stranger viewed the shore around      t was all so close with copsewood bound      nor track nor pathway might declare      that human foot frequented there      until the mountain maiden showed      a clambering unsuspected road      that winded through the tangled screen      and opened on a narrow green      where weeping birch and willow round      with their long fibres swept the ground      here for retreat in dangerous hour      some chief had framed a rustic bower        xxvi       it was a lodge of ample size      but strange of structure and device      of such materials as around      the workmans hand had readiest found      lopped of their boughs their hoar trunks bared      and by the hatchet rudely squared      to give the walls their destined height      the sturdy oak and ash unite      while moss and clay and leaves combined      to fence each crevice from the wind      the lighter pinetrees overhead      their slender length for rafters spread      and withered heath and rushes dry      supplied a russet canopy      due westward fronting to the green      a rural portico was seen      aloft on native pillars borne      of mountain fir with bark unshorn      where ellens hand had taught to twine

in this porch she stayed      and gayly to the stranger said      on heaven and on thy lady call      and enter the enchanted hall        xxvii       my hope my heaven my trust must be      my gentle guide in following thee       he crossed the thresholdand a clang      of angry steel that instant rang      to his bold brow his spirit rushed      but soon for vain alarm he blushed      when on the floor he saw displayed      cause of the din a naked blade      dropped from the sheath that careless flung      upon a stags huge antlers swung      for all around the walls to grace      hung

soldier matins try      and then awaked their fire to steal      as short and rude their soldier meal      that oer the gael around him threw      his graceful plaid of varied hue      and true to

to tell the saxon said      i dreamt not now to claim its aid      when here but three days since      i came bewildered in pursuit of game      all seemed as peaceful and as still      as the mist slumbering on yon hill      thy dangerous chief was then afar      nor soon expected back from war      thus said at least my mountainguide      though deep perchance the villain lied      yet why a second venture try      a warrior thou and ask me why      moves our free course by such fixed cause      as gives the poor mechanic laws      enough i sought to drive away      the lazy hours of peaceful day      slight cause will then suffice to guide      a knights free footsteps far and wide      a falcon flown a greyhound strayed      the merry glance of mountain maid      or if a path be dangerous known      the dangers self is lure alone        v       thy secret keep i urge thee not      yet ere again ye sought this spot      say heard ye naught of lowland war      against

warrior but yestermorn i knew      naught of thy chieftain roderick dhu      save as an outlawed desperate man      the chief of a rebellious clan      who in the regents court and sight      with ruffian dagger stabbed a knight      yet this alone might from his part      sever each true and loyal heart        vi       wrathful at such arraignment foul      dark lowered the clansmans sable scowl      a space he paused then sternly said      and heardst thou why he drew his blade      heardst thou that shameful word and blow      brought rodericks vengeance on his foe      what recked the chieftain if he stood      on highland heath or holyrood      he rights such wrong where it is given      if it were in the court of heaven      still was it outrageyet tis true      not then claimed sovereignty his due      while albany with feeble hand      held borrowed truncheon of command      the young king mewed in stirling tower      was stranger to respect and power      but then thy chieftains robber life      winning mean prey by causeless strife      wrenching from ruined lowland swain      his herds and harvest reared in vain      methinks a soul like thine should scorn

 i seek good faith a highland maid      free hadst thou been to come and go      but secret path marks secret foe      nor yet for this even as a spy      hadst thou unheard been doomed to die      save to fulfil an augury      well let it pass nor will i now      fresh cause of enmity avow      to chafe thy mood and cloud thy brow      enough i am by promise tied      to match me with this man of pride      twice have i sought clanalpines glen      in peace but when i come again      i come with banner brand and bow      as leader seeks his mortal foe      for lovelore swain in ladys bower      neer panted for the appointed hour      as i until before me stand      this rebel chieftain and his band        ix       have then thy wishhe whistled shrill      and he was answered from the hill      wild as the scream of the curlew      from crag to crag the signal flew      instant through copse and heath arose      bonnets and spears and bended bows      on right on left above below      sprung up at once the lurking foe      from shingles gray their lances start      the bracken bush sends forth the dart      the rushes and the willowwand      are bristling into axe and brand      and every tuft of broom gives life      to plaided warrior armed for strife      that whistle garrisoned the glen      at once with full five hundred men      as if the yawning hill to heaven      a subterranean host had given      watching their leaders beck and will      all silent there they stood and still      like the loose crags whose threatening mass      lay tottering oer the hollow pass      as if an infants touch could urge      their headlong passage down the verge      with step and weapon forward flung      upon the mountainside they hung      the mountaineer cast glance of pride      along benledis living side      then fixed his eye and sable brow      full on fitzjames how sayst thou now      these are clanalpines warriors true      and saxoni am roderick dhu        x       fitzjames was bravethough to his heart      the lifeblood thrilled with sudden start      he manned himself with dauntless air      returned the chief his haughty stare      his back against a rock he bore      and firmly placed his foot before      come one come all this rock shall fly      from its firm base as soon as i      sir roderick markedand in his eyes      respect was mingled with surprise      and the stern joy which warriors feel      in foeman worthy of their steel      short space he stoodthen waved his hand      down sunk the disappearing band      each warrior vanished where he stood      in broom or bracken heath or wood      sunk brand and spear and bended bow      in osiers pale and copses low      it seemed as if their mother earth      had swallowed up her warlike birth      the winds last breath had tossed in air      pennon and plaid and plumage fair      the next but swept a lone hillside      where heath and fern were waving wide      the suns last glance was glinted back      from spear and glaive from targe and jack      the next all unreflected shone      on bracken green and cold gray stone        xi       fitzjames looked roundyet scarce believed      the witness that his sight received      such apparition well might seem      delusion of a dreadful dream      sir roderick in suspense he eyed      and to his look the chief replied      fear naughtnay that i need not say      butdoubt not aught from mine array      thou art my guesti pledged my word      as far as coilantogle ford      nor would i call a clansmans brand      for aid against one valiant hand      though on our strife lay every vale      rent by the saxon from the gael      so move we oni only meant      to show the reed on which you leant      deeming this path you might pursue      without a pass from roderick dhu      they movedi said fitzjames was brave      as ever knight that belted glaive      yet dare not say that now his blood      kept on its wont and tempered flood      as following rodericks stride he drew      that seeming lonesome pathway through      which yet by fearful proof was rife      with lances that to take his life      waited but signal from a guide      so late dishonored and defied      ever by stealth his eye sought round      the vanished guardians of the ground      and stird from copse and heather deep      fancy saw spear and broadsword peep      and in the plovers shrilly strain      the signal whistle heard again      nor breathed he free till far behind      the pass was left for then they wind      along a wide and level green      where neither tree nor tuft was seen      nor rush nor bush of broom was near      to hide a bonnet or a spear        xii       the chief in silence strode before      and reached that torrents sounding shore      which daughter of three mighty lakes      from vennachar in silver breaks      sweeps through the plain and ceaseless mines      on bochastle the mouldering lines      where rome the empress of the world      of yore her eagle wings unfurled      and here his course the chieftain stayed      threw down his target and his plaid      and to the lowland warrior said      bold saxon to his promise just      vichalpine has discharged his trust      this murderous chief this ruthless man      this head of a rebellious clan      hath led thee safe through watch and ward      far past clanalpines outmost guard      now man to man and steel to steel      a chieftains vengeance thou shalt feel      see here all vantageless i stand      armed like thyself with single brand      for this is coilantogle ford      and thou must keep thee with thy sword        xiii       the saxon paused i neer delayed      when foeman bade me draw my blade      nay more brave chief i vowed thy death      yet sure thy fair and generous faith      and my deep debt for life preserved      a better meed have well deserved      can naught but blood our feud atone      are there no means no stranger none      and hearto fire thy flagging zeal      the saxon cause rests on thy steel      for thus spoke fate by prophet bred      between the living and the dead      who spills the foremost foemans life      his party conquers in the strife      then by my word the saxon said      the riddle is already read      seek yonder brake beneath the cliff      there lies red murdoch stark and stiff      thus fate hath solved her prophecy      then yield to fate and not to me      to james at stirling let us go      when if thou wilt be still his foe      or if the king shall not agree      to grant thee grace and favor free      i plight mine honor oath and word      that to thy native strengths restored      with each advantage shalt thou stand      that aids thee now to guard thy land        xiv       dark lightning flashed from rodericks eye      soars thy presumption then so high      because a wretched kern ye slew      homage to name to roderick dhu      he yields not he to man nor fate      thou addst but fuel to my hate      my clansmans blood demands revenge      not yet preparedby heaven i change      my thought and hold thy valor light      as that of some vain carpet knight      who ill deserved my courteous care      and whose best boast is but to wear      a braid of his fair ladys hair i thank thee      roderick for the word      it nerves my heart it steels my sword      for i have sworn this braid to stain      in the best blood that warms thy vein      now truce farewell and rush begone      yet think not that by thee alone      proud chief can courtesy be shown      though not from copse or heath or cairn      start at my whistle clansmen stern      of this small horn one feeble blast      would fearful odds against thee cast      but fear notdoubt notwhich thou wilt      we try this quarrel hilt to hilt      then each at once his falchion drew      each on the ground his scabbard threw      each looked to sun and stream and plain      as what they neer might see again      then foot and point and eye opposed      in dubious strife they darkly closed        xv       ill fared it then with

thousand copies were sold between june 2d and september 22d 1810 and repeated editions were subsequently called for in 1830 the following introduction was prefixed to the poem by the author  after the success of marmion i felt inclined to exclaim with ulysses in the odyssey     greek letters      odys x 5     one venturous game my hand has won today      another gallants yet remains to play  the ancient manners the habits and customs of the aboriginal race by whom the highlands of scotland were inhabited had always appeared to me peculiarly adapted to poetry the change in their manners too had taken place almost within my own time or at least i had learned many particulars concerning the ancient state of the highlands from the old men of the last generation i had always thought the old scottish gael highly adapted for poetical composition the feuds and political dissensions which half a century earlier would have rendered the richer and wealthier part of the kingdom indisposed to countenance a poem the scene of which was laid in the highlands were now sunk in the generous compassion which the english more than any other nation feel for the misfortunes of an honourable foe the poems of ossian had by their popularity sufficiently shown that if writings on highland subjects were qualified to interest the reader mere national prejudices were in the present day very unlikely to interfere with their success  i had also read a great deal seen much and heard more of that romantic country where i was in the habit of spending some time every autumn and the scenery of lock katrine was connected with the recollection of many a dear friend and merry expedition of former days this poem the action of which lay among scenes so beautiful and so deeply imprinted on my recollections was a labour of love and it was no less so to recall the manners and incidents introduced the frequent custom of james iv and particularly of james v to walk through their kingdom in disguise afforded me the hint of an incident which never fails to be interesting if managed with the slightest address or dexterity  i may now confess however that the employment though attended with great pleasure was not without its doubts and anxieties a lady to whom i was nearly related and with whom i lived during her whole life on the most brotherly terms of affection was residing with me at the time when the work was in progress and used to ask me what i could possibly do to rise so early in the morning that happening to be the most convenient to me for composition at last i told her the subject of my meditations and i can never forget the anxiety and affection expressed in her reply do not be so rash she said my dearest cousin 2 you are already popularmore so perhaps than you yourself will believe or than even i or other partial friends can fairly allow to your merit you stand highdo not rashly attempt to climb higher and incur the risk of a fall for depend upon it a favourite will not be permitted even to stumble with impunity i replied to this affectionate expostulation in the words of montrose     he either fears his fate too much         or his deserts are small       who dares not put it to the touch         to gain or lose it all  if i fail i said for the dialogue is strong in my recollection it is a sign that i ought never to have succeeded and i will write prose for life you shall see no change in my temper nor will i eat a single meal the worse but if i succeed     up with the bonnie blue bonnet        the dirk and the feather and a  afterwards i showed my affectionate and anxious critic the first canto of the poem which reconciled her to my imprudence nevertheless although i answered thus confidently with the obstinacy often said to be proper to those who bear my surname i acknowledge that my confidence was considerably shaken by the warning of her excellent taste and unbiased friendship nor was i much comforted by her retraction of the unfavourable judgment when i recollected how likely a natural partiality was to effect that change of opinion in such cases affection rises like a light on the canvas improves any favourable tints which it formerly exhibited and throws its defects into the shade  i remember that about the same time a friend started in to heeze up my hope like the sportsman with his cutty gun in the old song he was bred a farmer but a man of powerful understanding natural good taste and warm poetical feeling perfectly competent to supply the wants of an imperfect or irregular education he was a passionate admirer of fieldsports which we often pursued together  as this friend happened to dine with me at ashestiel one day i took the opportunity of reading to him the first canto of the lady of the lake in order to ascertain the effect the poem was likely to produce upon a person who was but too favourable a representative of readers at large it is of course to be supposed that i determined rather to guide my opinion by what my friend might appear to feel than by what he might think fit to say his reception of my recitation or prelection was rather singular he placed his hand across his brow and listened with great attention through the whole account of the staghunt till the dogs threw themselves into the lake to follow their master who embarks with ellen douglas he then started up with a sudden exclamation struck his hand on the table and declared in a voice of censure calculated for the occasion that the dogs must have been totally ruined by being permitted to take the water after such a severe chase i own i was much encouraged by the species of revery which had possessed so zealous a follower of the sports of the ancient nimrod who had been completely surprised out of all doubts of the reality of the tale another of his remarks gave me less pleasure he detected the identity of the king with the wandering knight fitzjames when he winds his bugle to summon his attendants he was probably thinking of the lively but somewhat licentious old ballad in which the denouement of a royal intrigue takes place as follows     he took a bugle frae his side        he blew both loud and shrill      and four and twenty belted knights        came skipping over the hill      then he took out a little knife        let a his duddies fa      and he was the brawest gentleman        that was amang them a            and well go no more a roving etc  this discovery as mr pepys says of the rent in his camlet cloak was but a trifle yet it troubled me and i was at a good deal of pains to efface any marks by which i thought my secret could be traced before the conclusion when i relied on it with the same hope of producing effect with which the irish postboy is said to reserve a trot for the avenue  i took uncommon pains to verify the accuracy of the local circumstances of this story i recollect in particular that to ascertain whether i was telling a probable tale i went into perthshire to see whether king james could actually have ridden from the banks of loch vennachar to stirling castle within the time supposed in the poem and had the pleasure to satisfy myself that it was quite practicable  after a considerable delay the lady of the lake appeared in june 1810 and its success was certainly so extraordinary as to induce me for the moment to conclude that i had at last fixed a nail in the proverbially inconstant wheel of fortune whose stability in behalf of an individual who had so boldly courted her favours for three successive times had not as yet been shaken i had attained perhaps that degree of reputation at which prudence or certainly timidity would have made a halt and discontinued efforts by which i was far more likely to diminish my fame than to increase it but as the celebrated john wilkes is said to have explained to his late majesty that he himself amid his full tide of popularity was never a wilkite so i can with honest truth exculpate myself from having been at any time a partisan of my own poetry even when it was in the highest fashion with the million it must not be supposed that i was either so ungrateful or so superabundantly candid as to despise or scorn the value of those whose voice had elevated me so much higher than my own opinion told me i deserved i felt on the contrary the more grateful to the public as receiving that from partiality to me which i could not have claimed from merit and i endeavoured to deserve the partiality by continuing such exertions as i was capable of for their amusement  it may be that i did not in this continued course of scribbling consult either the interest of the public or my own but the former had effectual means of defending themselves and could by their coldness sufficiently check any approach to intrusion and for myself i had now for several years dedicated my hours so much to literary labour that i should have felt difficulty in employing myself otherwise and so like dogberry i generously bestowed all my tediousness on the public comforting myself with the reflection that if posterity should think me undeserving of the favour with which i was regarded by my contemporaries they could not but say i had the crown and had enjoyed for a time that popularity which is so much coveted  i conceived however that i held the distinguished situation i had obtained however unworthily rather like the champion of pugilism 3 on the condition of being always ready to show proofs of my skill than in the manner of the champion of chivalry who performs his duties only on rare and solemn occasions i was in any case conscious that i could not long hold a situation which the caprice rather than the judgment of the public had bestowed upon me and preferred being deprived of my precedence by some more worthy rival to sinking into contempt for my indolence and losing my reputation by what scottish lawyers call the negative prescription accordingly those who choose to look at the introduction to rokeby will be able to trace the steps by which i declined as a poet to figure as a novelist as the ballad says queen eleanor sunk at charing cross to rise again at queenhithe  it only remains for me to say that during my short preeminence of popularity i faithfully observed the rules of moderation which i had resolved to follow before i began my course as a man of letters if a man is determined to make a noise in the world he is as sure to encounter abuse and ridicule as he who gallops furiously through a village must reckon on being followed by the curs in full cry experienced persons know that in stretching to flog the latter the rider is very apt to catch a bad fall nor is an attempt to chastise a malignant critic attended with less danger to the author on this principle i let parody burlesque and squibs find their own level and while the latter hissed most fiercely i was cautious never to catch them up as schoolboys do to throw them back against the naughty boy who fired them off wisely remembering that they are in such cases apt to explode in the handling let me add that my reign 4 since byron has so called it was marked by some instances of goodnature as well as patience i never refused a literary person of merit such services in smoothing his way to the public as were in my power and i had the advantage rather an uncommon one with our irritable race to enjoy general favour without incurring permanent illwill so far as is known to me among any of my contemporaries     ws    abbotsford april 1830  our limits do not permit us to add any extended selections from the many critical notices of the poem the verdict of jeffrey in the edinburgh review on its first appearance has been generally endorsed  upon the whole we are inclined to think more highly of the lady of the lake than of either of its authors former publications the lay and marmion we are more sure however that it has fewer faults than that it has greater beauties and as its beauties bear a strong resemblance to those with which the public has been already made familiar in these celebrated works we should not be surprised if its popularity were less splendid and remarkable for our own parts however we are of opinion that it will be oftener read hereafter than either of them and that if it had appeared first in the series their reception would have been less favourable than that which it has experienced it is more polished in its diction and more regular in its versification the story is constructed with infinitely more skill and address there is a greater proportion of pleasing and tender passages with much less antiquarian detail and upon the whole a larger variety of characters more artfully and judiciously contrasted there is nothing so fine perhaps as the battle in marmion or so picturesque as some of the scattered sketches in the lay but there is a richness and a spirit in the whole piece which does not pervade either of those poemsa profusion of incident and a shifting brilliancy of colouring that reminds us of the witchery of ariosto and a constant elasticity and occasional energy which seem to belong more peculiarly to the author now before us     canto first   each canto is introduced by one or more spenserian stanzas 5 forming a kind of prelude to it those prefixed to the first canto serve as an introduction to the whole poem which is inspired by the spirit of the old scottish minstrelsy   2 witchelm the broadleaved or wych elm ulmus montana indigenous to scotland forked branches of the tree were used in the olden time as diviningrods and riding switches from it were supposed to insure good luck on a journey in the closing stanzas of the poem vi 846 it is called the wizard elm tennyson in

had two springs which appear to be confounded by some editors of the poem one was at the eastern end of loch earn where the pretty modern village of st fillans now stands under the shadow of dun fillan or st fillans hills six hundred feet high on the top of which the saint used to say his prayers as the marks of his knees in the rock still testify to the credulous the other spring is at another village called st fillans nearly thirty miles to the westward just outside the limits of our map on the road to tyndrum in this holy pool as it is called insane folk were dipped with certain ceremonies and then left bound all night in the open air if they were found loose the next morning they were supposed to have been cured this treatment was practised as late as 1790 according to pennant who adds that the patients were generally found in the morning relieved of their troublesby death another writer in 1843 says that the pool is still visited not by people of the vicinity who have no faith in its virtue but by those from distant places scott alludes to this spring in marmion i 29     thence to saint fillans blessed well      whose springs can frenzied dreams dispel

particularly dangerous a wound received from a stags horn being then deemed poisonous and more dangerous than one from the tusks of a boar as the old rhyme testifies     if thou be hurt with hart it bring thee to thy bier     but barbers hand will boars hurt heal therefore thou        needst not fear  at all times however the task was dangerous and to be adventured upon wisely and warily either by getting behind the stag while he was gazing on the hounds or by watching an opportunity to gallop roundly in upon him and kill him with the sword see many directions to this purpose in the booke of hunting chap 41 wilson the historian has recorded a providential escape which befell him in the hazardous sport while a youth and follower of the earl of essex  sir peter lee of lime in cheshire invited my lord one summer to hunt the stagg and having a great stagg in chase and many gentlemen in the pursuit the stag took soyle and divers whereof i was one alighted and stood with swords drawne to have a cut at him at his coming out of the water the staggs there being wonderfully fierce and dangerous made us youths more eager to be at him but he escaped us all and it was my misfortune to be hindered of my coming nere him the way being sliperie by a falle which gave occasion to some who did not know mee to speak as if i had falne for feare which being told mee i left the stagg and followed the gentleman who first spake it but i found him of that cold temper that it seems his words made an escape from him as by his denial and repentance it appeared but this made mee more violent in the pursuit of the stagg to recover my reputation and i happened to be the only horseman in when the dogs sett him up at bay and approaching near him on horsebacke he broke through the dogs and run at mee and tore my horses side with his hornes close by my thigh then i quitted my horse and grew more cunning for the dogs had sette him up againe stealing behind him with my sword and cut his hamstrings and then got upon his back and cut his throate which as i was doing the company came in and blamed my rashness for running such a hazard pecks desiderata curiosa ii 464   138 whinyard a

singular faculty of seeing an otherwise invisible object without any previous means used by the person that uses if for that end the vision makes such a lively impression upon the seers that they neither see nor think of any thing else except the vision as long as it continues and then they appear pensive or jovial according to the object that was represented to them  at the sight of a vision the eyelids of the person are erected and the eyes continue staring until the object vanish this is obvious to others who are by when the persons happen to see a vision and occurred more than once to my own observation and to others that were with me  if a woman is seen standing at a mans left hand it is a presage that she will be his wife whether they be married to others or unmarried at the time

his perilous wanderings after the battle of culloden  it was situated in the face of a very rough high and rocky mountain called letternilichk still a part of benalder full of great stones and crevices and some scattered wood interspersed the habitation called the cage in the face of that mountain was within a small thick bush of wood there were first some rows of trees laid down in order to level the floor for a habitation and as the place was steep this raised the lower side to an equal height with the other and these trees in the way of joists or planks were levelled with earth and gravel there were betwixt the trees growing naturally on their own roots some stakes fixed in the earth which with the trees were interwoven with ropes made of heath and birch twigs up to the top of the cage it being of a round or rather oval shape and the whole thatched and covered over with fog the whole fabric hung as it were by a large tree which reclined from the one end all along the roof to the other and which gave it the name of the cage and by chance there happened to be two stones at a small distance from one another in the side next the precipice resembling the pillars of a

what period these instruments ceased to be used is not on record and tradition is silent on this head but as irish harpers occasionally visited the highlands and western isles till lately the harp might have been extant so late as the middle of the present century thus far we know that from remote times down to the present harpers were received as welcome guests particularly in the highlands of scotland and so late as the latter end of the sixteenth century as appears by the above quotations the harp was in common use among the natives of the western isles how it happened that the noisy and

killed in the genealogy of all the highland families sometimes preceptor to the young laird celebrates in irish verse the original of the tribe the famous warlike actions of the successive heads and sings his own lyricks as an opiate to the chief when indisposed for sleep but poets are not equally esteemed and honored in all countries i happened to be a witness of the dishonour done to the muse

which he was well known to be deeply disgusted but the valor of the douglases and their allies gave them the victory in every conflict at length the king while residing at falkland contrived to escape by night out of his own court and palace and rode full speed to stirling castle where the governor who was of the opposite faction joyfully received him being thus at liberty james speedily summoned around him such peers as he knew to be most inimical to the domination of angus and laid his complaint before them says pitscottie with great lamentations showing to them how he was holding in

been fabricated by enchanted skill of which we have various instances in the romances and legends of the time the wonderful sword skofnung wielded by the celebrated hrolf kraka was of this description it was deposited in the tomb of the monarch at his death and taken from thence by skeggo a celebrated pirate who bestowed it upon his soninlaw kormak with the following curious directions the manner of using it will appear strange to you a small bag is attached to it which take heed not to violate let not the rays of the sun touch the upper part of the handle nor unsheathe it unless thou art ready for battle but when thou comest to the place of fight go aside from the rest grasp and extend the sword and breathe upon it then a small worm will creep out of the handle lower the handle that he may more easily return into it kormak after having received the sword returned home to his mother he showed the sword and attempted to draw it as unnecessarily as ineffectually for he could not pluck it out of the sheath his mother dalla exclaimed do not despise the counsel given to thee my son kormak however repeating his efforts pressed down the handle with his feet and tore off the bag when skofung emitted a hollow groan but still he could not unsheathe the sword kormak then went out with bessus whom he had challenged to fight with him and drew apart at the place of combat he sat down upon the ground and ungirding the sword which he bore above his vestments did not remember to shield the hilt from the rays of the sun in vain he endeavored to draw it till he placed his foot against the hilt then the worm issued from it but kormak did not rightly handle the weapon in consequence whereof good fortune deserted it as he unsheathed skofnung it emitted a hollow murmur bartholini de causis contemptae a danis adhuc gentilibus mortis libri tres hafniae 1689 4to p 574  to the history of this sentient and prescient weapon i beg leave to add from memory the following legend for which i cannot produce any better authority a young nobleman of high hopes and fortune chanced to lose his way in the town which he inhabited the capital if i mistake not of a german province he had accidentally involved himself among the narrow and winding streets of a suburb inhabited by the lowest order of the people and an approaching thundershower determined him to ask a short refuge in the most decent habitation that was near him he knocked at the door which was opened by a tall man of a grisly and ferocious aspect and sordid dress the stranger was readily ushered to a chamber where swords scourges and machines which seemed to be implements of torture were suspended on the wall one of these swords dropped from its scabbard as the nobleman after a moments hesitation crossed the threshold his host immediately stared at him with such a marked expression that the young man could not help demanding his name and business and the meaning of his looking at him so fixedly i am answered the man the public executioner of this city and the incident you have observed is a sure augury that i shall in discharge of my duty one day cut off your head with the weapon which has just now spontaneously unsheathed itself the nobleman lost no time in leaving his place of refuge but engaging in some of the plots of the period was shortly after decapitated by that very man and instrument  lord lovat is said by the author of the letters from scotland vol ii p 214 to have affirmed that a number of swords that hung up in the hall of the mansionhouse leaped of

ordinary name and surname which were chiefly used in the intercourse with the lowlands every highland chief had an epithet expressive of his patriarchal dignity as head of the clan and which was common to all his predecessors and successors as pharaoh to the kings of egypt or arsaces to those of parthia this name was usually a patronymic expressive of his descent from the founder of the family thus the duke of argyll is called maccallum more or the son of colin the great sometimes however it is derived from armorial distinctions or the memory of some great feat thus lord seaforth as chief of the mackenzies or clankennet bears the epithet of caberfae or bucks head as representative of colin fitzgerald founder of the family who saved the scottish king when endangered by a stag but besides this title which belonged to his office and dignity the chieftain had usually another peculiar to himself which distinguished him from the chieftains of the same race this was sometimes derived from complexion as dhu or roy sometimes from size as beg or more at other times from some peculiar exploit or from some peculiarity of habit or appearance the line of the text therefore signifies     black roderick the descendant of alpine  the song itself is intended as an imitation of the jorrams or boat songs of the highlanders which were usually composed in honor of a favorite

lomond etc scott has the following note here   the lennox as the district is called which encircles the lower extremity of loch lomond was peculiarly exposed to the incursions of the mountaineers who inhabited the inaccessible fastnesses at the upper end of the lake and the neighboring district of loch katrine these were often marked by circumstances of great ferocity of which the noted conflict of glen fruin is a celebrated instance this was a clanbattle in which the macgregors headed by allaster macgregor chief of the clan encountered the sept of colquhouns commanded by sir humphry colquhoun of luss it is on all hands allowed that the action was desperately fought and that the colquhouns were defeated with slaughter leaving two hundred of their name dead upon the field but popular tradition has added other horrors to the tale it is said that sir humphry colquhoun who was on horseback escaped to the castle of benechra or bannochar and was next day dragged out and murdered by the victorious macgregors in cold blood buchanan of auchmar however speaks of his slaughter as a subsequent event and as perpetrated by the macfarlanes again it is reported that the macgregors murdered a number of youths whom report of the intended battle had brought to be spectators and whom the colquhouns anxious for their safety had shut up in a barn to be out of danger one account of the macgregors denies this circumstance entirely another ascribes it to the savage and bloodthirsty disposition of a single individual the bastard brother of the laird of macgregor who amused himself with this second massacre of the innocents in express disobedience to the chief by whom he was left their guardian during the pursuit of the colquhouns it is added that macgregor bitterly lamented this atrocious action and prophesied the ruin which it must bring upon their ancient clan   the consequences of the battle of glen fruin were very calamitous to the family of macgregor who had already been considered as an unruly clan the widows of the slain colquhouns sixty it is said in number appeared in doleful procession before the king at stirling each riding upon a white palfrey and bearing in her hand the bloody shirt of her husband displayed upon a pike james vi was so much moved by the complaints of this choir of mourning dames that he let loose his vengeance against the macgregors without either bounds or moderation the very name of the clan was proscribed and those by whom it had been borne were given up to sword and fire and absolutely hunted down by bloodhounds like wild beasts argyll and the campbells on the one hand montrose with the grahames and buchanans on the other are said to have been the chief instruments in suppressing this devoted clan the laird of macgregor surrendered to the former on condition that he would take him out of scottish ground but to use birrels expression he kept a highlandmans promise and although he fulfilled his word to the letter by carrying him as far as berwick he afterwards brought him back to edinburgh where he was executed with eighteen of his clan birrels diary 2d oct 1903 the clan gregor being thus driven to utter despair seem to have renounced the laws from the benefit of which they were excluded and their depredations produced new acts of council confirming the severity of their proscription which had only the effect of rendering them still more united and desperate it is a most extraordinary proof of the ardent and invincible spirit of clanship that notwithstanding the repeated proscriptions providently ordained by the legislature for the timeous preventing the disorders and oppression that may fall out by the said name and clan of macgregors and their followers they were in

mode of quelling the border robbers who during the license of his minority and the troubles which followed had committed many exorbitances accordingly he assembled a flying army of ten thousand men consisting of his principal nobility and their followers who were directed to bring their hawks and dogs with them that the monarch might refresh himself with sport during the intervals of military execution with this array he swept through ettrick forest where he hanged over the gate of his own castle piers cockburn of henderland who had prepared according to tradition a feast for his reception he caused adam scott of tushiclaw also to be executed who was distinguished by the title of king of the border but the most noted victim of justice during that expedition was john armstrong of gilnockie famous in scottish song who confiding in his own supposed innocence met the king with a retinue of thirtysix persons all of whom were hanged at carlenrig near the source of the teviot the effect of this severity was such that as the vulgar expressed it the rushbush kept the cow and thereafter was great peace and rest a long time wherethrough the king had great profit for he had ten thousand sheep going in the ettrick forest in keeping by andrew bell who made the king as good count of them as they had gone in the bounds of fife pitscotties history p 153   623 meggats mead the

past to the isles and there held justice courts and punished both thief and traitor according to their demerit and also he caused great men to show their holdings wherethrough he found many of the said lands in nonentry the which he confiscate and brought home to his own use and afterwards annexed them to the crown as ye shall hear syne brought many of the great men of the isles captive with him such as mudyart mconnel mloyd of the lewes mneil mlane mintosh john mudyart mkay mkenzie with many other that i cannot rehearse at this time some of them he put in ward and some in court and some he took pledges for good rule in time coming so he brought the isles both north and south in good rule and peace wherefore he had great profit service and obedience of people a long time hereafter and

effeminacy was the most bitter which could be thrown upon him yet it was sometimes hazarded on what we might presume to think slight grounds it is reported of old sir ewen cameron of lochiel when upwards of seventy that he was surprised by night on a hunting or military expedition he wrapped him in his plaid and lay contentedly down upon the snow with which the ground happened to be covered among his attendants who were preparing to take their rest in the same manner he observed that one of his grandsons for his better accommodation had rolled a large snowball and placed it below his head the wrath of the ancient chief was awakened by a symptom of what he conceived to be degenerate luxury out upon thee said he kicking the frozen bolster from the head which it supported art thou so effeminate as to need a pillow the officer of engineers whose curious letters from the highlands have been more than once quoted tells a similar story of macdonald of keppoch and subjoins the following remarks this and many other stories are romantick but there is one thing that at first thought might seem very romantick of which i have been credibly assured that when the highlanders are constrained to lie among the hills in cold dry weather they sometimes soak the plaid in some river or burn ie brook and then holding up a corner of it a little above their heads they turn themselves round and round till they are enveloped by the whole mantle they then lay themselves down on the heath upon the leeward side of some hill where the wet and the warmth of their bodies make a steam like that of a boiling kettle the wet they say keeps them warm by thickening the stuff and keeping the wind from penetrating i must confess i should have been apt to question this fact had i not frequently seen them wet from morning to night and even at the beginning of the rain not so much as stir a few yards to shelter but continue in it without necessity till they were as we say wet through and through and that is soon effected by the looseness and spunginess of the plaiding but the bonnet is frequently taken off and wrung like a dishclout and then put on again they have been accustomed from their infancy to be often wet and to take the water like spaniels and this is become a second nature and can scarcely be called a hardship to them insomuch that i used to say they seemed to be of the duck kind and to love water as well though i never saw this preparation for sleep in windy weather yet setting out early in a morning from one of the huts i have seen the marks of their lodging where the ground has been free from rime or snow which remained all round the spot where they had lain letters from scotland lond 1754 8vo ii p 108   809 his henchman scott quotes again the letters from

whence his title is derived and watches the conversation to see if any one offends his patron an english officer being in company with a certain chieftain and several other highland gentlemen near killichumen had an argument with the great man and both being well warmed with usky whisky at last the dispute grew very hot a youth who was henchman not understanding one word of english imagined his chief was insulted and thereupon drew his pistol from his side and snapped it at the officers head but the pistol missed fire otherwise it is more than probable he might have suffered death from the hand of that little vermin but it is very disagreeable to an englishman over a bottle with the highlanders to see every one of them have his gilly that is his servant standing behind him all the while

summon his clan upon any sudden or important emergency he slew a goat and making a cross of any light wood seared its extremities in the fire and extinguished them in the blood of the animal this was called the fiery cross also crean tarigh or the cross of shame because disobedience to what the symbol implied inferred infamy it was delivered to a swift and trusty messenger who ran full speed with it to the next hamlet where he presented it to the principal person with a single word implying the place of rendezvous he who received the symbol was bound to send it forward with equal despatch to the next village and thus it passed with incredible celerity through all the district which owed allegiance to the chief and also among his allies and neighbours if the danger was common to them at sight of the fiery cross every man from sixteen years old to sixty capable of bearing arms was obliged instantly to repair in his best arms and accoutrements to the place of rendezvous he who failed to appear suffered the extremities of fire and sword which were emblematically denounced to the disobedient by the bloody and burnt marks upon this warlike signal during the civil war of 17456 the fiery cross often made its circuit and upon one occasion it passed through the whole district of breadalbane a tract of thirtytwo miles in three hours the late alexander stewart esq of invernahyle described to me his having sent round the fiery cross through the district of appine during the same commotion the coast was threatened by a descent from two english trigates and the flower of the young men were with the army of prince charles edward then in england yet the summons was so effectual that even old age and childhood obeyed it and a force was collected in a few hours so numerous and so enthusiastic that all attempt at the intended diversion upon the country of the absent warriors was in prudence abandoned as desperate   19 the summer dawns reflected hue etc mr ruskin says modern painters iii 278 and thus nature becomes dear to scott in a threefold way dear to him first as containing those remains or memories of the past which he cannot find in cities and giving hope of praetorian mound or knights grave in every green slope and shade of its desolate places dear secondly in its moorland liberty which has for him just as high a charm as the fenced garden had for the mediaeval and dear to him finally in that perfect beauty denied alike in cities and in men for which every modern heart had begun at last to thirst and scotts in its freshness and power of all mens most earnestly  and in this love of beauty observe that the love of colour is a leading element his healthy mind being incapable of losing under any modern false teaching its joy in brilliancy of hue  in general if he does not mean to say much about things the one character which he will give is colour using it with the most perfect mastery and faithfulness  after giving many illustrations of scotts use of colour in his poetry ruskin quotes the present passage which he says is still more interesting because it has no form in it at all except in one word chalice but wholly composes its imagery either of colour or of that delicate halfbelieved life which we have seen to be so important an element in modern landscape  two more considerations he adds are however suggested by the above passage the first that the love of natural history excited by the continual attention now given to all wild landscape heightens reciprocally the interest of that landscape and becomes an important element in scotts description leading him to finish down to the minutest speckling of breast and slightest shade of attributed emotion the portraiture of birds and animals in strange opposition to homers slightly named seacrows who have care of the works of the sea and dantes singingbirds of undefined species compare carefully the 2d and 3d stanzas of rokeby  the second point i have to note is scotts habit of drawing a slight moral from every scene and that this slight moral is almost always melancholy here he has stopped short without entirely expressing it     the mountainshadows      lie      like future joys to fancys eye  his completed thought would be that these future joys like the mountainshadows were never to be attained it occurs fully uttered in many other places he seems to have been constantly rebuking his own worldly pride and vanity but never purposefully      the foamglobes on her eddies ride      thick as the schemes of human pride      that down lifes current drive amain      as frail as frothy and as vain  ruskin adds among other illustrations the reference to foxglove and nightshade in i 218 219 above   28 like future joys etc this passage quoted by ruskin above also illustrates what is comparatively rare in figurative languagetaking the immaterial to exemplify the material the latter is constantly used to symbolize or elucidate the former but one would have to search long in our modern poetry to find a dozen instances where as here the relation is reversed cf 639 below we have another example in the second passage quoted by ruskin cf also tennysons

regular worship to secure nevertheless the ghostly assistance of confessors perfectly willing to adapt the nature of their doctrine to the necessities and peculiar circumstances of their flock robin hood it is well known had his celebrated domestic chaplain friar tuck and that same curtal friar was probably matched in manners and appearance by the ghostly fathers of the tynedale robbers who are thus described in an excommunication fulminated against their patrons by richard fox bishop of durham tempore henrici viii we have further understood that there are many chaplains in the said territories of tynedale and redesdale who are public and open maintainers of concubinage irregular suspended excommunicated and interdicted persons and withal so utterly ignorant of letters that it has been found by those who objected this to them that there were some who having celebrated mass for ten years were still unable to read the sacramental service we have also understood there are persons among them who although not ordained do take upon them the offices of priesthood and in contempt of god celebrate the divine and sacred rites and administer the sacraments not only in sacred and dedicated places but in those which are prophane and interdicted and most wretchedly ruinous they themselves being attired in ragged torn and most filthy vestments altogether unfit to be used in divine or even in temporal offices the which said chaplains do administer sacraments and sacramental rites to the aforesaid manifest and infamous thieves robbers depredators receivers of stolen goods and plunderers and that without restitution or intention to restore as evinced by the act and do also openly admit them to the rites of ecclesiastical sepulchre without exacting security for restitution although they are prohibited from doing so by the sacred canons as well as by the institutes of the saints and fathers all which infers the heavy peril of their own souls and is a pernicious example to the other believers in christ as well as no slight but an aggravated injury to the numbers despoiled and plundered of their goods gear herds and chattels   74 benharrow a

geographical collections made by the laird of macfarlane   102 bucklered served as a buckler to shielded   114 snood cf i 363 above scott has the following note here the snood or riband with which as scottish lass braided her hair had an emblematical signification and applied to her maiden character it was exchanged for the curch toy or coif when she passed by marriage into the matron state but if the damsel was so unfortunate as to lose pretensions to the name of maiden without gaining a right to that of matron she was neither permitted to use the snood nor advanced to the graver dignity of the curch in old scottish songs there occur many sly allusions to such misfortune as in the old words to the popular tune of ower the muir amang the heather        down amang the broom the broom        down amang the broom my dearie     the lassie lost her silken snood        that gard her greet till she was wearie   120 or or for either or as often in poetry   131 till frantic etc the ms reads

142 above   149 the desert gave him etc scott says here in adopting the legend concerning the birth of the founder of the church of kilmallie the author has endeavored to trace the effects which such a belief was likely to produce in a barbarous age on the person to whom it related it seems likely that he must have become a fanatic or an impostor or that mixture of both which forms a more frequent character than either of them as existing separately in truth mad persons are frequently more anxious to impress upon others a faith in their visions than they are themselves confirmed in their reality as on the other hand it is difficult for the most coolheaded impostor long to personate an enthusiast without in some degree believing what he is so eager to have believed it was a natural attribute of such a character as the supposed hermit that he should credit the numerous superstitions with which the minds of ordinary highlanders are almost always imbued a few of these are slightly alluded to in this stanza the river demon or riverhorse for it is that form which he commonly assumes is the kelpy of the lowlands an evil and malicious spirit delighting to forebode and to witness calamity he frequents most highland lakes and rivers and one of his most memorable exploits was performed upon the banks of loch vennachar in the very district which forms the scene of our action it consisted in the destruction of a funeral procession with all its attendants the noontide hag called in gaelic glaslich a tall emaciated gigantic female figure is supposed in particular to haunt the district of knoidart a goblin dressed in antique armor and having one hand covered with blood called from that circumstance lhamdearg or redhand is a tenant of the forests of glenmore and rothiemurcus other spirits of the desert all frightful in shape and malignant in disposition are believed to frequent different mountains and glens of the highlands where any unusual appearance produced by mist or the strange lights that are sometimes thrown upon particular objects never fails to present an apparition to the imagination of the solitary and melancholy mountaineer   161 mankind accented on the

and seen her wrinkled form the sign      of woe and death to alpines line  scott has the following note here most great families in the highlands were supposed to have a tutelar or rather a domestic spirit attached to them who took an interest in their prosperity and intimated by its wailings any approaching disaster that of grant of grant was called may moullach and appeared in the form of a girl who had her arm covered with hair grant of rothiemurcus had an attendant called bodachandun or the ghost of the hill and many other examples might be mentioned the benshie implies the female fairy whose lamentations were often supposed to precede the death of a chieftain of particular families when she is visible it is in the form of an old woman with a blue mantle and streaming hair a superstition of the same kind is i believe universally received by the inferior ranks of the native irish  the death of the head of a highland family is also sometimes supposed to be announced by a chain of lights of different colours called dreug or death of the druid the direction which it takes marks the place of the funeral see the essay on fairy superstitions in scotts border minstrelsy   169 sounds too had come etc scott says a presage of the kind alluded to in the text is still believed to announce death to the ancient highland family of mlean of lochbuy the spirit of an ancestor slain in battle is heard to gallop along a stony bank and then to ride thrice around the family residence ringing his fairy bridle and thus intimating the approaching calamity how easily the eye as well as the ear may be deceived upon such occasions is evident from the stories of armies in the air and other spectral phenomena with which history abounds such an apparition is said to have been witnessed upon the side of southfell mountain between penrith and keswick upon the 23d june 1744 by two persons william lancaster of blakehills and daniel stricket his servant whose attestation to the fact with a full account of the apparition dated the 21st of july 1745 is printed in clarkes survey of the lakes the apparition consisted of several troops of horse moving in regular order with a steady rapid motion making a curved sweep around the fell and seeming to the spectators to disappear over the ridge of the mountain many persons witnessed this phenomenon and observed the last or last but one of the supposed troop occasionally leave his rank and pass at a gallop to the front when he resumed the steady pace the curious appearance making the necessary allowance for imagination may be perhaps sufficiently accounted for by optical deception   171 shingly gravelly pebbly   173 thunderbolt the 1st ed has thunder too   188 framed the reading of the 1st ed commonly misprinted formed

family places of sepulture of several neighboring clans the monuments of the lairds of macgregor and of other families claiming a descent from the old scottish king alpine are most remarkable the highlanders are as zealous of their rights of sepulture as may be expected from a people whose whole laws and government if clanship can be called so turned upon the single principle of family descent

was a wild expression of lamentation poured forth by the mourners over the body of a departed friend when the words of it were articulate they expressed the praises of the deceased and the loss the clan would sustain by his death the following is a lamentation of this kind literally translated from the gaelic to some of the ideas of which the text stands indebted the tune is so popular that it has since become the warmarch or gathering of the clan     coronach on sir lauchlan chief of maclean       which of all the senachies      can trace thy line from the root up to paradise      but

but roderick dhus command scott has the following note here  the deep and implicit respect paid by the highland clansmen to their chief rendered this both a common and a solemn oath in other respects they were like most savage nations capricious in their ideas concerning the obligatory power of oaths one solemn mode of swearing was by kissing the dirk imprecating upon themselves death by that or a similar weapon if they broke their vow but for oaths in the usual form they are said to have had little respect as for the reverence due to the chief it may be guessed from the following odd example of a highland point of honour  the clan whereto the abovementioned tribe belongs is the only one i have heard of which is without a chief that is being divided into families under several chieftains without any particular patriarch of the whole name and this is a great reproach as may appear from an affair that fell out at my table in the highlands between one of that name and a cameron the provocation given by the latter was name your chief the return of it at once was you are a fool they went out next morning but having early notice of it i sent a small party of soldiers after them which in all probability prevented some barbarous mischief that might have ensued for the chiefless highlander who is himself a petty chieftain was going to the place appointed with a smallsword and pistol whereas the cameron an old man took with him only his broadsword according to the agreement  when all was over and i had at least seemingly reconciled them i was told the words of which i

stupendous rocks and overshadowed with birchtrees mingled with oaks the spontaneous production of the mountain even where its cliffs appear denuded of soil a dale in so wild a situation and amid a people whose genius bordered on the romantic did not remain without appropriate deities the name literally implies the corri or den of the wild or shaggy men perhaps this as conjectured by mr alexander campbell journey from edinburgh 1802 p 109 may have originally only implied its being the haunt of a ferocious banditti but tradition has ascribed to the urisk who gives name to the cavern a figure between a goat and a man in short however much the classical reader may be startled precisely that of the grecian satyr the urisk seems not to have inherited with the form the petulance of the silvan deity of the classics his occupation on the contrary resembled those of miltons lubbar fiend or of the scottish brownie though he differed from both in name and appearance the urisks says dr graham were a sort of lubberly supernaturals who like the brownies could be gained over by kind attention to perform the drudgery of the farm and it was believed that many families in the highlands had one of the order attached to it they were supposed to be dispersed over the highlands each in his own wild recess but the solemn stated meetings of the order were regularly held in this cave of benvenue this current superstition no doubt alludes to some circumstance in the ancient history of this country scenery on the southern confines of perthshire p 19 1806 it must be owned that the coir or den does not in its present state meet our ideas of a subterraneous grotto or cave being only a small and narrow cavity among huge fragments of rocks rudely piled together but such a scene is liable to convulsions of nature which a lowlander cannot estimate and which may have choked up what was originally a cavern at least the name and tradition warrant the author of a fictitious tale to

below   672 a single page etc scott says a highland chief being as absolute in his patriarchal authority as any prince had a corresponding number of officers attached to his person he had his bodyguards called luichttach picked from his clan for strength activity and entire devotion to his person these according to their deserts were sure to share abundantly in the rude profusion of his hospitality it is recorded for example by tradition that allan maclean chief of that clan happened upon a time to hear one of these favorite retainers observe to his comrade that their chief grew old whence do you infer that replied the other when was it rejoined the first that a solider of allans was obliged as i am now not only to eat the flesh from the bone but even to tear off the inner skin or filament the hint was quite sufficient and maclean next morning to relieve his followers from such dire necessity undertook an inroad on the mainland the ravage of which altogether effaced the memory of his former expeditions for the like purpose  our officer of engineers so often quoted has given us a distinct list of the domestic officers who independent of luichttach or gardes de corps belonged to the establishment of a highland chief these are 1 the henchman 2 the bard see preceding notes 3 bladier or spokesman 4 gilliemore or swordbearer alluded to in the text 5 gilliecasflue who

letters from scotland vol ii p 158 although this appeared naturally enough very ridiculous to an english officer who considered the master of such a retinue as no more than an english gentleman of £500 a year yet in the circumstances of the chief whose strength and importance consisted in the number and attachment of his followers it was of the last consequence in point of policy to have in his gift subordinate offices which called immediately round his person those who were most devoted to him and being of value in their estimation were also the means of rewarding them   693 to drown etc

in the text a person was wrapped up in the skin of a newlyslain bullock and deposited beside a waterfall or at the bottom of a precipice or in some other strange wild and unusual situation where the scenery around him suggested nothing but objects of horror in this situation he revolved in his mind the question proposed and whatever was impressed upon him by his exalted imagination passed for the inspiration of the disembodied spirits who haunt these desolate recesses in some of the hebrides they attributed the same oracular power to a large black stone by the seashore which they approached with certain solemnities and considered the first fancy which came into their own minds after they did so to be the undoubted dictate of the tutelar deity of the stone and as such to be if possible punctually complied with   68 gallangad we do not find this name elsewhere but it probably belongs to some part of the district referred to in scotts note inserted here i know not if it be worth observing that this passage is taken almost literally from the mouth of an old highland kern or ketteran as they were called he used to narrate the merry doings of the good old time when he was follower of rob roy macgregor this leader on one occasion thought proper to make a descent upon the lower part of the loch lomond district and summoned all the heritors and farmers to meet at the kirk of drymen to pay him blackmail ie tribute for forbearance and protection as this invitation was supported by a band of thirty or forty stout fellows only one gentleman an ancestor if i mistake not of

below scott says here everything belonging to the chase was matter of solemnity among our ancestors but nothing was more so than the mode of cutting up or as it was technically called breaking the slaughtered stag the forester had his allotted portion the hounds had a certain allowance and to make the division as general as possible the very birds had their share also there is a little gristle says tubervile which is upon the spoone of the brisket which we call the ravens bone and i have seen in some places a raven so wont and accustomed to it that she would never fail to croak and cry for

published in the minstrelsy of the scottish border the most valuable part of which was supplied by my learned and indefatigable friend dr john leyden most of the circumstances are collected which can throw light upon the popular belief which even yet prevails respecting them in scotland dr grahame author of an entertaining work upon the scenery of the perthshire highlands already frequently quoted has recorded with great accuracy the peculiar tenets held by the highlanders on this topic in the vicinity of loch katrine the learned author is inclined to deduce the whole mythology from the druidical systeman opinion to which there are many objections  the daoine shi or men of peace of the highlanders though not absolutely malevolent are believed to be a peevish repining race of beings who possessing themselves but a scanty portion of happiness are supposed to envy mankind their more complete and substantial enjoyments they are supposed to enjoy in their subterraneous recesses a sort of shadowy happinessa tinsel grandeur which however they would willingly exchange for the more solid joys of mortality   they are believed to inhabit certain round grassy eminences where they celebrate their nocturnal festivities by the light of the moon about a mile beyond the source of the forth above loch con there is a placed called coirshian or the cove of the men of peace which is still supposed to be a favorite place of their residence in the neighborhood are to be seen many round conical eminences particularly one near the head of the lake by the skirts of which many are

admitted into their subterraneous abodes many it is said of mortal race have been entertained in their secret recesses there they have been received into the most splendid apartments and regaled with the most sumptuous banquets and delicious wines their females surpass the daughters of men in beauty the seemingly happy inhabitants pass their time in festivity and in dancing to notes of the softest music but unhappy is the mortal who joins in their joys or ventures to partake of their dainties by this indulgence he forfeits for ever the society of men and is bound down irrevocably to the condition of shiich or man of peace   301 why sounds etc it has been already observed that fairies if not positively malevolent are capricious and easily offended they are like other proprietors of forests peculiarly jealous of their rights of vert and venison this jealousy was also an attribute of the northern duergar or dwarfs to many of whose distinctions the fairies seem so have succeeded if indeed they are not the same class of beings in the huge metrical record of german chivalry entitled the heldenbuch sir hildebrand and the other heroes of whom it treats are engaged in one of their most desperate adventures from a rash violation of the rosegarden of an elfin or dwarf king  there are yet traces of a belief in this worst and most malicious order of fairies among the border wilds dr leyden has introduced such a dwarf into his ballad entitled the cout of keeldar and has not forgot his characteristic detestation of the chase      the third blast that young keeldar blew       still stood the limber fern     and a wee man of swarthy hue       upstarted by a cairn      his russet weeds were brown as heath       that clothes the upland fell     and the hair of his head was frizzy red       as the purple heatherbell      an urchin clad in prickles red       clung cowring to his arm     the hounds they howld and backward fled       as struck by fairy charm      why rises high the staghounds cry       where staghound neer should be     why wakes that horn the silent morn       without the leave of me      brown dwarf that oer the muirland strays       thy name to keeldar tell      the brown man of the muirs who stays       beneath the heatherbell      t is sweet beneath the heatherbell        to live in autumn brown     and sweet to hear the lavrocks swell        far far from tower and town      but woe betide the shrilling horn       the chases surly cheer     and ever that hunter is forlorn       whom first at morn i hear  the poetical picture here given of the duergar corresponds exactly with the following northumberland legend with which i was lately favored by my learned and kind friend mr surtees of mainsforth who has bestowed indefatigable labor upon the antiquities of the english border counties the subject is in itself so curious that the length of the note will i hope be pardoned  i have only one record to offer of the appearance of our northumbrian duergar my narratrix is elizabeth cockburn and old wife of offerton in this country whose credit in a case of this kind will not i hope be much impeached when i add that she is by her dull neighbors supposed to be occasionally insane but by herself to be at those times endowed with a faculty of seeing visions and spectral appearances which shun the common ken  in the year before the great rebellion two young men from newcastle were sporting on the high moors above eldson and after pursuing their game several hours sat down to dine in a green glen near one of the mountain streams after their repast the younger lad ran to the brook for water and after stooping to drink was surprised on lifting his head again by the appearance of a brown dwarf who stood on a crag covered with brackens across the burn this extraordinary personage did not appear to be above half the stature of a common man but was uncommonly stout and broadbuilt having the appearance of vast strength his dress was entirely brown the color of the brackens and his head covered with frizzled red hair his countenance was expressive of the most savage ferocity and his eyes glared like a bull it seems he addressed the young man first threatening him with his vengeance for having trespassed on his demesnes and asking him if he knew in whose presence he stood the youth replied that he now supposed him to be the lord of the moors that he offended through ignorance and offered to bring him the game he had killed the dwarf was a little mollified by this submission but remarked that nothing could be more offensive to him than such an offer as he considered the wild animals as his subjects and never failed to avenge their destruction he condescended further to inform him that he was like himself mortal though of years far exceeding the lot of common humanity and what i should not have had an idea of that he hoped for salvation he never he added fed on anything that had life but lived in the summer on whortleberries and in winter on nuts and apples of which he had great store in the woods finally he invited his new acquaintance to accompany him home and partake his hospitality an offer which the youth was on the point of accepting and was just going to spring across the brook which if he had done says elizabeth the dwarf would certainly have torn him in pieces when his foot was arrested by the voice of his companion who thought he had tarried long and on looking round again the wee brown man was fled the story adds that he was imprudent enough to slight the admonition and to sport over the moors on his way homewards but soon after his return he fell into a lingering disorder and died within the year scott   302 our moonlight circles the ms has our fairy ringlets   306 the fairies fatal green as the daoine shi or men of peace wore green habits they were supposed to take offence when any mortals ventured to assume their favorite color indeed from some reason which has been perhaps originally a general superstition green is held in scotland to be unlucky to particular tribes and counties the caithness men who hold this belief allege as a reason that their bands wore that color when they were cut off at the battle of flodden and for the same reason they avoid crossing the ord on a monday being the day of the week on which their illomened array set forth green is also disliked by those of the name of ogilvy but more especially it is held fatal to the whole clan of grahame it is remembered of an aged gentleman of that name that when his horse fell in a foxchase he accounted for it at once by observing that the whipcord attached to his lash was of this unlucky color scott   308 wert christened man scott says the elves were supposed greatly to envy the privileges acquired by christian initiation and they gave to those mortals who had fallen into their power a certain precedence founded upon this advantageous distinction tamlane in the old ballad

better ascertained than the fantastic and illusory nature of their apparent pleasure and splendour it has been already noticed in the former quotations from dr grahames entertaining volume and may be confirmed by the following highland traditiona woman whose newborn child had been conveyed by them into their secret abodes was also carried thither herself to remain however only until she should suckle her infant she one day during this period observed the shiichs busily employed in mixing various ingredients in a boiling caldron and as soon as the composition was prepared she remarked that they all carefully anointed their eyes with it laying the remainder aside for future use in a moment when they were all absent she also attempted to anoint her eyes with the precious drug but had time to apply it to one eye only when the daoine shi returned but with that eye she was henceforth enabled to see everything as it really passed in their secret abodes she saw every object not as she hitherto had done in deceptive splendour and elegance but in its genuine colours and form the gaudy ornaments of the apartment were reduced to the walls of a gloomy cavern soon after having discharged her office she was dismissed to her own home still however she retained the faculty of seeing with her medicated eye everything that was done anywhere in her presence by the deceptive art of the order one day amidst a throng of people she chanced to observe the shiich or man of peace in whose possession she had left her child though to every other eye invisible prompted by maternal affection she inadvertently accosted him and began to inquire after the welfare of her child the man of peace astonished at being thus recognized by one of mortal race demanded how she had been enabled to discover him awed by the terrible frown of his countenance she acknowledged what she had done he spat in her eye and extinguished it for ever  it is very remarkable that this story translated by dr grahame from popular gaelic tradition is to be found in the otia imperialia of gervase of tilbury fn 10 a work of great interest might be compiled upon the original of popular fiction and the transmission of similar tales from age to age and from country to country the mythology of one period would then appear to pass into the romance of the next century and that into the nursery tale of the subsequent ages such an investigation while it went greatly to diminish our ideas of the richness of human invention would also show that these fictions however wild and childish possess such charms for the populace as enable them to penetrate into countries unconnected by manners and language and having no apparent intercourse to afford the means of transmission it would carry me far beyond my bounds to produce instances of fable among nations who never borrowed from each other any thing intrinsically worth learning indeed the wide diffusion of popular factions may be compared to the facility with which straws and feathers are dispersed abroad by the wind while valuable metals cannot be transported without trouble and labour there lives i believe only one gentleman whose unlimited acquaintance with this subject might enable him to do it justicei mean my friend mr francis douce of the british museum whose usual kindness will i hope pardon my mentioning his name while on a subject so closely connected with his extensive and curious researches scott   355 snatched away etc the subjects of fairyland were recruited from the regions of humanity by a sort of crimping system which extended to

effecting the deliverance of a distressed hero than the introduction of a mad woman who without knowing or caring about the wanderer warns him by a song to take care of the ambush that was set for him the maniacs or poetry have indeed had a prescriptive right to be musical since the days of ophelia downwards but it is rather a rash extension of this privilege to make them sing good sense and to make sensible people be guided by them  to this taylor well replied this criticism seems unjust the cruelty of rodericks raids in the lowlands has already been hinted at and the sight of the lowland dress might well stir associations in the poor girls mind which would lead her to look to the knight for help and protection and also to warn him of his danger it is plain from murdochs surprise that her being out of her captors sight is looked on as dangerous from which we may infer that she is not entirely crazed her song is not the only hint that fitzjames follows his suspicions had already twice been excited so that the episode seems natural enough as giving a distinct personal ground for the combat in canto v it serves the poets purpose still further without it we should sympathize too much with the robber chief who thinks that plundering lowland field and fold is naught but retribution true but the sight of this sad fruit of his raids wins us back to the cause of law and order   614 forth at full speed etc the ms reads      forth at full speed the clansman went      but in his race his bow he bent      haltedand back an arrow sent   617 thrilled quivered   627 thine ambushed

confuting the plea of law proposed for the unfortunate earl of strafford it was true we gave laws to hares and deer because they are beasts of chase but it was never accounted either cruelty or foul play to knock foxes or wolves on the head as they can be found because they are beasts of prey in a word the law and humanity were alike the one being more fallacious and the other more barbarous than in any age had been vented in such an authority clarendons history of the rebellion   762 the hardened flesh of mountain deer the scottish highlanders in former times had a concise mode of cooking their venison or rather of dispensing with cooking it which appears greatly to have surprised the french whom chance made acquainted with it the vidame of chartres when a hostage in england during the reign of edward vi was permitted to travel into scotland and penetrated as far as to the remote highlands au fin fond des sauvages after a great huntingparty at which a most wonderful quantity of game was destroyed he saw these scottish savages devour a part of their venison raw without any farther preparation than compressing it between two batons of wood so as to force out the blood and render it extremely hard this they reckoned a great delicacy and when the vidame partook of it his compliance with their taste rendered him extremely popular this curious trait of manners was communicated by mons de montmorency a great friend of the vidame to brantome by whom it is recorded in vies des hommes illustres lxxxix 14 after all it may be doubted whether la chaire nostree for so the french called the venison thus summarily prepared was anything more than a mere rude kind of deer ham scott   772 a mighty augury that of the taghairm   777 not for clan the 1st ed has nor for clan   785

disorderly period of scottish history than that which succeeded the battle of flodden and occupied the minority of james v feuds of ancient standing broke out like old wounds and every quarrel among the independent nobility which occurred daily and almost hourly gave rise to fresh bloodshed there arose said pitscottie great trouble and deadly feuds in many parts of scotland both in the north and west parts the master of forbes in the north slew the laird of meldrum under tryst that is at an agreed and secure meeting likewise the laird of drummelzier slew the lord fleming at the hawking and likewise there was slaughter among many other great lords nor was the matter much mended under the government of the earl of angus for though he caused the king to ride through all scotland under the pretence and color of justice to punish thief and traitor none were found greater than were in their own company and none at that time durst strive with a douglas nor yet a douglass man for if they would they got the worst therefore none durst plainzie of no extortion theft reiff nor slaughter done to them by the douglases or their men in that cause they were not heard so long as the douglas had

practice the lines of gray fragment on the alliance of education and government      an iron race the mountain cliffs maintain      foes to the gentler genius of the plain      for where unwearied sinews must be found      with sidelong plough to quell the flinty ground      to turn the torrents swift descending flood      to tame the savage rushing from the wood      what wonder if to patient

lowlanders for which no apology was necessary the gael great traditional historians never forgot that the lowlands had at some remote period been the property of their celtic forefathers which furnished an ample vindication of all the ravages that they could make on the unfortunate districts which lay within their reach sir james grant of grant is in possession of a letter of apology from cameron of lochiel whose men had committed some depredation upon a farm called moines occupied by one of the grants lochiel assures grant that however the mistake had happened his instructions were

imaginary but borrowed from fact the highlanders with the inconsistency of most nations in the same state were alternately capable of great exertions of generosity and of cruel revenge and perfidy the following story i can only quote from tradition but with such an assurance from those by whom it was communicated as permits me little doubt of its authenticity early in the last century john gunn a

banks being unknown was usually transmitted in specie under the guard of a small escort it chanced that the officer who commanded this little party was unexpectedly obliged to halt about thirty miles from inverness at a miserable inn about nightfall a stranger in the highland dress and of very prepossessing appearance entered the same house separate accommodations being impossible the englishman offered the newlyarrived guest a part of his supper which was accepted with reluctance by the conversation he found his new acquaintance knew well all the passes of the country which induced him eagerly to request his company on the ensuing morning he neither disguised his business and charge nor his apprehensions of that celebrated freebooter john gunn the highlander hesitated a moment and then frankly consented to be his guide forth they set in the morning and in travelling through a solitary and dreary glen the discourse again turned on john gunn would you like to see him said the guide and without waiting an answer to this alarming question he whistled and the english officer with his small party were surrounded by a body of highlanders whose numbers put resistance out of question and who were all well armed stranger resumed the guide i am that very john gunn by whom you feared to be intercepted and not without cause for i came to the inn last night with the express purpose of learning your route that i and my followers might ease you of your charge by the road but i am incapable of betraying the trust you reposed in me and having convinced you that you were in my power i can only dismiss you unplundered and uninjured he then gave the officer directions for his journey and disappeared with his party as suddenly as they had presented themselves   277 flood

scott says the duellists of former times did not always stand upon those punctilios respecting equality of arms which are not judged essential to fair combat it is true that in formal combats in the lists the parties were by the judges of the field put as nearly as possible in the same circumstances but in private duel it was often otherwise in that desperate combat which was fought between quelus a minion of henry iii of france and antraguet with two seconds on each side from which only two persons escaped alive quelus complained that his antagonist had over him the advantage of a poniard which he used in parrying while his left hand which he was forced to employ for the same purpose was cruelly mangled when he charged antraguet with this odds thou hast done wrong answered he to forget thy dagger at home we are here to fight and not to settle punctilios of arms in a similar duel however a young brother of the house of aubayne in angoulesme behaved more generously on the like occasion and at once threw away his dagger when his enemy challenged it as an undue advantage but at this time hardly anything can be conceived more horridly brutal and savage than the mode in which private quarrels were conducted in france those who were most jealous of the point of honor and acquired the title of ruffines did not scruple to take advantage of strength numbers surprise and

brass or iron was a necessary part of a highlanders equipment in charging regular troops they received the thrust of the bayonet in this buckler twisted it aside and used the broadsword against the encumbered soldier in the civil war of 1745 most of the front rank of the clans were thus armed and captain grose military antiquities vol i p 164 informs us that in 1747 the privates of the 42d regiment then in flanders were for the most part permitted to carry targets a person thus armed had a considerable advantage in private fray among verses between swift and sheridan lately published by dr barrett there is an account of such an encounter in which the circumstances and consequently the relative superiority of the combatants are precisely the reverse of those in the text      a

although that of the single rapier seems to have been occasionally practised much earlier see douces illustrations of shakespeare vol ii p 61 rowland yorke however who betrayed the fort of zutphen to the spaniards for which good service he was afterwards poisoned by them is said to have been the first who brought the rapierfight into general use fuller speaking of the swashbucklers or bullies of queen elizabeths time says west smithfield was formerly called ruffians hall where such men usually met casually or otherwise to try masteries with sword or buckler more were frightened than hurt more hurt than killed therewith it being accounted unmanly to strike beneath the knee but since that desperate traitor rowland yorke first introduced thrusting with rapiers sword and buckler are disused in the two angry women of abingdon a comedy printed in 1599 we have a pathetic complaint sword and buckler fight begins to grow out of use i am sorry for it i shall never see good manhood again if it be once gone this poking fight of rapier and dagger will come up then a tall man and a good sword and buckler man will be spitted like a cat or rabbit but the rapier had upon the continent long superseded in private duel the use of sword and shield the masters of the noble science of defence were chiefly italians they made great mystery of their art and mode of instruction never suffered any person to be present but the scholar who was to be taught and even examined closets beds and other places of possible concealment their lessons often gave the most treacherous advantages for the challenged having the right to choose his weapons frequently selected some strange unusual and inconvenient kind of arms the use of which he practised under these instructors and thus killed at his

constant incursions rendered him a very unpleasant neighbor to the republican garrison at inverlochy now fort william the governor of the fort detached a party of three hundred men to lay waste lochiels possessions and cut down his trees by in a sudden and desperate attack made upon them by the chieftain with very inferior numbers they were almost all cut to pieces the skirmish is detailed in a curious memoir of sir ewans life printed in the appendix of pennants scottish tour vol i p 375  in this engagement lochiel himself had several wonderful escapes in the retreat of the english one of the strongest and bravest of the officers retired behind a bush when he observed lochiel pursuing and seeing him unaccompanied with any he leapt out and thought him his prey they met one another with equal fury the combat was long and doubtful the english gentleman had by far the advantage in strength and size but lochiel exceeding him in nimbleness and agility in the end tript the sword out of his hand they closed and wrestled till both fell to the ground in each others arms the english officer got above lochiel and pressed him hard but stretching forth his neck by attempting to disengage himself lochiel who by this time had his hands at liberty with his left hand seized him by the collar and jumping at his extended throat he bit it with his teeth quite through and kept such

solemn play or festival when feats of archery were exhibited and prized distributed to those who excelled in wrestling hurling the bar and the other gymnastic exercises of the period stirling a usual place of royal residence was not likely to be deficient in pomp upon such occasions especially since james v was very partial to them his ready participation in these popular amusements was one cause of his acquiring the title of the king of the commons or rex plebeiorum as lesley has latinized it the usual prize to the best shooter was a silver arrow such a one is preserved at selkirk and at peebles at dumfries a silver gun was substituted and the contention transferred to firearms the ceremony as there performed is the subject of an excellent scottish poem by mr john mayne entitled the siller gun 1808 which surpasses the efforts of fergusson and comes near those of burns  of jamess attachment to archery pitscottie the faithful though rude recorder of the manners of that period has given us evidence  in this year there came an ambassador out of england named lord william howard with a bishop with him with many other gentlemen to the number of threescore horse which were all able men and waled picked men for all kind of games and pastimes shooting louping running wrestling and casting of the stone but they were well sayed essayed or tried ere they past out of scotland and that by their own provocation but ever they tint till at last the queen of scotland the kings mother favoured the englishmen because she was the king of englands sister and therefore she took an enterprise of archery upon the englishmens hands contrary her son the king and any six in scotland that he would wale either gentlemen or yeomen that the englishmen should shoot against them either at pricks revers or buts as the scots pleased  the king hearing this of his mother was content and gart her pawn a hundred crowns and a tun of wine upon the englishmens hands and he incontinent laid down as much for the scottishmen the field and ground was chosen in st andrews and three landed men and three yeomen chosen to shoot against the englishmento wit david wemyss of that ilk david arnot of that ilk and mr john wedderburn vicar of dundee the yeomen john thomson in leith steven taburner with a piper called alexander bailie they shot very near and warred worsted the englishmen of the enterprise

and his band was a favorite frolic at such festivals as we are describing this sporting in which kings did not disdain to be actors was prohibited in scotland upon the reformation by a statute of the 6th parliament of queen mary c 61 a d 1555 which ordered under heavy penalties that na manner of person be chosen robert hude nor little john abbot of unreason queen of may nor otherwise but in 1561 the rascal multitude says john knox were stirred up to make a robin hude whilk enormity was of mony years left and damned by statute and act of paliament yet would they not be forbidden accordingly they raised a very serious tumult and at length made prisoners the magistrates who endeavored to suppress it and would not release them till they extorted a formal promise that no one should be punished for his share of the disturbance it would seem from the complaints of the general assembly of the kirk that these profane festivities were continued down to 1592 book of the universal kirk p 414 bold robin was to say the least equally successful in maintaining his ground against the reformed clergy of england for the simple and evangelical latimer complains of coming to a country church where the people refused to hear him because it was robin hoods day and his mitre and rochet were fain to give way to the village pastime much curious information on this subject may be found in the preliminary dissertation to the late mr ritsons edition of the songs respecting this memorable outlaw the game of robin hood was usually acted in may and he was associated with the morricedancers on whom so much illustration has been bestowed by the commentators on shakespeare a very lively picture of these festivities containing a great deal of curious information on the subject of the private

of angus but the kings behavior during an unexpected interview with the laird of kilspindie one of the banished douglases under circumstances similar to those in the text is imitated from a real story told by hume of godscroft i would have availed myself more fully of the simple and affecting circumstances of the old history had they not been already woven into a pathetic ballad by my friend mr finlay 11  his the kings implacability towards the family of douglas did also appear in his carriage towards archibald of kilspinke whom he when he was a child loved singularly well for his ability of body and was wont to call him his graysteill  12 archibald being banished into england could not well comport with the humor of that nation which he thought to be too proud and that they had too high a conceit of themselves joined with a contempt and despising of all others wherefore being wearied of that life and remembering the kings favor of old towards him he determined to try the kings mercifulness and clemency so he comes into scotland and taking occasion of the kings hunting in the park at stirling he casts himself to be in his way as he was coming home to the castle so soon as the king saw him afar off ere he came near he guessed it was he and said to one of his courtiers yonder is my graysteill archibald of kilspindie if he be alive the other answered that it could not be he and that he durst not come into the kings presence the king approaching he fell upon his knees and craved pardon and promised from thenceforward to abstain from meddling in public affairs and to lead a quiet and private life the king went by without giving him any answer and trotted a good round pace up the hill kilspindie followed and though he wore on him a secret or shirt of mail for his particular enemies was as soon at the castle gate as the king there he sat him down upon a stone without and entreated some of the kings servants for a cup of drink being weary and thirsty but they fearing the kings displeasure durst gave him none when the king was set at his dinner he asked what he had done what he had said and whither he had gone it was told him that he had desired a cup of drink and had gotten none the king reproved them very sharply for their discourtesy and told them that if he had not taken an oath that no douglas should ever serve him he would have received him into his service for he had seen him sometime a man of great ability then he sent him word to go to leith and expect his further pleasure then some kinsman of david falconer the cannonier that was slain at tantallon began to quarrel with archibald about the matter wherewith the king showed himself not well pleased when he heard of it then he commanded him to go to france for a certain space till he heard further from him and so he did and died shortly after this gave occasion to the king of england henry viii to blame his nephew alleging the old saying that a kings face should give grace for this archibald whatsoever were anguss or sir georges fault had not been principal actor of anything nor no counsellor nor stirrer up but only a follower of his friends and that noways cruelly disposed

laird is said to have evinced this strong mark of partiality it is popularly told of a famous freebooter that he composed the tune known by the name of macphersons rant while under sentence of death and played it at the gallowstree some spirited words have been adapted to it by burns a similar story is recounted of a welsh bard who composed and played on his deathbed the air called dafyddy

the following note here  a skirmish actually took place at a pass thus called in the trosachs and closed with the remarkable incident mentioned in the text it was greatly posterior in date to the reign of james v  in this roughlywooded island  13 the country people secreted their wives and children and their most valuable effects from the rapacity of cromwells soldiers during their inroad into this country in the time of the republic these invaders not venturing to ascend by the ladders along the lake took a more circuitous road through the heart of the trosachs the most frequented path at that time which penetrates the wilderness about half way between binean and the lake by a tract called yeachilleach or the old wifes bog  in one of the defiles of this byroad the men of the country at that time hung upon the rear of the invading enemy and shot one of cromwells men whose grave marks the scene of action and gives name to that pass  14 in revenge of this insult the soldiers resolved to plunder the island to violate the women and put the children to death with this brutal intention one of the party more expert than the rest swam towards the island to fetch the boat to his comrades which had carried the women to their asylum and lay moored in one of the creeks his companions stood on the shore of the mainland in full view of all that was to pass waiting anxiously for his return with the boat but just as the swimmer had got to the nearest point of the island and was laying hold of a black rock to get on shore a heroine who stood on the very point where he meant to land hastily snatching a dagger from below her apron with one stroke severed his head from the body his party seeing this disaster and relinquishing all future hope of revenge or conquest made the best of

of the beautiful arabian tale of il bondocani yet the incident is not borrowed from that elegant story but from scottish tradition james v of whom we are treating was a monarch whose good and benevolent intentions often rendered his romantic freaks venial if not respectable since from his anxious attention to the interests of the lower and most oppressed class of his subjects he was as we have seen popularly termed the king of the commons for the purpose of seeing that justice was regularly administered and frequently from the less justifiable motive of gallantry he used to traverse the vicinage of his several palaces in various disguises the two excellent comic songs entitled the gaberlunzie man and well gae nae mair a roving are said to have been founded upon the success of his amorous adventures when travelling in the disguise of a beggar the latter is perhaps the best comic ballad in any language  another adventure which had nearly cost james his life is said to have taken place at the village of cramond near edinburgh where he had rendered his addresses acceptable to a pretty girl of the lower rank four or five persons whether relations or lovers of his mistress is uncertain beset the disguised monarch as he returned from his rendezvous naturally gallant and an admirable master of his weapon the king took post on the high and narrow bridge over the almond river and defended himself bravely with his sword a peasant who was thrashing in a neighboring barn came out upon the noise and whether moved by compassion or by natural gallantry took the weaker side and laid about with his flail so effectually as to disperse the assailants well thrashed even according to the letter he then conducted the king into his barn where his guest requested a basin and a towel to remove the stains of the broil this being procured with difficulty james employed himself in learning what was the summit of the deliverers earthly wishes and found that they were bounded by the desire of possessing in property the farm of braehead upon which he labored as a bondsman the lands chanced to belong to the crown and james directed him to come to the palace of holyrood and inquire for the guidman that is farmer of ballenguich a name by which he was known in his excursions and which answered to the il bondocani of haroun alraschid he presented himself accordingly and found with due astonishment that he had saved his monarchs life and that he was to be gratified with a crown charter of the lands of braehead under the service of presenting a ewer basin and towel for the king to wash his hands when he shall happen to pass the bridge of cramond this person was ancestor of the howisons of braehead in midlothian a respectable family who continue to hold the lands now passed into the female line under the same tenure  15  another of jamess frolics is thus narrated by mr campbell from the statistical account being once benighted when out ahunting and separated from his attendants he happened to enter a cottage in the midst of a moor at the foot of the ochil hills near alloa where unknown he was kindly received in order to regale their unexpected guest the gudeman desired the gudewife to fetch the hen that roosted nearest the cock which is always the plumpest for the strangers supper the king highly pleased with his nights lodging and hospitable entertainment told mine host at parting that he should be glad to return his civility and requested that the first time he came to stirling he would call at the castle and inquire for the gudeman of ballenguich donaldson the landlord did not fail to call on the gudeman of ballenguich when his astonishment at finding that the king had been his guest afforded no small amusement to the merry monarch and his courtiers and to carry on the pleasantry he was thenceforth designated by james with the title of king of the moors which name and designation have descended from father to son ever since and they have continued in possession of the identical spot the property of mr erskine of mar till very lately when this gentleman with reluctance turned out the descendant and representative of the king of the moors on account of his majestys invincible indolence and great dislike to reform or innovation of any kind although from the spirited example of his neighbor tenants on the same estate he is convinced similar exertion would promote his advantage  the author requests permission yet farther to verify the subject of his poem by an extract from the genealogical work of buchanan of auchmar upon scottish surnames essay upon the family of buchanan p 74  this john buchanan of auchmar and arnpryor was afterwards termed king of kippen a small district of perthshire upon the following account king james v a very sociable debonair prince residing at stirling in buchanan of arnpryors time carriers were very frequently passing along the common road being near arnpryors house with necessaries for the use of the kings family and he having some extraordinary occasion ordered one of these carriers to leave his load at his house and he would pay him for it which the carrier refused to do telling him he was the kings carrier and his load for his majestys use to which arnpryor seemed to have small regard compelling the carrier in the end to leave his load telling him if king james was king of scotland he was king of kippen so that it was reasonable he should share with his neighbor king in some of these loads so frequently carried that road the carrier representing these usage and telling the story as arnpryor spoke it to some of the kings servants it came at length to his majestys ears who shortly thereafter with a few attendants came to visit his neighbor king who was in the meantime at dinner king james having sent a servant to demand access was denied the same by a tall fellow with a battleaxe who stood porter at the gate telling there could be no access till dinner was over this answer not satisfying the king he sent to demand access a second time upon which he was desired by the porter to desist otherwise he would find cause to repent his rudeness his majesty finding this method would not do desired the porter to tell his master that the goodman of ballangeigh desired to speak with the king of kippen the porter telling arnpryor so much he in all humble manner came and received the king and having entertained him with much sumptuousness and jollity became so agreeable to king james that he allowed him to take so much of any provision he found carrying that road as he had occasion for and seeing he made the first visit desired arnpryor in a few days to return him a second to stirling which he performed and continued in very much favor with the king always thereafter being termed king of kippen while he lived  the readers of ariosto must give credit for the amiable features with which james is represented since he is generally considered as the prototype of zerbino the most interesting hero of the orlando furioso   743 glided from her stay the ms has shrinking quits her stay  ruskin asks us to note the northern love of rocks in this

may june and july would i dwell in thee were i a man to hear the birdis sound whilk doth agane thy royal rock rebound   mr chalmers in his late excellent edition of sir david lindsays works has refuted the chimerical derivation of snawdoun from snedding or cutting it was probably derived from the romantic legend which connected stirling with king arthur to which the mention of the round table gives countenance the ring within which justs were formerly practised in the castle park is still called the round table snawdoun is the official title of one of the scottish heralds whose epithets seem in all countries to have been fantastically adopted from ancient history or romance  it appears from the preceding note that the real name by which james was actually distinguished in his private excursions was the goodman of ballenguich derived from a steep pass leading up to the castle of stirling so called but the epithet would not have suited poetry and would besides at once

assigned him considering the favor in which he is held both by ellen and the author and in bringing out the shaded and imperfect character of roderick dhu as a contrast to the purer virtue of his rival mr scott seems to have fallen into the common error of making him more interesting than him whose virtues he was intended to set off and converted the villain of the piece in some measure into its hero a modern poet however may perhaps be pardoned for an error of which milton himself is thought not to have kept clear and for which there seems so natural a cause in the difference between poetical and amiable characters   837 warder guard jailer   841 lockhart quotes here the following extract from a letter of byrons to scott dated july 6 1812  and now waiving myself let me talk to you of the prince regent he ordered me to be presented to him at a ball and after some saying peculiarly pleasing from royal lips as to my own attempts he talked to me of you and your immoralities he preferred you to every bard past and present and asked which of your works pleased me most it was a difficult question i answered i thought the lay he said his own opinion was nearly similar in speaking of the others i told him that i thought you more particularly the poet of princes as they never appeared more fascinating than in marmion and the lady of the lake he was pleased to coincide
