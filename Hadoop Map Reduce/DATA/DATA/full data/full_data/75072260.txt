a message came to me from wilkie collins then though we hoped otherwise on his deathbed  it was conveyed to me by mr a p watt he told me that his son had just come from wilkie collins that they had been speaking of his novel blind love then running in the illustrated london news that the novel was unfortunately unfinished that he himself could not possibly finish it and that he would be very glad if i would finish it if i could find the time and that if i could undertake this work he would send me his notes of the remainder wilkie collins added these words if he has the time i think he will do it we are both old hands at this work and understand it and he knows that i would do the same for him if he were in my place  under the circumstances of the case it was impossible to decline this request i wrote to say that time should be made and the notes were forwarded to me at robin hoods bay i began by reading carefully and twice over so as to get a grip of the story and the novelists intention the part that had already appeared and the proofs so far as the author had gone i then turned to the notes i found that these were not merely notes such as i expectedsimple indications of the plot and the development of events but an actual detailed scenario in which every incident however trivial was carefully laid down there were also fragments of dialogue inserted at those places where dialogue was wanted to emphasise the situation and make it real i was much struck with the writers perception of the vast importance of dialogue in making the reader seize the scene description requires attention dialogue rivets attention  it is not an easy task nor is it pleasant to carry on another mans work but the possession of this scenario lightened the work enormously i have been careful to adhere faithfully and exactly to the plot scene by scene down to the smallest detail as it was laid down by the author in this book i have altered nothing i have preserved and incorporated every fragment of dialogue i have used the very language wherever that was written so carefully as to show that it was meant to be used i think that there is only one trivial detail where i had to choose because it was not clear from the notes what the author had intended the plot of the novel every scene every situation from beginning to end is the work of wilkie collins the actual writing is entirely his up to a certain point from that point to the end it is partly his but mainly mine where his writing ends and mine begins i need not point out the practised critic will no doubt at once lay his finger on the spot  i have therefore carried out the authors wishes to the best of my ability i would that he were living still if only to regret that he had not been allowed to finish his last work with his own hand  walter besant    blind love   the prologue  i  soon after sunrise on a cloudy morning in the year 1881 a special messenger disturbed the repose of dennis howmore at his place of residence in the pleasant irish town of ardoon  well acquainted apparently with the way upstairs the man thumped on a bedroom door and shouted his message through it the master wants you and mind you dont keep him waiting  the person sending this peremptory message was sir giles mountjoy of ardoon knight and banker the person receiving the message was sir giless head clerk as a matter of course dennis howmore dressed himself at full speed and hastened to his employers private house on the outskirts of the town  he found sir giles in an irritable and anxious state of mind a letter lay open on the bankers bed his nightcap was crumpled crookedly on his head he was in too great a hurry to remember the claims of politeness when the clerk said good morning  dennis i have got something for you to do it must be kept a secret and it allows of no delay  is it anything connected with business sir  the banker lost his temper how can you be such an infernal fool as to suppose that anything connected with business could happen at this time in the morning do you know the first milestone on the road to garvan  yes sir  very well go to the milestone and take care that nobody sees you when you get there look at the back of the stone if you discover an object which appears to have been left in that situation on the ground bring it to me and dont forget that the most impatient man in all ireland is waiting for you  not a word of explanation followed these extraordinary instructions  the head clerk set forth on his errand with his mind dwelling on the national tendencies to conspiracy and assassination his employer was not a popular person sir giles had paid rent when he owed it and worse still was disposed to remember in a friendly spirit what england had done for ireland in the course of the last fifty years if anything appeared to justify distrust of the mysterious object of which he was in search dennis resolved to be vigilantly on the lookout for a gunbarrel whenever he passed a hedge on his return journey to the town  arrived at the milestone he discovered on the ground behind it one object onlya fragment of a broken teacup  naturally enough dennis hesitated it seemed to be impossible that the earnest and careful instructions which he had received could relate to such a trifle as this at the same time he was acting under orders which were as positive as tone manner and language could make them passive obedience appeared to be the one safe course to takeat the risk of a reception irritating to any mans selfrespect when he returned to his employer with a broken teacup in his hand  the event entirely failed to justify his misgivings there could be no doubt that sir giles attached serious importance to the contemptible discovery made at the milestone after having examined and reexamined the fragment he announced his intention of sending the clerk on a second errandstill without troubling himself to explain what his incomprehensible instructions meant  if i am not mistaken he began the reading rooms in our town open as early as nine very well go to the rooms this morning on the stroke of the clock he stopped and consulted the letter which lay open on his bed ask the librarian he continued for the third volume of gibbons decline and fall of the roman empire open the book at pages seventyeight and seventynine if you find a piece of paper between those two leaves take possession of it when nobody is looking at you and bring it to me thats all dennis and bear in mind that i shall not recover the use of my patience till i see you again  on ordinary occasions the head clerk was not a man accustomed to insist on what was due to his dignity at the same time he was a sensible human being conscious of the consideration to which his responsible place in the office entitled him sir giless irritating reserve not even excused by a word of apology reached the limits of his endurance he respectfully protested  i regret to find sir he said that i have lost my place in my employers estimation the man to whom you confide the superintendence of your clerks and the transaction of your business has i venture to think some claim under the present circumstances to be trusted  the banker was now offended on his side  i readily admit your claim he answered when you are sitting at your desk in my office but even in these days of strikes cooperations and bank holidays an employer has one privilege lefthe has not ceased to be a man and he has not forfeited a mans right to keep his own secrets i fail to see anything in my conduct which has given you just reason to complain  dennis rebuked made his bow in silence and withdrew  did these acts of humility mean that he submitted they meant exactly the contrary he had made up his mind that sir giles mountjoys motives should sooner or later cease to be mysteries to sir giles mountjoys clerk   ii  carefully following his instructions he consulted the third volume of gibbons great history and found between the seventyeighth and seventyninth pages something remarkable this time  it was a sheet of delicatelymade paper pierced with a number of little holes infinitely varied in size and cut with the smoothest precision having secured this curious object while the librarians back was turned dennis howmore reflected  a page of paper unintelligibly perforated for some purpose unknown was in itself a suspicious thing and what did suspicion suggest to the inquiring mind in southwestern ireland before the suppression of the land league unquestionablypolice  on the way back to his employer the bankers clerk paid a visit to an old frienda journalist by profession and a man of varied learning and experience as well invited to inspect the remarkable morsel of paper and to discover the object with which the perforations had been made the authority consulted proved to be worthy of the trust reposed in him dennis left the newspaper office an enlightened manwith information at the disposal of sir giles and with a sense of relief which expressed itself irreverently in these words now i have got him  the bewildered banker looked backwards and forwards from the paper to the clerk and from the clerk to the paper i dont understand it he said do you  still preserving the appearance of humility dennis asked leave to venture on a guess the perforated paper looked as he thought like a puzzle if we wait for a day or two he suggested the key to it may possibly reach us  on the next day nothing happened on the day after a second letter made another audacious demand on the fast failing patience of sir giles mountjoy  even the envelope proved to be a puzzle on this occasion the postmark was ardoon in other words the writer had used the postman as a messenger while he or his accomplice was actually in the town posting the letter within halfaminutes walk of the bank the contents presented an impenetrable mystery the writing looked worthy of a madman sentences appeared in the wildest state of confusion and words were so mutilated as to be unintelligible this time the force of circumstances was more than sir giles could resist he took the clerk into his confidence at last  let us begin at the beginning he said there is the letter you saw on my bed when i first sent for you i found it waiting on my table when i woke and i dont know who put it there read it  dennis read as follows  sir giles mountjoyi have a disclosure to make in which one of the members of your family is seriously interested before i can venture to explain myself i must be assured that i can trust to your good faith as a test of this i require you to fulfil the two conditions that followand to do it without the slightest loss of time i dare not trust you yet with my address or my signature any act of carelessness on my part might end fatally for the true friend who writes these lines if you neglect this warning you will regret it to the end of your life  to the conditions on which the letter insisted there is no need to allude they had been complied with when the discoveries were made at the back of the milestone and between the pages of gibsons history sir giles had already arrived at the conclusion that a conspiracy was in progress to assassinate him and perhaps to rob the bank the wiser head clerk pointed to the perforated paper and the incomprehensible writing received that morning if we can find out what these mean he said you may be better able sir to form a correct opinion  and who is to do that the banker asked  i can but try sir was the modest reply if you see no objection to my making the attempt  sir giles approved of the proposed experiment silently and satirically by a bend of his head  too discreet a man to make a suspiciously ready use of the information which he had privately obtained dennis took care that his first attempt should not be successful after modestly asking permission to try again he ventured on the second occasion to arrive at a happy discovery lifting the perforated paper he placed it delicately over the page which contained the unintelligible writing words and sentences now appeared through the holes in the paper in their right spelling and arrangement and addressed sir giles in these terms  i beg to thank you sir for complying with my conditions you have satisfied me of your good faith at the same time it is possible that you may hesitate to trust a man who is not yet able to admit you to his confidence the perilous position in which i stand obliges me to ask for two or three days more of delay before i can safely make an appointment with you pray be patientand on no account apply for advice or protection to the police  those last words sir giles declared are conclusive the sooner i am under the care of the law the better take my card to the policeoffice  may i say a word first sir  do you mean that you dont agree with me  i mean that  you were always an obstinate man dennis and it grows on you as you get older never mind lets have it out who do you say is the person pointed at in these rascally letters  the head clerk took up the first letter of the two and pointed to the opening sentence sir giles mountjoy i have a disclosure to make in which one of the members of your family is seriously interested dennis emphatically repeated the words one of the members of your family his employer regarded him with a broad stare of astonishment  one of the members of my family sir giles repeated on his side why man alive what are you thinking of im an old bachelor and i havent got a family  there is your brother sir  my brother is in franceout of the way of the wretches who are threatening me i wish i was with him  there are your brothers two sons sir giles  well and what is there to be afraid of my nephew hugh is in londonand mind not on a political errand i hope before long to hear that he is going to be marriedif the strangest and nicest girl in england will have him whats wrong now  dennis explained i only wished to say sir that i was thinking of your other nephew  sir giles laughed arthur in danger he exclaimed as harmless a young man as ever lived the worst one can say of him is that he is throwing away his moneyfarming in kerry  excuse me sir giles theres not much chance of his throwing away his money where he is now nobody will venture to take his money i met with one of mr arthurs neighbours at the market yesterday your nephew is boycotted  so much the better the obstinate banker declared he will be cured of his craze for farming and he will come back to the place i am keeping for him in the office  god grant it the clerk said fervently  for the moment sir giles was staggered have you heard something that you havent told me yet he asked  no sir i am only bearing in mind something whichwith all respecti think you have forgotten the last tenant on that bit of land in kerry refused to pay his rent mr arthur has taken what they call an evicted farm its my firm belief said the head clerk rising and speaking earnestly that the person who has addressed those letters to you knows mr arthur and knows he is in dangerand is trying to save your nephew by means of your influence at the risk of his own life  sir giles shook his head i call that a farfetched interpretation dennis if what you say is true why didnt the writer of those anonymous letters address himself to arthur instead of to me  i gave it as my opinion just now sir that the writer of the letter knew mr arthur  so you did and what of that  dennis stood to his guns  anybody who is acquainted with mr arthur he persisted knows that with all sorts of good qualities the young gentleman is headstrong and rash if a friend told him he was in danger on the farm that would be enough of itself to make him stop where he is and brave it out whereas you sir are known to be cautious and careful and farseeing and discreet he might have added and cowardly and obstinate and narrowminded and inflated by stupid selfesteem but respect for his employer had blindfolded the clerks observation for many a long year past if one man may be born with the heart of a lion another man may be born with the mind of a mule denniss master was one of the other men  very well put sir giles answered indulgently time will show if such an entirely unimportant person as my nephew arthur is likely to be assassinated that allusion to one of the members of my family is a mere equivocation designed to throw me off my guard rank money social influence unswerving principles mark me out as a public character go to the policeoffice and let the best man who happens to be off duty come here directly  good dennis howmore approached the door very unwillingly it was opened from the outer side before he had reached that end of the room one of the bank porters announced a visitor  miss henley wishes to know sir if you can see her  sir giles looked agreeably surprised he rose with alacrity to receive the lady   iii  when iris henley dies there will in all probability be friends left who remember her and talk of herand there may be strangers present at the time women for the most part whose curiosity will put questions relating to her personal appearance no replies will reward them with trustworthy information miss henleys chief claim to admiration lay in a remarkable mobility of expression which reflected every change of feeling peculiar to the nature of a sweet and sensitive woman for this reason probably no descriptions of her will agree with each other no existing likenesses will represent her the one portrait that was painted of iris is only recognisable by partial friends of the artist in and out of london photographic likenesses were taken of her they have the honour of resembling the portraits of shakespeare in this respectcompared with one another it is not possible to discover that they present the same person as for the evidence offered by the loving memory of her friends it is sure to be contradictory in the last degree she had a charming face a commonplace face an intelligent facea poor complexion a delicate complexion no complexion at alleyes that were expressive of a hot temper of a bright intellect of a firm character of an affectionate disposition of a truthful nature of hysterical sensibility of inveterate obstinacya figure too short no just the right height no neither one thing nor the other elegant if you likedress shabby oh surely not dress quiet and simple no something more than that ostentatiously quiet theatrically simple worn with the object of looking unlike other people in one last word was this mass of contradictions generally popular in the time when it was a living creature yesamong the men nonot invariably the man of all others who ought to have been fondest of her was the man who behaved cruelly to irisher own father and when the poor creature married if she did marry how many of you attended the wedding not one of us and when she died how many of you were sorry for her all of us what no difference of opinion in that one particular on the contrary perfect concord thank god  let the years roll back and let iris speak for herself at the memorable time when she was in the prime of her life and when a stormy career was before her   iv  being miss henleys godfather sir giles was a privileged person he laid his hairy hands on her shoulders and kissed her on either cheek after that prefatory act of endearment he made his inquiries what extraordinary combination of events had led iris to leave london and had brought her to visit him in his bankinghouse at ardoon  i wanted to get away from home she answered and having nobody to go to but my godfather i thought i should like to see you  alone cried sir giles  nowith my maid to keep me company  only your maid iris surely you have acquaintances among young ladies like yourself  acquaintancesyes no friends  does your father approve of what you have done  will you grant me a favour godpapa  yesif i can  dont insist on my answering your last question  the faint colour that had risen in her face when she entered the room left it at the same time the expression of her mouth altered the lips closed firmly revealing that strongest of all resolutions which is founded on a keen sense of wrong she looked older than her age what she might be ten years hence she was now sir giles understood her he got up and took a turn in the room an old habit of which he had cured himself with infinite difficulty when he was made a knight showed itself again he put his hands in his pockets  you and your father have had another quarrel he said stopping opposite iris  i dont deny it she replied  who is to blame  she smiled bitterly the woman is always to blame  did your father tell you that  my father reminded me that i was twentyone years old last birthdayand told me that i could do as i liked i understood him and i left the house  you will go back again i suppose  i dont know  sir giles began pacing the room once more his rugged face telling its story of disaster and struggle in early life showed signs of disappointment and distress  hugh promised to write to me he said and he has not written i know what that means i know what you have done to offend your father my nephew has asked you to marry him for the second time and for the second time you have refused  her face softened its better and younger aspect revived yes she said sadly and submissively i have refused him again  sir giles lost his temper what the devil is your objection to hugh he burst out  my father said the same thing to me she replied almost in the same words i made him angry when i tried to give my reason i dont want to make you angry too  he took no notice of this isnt hugh a good fellow he went on isnt he affectionate and kindhearted and honourableaye and a handsome man too if you come to that  hugh is all that you say i like him i admire him i owe to his kindness some of the happiest days of my sad life and i am gratefuloh with all my heart i am grateful to hugh  if thats true iris  every word of it is true  i say if thats truetheres no excuse for you i hate perversity in a young woman why dont you marry him  try to feel for me she said gently i cant love him  her tone said more to the banker than her words had expressed the secret sorrow of her life which was known to her father was known also to sir giles  now we have come to it at last he said you cant love my nephew hugh and you wont tell me the reason why because your sweet temper shrinks from making me angry shall i mention the reason for you my dear i can do it in two wordslord harry  she made no reply she showed no sign of feeling at what he had just said her head sank a little her hands clasped themselves on her lap the obstinate resignation which can submit to anything hardened her face stiffened her figureand that was all  the banker was determined not to spare her  its easy to see he resumed that you have not got over your infatuation for that vagabond yet go where he may into the vilest places and among the lowest people he carries your heart along with him i wonder you are not ashamed of such an attachment as that  he had stung her at last she roused herself and answered him  harry has led a wild life she said he has committed serious faults and he may live to do worse than he has done yet to what degradation bad company and a bad bringingup may yet lead him i leave his enemies to foresee but i tell you this he has redeeming qualities which you and people like you are not good christians enough to discover he has friends who can still appreciate himyour nephew arthur mountjoy is one of them oh i know it by arthurs letters to me blame lord harry as you may i tell you he has the capacity for repentance in him and one daywhen it is too late i dare sayhe will show it i can never be his wife we are parted never in all likelihood to meet again well he is the only man whom i have ever loved and he is the only man whom i ever shall love if you think this state of mind proves that i am as bad as he is i wont contradict you do we any of us know how bad we are have you heard of harry lately  the sudden transition from an earnest and devoted defence of the man to an easy and familiar inquiry about him startled sir giles  for the moment he had nothing to say iris had made him think she had shown a capacity for mastering her strongest feelings at the moment when they threatened to overcome her which is very rarely found in a young woman how to manage her was a problem for patient resolution to solve the bankers obstinacy rather than his conviction had encouraged him to hold to the hope of hughs marriage even after his nephew had been refused for the second time his headstrong goddaughter had come to visit him of her own accord she had not forgotten the days of her childhood when he had some influence over herwhen she had found him kinder to her than her father had ever been sir giles saw that he had taken the wrong tone with iris his anger had not alarmed her his opinion had not influenced her in hughs interests he determined to try what consideration and indulgence would do towards cultivating the growth of her regard for him finding that she had left her maid and her luggage at the hotel he hospitably insisted on their removal to his own house  while you are in ardoon iris you are my guest he said  she pleased him by readily accepting the invitationand then annoyed him by asking again if he had heard anything of lord harry  he answered shortly and sharply i have heard nothing what is your last news of him  news she said which i sincerely hope is not true an irish paper has been sent to me which reports that he has joined the secret societynothing better than a society of assassins i am afraidwhich is known by the name of the invincibles  as she mentioned that formidable brotherhood dennis howmore returned from the policeoffice he announced that a sergeant was then waiting to receive instructions from sir giles   v  iris rose to go her godfather courteously stopped her  wait here he said until i have spoken to the sergeant and i will escort you to my house my clerk will do what is necessary at the hotel you dont look quite satisfied is the arrangement that i have proposed not agreeable to you  iris assured him that she gratefully acceded to the arrangement at the same time she confessed to having been a little startled on discovering that he was in consultation with the police i remember that we are in ireland she explained and i am foolish enough to fear that you may be in some danger may i hope that it is only a trifle  only a trifle among ether deficient sensibilities in the strange nature of iris sir giles had observed an imperfect appreciation of the dignity of his social position here was a new proof of it the temptation to inspire sentiments of alarmnot unmingled with admirationin the mind of his insensible goddaughter by exhibiting himself as a public character threatened by a conspiracy was more than the bankers vanity could resist before he left the room he instructed dennis to tell miss henley what had happened and to let her judge for herself whether he had been needlessly alarmed by what she was pleased to call a mere trifle  dennis howmore must have been more than mortal if he could have related his narrative of events without being influenced by his own point of view on the first occasion when he mentioned arthur mountjoys name iris showed a sudden interest in his strange story which took him by surprise  you know mr arthur he said  knew him iris repeated he was my playfellow when we were both children he is as dear to me as if he was my brother tell me at onceis he really in danger  dennis honestly repeated what he had already said on that subject to his master miss henley entirely agreeing with him was eager to warn arthur of his position there was no telegraphic communication with the village which was near his farm she could only write to him and she did write to him by that days posthaving reasons of her own for anxiety which forbade her to show her letter to dennis well aware of the devoted friendship which united lord harry and arthur mountjoyand bearing in mind the newspaper report of the irish lords rash association with the invinciblesher fears now identified the noble vagabond as the writer of the anonymous letters which had so seriously excited her godfathers doubts of his own safety  when sir giles returned and took her with him to his house he spoke of his consultation with the sergeant in terms which increased her dread of what might happen in the future she was a dull and silent guest during the interval that elapsed before it would be possible to receive arthurs reply the day arrivedand the post brought no relief to her anxieties the next day passed without a letter on the morning of the fourth day sir giles rose later than usual his correspondence was sent to him from the office at breakfasttime after opening one of the letters he dispatched a messenger in hot haste to the police  look at that he said handing the letter to iris does the assassin take me for a fool  she read the lines that follow  unforeseen events force me sir giles to run a serious risk i must speak to you and it must not be by daylight my one hope of safety is in darkness meet me at the first milestone on the road to garvan when the moon sets at ten oclock tonight no need to mention your name the password is fidelity  do you mean to go iris asked  do i mean to be murdered sir giles broke out my dear child do pray try to think before you speak the sergeant will represent me of course  and take the man prisoner iris added  certainly  with that startling reply the banker hurried away to receive the police in another room iris dropped into the nearest chair the turn that the affair had now taken filled her with unutterable dismay  sir giles came back after no very long absence composed and smiling the course of proceeding had been settled to his complete satisfaction  dressed in private clothes the sergeant was to go to the milestone at the appointed time representing the banker in the darkness and giving the password he was to be followed by two of his men who would wait in concealment within hearing of his whistle if their services were required i want to see the ruffian when he is safely handcuffed sir giles explained and i have arranged to wait for the police tonight at my office  there was but one desperate way that iris could now discern of saving the man who had confided in her godfathers honour and whose trust had already been betrayed never had she loved the outlawed irish lordthe man whom she was forbidden and rightly forbidden to marryas she loved him at that moment let the risk be what it might this resolute woman had determined that the sergeant should not be the only person who arrived at the milestone and gave the password there was one devoted friend to lord harry whom she could always trustand that friend was herself  sir giles withdrew to look after his business at the bank she waited until the clock had struck the servants dinner hour and then ascended the stairs to her godfathers dressingroom opening his wardrobe she discovered in one part of it a large spanish cloak and in another part a highcrowned felt hat which he wore on his country excursions in the dark here was disguise enough for her purpose  as she left the dressingroom a measure of precaution occurred to her which she put in action at once telling her maid that she had some purchases to make in the town she went out and asked her way to garvan of the first respectable stranger whom she met in the street her object was to walk as far as the first milestone in daylight so as to be sure of finding it again by night she had made herself familiar with the different objects on the road when she returned to the bankers house  as the time for the arrest drew nearer sir giles became too restless to wait patiently at home he went away to the policeoffice eager to hear if any new counterconspiracy had occurred to the authorities  it was dark soon after eight oclock at that time of the year at nine the servants assembled at the suppertable they were all downstairs together talking and waiting for their meal  feeling the necessity of arriving at the place of meeting in time to keep out of the sergeants way iris assumed her disguise as the clock struck nine she left the house without a living creature to notice her indoors or out clouds were gathering over the sky the waning moon was only to be seen at intervals as she set forth on her way to the milestone   vi  the wind rose a little and the rifts in the clouds began to grow broader as iris gained the high road  for a while the glimmer of the misty moonlight lit the way before her as well as she could guess she had passed over more than half of the distance between the town and the milestone before the sky darkened again objects by the wayside grew shadowy and dim a few drops of rain began to fall the milestone as she knewthanks to the discovery of it made by daylightwas on the righthand side of the road but the dullgrey colour of the stone was not easy to see in the dark  a doubt troubled her whether she might not have passed the milestone she stopped and looked at the sky  the threatening of rain had passed away signs showed themselves which seemed to promise another break in the clouds she waited low and faint the sinking moonlight looked its last at the dull earth in front of her there was nothing to be seen but the road she looked backand discovered the milestone  a rough stone wall protected the land on either side of the road nearly behind the milestone there was a gap in this fence partially closed by a hurdle a halfruined culvert arching a ditch that had run dry formed a bridge leading from the road to the field had the field been already chosen as a place of concealment by the police nothing was to be seen but a footpath and the dusky line of a plantation beyond it as she made these discoveries the rain began to fall again the clouds gathered once more the moonlight vanished  at the same moment an obstacle presented itself to her mind which iris had thus far failed to foresee  lord harry might approach the milestone by three different ways that is to sayby the road from the town or by the road from the open country or by way of the field and the culvert how could she so place herself as to be sure of warning him before he fell into the hands of the police to watch the three means of approach in the obscurity of the night and at one and the same time was impossible  a man in this position guided by reason would in all probability have wasted precious time in trying to arrive at the right decision a woman aided by love conquered the difficulty that confronted her in a moment  iris decided on returning to the milestone and on waiting there to be discovered and taken prisoner by the police supposing lord harry to be punctual to his appointment he would hear voices and movements as a necessary consequence of the arrest in time to make his escape supposing him on the other hand to be late the police would be on the way back to the town with their prisoner he would find no one at the milestone and would leave it again in safety  she was on the point of turning to get back to the road when something on the dark surface of the field which looked like a darker shadow became dimly visible in another moment it seemed to be a shadow that moved she ran towards it it looked like a man as she drew nearer the man stopped  the password he said in tones cautiously lowered  fidelity she answered in a whisper  it was too dark for a recognition of his features but iris knew him by his tall statureknew him by the accent in which he had asked for the password erroneously judging of her on his side as a man he drew back again sir giles mountjoy was above the middle height the stranger in a cloak who had whispered to him was below it you are not the person i expected to meet he said who are you  her faithful heart was longing to tell him the truth the temptation to reveal herself and to make the sweet confession of her happiness at having saved him would have overpowered her discretion but for a sound that was audible on the road behind them in the deep silence of the time and place mistake was impossible it was the sound of footsteps  there was just time to whisper to him sir giles has betrayed you save yourself  thank you whoever you are  with that reply he suddenly and swiftly disappeared iris remembered the culvert and turned towards it there was a hidingplace under the arch if she could only get down into the dry ditch in time she was feeling her way to the slope of it with her feet when a heavy hand seized her by the arm and a resolute voice said you are my prisoner  she was led back into the road the man who had got her blew a whistle two other men joined him  show a light he said and lets see who the fellow is  the shade was slipped aside from a lantern the light fell full on the prisoners face amazement petrified the two attendant policemen the pious catholic sergeant burst into speech holy mary its a woman  did the secret societies of ireland enrol women was this a modern judith expressing herself by anonymous letters and bent on assassinating a financial holofernes who kept a bank what account had she to give of herself how came she to be alone in a desolate field on a rainy night instead of answering these questions the inscrutable stranger preferred a bold and brief request take me to sir gileswas all she said to the police  the sergeant had the handcuffs ready after looking at the prisoners delicate wrists by the lanternlight he put his fetters back in his pocket a ladyand no doubt about it he said to one of his assistants  the two men waited with a mischievous interest in seeing what he would do next the list of their pious officers virtues included a constitutional partiality for women which exhibited the merciful side of justice when a criminal wore a petticoat we will take you to sir giles miss he saidand offered his arm instead of offering his handcuffs iris understood him and took his arm   she was silentunaccountably silent as the men thoughton the way to the town they heard her sigh and once the sigh sounded more like a sob little did they suspect what was in that silent womans mind at the time  the one object which had absorbed the attention of iris had been the saving of lord harry this accomplished the free exercise of her memory had now reminded her of arthur mountjoy  it was impossible to doubt that the object of the proposed meeting at the milestone had been to take measures for the preservation of the young mans life a coward is always more or less cruel the proceedings equally treacherous and merciless by which sir giles had provided for his own safety had delayedperhaps actually preventedthe execution of lord harrys humane design it was possible horribly possible that a prompt employment of time might have been necessary to the rescue of arthur from impending death by murder in the agitation that overpowered her iris actually hurried the police on their return to the town  sir giles had arranged to wait for news in his private room at the officeand there he was with dennis howmore in attendance to receive visitors  the sergeant went into the bankers room alone to make his report he left the door ajar iris could hear what passed  have you got your prisoner sir giles began  yes your honour  is the wretch securely handcuffed  i beg your pardon sir it isnt a man  nonsense sergeant it cant be a boy  the sergeant confessed that it was not a boy its a woman he said  what  a woman the patient officer repeatedand a young one she asked for you  bring her in  iris was not the sort of person who waits to be brought in she walked in of her own accord   vii  good heavens cried sir giles iris with my cloak on with my hat in her hand sergeant there has been some dreadful mistake this is my goddaughtermiss henley  we found her at the milestone your honour the young lady and nobody else  sir giles appealed helplessly to his goddaughter what does this mean instead of answering she looked at the sergeant the sergeant conscious of responsibility stood his ground and looked at sir giles his face confessed that the irish sense of humour was tickled but he showed no intention of leaving the room sir giles saw that iris would enter into no explanation in the mans presence you neednt wait any longer he said  what am i to do if you please with the prisoner the sergeant inquired  sir giles waived that unnecessary question away with his hand he was trebly responsibleas knight banker and magistrate into the bargain i will be answerable he replied for producing miss henley if called upon good night  the sergeants sense of duty was satisfied he made the military salute his gallantry added homage to the young lady under the form of a bow then and then only he walked with dignity out of the room  now sir giles resumed i presume i may expect to receive an explanation what does this impropriety mean what were you doing at the milestone  i was saving the person who made the appointment with you iris said the poor fellow had no illwill towards youwho had risked everything to save your nephews life oh sir you committed a terrible mistake when you refused to trust that man  sir giles had anticipated the appearance of fear and the reality of humble apologies she had answered him indignantly with a heightened colour and with tears in her eyes his sense of his own social importance was wounded to the quick who is the man you are speaking of he asked loftily and what is your excuse for having gone to the milestone to save himhidden under my cloak disguised in my hat  dont waste precious time in asking questions was the desperate reply undo the harm that you have done already your helpoh i mean what i saymay yet preserve arthurs life go to the farm and save him  sir giless anger assumed a new form it indulged in an elaborate mockery of respect he took his watch from his pocket and consulted it satirically must i make an excuse he asked with a clumsy assumption of humility  no you must go  permit me to inform you miss henley that the last train started more than two hours since  what does that matter you are rich enough to hire a train  sir giles the actor could endure it no longer he dropped the mask and revealed sir giles the man his clerk was summoned by a peremptory ring of the bell attend miss henley to the house he said you may come to your senses after a nights rest he continued turning sternly to iris i will receive your excuses in the morning   in the morning the breakfast was ready as usual at nine oclock sir giles found himself alone at the table  he sent an order to one of the womenservants to knock at miss henleys door there was a long delay the housekeeper presented herself in a state of alarm she had gone upstairs to make the necessary investigation in her own person miss henley was not in her room the maid was not in her room the beds had not been slept in the heavy luggage was labelledto be called for from the hotel and there was an end of the evidence which the absent iris had left behind her  inquiries were made at the hotel the young lady had called there with her maid early on that morning they had their travellingbags with them and miss henley had left directions that the luggage was to be placed under care of the landlord until her return to what destination she had betaken herself nobody knew  sir giles was too angry to remember what she had said to him on the previous night or he might have guessed at the motive which had led to her departure her father has done with her already he said and i have done with her now the servants received orders not to admit miss henley if her audacity contemplated a return to her godfathers house   viii  on the afternoon of the same day iris arrived at the village situated in the near neighbourhood of arthur mountjoys farm  the infection of political excitement otherwise the hatred of england had spread even to this remote place on the steps of his little chapel the priest a peasant himself was haranguing his brethren of the soil an irishman who paid his landlord was a traitor to his country an irishman who asserted his free birthright in the land that he walked on was an enlightened patriot such was the new law which the reverend gentleman expounded to his attentive audience if his brethren there would like him to tell them how they might apply the law this exemplary christian would point to the faithless irishman arthur mountjoy buy not of him sell not to him avoid him if he approaches you starve him out of the place i might say more boysyou know what i mean  to hear the latter part of this effort of oratory without uttering a word of protest was a trial of endurance under which iris trembled the secondary effect of the priests address was to root the conviction of arthurs danger with tenfold tenacity in her mind after what she had just heard even the slightest delay in securing his safety might be productive of deplorable results she astonished a barefooted boy on the outskirts of the crowd by a gift of sixpence and asked her way to the farm the little irishman ran on before her eager to show the generous lady how useful he could be in less than half an hour iris and her maid were at the door of the farmhouse no such civilised inventions appeared as a knocker or a bell the boy used his knuckles insteadand ran away when he heard the lock of the door turned on the inner side he was afraid to be seen speaking to any living creature who inhabited the evicted farm  a decent old woman appeared and inquired suspiciously what the ladies wanted the accent in which she spoke was unmistakably english when iris asked for mr arthur mountjoy the reply was not at home the housekeeper inhospitably attempted to close the door wait one moment iris said years have changed you but there is something in your face which is not quite strange to me are you mrs lewson  the woman admitted that this was her name but how is it that you are a stranger to me she asked distrustfully  if you have been long in mr mountjoys service iris replied you may perhaps have heard him speak of miss henley  mrs lewsons face brightened in an instant she threw the door wide open with a glad cry of recognition  come in miss come in who would have thought of seeing you in this horrible place yes i was the nurse who looked after you all threewhen you and mr arthur and mr hugh were playfellows together her eyes rested longingly on her favourite of bygone days the sensitive sympathies of iris interpreted that look she prettily touched her cheek inviting the nurse to kiss her at this act of kindness the poor old woman broke down she apologised quaintly for her tears think miss how i must remember that happy timewhen you have not forgotten it  shown into the parlour the first object which the visitor noticed was the letter that she had written to arthur lying unopened on the table  then he is really out of the house she said with a feeling of relief  he had been away from the farm for a week or more had he received a warning from some other quarter and had he wisely sought refuge in flight the amazement in the housekeepers face when she heard these questions pleaded for a word of explanation iris acknowledged without reserve the motives which had suggested her journey and asked eagerly if she had been mistaken in assuming that arthur was in danger of assassination  mrs lewson shook her head beyond all doubt the young master was in danger but miss iris ought to have known his nature better than to suppose that he would beat a retreat if all the landleaguers in ireland threatened him together no it was his bold way to laugh at danger he had left his farm to visit a friend in the next county and it was shrewdly guessed that a young lady who was staying in the house was the attraction which had kept him so long away anyhow he means to come back tomorrow mrs lewson said i wish he would think better of it and make his escape to england while he has the chance if the savages in these parts must shoot somebody im herean old woman that cant last much longer let them shoot me  iris asked if arthurs safety was assured in the next county and in the house of his friend  i cant say miss i have never been to the house he is in danger if he persists in coming back to the farm there are chances of shooting him all along his road home oh yes he knows it poor dear as well as i do but theremen like him are such perverse creatures he takes his rides just as usual no he wont listen to an old woman like me and as for friends to advise him the only one of them that has darkened our doors is a scamp who had better have kept away you may have heard tell of him the old earl his wicked father used to be called by a bad name and the wild young lord is his fathers true son  not lord harry iris exclaimed  the outbreak of agitation in her tone and manner was silently noticed by her maid the housekeeper did not attempt to conceal the impression that had been produced upon her i hope you dont know such a vagabond as that she said very seriously perhaps you are thinking of his brotherthe eldest sona respectable man as i have been told  miss henley passed over these questions without notice urged by the interest in her lover which was now more than ever an interest beyond her control she said is lord harry in danger on account of his friend  he has nothing to fear from the wretches who infest our part of the country mrs lewson replied report says hes one of themselves the policetheres what his young lordship has to be afraid of if alls true that is said about him anyhow when he paid his visit to my master he came secretly like a thief in the night and i heard mr arthur while they were together here in the parlour loud in blaming him for something that he had done no more miss of lord harry i have something particular to say to you suppose i promise to make you comfortablewill you please wait here till tomorrow and see mr arthur and speak to him if theres a person living who can persuade him to take better care of himself i do believe it will be you  iris readily consented to wait for arthur mountjoys return left together while mrs lewson was attending to her domestic duties the mistress noticed an appearance of preoccupation in the maids face  are you beginning to wish rhoda she said that i had not brought you to this strange place among these wild people  the maid was a quiet amiable girl evidently in delicate health she smiled faintly i was thinking miss of another nobleman besides the one mrs lewson mentioned just now who seems to have led a reckless life it was printed in a newspaper that i read before we left london  was his name mentioned iris asked  no miss i suppose they were afraid of giving offence he tried so many strange ways of getting a livingit was almost like reading a storybook  the suppression of the name suggested a suspicion from which iris recoiled was it possible that her maid could be ignorantly alluding to lord harry  do you remember this heros adventures she said  i can try miss if you wish to hear about him  the newspaper narrative appeared to have produced a vivid impression on rhodas mind making allowance for natural hesitations and mistakes and difficulties in expressing herself correctly she repeated with a singularly clear recollection the substance of what she had read   ix  the principal characters in the story were an old irish nobleman who was called the earl and the youngest of his two sons mysteriously distinguished as the wild lord  it was said of the earl that he had not been a good father he had cruelly neglected both his sons the younger one badly treated at school and left to himself in the holidays began his adventurous career by running away he got employment under an assumed name as a ships boy at the outset he did well learning his work and being liked by the captain and the crew but the chief mate was a brutal man and the young runaways quick temper resented the disgraceful infliction of blows he made up his mind to try his luck on shore and attached himself to a company of strolling players being a handsome lad with a good figure and a fine clear voice he did very well for a while on the country stage hard times came salaries were reduced the adventurer wearied of the society of actors and actresses his next change of life presented him in north britain as a journalist employed on a scotch newspaper an unfortunate love affair was the means of depriving him of this new occupation he was recognised soon afterwards serving as assistant steward in one of the passenger steamers voyaging between liverpool and new york arrived in this last city he obtained notoriety of no very respectable kind as a medium claiming powers of supernatural communication with the world of spirits when the imposture was ultimately discovered he had gained money by his unworthy appeal to the meanly prosaic superstition of modern times a long interval had then elapsed and nothing had been heard of him when a starving man was discovered by a traveller lost on a western prairie the illfated irish lord had associated himself with an indian tribehad committed some offence against their lawsand had been deliberately deserted and left to die on his recovery he wrote to his elder brother who had inherited the title and estates on the death of the old earl to say that he was ashamed of the life that he had led and eager to make amendment by accepting any honest employment that could be offered to him the traveller who had saved his life and whose opinion was to be trusted declared that the letter represented a sincerely penitent state of mind there were good qualities in the vagabond which only wanted a little merciful encouragement to assert themselves the reply that he received from england came from the lawyers employed by the new earl they had arranged with their agents in new york to pay to the younger brother a legacy of a thousand pounds which represented all that had been left to him by his fathers will if he wrote again his letters would not be answered his brother had done with him treated in this inhuman manner the wild lord became once more worthy of his name he tried a new life as a betting man at races and trottingmatches fortune favoured him at the outset and he considerably increased his legacy with the customary infatuation of men who gain money by risking the loss of it he presumed on his good luck one pecuniary disaster followed another and left him literally penniless he was found again in england exhibiting an open boat in which he and a companion had made one of those foolhardy voyages across the atlantic which have now happily ceased to interest the public to a friend who remonstrated with him he answered that he reckoned on being lost at sea and on so committing a suicide worthy of the desperate life that he had led the last accounts of him after this were too vague and too contradictory to be depended on at one time it was reported that he had returned to the united states not long afterwards unaccountable paragraphs appeared in newspapers declaring at one and the same time that he was living among bad company in paris and that he was hiding disreputably in an ill famed quarter of the city of dublin called the liberties in any case there was good reason to fear that irishamerican desperadoes had entangled the wild lord in the network of political conspiracy   the maid noticed a change in the mistress which surprised her when she had reached the end of the newspaper story of miss henleys customary good spirits not a trace remained few people rhoda remember what they read as well as you do she said it kindly and sadlyand she said no more  there was a reason for this  now at one time and now at another iris had heard of lord harrys faults and failings in fragments of family history the complete record of his degraded life presented in an uninterrupted succession of events had now forced itself on her attention for the first time it naturally shocked her she felt as she had never felt before how entirely right her father had been in insisting on her resistance to an attachment which was unworthy of her so far but no farther her conscience yielded to its own conviction of what was just but the one unassailable vital force in this world is the force of love it may submit to the hard necessities of life it may acknowledge the imperative claims of duty it may be silent under reproach and submissive to privationbut suffer what it may it is the masterpassion still subject to no artificial influences owning no supremacy but the law of its own being iris was above the reach of selfreproach when her memory recalled the daring action which had saved lord harry at the milestone her better sense acknowledged hugh mountjoys superiority over the other manbut her heart her perverse heart remained true to its first choice in spite of her she made an impatient excuse and went out alone to recover her composure in the farmhouse garden  the hours of the evening passed slowly  there was a pack of cards in the house the women tried to amuse themselves and failed anxiety about arthur preyed on the spirits of miss henley and mrs lewson even the maid who had only seen him during his last visit to london said she wished tomorrow had come and gone his sweet temper his handsome face his lively talk had made arthur a favourite everywhere mrs lewson had left her comfortable english home to be his housekeeper when he tried his rash experiment of farming in ireland and more wonderful still even wearisome sir giles became an agreeable person in his nephews company  iris set the example of retiring at an early hour to her room  there was something terrible in the pastoral silence of the place it associated itself mysteriously with her fears for arthur it suggested armed treachery on tiptoe taking its murderous stand in hiding the whistling passage of bullets through the air the piercing cry of a man mortally wounded and that man perhaps iris shrank from her own horrid thought a momentary faintness overcame her she opened the window as she put her head out to breathe the cool nightair a man on horseback rode up to the house was it arthur no the lightcoloured grooms livery that he wore was just visible  before he could dismount to knock at the door a tall man walked up to him out of the darkness  is that miles the tall man asked  the groom knew the voice iris was even better acquainted with it she too recognised lord harry   x  there was the irish lord at the very time when iris was most patiently resigned never to see him more never to think of him as her husband againreminding her of the first days of their love and of their mutual confession of it fear of herself kept her behind the curtain while interest in lord harry detained her at the window in hiding  all well at rathco he askedmentioning the name of the house in which arthur was one of the guests  yes my lord mr mountjoy leaves us tomorrow  does he mean to return to the farm  sorry i am to say it he does mean that  has he fixed any time miles for starting on his journey  miles instituted a search through his pockets and accompanied it by an explanation yes indeed master arthur had fixed a time he had written a note to say so to mistress lewson the housekeeper he had said drop the note at the farm on your way to the village and what might miles want at the village in the dark medicine in a hurry for one of his masters horses that was sick and sinking and speaking of that here thank god was the note  iris listening and watching alternately saw to her surprise the note intended for mrs lewson handed to lord harry am i expected he asked jocosely to read writing without a light miles produced a small lantern which was strapped to his grooms belt theres parts of the road not over safe in the dark he said as he raised the shade which guarded the light the wild lord coolly opened the letter and read the few careless words which it contained to mrs lewsondear old girl expect me back tomorrow to dinner at three oclock yours arthur  there was a pause  are there any strangers at rathco lord harry asked  two new men miles replied at work in the grounds  there was another pause how can i protect him the young lord said partly to himself partly to miles he suspected the two new menspies probably who knew of arthurs proposed journey home and who had already reported to their employers the hour at which he would set out  miles ventured to say a word i hope you wont be angry with me my lord  stuff and nonsense was i ever angry with you when i was rich enough to keep a servant and when you were the man  the irish groom answered in a voice that trembled with strong feeling you were the best and kindest master that ever lived on this earth i cant see you putting your precious life in peril  my precious life lord harry repeated lightly youre thinking of mr mountjoy when you say that his life is worth saving as for my life he ended the sentence by a whistle as the best way he could hit on of expressing his contempt for his own existence  my lord my lord miles persisted the invincibles are beginning to doubt you if any of them find you hanging about mr mountjoys farm theyll try a shot at you first and ask afterwards whether it was right to kill you or not  to hear this saidand said seriouslyafter the saving of him at the milestone was a trial of her firmness which iris was unable to resist love got the better of prudence she drew back the windowcurtain in another moment she would have added her persuasion to the servants warning if lord harry himself had not accidentally checked her by a proceeding on his part for which she was not prepared  show the light he said ill write a line to mr mountjoy  he tore off the blank page from the note to the housekeeper and wrote to arthur entreating him to change the time of his departure from rathco and to tell no creature in the house or out of the house at what new hour he had arranged to go saddle your horse yourself the letter concluded it was written in a feigned hand without a signature  give that to mr mountjoy lord harry said if he asks who wrote it dont frighten him about me by telling the truth lie miles say you dont know he next returned the note for mrs lewson if she notices that it has been opened he resumed and asks who has done it lie again goodnight milesand mind those dangerous places on your road home  the groom darkened his lantern and the wild lord was lost to view round the side of the house  left by himself miles rapped at the door with the handle of his whip a letter from mr arthur he called out mrs lewson at once took the note and examined it by the light of the candle on the halltable somebody has been reading this she exclaimed stepping out to the groom and showing him the torn envelope miles promptly obeying his instructions declared that he knew nothing about it and rode away  iris descended the stairs and joined mrs lewson in the hall before she had closed the door the housekeeper at once produced arthurs letter  its on my mind miss she said to write an answer and say something to mr arthur which will persuade him to take care of himself on his way back to the farm the difficulty is how am i to express it you would be doing a kind thing if you would give me a word of advice  iris willingly complied a second note from the anxious housekeeper might help the effect of the few lines which lord harry had written  arthurs letter informed iris that he had arranged to return at three oclock lord harrys question to the groom and the mans reply instantly recurred to her memory are there any strangers at rathcotwo new men at work in the grounds arriving at the same conclusion which had already occurred to lord harry iris advised the housekeeper in writing to arthur to entreat him to change the hour secretly at which he left his friends house on the next day warmly approving of this idea mrs lewson hurried into the parlour to write her letter dont go to bed yet miss she said i want you to read it before i send it away the first thing tomorrow morning  left alone in the hall with the door open before her iris looked out on the night thinking  the lives of the two men in whom she was interestedin widely different wayswere now both threatened and the imminent danger at that moment was the danger of lord harry he was an outlaw whose character would not bear investigation but to give him his due there was no risk which he was not ready to confront for arthurs sake if he was still recklessly lingering on the watch for assassins in the dangerous neighbourhood of the farm who but herself possessed the influence which would prevail on him to leave the place she had joined mrs lewson at the door with that conviction in her mind in another instant she was out of the house and beginning her search in the dark  iris made the round of the building sometimes feeling her way in obscure places sometimes calling to lord harry cautiously by his name no living creature appeared no sound of a movement disturbed the stillness of the night the discovery of his absence which she had not dared to hope for was the cheering discovery which she had now made  on her way back to the house she became conscious of the rashness of the act into which her own generous impulse had betrayed her  if she and lord harry had met could she have denied the tender interest in him which her own conduct would then have revealed would he not have been justified in concluding that she had pardoned the errors and the vices of his life and that he might without impropriety remind her of their engagement and claim her hand in marriage she trembled as she thought of the concessions which he might have wrung from her never more she determined shall my own folly be answerable for it if he and i meet again  she had returned to mrs lewson and had read over the letter to arthur when the farm clock striking the hour reminded them that it was time to retire they slept badly that night  at six in the morning one of the two labourers who had remained faithful to arthur was sent away on horseback with the housekeepers reply and with orders to wait for an answer allowing time for giving the horse a rest the man might be expected to return before noon   ix  it was a fine sunshiny day mrs lewsons spirits began to improve i have always held the belief the worthy old woman confessed that bright weather brings good luckof course provided the day is not a friday this is wednesday cheer up miss  the messenger returned with good news mr arthur had been as merry as usual he had made fun of another letter of good advice received without a signature but mrs lewson must have her way he said my love to the old dearill start two hours later and be back to dinner at five  where did mr arthur give you that message iris inquired  at the stables miss while i was putting up the horse the men about were all on the broad grin when they heard mr arthurs message  still in a morbid state of mind iris silently regretted that the message had not been written instead of being delivered by word of mouth here again she like the wild lord had been afraid of listeners  the hours wore slowly on until it was past four oclock iris could endure the suspense no longer its a lovely afternoon she said to mrs lewson let us take a walk along the road and meet arthur to this proposal the housekeeper readily agreed  it was nearly five oclock when they reached a place at which a byroad branched off through a wood from the highway which they had hitherto followed mrs lewson found a seat on a felled tree we had better not go any farther she said  iris asked if there was any reason for this  there was an excellent reason a few yards farther on the high road had been diverted from the straight line in the interest of a large agricultural village and was then directed again into its former course the byroad through the wood served as a short cut for horsemen and pedestrians from one divergent point to the other it was next to a certainty that arthur would return by the short cut but if accident or caprice led to his preferring the highway it was clearly necessary to wait for him within view of both the roads  too restless to submit to a state of passive expectation iris proposed to follow the bridle path through the wood for a little way and to return if she failed to see anything of arthur you are tired she said kindly to her companion pray dont move  mrs lewson looked needlessly uneasy you might lose yourself miss mind you keep to the path  iris followed the pleasant windings of the woodland track in the hope of meeting arthur she considerably extended the length of her walk the white line of the high road as it passed the farther end of the wood showed itself through the trees she turned at once to rejoin mrs lewson  on her way back she made a discovery a ruin which she had not previously noticed showed itself among the trees on her left hand her curiosity was excited she strayed aside to examine it more closely the crumbling walls as she approached them looked like the remains of an ordinary dwellinghouse age is essential to the picturesque effect of decay a modern ruin is an unnatural and depressing objectand here the horrid thing was  as she turned to retrace her steps to the road a man walked out of the inner space enclosed by all that was left of the dismantled house a cry of alarm escaped her was she the victim of destiny or the sport of chance there was the wild lord whom she had vowed never to see again the master of her heartperhaps the master of her fate  any other man would have been amazed to see her and would have asked how it had happened that the english lady presented herself to him in an irish wood this man enjoyed the delight of seeing her and accepted it as a blessing that was not to be questioned my angel has dropped from heaven he said may heaven be praised  he approached her his arms closed round her she struggled to free herself from his embrace at that moment they both heard the crackle of breaking underwood among the trees behind them lord harry looked round this is a dangerous place he whispered im waiting to see arthur pass safely submit to be kissed or i am a dead man his eyes told her that he was truly and fearfully in earnest her head sank on his bosom as he bent down and kissed her three men approached from their hidingplace among the trees they had no doubt been watching him under orders from the murderous brotherhood to which they belonged their pistols were ready in their handsand what discovery had they made there was the brother who had been denounced as having betrayed them guilty of no worse treason than meeting his sweetheart in a wood we beg your pardon my lord they cried with a thoroughly irish enjoyment of their own discomfitureand burst into a roar of laughterand left the lovers together for the second time iris had saved lord harry at a crisis in his life  let me go she pleaded faintly trembling with superstitious fear for the first time in her experience of herself  he held her to him as if he would never let her go again oh my sweet give me a last chance help me to be a better man you have only to will it iris and to make me worthy of you  his arms suddenly trembled round her and dropped the silence was broken by a distant sound like the report of a shot he looked towards the farther end of the wood in a minute more the thump of a horses hoofs at a gallop was audible where the bridlepath was hidden among the trees it came nearernearerthe creature burst into view wild with fright and carrying an empty saddle lord harry rushed into the path and seized the horse as it swerved at the sight of him there was a leather pocket attached to the front of the saddle search it he cried to iris forcing the terrified animal back on its haunches she drew out a silver travellingflask one glance at the name engraved on it told him the terrible truth his trembling hands lost their hold the horse escaped the words burst from his lips  oh god theyve killed him  the end of the prologue    the story  first period   chapter i  the sour french wine  while the line to be taken by the new railway between culm and everill was still under discussion the engineer caused some difference of opinion among the moneyed men who were the first directors of the company by asking if they proposed to include among their stations the little old town of honeybuzzard  for years past commerce had declined and population had decreased in this ancient and curious place painters knew it well and prized its mediaeval houses as a mine of valuable material for their art persons of cultivated tastes who were interested in church architecture of the fourteenth century sometimes pleased and flattered the rector by subscribing to his fund for the restoration of the tower and the removal of the accumulated rubbish of hundreds of years from the crypt small speculators not otherwise in a state of insanity settled themselves in the town and tried the desperate experiment of opening a shop spent their little capital put up the shutters and disappeared the old marketplace still showed its list of marketlaws issued by the mayor and corporation in the prosperous bygone times and every week there were fewer and fewer people to obey the laws the great empty enclosure looked more cheerful when there was no market held and when the boys of the town played in the deserted place in the last warehouse left in a state of repair the crane was generally idle the windows were mostly shut up and a solitary man represented languishing trade idling at a halfopened door the muddy river rose and fell with the distant tide at rare intervals a collier discharged its cargo on the mouldering quay or an empty barge took in a load of hay one bold house advertised in a dirty window apartments to let there was a lawyer in the town who had no occasion to keep a clerk and there was a doctor who hoped to sell his practice for anything that it would fetch the directors of the new railway after a stormy meeting decided on offering by means of a station a last chance of revival to the dying town the town had not vitality enough left to be grateful the railway stimulant produced no effect of all his colleagues in great britain and ireland the stationmaster at honeybuzzard was the idlest manand this as he said to the unemployed porter through no want of energy on his own part  late on a rainy autumn afternoon the slow train left one traveller at the station he got out of a firstclass carriage he carried an umbrella and a travellingbag and he asked his way to the best inn the stationmaster and the porter compared notes one of them said evidently a gentleman the other added what can he possibly want here  the stranger twice lost his way in the tortuous old streets of the town before he reached the inn on giving his orders it appeared that he wanted three things a private room something to eat and while the dinner was being cooked materials for writing a letter  answering her daughters questions downstairs the landlady described her guest as a nicelooking man dressed in deep mourning young my dear with beautiful dark brown hair and a grand beard and a sweet sorrowful look ah his eyes would tell anybody that his black clothes are not a mere sham whether married or single of course i cant say but i noticed the name on his travellingbag a distinguished name in my opinionhugh mountjoy i wonder what hell order to drink when he has his dinner what a mercy it will be if we can get rid of another bottle of the sour french wine  the bell in the private room rang at that moment and the landladys daughter it is needless to say took the opportunity of forming her own opinion of mr hugh mountjoy  she returned with a letter in her hand consumed by a vain longing for the advantages of gentle birth ah mother if i was a young lady of the higher classes i know whose wife i should like to be not particularly interested in sentimental aspirations the landlady asked to see mr mountjoys letter the messenger who delivered it was to wait for an answer it was addressed to miss henley care of clarence vimpany esquire honeybuzzard urged by an excited imagination the daughter longed to see miss henley the mother was at a loss to understand why mr mountjoy should have troubled himself to write the letter at all if he knows the young lady who is staying at the doctors house she said why doesnt he call on miss henley she handed the letter back to her daughter there let the ostler take it hes got nothing to do  no mother the ostlers dirty hands mustnt touch itill take the letter myself perhaps i may see miss henley such was the impression which mr hugh mountjoy had innocently produced on a sensitive young person condemned by destiny to the barren sphere of action afforded by a country inn  the landlady herself took the dinner upstairsa first course of mutton chops and potatoes cooked to a degree of imperfection only attained in an english kitchen the sour french wine was still on the good womans mind what would you choose to drink sir she asked mr mountjoy seemed to feel no interest in what he might have to drink we have some french wine sir  thank you maam that will do  when the bell rang again and the time came to produce the second course of cheese and celery the landlady allowed the waiter to take her place her experience of the farmers who frequented the inn and who had in some few cases been induced to taste the wine warned her to anticipate an outbreak of just anger from mr mountjoy he like the others would probably ask what she meant by poisoning him with such stuff as that on the return of the waiter she put the question did the gentleman complain of the french wine  he wants to see you about it maam  the landlady turned pale the expression of mr mountjoys indignation was evidently reserved for the mistress of the house did he swear she asked when he tasted it  lord bless you maam no drank it out of a tumbler andif you will believe meactually seemed to like it  the landlady recovered her colour gratitude to providence for having sent a customer to the inn who could drink sour wine without discovering it was the uppermost feeling in her ample bosom as she entered the private room mr mountjoy justified her anticipations he was simple enoughwith his tumbler before him and the wine as it were under his noseto begin with an apology  i am sorry to trouble you maam may i ask where you got this wine  the wine sir was one of my late husbands bad debts it was all he could get from a frenchman who owed him money  its worth money maam  indeed sir  yes indeed this is some of the finest and purest claret that i have tasted for many a long day past  an alarming suspicion disturbed the serenity of the landladys mind was his extraordinary opinion of the wine sincere or was it mr mountjoys wicked design to entrap her into praising her claret and then to imply that she was a cheat by declaring what he really thought of it she took refuge in a cautious reply  you are the first gentleman sir who has not found fault with it  in that case perhaps you would like to get rid of the wine mr mountjoy suggested  the landlady was still cautious who will buy it of me sir  i will how much do you charge for it by the bottle  it was by this time clear that he was not mischievousonly a little crazy the worldlywise hostess took advantage of that circumstance to double the price without hesitation she said five shillings a bottle sir  often too often the irony of circumstances brings together on this earthly scene the opposite types of vice and virtue a lying landlady and a guest incapable of deceit were looking at each other across a narrow table equally unconscious of the immeasurable moral gulf that lay between them influenced by honourable feeling innocent hugh mountjoy lashed the landladys greed for money to the fullgallop of human cupidity  i dont think you are aware of the value of your wine he said i have claret in my cellar which is not so good as this and which costs more than you have asked it is only fair to offer you sevenandsixpence a bottle  when an eccentric traveller is asked to pay a price and deliberately raises that price against himself where is the sensible womanespecially if she happens to be a widow conducting an unprofitable businesswho would hesitate to improve the opportunity the greedy landlady raised her terms  on reflection sir i think i ought to have ten shillings a bottle if you please  the wine may be worth it mountjoy answered quietly but it is more than i can afford to pay no maam i will leave you to find some lover of good claret with a longer purse than mine  it was in this mans character when he said no to mean no mr mountjoys hostess perceived that her crazy customer was not to be trifled with she lowered her terms again with the headlong hurry of terror you shall have it sir at your own price said this entirely shameless and perfectly respectable woman  the bargain having been closed under these circumstances the landladys daughter knocked at the door i took your letter myself sir she said modestly and here is the answer she had seen miss henley and did not think much of her mountjoy offered the expression of his thanks in words never to be forgotten by a sensitive young person and opened his letter it was short enough to be read in a moment but it was evidently a favourable reply he took his hat in a hurry and asked to be shown the way to mr vimpanys house    chapter ii  the man she refused  mountjoy had decided on travelling to honeybuzzard as soon as he heard that miss henley was staying with strangers in that town having had no earlier opportunity of preparing her to see him he had considerately written to her from the inn in preference to presenting himself unexpectedly at the doctors house how would she receive the devoted friend whose proposal of marriage she had refused for the second time when they had last met in london  the doctors place of residence situated in a solitary bystreet commanded a view not perhaps encouraging to a gentleman who followed the medical profession it was a view of the churchyard the door was opened by a womanservant who looked suspiciously at the stranger without waiting to be questioned she said her master was out mountjoy mentioned his name and asked for miss henley  the servants manner altered at once for the better she showed him into a small drawingroom scantily and cheaply furnished some poorlyframed prints on the walls a little out of place perhaps in a doctors house represented portraits of famous actresses who had been queens of the stage in the early part of the present century the few books too collected on a little shelf above the chimneypiece were in every case specimens of dramatic literature who reads these plays mountjoy asked himself and how did iris find her way into this house  while he was thinking of her miss henley entered the room  her face was pale and careworn tears dimmed her eyes when mountjoy advanced to meet her in his presence the horror of his brothers death by assassination shook iris as it had not shaken her yet impulsively she drew his head down to her with the fond familiarity of a sister and kissed his forehead oh hugh i know how you and arthur loved each other no words of mine can say how i feel for you  no words are wanted my dear he answered tenderly your sympathy speaks for itself  he led her to the sofa and seated himself by her side your father has shown me what you have written to him he resumed your letter from dublin and your second letter from this place i know what you have so nobly risked and suffered in poor arthurs interests it will be some consolation to me if i can make a returna very poor return irisfor all that arthurs brother owes to the truest friend that ever man had no he continued gently interrupting the expression of her gratitude your father has not sent me herebut he knows that i have left london for the express purpose of seeing you and he knows why you have written to him dutifully and affectionately you have pleaded for pardon and reconciliation when he is to blame shall i venture to tell you how he answered me when i asked if he had no faith left in his own child hugh he said you are wasting words on a man whose mind is made up i will trust my daughter when that irish lord is laid in his gravenot before that is a reflection on you iris which i cannot permit even when your father casts it he is hard he is unforgiving but he must and shall be conquered yet i mean to make him do you justice i have come here with that purpose and that purpose only in view may i speak to you of lord harry  how can you doubt it  my dear this is a delicate subject for me to enter on  and a shameful subject for me iris broke out bitterly hugh you are an angel by comparison with that manhow debased i must be to love himhow unworthy of your good opinion ask me anything you like have no mercy on me oh she cried with reckless contempt for herself why dont you beat me i deserve it  mountjoy was well enough acquainted with the natures of women to pass over that passionate outbreak instead of fanning the flame in her by reasoning and remonstrance  your father will not listen to the expression of feeling he continued but it is possible to rouse his sense of justice by the expression of facts help me to speak to him more plainly of lord harry than you could speak in your letters i want to know what has happened from the time when events at ardoon brought you and the young lord together again to the time when you left him in ireland after my brothers death if i seem to expect too much of you iris pray remember that i am speaking with a true regard for your interests  in those words he made his generous appeal to her she proved herself to be worthy of it   stated briefly the retrospect began with the mysterious anonymous letters which had been addressed to sir giles  lord harrys explanation had been offered to iris gratefully but with some reserve after she had told him who the stranger at the milestone really was i entreat you to pardon me if i shrink from entering into particulars he had said circumstances at the time amply justified me in the attempt to use the bankers political influence as a means of securing arthurs safety i knew enough of sir giless mean nature to be careful in trusting him but i did hope to try what my personal influence might do if he had possessed a tenth part of your courage arthur might have been alive and safe in england at this moment i cant say any more i darent say any more it maddens me when i think of it he abruptly changed the subject and interested iris by speaking of other and later events his association with the invinciblesinexcusably rash and wicked as he himself confessed it to behad enabled him to penetrate and for a time to defeat secretly the murderous designs of the brotherhood his appearances first at the farmhouse and afterwards at the ruin in the wood were referable to changes in the plans of the assassins which had come to his knowledge when iris had met with him he was on the watch believing that his friend would take the short way back through the wood and well aware that his own life might pay the penalty if he succeeded in warning arthur after the terrible discovery of the murder committed on the high road and the escape of the miscreant who had been guilty of the crime the parting of lord harry and miss henley had been the next event she had left him on her return to england and had refused to consent to any of the future meetings between them which he besought her to grant   at this stage in the narrative mountjoy felt compelled to ask questions more searching than he had put to iris yet it was possible that she might be trusting her own impressions of lord harry with the illplaced confidence of a woman innocently selfdeceived  did he submit willingly to your leaving him mountjoy said  not at first she replied  has he released you from that rash engagement of some years since which pledged you to marry him  no  did he allude to the engagement on this occasion  he said he held to it as the one hope of his life  and what did you say  i implored him not to distress me  did you say nothing more positive than that  i couldnt help thinking hugh of all that he had tried to do to save arthur but i insisted on leaving himand i have left him  do you remember what he said at parting  he said while i live i love you  as she repeated the words there was an involuntary change to tenderness in her voice which was not lost on mountjoy  i must be sure he said to her gravely of what i tell your father when i go back to him can i declare with a safe conscience that you will never see lord harry again  my mind is made up never to see him again she had answered firmly so far her next words were spoken with hesitation in tones that faltered but i am sometimes afraid she said that the decision may not rest with me  what do you mean  i would rather not tell you  that is a strange answer iris  i value your good opinion hugh and i am afraid of losing it  nothing has ever altered my opinion of you he replied and nothing ever will  she looked at him anxiously with the closest attention little by little the expression of doubt in her face disappeared she knew how he loved hershe resolved to trust him  my friend she began abruptly education has done nothing for me since i left ireland i have sunk i dont know how or why into a state of superstitious fear yes i believe in a fatality which is leading me back to lord harry in spite of myself twice already since i left home i have met with him and each time i have been the means of saving himonce at the milestone and once at the ruin in the wood if my father still accuses me of being in love with an adventurer you can say with perfect truth that i am afraid of him i am afraid of the third meeting i have done my best to escape from that man and step by step as i think i am getting away destiny is taking me back to him i may be on my way to him here hidden in this wretched little town oh dont despise me dont be ashamed of me  my dear i am interesteddeeply interested in you that there may be some such influence as destiny in our poor mortal lives i dare not deny but i dont agree with your conclusion what destiny has to do with you and with me neither you nor i can pretend to know beforehand in the presence of that great mystery humanity must submit to be ignorant wait iriswait  she answered him with the simplicity of a docile child i will do anything you tell me  mountjoy was too fond of her to say more of lord harry for that day he was careful to lead the talk to a topic which might be trusted to provoke no agitating thoughts finding iris to all appearance established in the doctors house he was naturally anxious to know something of the person who must have invited herthe doctors wife    chapter iii  the registered packet  mountjoy began by alluding to the second of miss henleys letters to her father and to a passage in it which mentioned mrs vimpany with expressions of the sincerest gratitude  i should like to know more he said of a lady whose hospitality at home seems to equal her kindness as a fellowtraveller did you first meet with her on the railway  she travelled by the same train to dublin with me and my maid but not in the same carriage iris answered i was so fortunate as to meet with her on the voyage from dublin to holyhead we had a rough crossing and rhoda suffered so dreadfully from seasickness that she frightened me the stewardess was attending to ladies who were calling for her in all directions i really dont know what misfortune might not have happened if mrs vimpany had not come forward in the kindest manner and offered help she knew so wonderfully well what was to be done that she astonished me i am the wife of a doctor she said and i am only imitating what i have seen my husband do when his assistance has been required at sea in weather like this in her poor state of health rhoda was too much exhausted to go on by the train when we got to holyhead she is the best of good girls and i am fond of her as you know if i had been by myself i daresay i should have sent for medical help what do you think dear mrs vimpany offered to do your maid is only faint she said give her rest and some iced wine and she will be well enough to go on by the slow train dont be frightened about her i will wait with you and she did wait are there many strangers hugh who are as unselfishly good to others as my chanceacquaintance in the steamboat  very few i am afraid  mountjoy made that reply with some little embarrassment conscious of a doubt of mrs vimpanys disinterested kindness which seemed to be unworthy of a just man  iris went on  rhoda was sufficiently recovered she said to travel by the next train and there seemed to be no reason for feeling any more anxiety but after a time the fatigue of the journey proved to be too much for her the poor girl turned paleand fainted mrs vimpany revived her but as it turned out only for a while she fell into another fainting fit and my travellingcompanion began to look anxious there was some difficulty in restoring rhoda to her senses in dread of another attack i determined to stop at the next station it looked such a poor place when we got to it that i hesitated mrs vimpany persuaded me to go on the next station she said was her station stop there she suggested and let my husband look at the girl i ought not perhaps to say it but you will find no better medical man out of london i took the good creatures advice gratefully what else could i do  what would you have done mountjoy inquired if rhoda had been strong enough to get to the end of the journey  i should have gone on to london and taken refuge in a lodgingyou were in town as i believed and my father might relent in time as it was i felt my lonely position keenly to meet with kind people like mr vimpany and his wife was a real blessing to such a friendless creature as i amto say nothing of the advantage to rhoda who is getting better every day i should like you to see mrs vimpany if she is at home she is a little formal and old fashioned in her mannerbut i am sure you will be pleased with her ah you look round the room they are poor miserably poor for persons in their position these worthy friends of mine i have had the greatest difficulty in persuading them to let me contribute my share towards the household expenses they only yielded when i threatened to go to the inn you are looking very serious hugh is it possible that you see some objection to my staying in this house  the drawingroom door was softly opened at the moment when iris put that question a lady appeared on the threshold seeing the stranger she turned to iris  i didnt know dear miss henley that you had a visitor pray pardon my intrusion  the voice was deep the articulation was clear the smile presented a certain modest dignity which gave it a value of its own this was a woman who could make such a commonplace thing as an apology worth listening to iris stopped her as she was about to leave the room i was just wishing for you she said let me introduce my old friend mr mountjoy hugh this is the lady who has been so kind to memrs vimpany  hughs impulse under the circumstances was to dispense with the formality of a bow and to shake hands mrs vimpany met this friendly advance with a suavity of action not often seen in these days of movement without ceremony she was a tall slim woman of a certain age art had so cleverly improved her complexion that it almost looked like nature her cheeks had lost the plumpness of youth but her hair thanks again perhaps to art showed no signs of turning grey the expression of her large dark eyesplaced perhaps a little too near her high aquiline noseclaimed admiration from any person who was so fortunate as to come within their range of view her hands long yellow and pitiably thin were used with a grace which checked to some extent their cruel betrayal of her age her dress had seen better days but it was worn with an air which forbade it to look actually shabby the faded lace that encircled her neck fell in scanty folds over her bosom she sank into a chair by hughs side it was a great pleasure to me mr mountjoy to offer my poor services to miss henley i cant tell you how happy her presence makes me in our little house the compliment was addressed to iris with every advantage that smiles and tones could offer oddly artificial as it undoubtedly was mrs vimpanys manner produced nevertheless an agreeable impression disposed to doubt her at first mountjoy found that she was winning her way to a favourable change in his opinion she so far interested him that he began to wonder what her early life might have been when she was young and handsome he looked again at the portraits of actresses on the walls and the plays on the bookshelfand then when she was speaking to iris he stole a sly glance at the doctors wife was it possible that this remarkable woman had once been an actress he attempted to put the value of that guess to the test by means of a complimentary allusion to the prints  my memory as a playgoer doesnt extend over many years he began but i can appreciate the historical interest of your beautiful prints mrs vimpany bowed gracefullyand dumbly mountjoy tried again one doesnt often see the famous actresses of past days he proceeded so well represented on the walls of an english house  this time he had spoken to better purpose mrs vimpany answered him in words  i have many pleasant associations with the theatre she said first formed in the time of my girlhood  mountjoy waited to hear something more nothing more was said perhaps this reticent lady disliked looking back through a long interval of years or perhaps she had her reasons for leaving mountjoys guess at the truth still lost in doubt in either case she deliberately dropped the subject iris took it up sitting by the only table in the room she was in a position which placed her exactly opposite to one of the printsthe magnificent portrait of mrs siddons as the tragic muse  i wonder if mrs siddons was really as beautiful as that she said pointing to the print sir joshua reynolds is reported to have sometimes flattered his sitters  mrs vimpanys solemn selfpossessed eyes suddenly brightened the name of the great actress seemed to interest her on the point apparently of speaking she dropped the subject of mrs siddons as she had dropped the subject of the theatre mountjoy was left to answer iris  we are none of us old enough he reminded her to decide whether sir joshuas brush has been guilty of flattery or not he turned to mrs vimpany and attempted to look into her life from a new point of view when miss henley was so fortunate as to make your acquaintance he said you were travelling in ireland was it your first visit to that unhappy country  i have been more than once in ireland  having again deliberately disappointed mountjoy she was assisted in keeping clear of the subject of ireland by a fortunate interruption it was the hour of delivery by the afternoonpost the servant came in with a small sealed packet and a slip of printed paper in her hand  its registered maam the woman announced the postman says you are to please sign this and he seems to be in a hurry  she placed the packet and the slip of paper on the table near the inkstand having signed the receipt mrs vimpany took up the packet and examined the address she instantly looked at iris and looked away again will you excuse me for a moment saying this she left the room without opening the packet  the moment the door closed on her iris started up and hurried to mountjoy  oh hugh she said i saw the address on that packet when the servant put it on the table  my dear what is there to excite you in the address  dont speak so loud she may be listening outside the door  not only the words but the tone in which they were spoken amazed mountjoy your friend mrs vimpany he exclaimed  mrs vimpany was afraid to open the packet in our presence iris went on you must have seen that the handwriting is familiar to me i am certain of the person who wrote the address  well and who is the person  she whispered in his ear  lord harry    chapter iv  the game mountjoy loses  surprise silenced hugh for the moment iris understood the look that he fixed on her and answered it i am quite sure she told him of what i say  mountjoys wellbalanced mind hesitated at rushing to a conclusion  i am sure you are convinced of what you tell me he said but mistakes do sometimes happen in forming a judgment of handwriting  in the state of excitement that now possessed her iris was easily irritated she was angry with hugh for only supposing that she might have made a mistake he had himself as she reminded him seen lord harrys handwriting in past days was it possible to be mistaken in those bold thicklywritten characters with some of the letters so quaintly formed oh hugh i am miserable enough as it is she broke out dont distract me by disputing what i know think of a woman so kind so disinterested so charmingthe very opposite of a false creaturethink of mrs vimpany having deceived me  there was not the slightest reason thus far for placing that interpretation on what had happened mountjoy gently very gently remonstrated  my dear we really dont know yet that mrs vimpany has been acting under lord harrys instructions wait a little before you suspect your fellowtraveller of offering her services for the purpose of deceiving you  iris was angry with him again why did mrs vimpany never tell me she knew lord harry isnt that suspicious  mountjoy smiled let me put a question on my side he said did you tell mrs vimpany you knew lord harry iris made no reply her face spoke for her well then he urged is your silence suspicious i am far mind from saying that this may not be a very unpleasant discovery only let us be sure first that we are right  with most of a womans merits miss henley had many of a womans faults still holding to her own conclusion she asked how they could expect to be sure of anything if they addressed their inquiries to a person who had already deceived them  mountjoys inexhaustible indulgence still made allowances for her when mrs vimpany comes back he said i will find an opportunity of mentioning lord harrys name if she tells us that she knows him there will be good reason in that one circumstance as it seems to me for continuing to trust her  suppose she shams ignorance iris persisted and looks as if she had never heard of his name before  in that case i shall own that i was wrong and shall ask you to forgive me  the finer and better nature of iris recovered its influence at these words it is i who ought to beg pardon she said oh i wish i could think before i speak how insolent and illtempered i have been but suppose i turn out to be right hugh what will you do then  then my dear it will be my duty to take you and your maid away from this house and to tell your father what serious reasons there are he abruptly checked himself mrs vimpany had returned she was in perfect possession of her lofty courtesy sweetened by the modest dignity of her smile  i have left you miss henley in such good company she said with a gracious inclination of her head in the direction of mountjoy that i need hardly repeat my apologiesunless indeed i am interrupting a confidential conversation  it was possible that iris might have betrayed herself when the doctors wife had looked at her after examining the address on the packet in this case mrs vimpanys allusion to a confidential conversation would have operated as a warning to a person of experience in the byways of deceit mountjoys utmost exertion of cunning was not capable of protecting him on such conditions as these the opportunity of trying his proposed experiment with lord harrys name seemed to have presented itself already he rashly seized on it  you have interrupted nothing that was confidential he hastened to assure mrs vimpany we have been speaking of a reckless young gentleman who is an acquaintance of ours if what i hear is true he has already become public property his adventures have found their way into some of the newspapers  here if mrs vimpany had answered hughs expectations she ought to have asked who the young gentleman was she merely listened in polite silence  with a womans quickness of perception iris saw that mountjoy had not only pounced on his opportunity prematurely but had spoken with a downright directness of allusion which must at once have put such a readywitted person as mrs vimpany on her guard in trying to prevent him from pursuing his unfortunate experiment in social diplomacy iris innocently repeated mountjoys own mistake she too seized her opportunity prematurely that is to say she was rash enough to change the subject  you were talking just now hugh of our friends adventures she said i am afraid you will find yourself involved in an adventure of no very agreeable kind if you engage a bed at the inn i never saw a more wretchedlooking place  it was one of mrs vimpanys many merits that she seldom neglected an opportunity of setting her friends at their ease  no no dear miss henley she hastened to say the inn is really a more clean and comfortable place than you suppose a hard bed and a scarcity of furniture are the worst evils which your friend has to fear do you know she continued addressing herself to mountjoy that i was reminded of a friend of mine when you spoke just now of the young gentleman whose adventures are in the newspapers is it possible that you referred to the brother of the present earl of norland a handsome young irishmanwith whom i first became acquainted many years since am i right in supposing that you and miss henley know lord harry she asked  what more than this could an unprejudiced mind require mrs vimpany had set herself right with a simplicity that defied suspicion iris looked at mountjoy he appeared to know when he was beaten having acknowledged that lord harry was the young gentleman of whom he and miss henley had been speaking he rose to take leave  after what had passed iris felt the necessity of speaking privately to hugh the necessary excuse presented itself in the remote situation of the inn you will never find your way back she said through the labyrinth of crooked streets in this old town wait for me a minute and i will be your guide  mrs vimpany protested my dear let the servant show the way  iris held gaily to her resolution and ran away to her room mrs vimpany yielded with her best grace miss henleys motive could hardly have been plainer to her if miss henley had confessed it herself what a charming girl the doctors amiable wife said to mountjoy when they were alone if i were a man miss iris is just the young lady that i should fall in love with she looked significantly at mountjoy nothing came of it she went on miss henley must have had many opportunities of being married but the right man has i fear not yet presented himself once more her eloquent eyes consulted mountjoy and once more nothing came of it some women are easily discouraged impenetrable mrs vimpany was one of the other women she had not done with mountjoy yetshe invited him to dinner on the next day  our early hour is three oclock she said modestly pray join us i hope to have the pleasure of introducing my husband  mountjoy had his reasons for wishing to see the husband as he accepted the invitation miss henley returned to accompany him to the inn  iris put the inevitable question to hugh as soon as they were out of the doctors housewhat do you say of mrs vimpany now  i say that she must have been once an actress mountjoy answered and that she carries her experience of the stage into private life  what do you propose to do next  i propose to wait and see mrs vimpanys husband tomorrow  why  mrs vimpany my dear is too clever for me ifobserve please that i do her the justice of putting it in that wayif she is really lord harrys creature employed to keep watch on you and to inform him of your next place of residence in england i own that she has completely deceived me in that case it is just possible that the husband is not such a finished and perfect humbug as the wife i may be able to see through him i can but try  iris sighed i almost hope you may not succeed she said  mountjoy was puzzled and made no attempt to conceal it i thought you only wanted to get at the truth he answered  my mind might be easier perhaps if i was left in doubt she suggested a perverse way of thinking has set up my poor opinion against yours but i am getting back to my better sense i believe you were entirely right when you tried to prevent me from rushing to conclusions it is more than likely that i have done mrs vimpany an injustice oh hugh i ought to keep a friendi who have so few friendswhen i have got one and there is another feeling in me which i must not conceal from you when i remember lord harrys noble conduct in trying to save poor arthur i cannot believe him capable of such hateful deceit as consenting to our separation and then having me secretly watched by a spy what monstrous inconsistency can anybody believe it can anybody account for it  i think i can account for it iris if you will let me make the attempt you are mistaken to begin with  how am i mistaken  you shall see there is no such creature as a perfectly consistent human being on the face of the earthand strange as it may seem to you the human beings themselves are not aware of it the reason for this curious state of things is not far to seek how can people who are ignorantas we see every dayof their own characters be capable of correctly estimating the characters of others even the influence of their religion fails to open their eyes to the truth in the prayer which is the most precious possession of christendom their lips repeat the entreaty that they may not be led into temptationbut their minds fail to draw the inference if that pathetic petition means anything it means that virtuous men and women are capable of becoming vicious men and women if a powerful temptation puts them to the test every sunday devout members of the congregation in churchmodels of excellence in their own estimation and in the estimation of their neighboursdeclare that they have done those things which they ought not to have done and that there is no health in them will you believe that they are encouraged by their prayerbooks to present this sad exposure of the frailty of their own admirable characters how inconsistentand yet how entirely true lord harry as you rightly say behaved nobly in trying to save my dear lost brother he ought as you think and as other people think to be consistently noble after that in all his thoughts and actions to the end of his life suppose that temptation does try himsuch temptation iris as you innocently presentwhy doesnt he offer a superhuman resistance you might as well ask why is he a mortal man how inconsistent how improbable that he should have tendencies to evil in him as well as tendencies to good ah i see you dont like this it would be infinitely more agreeable wouldnt it if lord harry was one of the entirely consistent characters which are sometimes presented in works of fiction our good english readers are charmed with the man the woman or the child who is introduced to them by the kind novelist as a being without faults do they stop to consider whether this is a true picture of humanity it would be a terrible day for the book if they ever did that but the book is in no danger the readers would even fail to discover the falseness of the picture if they were presented to themselves as perfect characters we mustnt say so but how wonderfully like us there would be the only impression produced i am not trying to dishearten you i want to encourage you to look at humanity from a wider and truer point of view do not be too readily depressed if you find your faith shaken in a person whom you have hitherto believed to be good that person has been led into temptation wait till time shows you that the evil influence is not everlasting and that the good influence will inconsistently renew your faith out of the very depths of your despair humanity in general is neither perfectly good nor perfectly wicked take it as you find it is this a hard lesson to learn well its easy to do what other people do under similar circumstances listen to the unwelcome truth today my dear and forget it tomorrow  they parted at the door of the inn    chapter v  the game mountjoy plays a new card  mr vimpany of the college of surgeons was a burly man heavily built from head to foot his bold round eyes looked straight at his fellowcreatures with an expression of impudent good humour his whiskers were bushy his hands were big his lips were thick his legs were solid add to this a broad sunburnt face and a grey coat with wide tails a waistcoat with a check pattern and leather ridinggaitersand no stranger could have failed to mistake mr vimpany for a farmer of the old school he was proud of the false impression that he created nature built me to be a farmer he used to say but my poor foolish old mother was a lady by birth and she insisted on her son being a professional man i hadnt brains for the law or money for the army or morals for the church and here i am a country doctorthe one representative of slavery left in the nineteenth century you may not believe me but i never see a labourer at the plough that i dont envy him  this was the husband of the elegant lady with the elaborate manners this was the man who received mountjoy with a glad to see you sir and a shake of the hand that hurt him  coarse fare said mr vimpany carving a big joint of beef but i cant afford anything better only a pudding to follow and a glass of glorious old sherry miss henley is good enough to excuse itand my wifes used to itand you will put up with it mr mountjoy if you are half as amiable as you look im an oldfashioned man the pleasure of a glass of wine with you sir  hughs first experience of the glorious old sherry led him to a discovery which proved to be more important than he was disposed to consider it at the moment he merely observed with some amusement that mr vimpany smacked his lips in hearty approval of the worst sherry that his guest had ever tasted here plainly selfbetrayed was a medical man who was an exception to a general rule in the professionhere was a doctor ignorant of the difference between good wine and bad  both the ladies were anxious to know how mountjoy had passed the night at the inn he had only time to say that there was nothing to complain of when mr vimpany burst into an explosion of laughter  oh but you must have had something to complain of said the big doctor i would bet a hundred if i could afford it that the landlady tried to poison you with her sour french wine  do you speak of the claret at the inn after having tasted it mountjoy asked  what do you take me for cried mr vimpany after all i have heard of that claret i am not fool enough to try it myself i can tell you mountjoy received this answer in silence the doctors ignorance and the doctors prejudice in the matter of wine had started a new train of thought in hughs mind which threatened serious consequences to mr vimpany himself there was a pause at the table nobody spoke the doctor saw condemnation of his rudeness expressed in his wifes face he made a rough apology to mountjoy who was still preoccupied no offence i hope its in the nature of me sir to speak my mind if i could fawn and flatter i should have got on better in my profession im what they call a rough diamond no offence i say  none whatever mr vimpany  thats right try another glass of sherry  mountjoy took the sherry  iris looked at him lost in surprise it was unlike hugh to be interested in a strangers opinion of wine it was unlike him to drink wine which was evidently not to his taste and it was especially unlike his customary courtesy to let himself fall into thought at dinnertime when there were other persons at the table was he ill impossible to look at him and not see that he was in perfect health what did it mean  finding mountjoy inattentive mr vimpany addressed himself to iris  i had to ride hard miss henley to get home in time for dinner there are patients i must tell you who send for the doctor and then seem to think they know more about it than the very man whom they have called in to cure them it isnt he who tells them what their illness is its they who tell him they dispute about the medical treatment thats best for them and the one thing they are never tired of doing is talking about their symptoms it was an old mans gabble that kept me late today however the squire as they call him in these parts is a patient with a long purse i am obliged to submit  a gentleman of the old school dear miss henley mrs vimpany explained immensely rich is he better she asked turning to her husband  better cried the outspoken doctor pooh theres nothing the matter with him but gluttony he went to london and consulted a great man a humbug with a handle to his name the famous physician got rid of him in no timesent him abroad to boil himself in foreign baths he came home again worse than ever and consulted poor me i found him at dinnera perfect feast i give you my word of honourand the old fool gorging himself till he was black in the face his wine i should have said was not up to the mark wanted body and flavour you know ah mr mountjoy this seems to interest you reminds you of the landladys wineeh well sir how do you think i treated the squire emptied his infirm old inside with an emeticand there he was on his legs again whenever he overeats himself he sends for me and pays liberally i ought to be grateful to him and i am upon my soul i believe i should be in the bankruptcy court but for the squires stomach look at my wife shes shocked at me we ought to keep up appearances my dear not i when i am poor i say i am poor when i cure a patient i make no mystery of it everybodys welcome to know how its done dont be downhearted arabella nature never meant your husband for a doctor and theres the long and the short of it another glass of sherry mr mountjoy  all social ceremoniesincluding the curious english custom which sends the ladies upstairs after dinner and leaves the gentlemen at the tablefound a devoted adherent in mrs vimpany she rose as if she had been presiding at a banquet and led miss henley affectionately to the drawingroom iris glanced at hugh no his mind was not at ease yet the preoccupied look had not left his face  jovial mr vimpany pushed the bottle across the table to his guest and held out a handful of big black cigars  now for the juice of the grape he cried and the best cigar in all england  he had just filled his glass and struck a light for his cigar when the servant came in with a note some men relieve their sense of indignation in one way and some in another the doctors form of relief was an oath talk about slavery he shouted find me such a slave in all africa as a man in my profession there isnt an hour of the day or night that he can call his own heres a stupid old woman with an asthma who has got another spasmodic attackand i must leave my dinnertable and my friend just as we are enjoying ourselves i have half a mind not to go  the inattentive guest suddenly set himself right in his hosts estimation hugh remonstrated with an appearance of interest in the case which the doctor interpreted as a compliment to himself oh mr vimpany humanity humanity  oh mr mountjoy money money the facetious doctor answered the old lady is our mayors mother sir you dont seem to be quick at taking a joke make your mind easy i shall pocket my fee  as soon as he had closed the door hugh mountjoy uttered a devout ejaculation thank god he saidand walked up and down the room free to think without interruption at last  the subject of his meditations was the influence of intoxication in disclosing the hidden weaknesses and vices of a mans character by exhibiting them just as they are released from the restraint which he exercises over himself when he is sober that there was a weak side and probably a vicious side in mr vimpanys nature it was hardly possible to doubt his blustering good humour his audacious selfconceit the tones of his voice the expression in his eyes all revealed him to use one expressive word as a humbug let drink subtly deprive him of his capacity for selfconcealment and the true nature of his wifes association with lord harry might sooner or later show itselfsay in afterdinner talk under skilful management the right method of entrapping him into a state of intoxication which might have presented serious difficulties under other circumstances was suggested partly by his ignorance of the difference between good wine and bad and partly by mountjoys knowledge of the excellent quality of the landladys claret he had recognised as soon as he tasted it that finest vintage of bordeaux which conceals its true strengthto a gross and ignorant tasteunder the exquisite delicacy of its flavour encourage mr vimpany by means of a dinner at the inn to give his opinion as a man whose judgment in claret was to be seriously consultedand permit him also to discover that hugh was rich enough to have been able to buy the wineand the attainment of the end in view would be simply a question of time there was certainly the chance to be reckoned with that his thick head might prove to be too strong for the success of the experiment mountjoy determined to try it and did try it nevertheless  mr vimpany returned from his medical errand thoroughly well satisfied with himself  the mayors mother has reason to thank you sir he announced if you hadnt hurried me away the wretched old creature would have been choked a regular standup fight by jupiter between death and the doctorand the doctor has won give me the reward of merit pass the bottle  he took up the decanter and looked at it  why what have you been about he asked i made up my mind that i should want the key of the cellar when i came back and i dont believe you have drunk a drop in my absence what does it mean  it means that i am not worthy of your sherry mountjoy answered the spanish wines are too strong for my weak digestion  mr vimpany burst into one of his explosions of laughter you miss the landladys vinegareh  yes i do wait a minute doctor i have a word to say on my sideand like you i mean what i say the landladys vinegar is some of the finest chateau margaux i have ever met withthrown away on ignorant people who are quite unworthy of it  the doctors natural insolence showed itself you have bought this wonderful wine of course he said satirically  that mountjoy answered is just what i have done  for once in his life mr vimpanys selfsufficient readiness of speech failed him he stared at his guest in dumb amazement on this occasion mountjoy improved the opportunity to good purpose mr vimpany accepted with the utmost readiness an invitation to dine on the next day at the inn but he made a condition in case i dont agree with you about that chateauwhatyoucallit he said you wont mind my sending home for a bottle of sherry  the next event of the day was a visit to the most interesting monument of antiquity in the town in the absence of the doctor caused by professional engagements miss henley took mountjoy to see the old churchand mrs vimpany accompanied them as a mark of respect to miss henleys friend  when there was a chance of being able to speak confidentially iris was eager in praising the doctors wife you cant imagine hugh how agreeable she has been and how entirely she has convinced me that i was wrong shamefully wrong in thinking of her as i did she sees that you dislike her and yet she speaks so nicely of you your clever friend enjoys your society she said pray accompany me when i take him to see the church how unselfish  mountjoy kept his own counsel the generous impulses which sometimes led iris astray were as he well knew beyond the reach of remonstrance his own opinion of mrs vimpany still pronounced steadily against her prepared for discoveries on the next day which might prove too serious to be trifled with he now did his best to provide for future emergencies  after first satisfying himself that there was nothing in the present state of the maids health which need detain her mistress at honeybuzzard he next completed his preparations by returning to the inn and writing to mr henley with strict regard to truth his letter presented the daughters claim on the father under a new point of view whatever the end of it might be mr henley was requested to communicate his intentions by telegraph will you receive iris was the question submitted the answer expected was yes or no    chapter vi  the game mountjoy wins  mr henleys telegram arrived at the inn the next morning  he was willing to receive his daughter but not unreservedly the message was characteristic of the man yeson trial mountjoy was not shocked was not even surprised he knew that the successful speculations by means of which mr henley had accumulated his wealth had raised against him enemies who had spread scandalous reports which had never been completely refuted the silent secession of friends in whose fidelity he trusted had hardened the mans heart and embittered his nature strangers in distress who appealed to the rich retired merchant for help found in their excellent references to character the worst form of persuasion that they could have adopted paupers without a rag of reputation left to cover them were the objects of charity whom mr henley relieved when he was asked to justify his conduct he said i have a sympathy with bad charactersi am one of them myself  with the arrival of the dinner hour the doctor appeared in no very amiable humour at the inn  another hard days work he said i should sink under it if i hadnt a prospect of getting rid of my practice here londonor the neighbourhood of londontheres the right place for a man like me well wheres the wonderful wine mind im tomtelltruth if i dont like your french tipple i shall say so  the inn possessed no claret glasses they drank the grand wine in tumblers as if it had been vin ordinaire  mr vimpany showed that he was acquainted with the formalities proper to the ceremony of tasting he filled his makeshift glass he held it up to the light and looked at the wine severely he moved the tumbler to and fro under his nose and smelt at it again and again he paused and reflected he tasted the claret as cautiously as if he feared it might be poisoned he smacked his lips and emptied his glass at a draught lastly he showed some consideration for his hosts anxiety and pronounced sentence on the wine  not so good as you think it sir but nice light claret clean and wholesome i hope you havent given too much for it  thus far hugh had played a losing game patiently his reward had come at last after what the doctor had just said to him he saw the winning card safe in his own hand  the bad dinner was soon over no soup of course fish in the state of preservation usually presented by a decayed country town steak that rivalled the toughness of indiarubber potatoes whose aspect said stranger dont eat us pudding that would have produced a sense of discouragement even in the mind of a child and the famous english cheese which comes to us oddly enough from the united states and stings us vindictively when we put it into our mouths but the wine the glorious wine would have made amends to anybody but mr vimpany for the woeful deficiencies of the food tumblerfull after tumblerfull of that noble vintage poured down his thirsty and ignorant throat and still he persisted in declaring that it was nice light stuff and still he unforgivingly bore in mind the badness of the dinner  the feeding here said this candid man is worse if possible than the feeding at sea when i served as doctor on board a passengersteamer shall i tell you how i lost my place oh say so plainly if you dont think my little anecdote worth listening to  my dear sir i am waiting to hear it  very good no offence i hope thats right well sir the captain of the ship complained of me to the owners i wouldnt go round every morning and knock at the ladies cabindoors and ask how they felt after a seasick night who doesnt know what they feel without knocking at their doors let them send for the doctor when they want him that was how i understood my duty and there was the line of conduct that lost me my place pass the wine talking of ladies what do you think of my wife did you ever see such distinguished manners before my dear fellow i have taken a fancy to you shake hands ill tell you another little anecdote where do you think my wife picked up her fashionable airs and graces ho ho on the stage the highest branch of the profession sira tragic actress if you had seen her in lady macbeth mrs vimpany would have made your flesh creep look at me and feast your eyes on a man who is above hypocritical objections to the theatre havent i proved it by marrying an actress but we dont mention it here the savages in this beastly place wouldnt employ me if they knew i had married a stageplayer hullo the bottles empty again ha heres another bottle full i love a man who has always got a full bottle to offer his friend shake hands i say mountjoy tell me on your sacred word of honour can you keep a secret my wifes secret sir stop let me look at you again i thought i saw you smile if a man smiles at me when i am opening my whole heart to him by the living jingo i would knock that man down at his own table what you didnt smile i apologise your hand again i drink your health in your own good wine where was i what was i talking about  mountjoy carefully humoured his interesting guest  you were about to honour me he said by taking me into your confidence mr vimpany stared in tipsy bewilderment mountjoy tried again in plainer language you were going to tell me a secret  this time the doctor grasped the idea he looked round cunningly to the door any eavesdroppers he asked hush whisperthis is seriouswhisper what was it i was going to tell you what was the secret old boy  mountjoy answered a little too readily i think it related to mrs vimpany  mrs vimpanys husband threw himself back in his chair snatched a dirty handkerchief out of his pocket and began to cry  heres a false friend the creature whimpered asks me to dinner and takes advantage of my dependent situation to insult my wife the loveliest of women the sweetest of women the innocentest of women oh my wife my wife he suddenly threw his handkerchief to the other end of the room and burst out laughing ho ho mountjoy what an infernal fool you must be to take me seriously i can act too do you think i care about my wife she was a fine woman once shes a bundle of old rags now but she has her merits hush i want to know something have you got a lord among your circle of acquaintance  experience made mountjoy more careful perhaps a little too careful he only said yes  the doctors dignity asserted itself thats a short answer sir to a man in my position if you want me to believe you mention your friends name  here was a chance at last his name mountjoy began is lord harry  mr vimpany lost his dignity in an instant he struck his heavy fist on the table with a blow that made the tumblers jump  coincidence he cried how wonderfulno thats not the wordprovidential is the wordhow providential are coincidences i mean of course to a rightly constituted mind let nobody contradict me when i say a rightly constituted mind i speak seriously and a young man like you will be all the better for it mountjoy dear mountjoy jolly mountjoy my wifes lord is your lordlord harry no none of your nonsensei wont have any more wine yes i will it might hurt your feelings if i didnt drink with you pass the bottle ha thats a nice ring youve got on your finger perhaps you think it valuable its nothing sir its dross its dirt compared to my wifes diamond pin theres a jewel if you like it will be worth a fortune to us when we sell it a gift dear sir im afraid ive been too familiar with you speaking as a born gentleman i beg to present my respects and i call you dear sir did i tell you the diamond pin was a gift its nothing of the sort we are under no obligation my wife my admirable wife has earned that diamond pin by registered post and what i call a manly letter from lord harry he is deeply obliged i give you the sense of it by what my wife has done for him ready money is scarce with my lord he sends a family jewel with his love oh im not jealous hes welcome to love mrs vimpany in her old age if he likes did you say that sir did you say that lord harry or any man was welcome to love mrs vimpany i have a great mind to throw this bottle at your head no i wont its wasting good wine how kind of you to give me good wine who are you i dont like dining with a stranger do you know any friend of mine do you know a man named mountjoy do you know two men named mountjoy no you dont one of them is dead killed by those murdering scoundrels what do you call them eh what the doctors voice began to falter his head dropped he slumbered suddenly and woke suddenly and began talking again suddenly would you like to be made acquainted with lord harry ill give you a sketch of his character before i introduce him between ourselves hes a desperate wretch do you know why he employed my wife my admirable wife you will agree with me he ought to have looked after his young woman himself weve got his young woman safe in our house a nice girl not my style my medical knowledge certifies shes coldblooded lord harry has only to come over here and find her why the devil doesnt he come what is it keeps him in ireland do you know i seem to have forgotten my own belief is ive got softening of the brain whats good for softening of the brain there isnt a doctor living who wont tell you the right remedywine pass the wine if this claret is worth a farthing its worth a guinea a bottle i ask you in confidence did you ever hear of such a fool as my wifes lord his name escapes me no matter he stops in irelandhunting hunting what the fox nothing so noble hunting assassins hes got some grudge against one of them means to kill one of them a word in your ear theyll kill him do you ever bet five to one hes a dead man before the end of the week when is the end of the week tuesday wednesdayno saturdaythats the beginning of the weekno it isntthe beginning of the week isnt the sabbathsunday of coursewe are not christians we are jewsi mean we are jews we are not christiansi mean  the claret got the better of his tongue at last he mumbled and muttered he sank back in his chair he chuckled he hiccupped he fell asleep  all and more than all that mountjoy feared he had now discovered in a state of sobriety the doctor was probably one of those men who are always ready to lie in a state of intoxication the utterances of his drunken delirium might unconsciously betray the truth the reason which he had given for lord harrys continued absence in ireland could not be wisely rejected as unworthy of belief it was in the reckless nature of the wild lord to put his own life in peril in the hope of revenging arthur mountjoy on the wretch who had killed him taking this bad news for granted was there any need to distress iris by communicating the motive which detained lord harry in his own country surely not  and again was there any immediate advantage to be gained by revealing the true character of mrs vimpany as a spy and worse still a spy who was paid in her present state of feeling iris would in all probability refuse to believe it  arriving at these conclusions hugh looked at the doctor snoring and choking in an easychair he had not wasted the time and patience devoted to the stratagem which had now successfully reached its end after what he had just heardthanks to the clarethe could not hesitate to accomplish the speedy removal of iris from mr vimpanys house using her fathers telegram as the only means of persuasion on which it was possible to rely mountjoy left the inn without ceremony and hurried away to iris in the hope of inducing her to return to london with him that night    chapter vii  doctoring the doctor  asking for miss henley at the doctors door hugh was informed that she had gone out with her invalid maid for a walk she had left word if mr mountjoy called in her absence to beg that he would kindly wait for her return  on his way up to the drawingroom mountjoy heard mrs vimpanys sonorous voice occupied as he supposed in reading aloud the door being opened for him he surprised her striding up and down the room with a book in her hand grandly declaiming without anybody to applaud her after what hugh had already heard he could only conclude that reminiscences of her theatrical career had tempted the solitary actress to make a private appearance for her own pleasure in one of those tragic characters to which her husband had alluded she recovered her selfpossession on mountjoys appearance with the ease of a mistress of her art pardon me she said holding up her book with one hand and tapping it indicatively with the other shakespeare carries me out of myself a spark of the poets fire burns in the poets humble servant may i hope that i have made myself understood you look as if you had a fellowfeeling for me  mountjoy did his best to fill the sympathetic part assigned to him and only succeeded in showing what a bad actor he would have been if he had gone on the stage under the sedative influence thus administered mrs vimpany put away her book and descended at once from the highest poetry to the lowest prose  let us return to domestic events she said indulgently have the people at the inn given you a good dinner  the people did their best mountjoy answered cautiously  has my husband returned with you mrs vimpany went on  mountjoy began to regret that he had not waited for iris in the street he was obliged to acknowledge that the doctor had not returned with him  where is mr vimpany  at the inn  what is he doing there  mountjoy hesitated mrs vimpany rose again into the regions of tragic poetry she stepped up to him as if he had been macbeth and she was ready to use the daggers i understand but too well she declared in terrible tones my wretched husbands vices are known to me mr vimpany is intoxicated  hugh tried to make the best of it only asleep he said mrs vimpany looked at him once more this time it was queen katharine looking at cardinal wolsey she bowed with lofty courtesy and opened the door i have occasion she said to go outand made an exit  five minutes later mountjoy standing at the window impatiently on the watch for the return of iris saw mrs vimpany in the street she entered a chemists shop on the opposite side of the way and came out again with a bottle in her hand it was enclosed in the customary medical wrapping of white paper majestically she passed out of sight if hugh had followed her he would have traced the doctors wife to the door of the inn  the unemployed waiter was on the housesteps looking about himwith nothing to see he made his bow to mrs vimpany and informed her that the landlady had gone out  you will do as well was the reply is mr vimpany here  the waiter smiled and led the way through the passage to the foot of the stairs you can hear him maam it was quite true mr vimpanys snoring answered for mr vimpany his wife ascended the first two or three stairs and stopped to speak again to the waiter she asked what the two gentlemen had taken to drink with their dinner they had taken the french wine  and nothing else  the waiter ventured on a little joke nothing else he saidand more than enough of it too  not more than enough i suppose for the good of the house mrs vimpany remarked  i beg your pardon maam the claret the two gentlemen drank is not charged for in the bill  what do you mean  the waiter explained that mr mountjoy had purchased the whole stock of the wine suspicion as well as surprise appeared in mrs vimpanys face she had hitherto thought it likely that miss henleys gentlemanlike friend might be secretly in love with the young lady her doubts of him now took a wider range of distrust she went on up the stairs by herself and banged the door of the private room as the easiest means of waking the sleeping man to the utmost noise that she could make in this way he was perfectly impenetrable for a while she waited looking at him across the table with unutterable contempt  there was the man to whom the religion of the land and the law of the land acting together in perfect harmony had fettered her for life some women in her position might have wasted time in useless selfreproach mrs vimpany reviewed her miserable married life with the finest mockery of her own misfortune virtue she said to herself is its own reward  glancing with careless curiosity at the disorder of the dinnertable she noticed some wine still left in the bottom of her husbands glass had artificial means been used to reduce him to his present condition she tasted the claret no there was nothing in the flavour of it which betrayed that he had been drugged if the waiter was to be believed he had only drunk claretand there he was in a state of helpless stupefaction nevertheless  she looked again at the dinnertable and discovered one among the many empty bottles with some wine still left in it after a moment of reflection she took a clean tumbler from the sideboard  here was the wine which had been an object of derision to mr vimpany and his friends they were gross feeders and drinkers and it might not be amiss to put their opinions to the test she was not searching for the taste of a drug now her present experiment proposed to try the wine on its own merits  at the time of her triumphs on the country stagebefore the date of her unlucky marriagerich admirers had entertained the handsome actress at suppers which offered every luxury that the most perfect table could supply experience had made her acquainted with the flavour of the finest claretand that experience was renewed by the claret which she was now tasting it was easy to understand why mr mountjoy had purchased the wine and after a little thinking his motive for inviting mr vimpany to dinner seemed to be equally plain foiled in their first attempt at discovery by her own prudence and tact his suspicions had set their trap her gross husband had been tempted to drink and to talk at random for mr mountjoys benefit in a state of intoxication  what secrets might the helpless wretch not have betrayed before the wine had completely stupefied him  urged by rage and fear she shook him furiously he woke he glared at her with bloodshot eyes he threatened her with his clenched fist there was but one way of lifting his purblind stupidity to the light she appealed to his experience of himself on many a former occasion you fool you have been drinking againand theres a patient waiting for you to that dilemma he was accustomed the statement of it partially roused him mrs vimpany tore off the paper wrapping and opened the medicinebottle which she had brought with her  he stared at it he muttered to himself is she going to poison me she seized his head with one hand and held the open bottle to his nose your own prescription she cried for yourself and your hateful friends  his nose told him what words might have tried vainly to say he swallowed the mixture if i lose the patient he muttered oracularly i lose the money his resolute wife dragged him out of his chair the second door in the diningroom led into an empty bedchamber with her help he got into the room and dropped on the bed  mrs vimpany consulted her watch  on many a former occasion she had learnt what interval of repose was required before the sobering influence of the mixture could successfully assert itself for the present she had only to return to the other room the waiter presented himself asking if there was anything he could do for her familiar with the defective side of her husbands character he understood what it meant when she pointed to the bedroom door the old story maam he said with an air of respectful sympathy can i get you a cup of tea  mrs vimpany accepted the tea and enjoyed it thoughtfully  she had two objects in viewto be revenged on mountjoy and to find a way of forcing him to leave the town before he could communicate his discoveries to iris how to reach these separate ends by one and the same means was still the problem which she was trying to solve when the doctors coarse voice was audible calling for somebody to come to him  if his head was only clear enough by this time to understand the questions which she meant to put his answers might suggest the idea of which she was in search rising with alacrity mrs vimpany returned to the bedchamber  you miserable creature she began are you sober now  im as sober as you are  do you know she went on why mr mountjoy asked you to dine with him  because hes my friend  he is your worst enemy hold your tongue ill explain what i mean directly rouse your memory if you have got a memory left i want to know what you and mr mountjoy talked about after dinner  he stared at her helplessly she tried to find her way to his recollection by making suggestive inquiries it was useless he only complained of being thirsty his wife lost her selfcontrol she was too furiously angry with him to be able to remain in the room recovering her composure when she was alone she sent for sodawater and brandy her one chance of making him useful was to humour his vile temper she waited on him herself  in some degree the drink cleared his muddled head mrs vimpany tried his memory once more had he said this had he said that yes he thought it likely had he or had mr mountjoy mentioned lord harrys name a glimmer of intelligence showed itself in his stupid eyes yesand they had quarrelled about it he rather thought he had thrown a bottle at mr mountjoys head had they either of them said anything about miss henley oh of course what was it he was unable to remember had his wife done bothering him now  not quite she replied try to understand what i am going to say to you if lord harry comes to us while miss henley is in our house  he interrupted her thats your business  wait a little its my business if i hear beforehand that his lordship is coming but he is quite reckless enough to take us by surprise in that case i want you to make yourself useful if you happen to be at home keep him from seeing miss henley until i have seen her first  why  i want an opportunity my dear of telling miss henley that i have been wicked enough to deceive her before she finds it out for herself i may hope she will forgive me if i confess everything  the doctor laughed what the devil does it matter whether she forgives you or not  it matters a great deal  why you talk as if you were fond of her  i am  the doctors clouded intelligence was beginning to clear he made a smart reply fond of her and deceiving heraha  yes she said quietly thats just what it is it has grown on me little by little i cant help liking miss henley  well mr vimpany remarked you are a fool he looked at her cunningly suppose i do make myself useful what am i to gain by it  let us get back she suggested to the gentleman who invited you to dinner and made you tipsy for his own purposes  ill break every bone in his skin  dont talk nonsense leave mr mountjoy to me  do you take his part i can tell you this if i drank too much of that poisonous french stuff mountjoy set me the example he was tipsyas you call itshamefully tipsy i give you my word of honour whats the matter now  his wife so impenetrably cool thus far had suddenly become excited there was not the smallest fragment of truth in what he had just said of hugh and mrs vimpany was not for a moment deceived by it but the lie had accidentally one meritit suggested to her the idea which she had vainly tried to find over her cup of tea suppose i show you how you may be revenged on mr mountjoy she said  well  will you remember what i asked you to do for me if lord harry takes us by surprise  he produced his pocketdiary and told her to make a memorandum of it she wrote as briefly as if she had been writing a telegram keep lord harry from seeing miss henley till i have seen her first  now she said taking a chair by the bedside you shall know what a clever wife you have got listen to me    chapter viii  her fathers message  looking out of the drawingroom window for the tenth time at least mountjoy at last saw iris in the street returning to the house  she brought the maid with her into the drawingroom in the gayest of good spirits and presented rhoda to mountjoy  what a blessing a good long walk is if we only knew it she exclaimed look at my little maids colour who would suppose that she came here with heavy eyes and pale cheeks except that she loses her way in the town whenever she goes out alone we have every reason to congratulate ourselves on our residence at honeybuzzard the doctor is rhodas good genius and the doctors wife is her fairy godmother  mountjoys courtesy having offered the customary congratulations the maid was permitted to retire and iris was free to express her astonishment at the friendly relations established by means of the dinnertable between the two most dissimilar men on the face of creation  there is something overwhelming she declared in the bare idea of your having asked him to dine with youon such a short acquaintance and being such a man i should like to have peeped in and seen you entertaining your guest with the luxuries of the hotel larder seriously hugh your social sympathies have taken a range for which i was not prepared after the example that you have set me i feel ashamed of having doubted whether mr vimpany was worthy of his charming wife dont suppose that i am ungrateful to the doctor he has found his way to my regard after what he has done for rhoda i only fail to understand how he has possessed himself of your sympathies  so she ran on enjoying the exercise of her own sense of humour in innocent ignorance of the serious interests which she was deriding  mountjoy tried to stop her and tried in vain  no no she persisted as mischievously as ever the subject is too interesting to be dismissed i am dying to know how you and your guest got through the dinner did he take more wine than was good for him and when he forgot his good manners did he set it all right again by saying no offence and passing the bottle  hugh could endure it no longer pray control your high spirits for a moment he said i have news for you from home  those words put an end to her outbreak of gaiety in an instant  news from my father she asked  yes  is he coming here  no i have heard from him  a letter  a telegram mountjoy explained in answer to a letter from me i did my best to press your claims on him and i am glad to say i have not failed  hugh dear hugh have you succeeded in reconciling us  mountjoy produced the telegram i asked mr henley he said to let me know at once whether he would receive you and to answer plainly yes or no the message might have been more kindly expressedbut at any rate it is a favourable reply  iris read the telegram is there another father in the world she said sadly who would tell his daughter when she asks to come home that he will receive her on trial  surely you are not offended with him iris  she shook her head i am like you she said i know him too well to be offended he shall find me dutiful he shall find me patient i am afraid i must not expect you to wait for me in honeybuzzard will you tell my father that i hope to return to him in a weeks time  pardon me iris i see no reason why you should waste a week in this town on the contrary the more eager you show yourself to return to your father the more likely you are to recover your place in his estimation i had planned to take you home by the next train  iris looked at him in astonishment is it possible that you mean what you say she asked  my dear i do most assuredly mean what i say why should you hesitate what possible reason can there be for staying here any longer  oh hugh how you disappoint me what has become of your kind feeling your sense of justice your consideration for others poor mrs vimpany  what has mrs vimpany to do with it  iris was indignant  what has mrs vimpany to do with it she repeated after all that i owe to that good creatures kindness after i have promised to accompany hershe has so few happy days poor soulon excursions to places of interest in the neighbourhood do you expect me to leave herno its worse than thatdo you expect me to throw her aside like an old dress that i have worn out and this after i have so unjustly so ungratefully suspected her in my own thoughts shameful shameful  with some difficulty mountjoy controlled himself after what she had just said his lips were sealed on the subject of mrs vimpanys true character he could only persist in appealing to her duty to her father  you are allowing your quick temper to carry you to strange extremities he answered if i think it of more importance to hasten a reconciliation with your father than to encourage you to make excursions with a lady whom you have only known for a week or two what have i done to deserve such an outbreak of anger hush not a word more now here is the lady herself  as he spoke mrs vimpany joined them returning from her interview with her husband at the inn she looked first at iris and at once perceived signs of disturbance in the young ladys face  concealing her anxiety under that wonderful stage smile which affords a refuge to so many secrets mrs vimpany said a few words excusing her absence miss henley answered without the slightest change in her friendly manner to the doctors wife the signs of disturbance were evidently attributable to some entirely unimportant cause from mrs vimpanys point of view mr mountjoys discoveries had not been communicated yet  in hughs state of mind there was some irritating influence in the presence of the mistress of the house which applied the spur to his wits he mischievously proposed submitting to her the question in dispute between iris and himself  it is a very simple matter he said to mrs vimpany miss henleys father is anxious that she should return to him after an estrangement between them which is happily at an end do you think she ought to allow any accidental engagements to prevent her from going home at once if she requests your indulgence under the circumstances has she any reason to anticipate a refusal  mrs vimpanys expressive eyes looked up with saintly resignation at the dirty ceilingand asked in dumb show what she had done to deserve the injury implied by a doubt  mr mountjoy she said sternly you insult me by asking the questiondear miss henley she continued turning to iris you will do me justice i am sure am i capable of allowing my own feelings to stand in the way when your filial duty is concerned leave me my sweet friend go i entreat you go home  she retired up the stageno no she withdrew to the other end of the roomand burst into the most becoming of all human tears theatrical tears impulsive iris hastened to comfort the personification of selfsacrifice the model of all that was most unselfish in female submission for shame for shame she whispered as she passed mountjoy  beaten again by mrs vimpanywith no ties of relationship to justify resistance to miss henley with two women against him entrenched behind the privileges of their sexthe one last sacrifice of his own feelings in the interests of iris that hugh could make was to control the impulse which naturally urged him to leave the house in the helpless position in which he had now placed himself he could only wait to see what course mrs vimpany might think it desirable to take would she request him in her most politely malicious way to bring his visit to an end no she looked at himhesitateddirected a furtive glance towards the view of the street from the windowsmiled mysteriouslyand completed the sacrifice of her own feelings in these words  dear miss henley let me help you to pack up  iris positively refused  no she said i dont agree with mr mountjoy my father leaves it to me to name the day when we meet i hold you my dear to our engagementi dont leave an affectionate friend as i might leave a stranger  even if mr mountjoy communicated his discoveries to miss henley on the way home there would be no danger now of her believing him mrs vimpany put her powerful arm round the generous iris and with infinite grace thanked her by a kiss  your kindness will make my lonely lot in life harder than ever to bear she murmured when you are gone  but we may hope to meet in london iris reminded her unless mr vimpany alters his mind about leaving this place  my husband will not do that dear he is determined to try his luck as he says in london in the meantime you will give me your address wont you perhaps you will even promise to write to me  iris instantly gave her promise and wrote down her address in london  mountjoy made no attempt to interfere it was needless  if the maid had not fallen ill on the journey and if mrs vimpany had followed miss henley to london there would have been little to fear in the discovery of her addressand there was little to fear now the danger to iris was not in what might happen while she was living under her fathers roof but in what might happen if she was detained by plans for excursions in mr vimpanys house until lord harry might join her there  rather than permit this to happen hugh in sheer desperation meditated charging mrs vimpany to her face with being the irish lords spy and proving the accusation by challenging her to produce the registered letter and the diamond pin  while he was still struggling with his own reluctance to inflict this degrading exposure on a woman the talk between the two ladies came to an end mrs vimpany returned again to the window on this occasion she looked out into the streetwith her handkerchief was it used as a signal exhibited in her hand iris on her side advanced to mountjoy easily moved to anger her nature was incapable of sullen perseverance in a state of enmity to see hugh still patiently waitingstill risking the chances of insultdevoted to her and forgiving herwas at once a reproach that punished iris and a mute appeal that no true womans heart could resist  with tears in her eyes she said to him there must be no coolness between you and me i lost my temper and spoke shamefully to you my dear i am indeed sorry for it you are never hard on meyou wont be hard on me now  she offered her hand to him he had just raised it to his lipswhen the drawingroom door was roughly opened they both looked round  the man of all others whom hugh least desired to see was the man who now entered the room the victim of light claretprivately directed to lurk in the street until he saw a handkerchief fluttering at the windowhad returned to the house primed with his clever wifes instructions ready and eager to be even with mountjoy for the dinner at the inn    chapter ix  mr vimpany on intoxication  there was no unsteadiness in the doctors walk and no flush on his face he certainly did strut when he entered the room and he held up his head with dignity when he discovered mountjoy but he seemed to preserve his selfcontrol was the man sober again already  his wife approached him with her set smile the appearance of her lord and master filled mrs vimpany with perfectlyassumed emotions of agreeable surprise  this is an unexpected pleasure she said you seldom favour us with your company my dear so early in the evening are there fewer patients in want of your advice than usual  you are mistaken arabella i am here in the performance of a painful duty  the doctors language and the doctors manner presented him to iris in a character that was new to her what effect had he produced on mrs vimpany that excellent friend to travellers in distress lowered her eyes to the floor and modestly preserved silence mr vimpany proceeded to the performance of his duty his painful responsibility seemed to strike him at first from a medical point of view  if there is a poison which undermines the sources of life he remarked it is alcohol if there is a vice that degrades humanity it is intoxication mr mountjoy are you aware that i am looking at you  impossible not to be aware of that hugh answered may i ask why you are looking at me it was not easy to listen gravely to mr vimpanys denunciation of intemperance after what had taken place at the dinner of that day hugh smiled the moral majesty of the doctor entered its protest  this is really shameful he said the least you can do is to take it seriously  what is it mountjoy asked and why am i to take it seriously  mr vimpanys reply was to say the least of it indirect if such an expression may be permitted it smelt of the stage viewed in connection with mrs vimpanys persistent assumption of silent humility it suggested to mountjoy a secret understanding of some kind between husband and wife  what has become of your conscience sir mr vimpany demanded is that silent monitor dead within you after giving me a bad dinner do you demand an explanation ha you shall have it  having delivered himself to this effect he added action to words walking grandly to the door he threw it open and saluted mountjoy with an ironical bow iris observed that act of insolence her colour rose her eyes glittered do you see what he has just done she said to mrs vimpany  the doctors wife answered softly i dont understand it after a glance at her husband she took iris by the hand dear miss henley shall we retire to my room  iris drew her hand away not unless mr mountjoy wishes it she said  certainly not hugh declared pray remain here your presence will help me to keep my temper he stepped up to mr vimpany have you any particular reason for opening that door he asked  the doctor was a rascal but to do him justice he was no coward yes he said i have a reason  what is it if you please  christian forbearance mr vimpany answered  forbearance towards me mountjoy continued  the doctors dignity suddenly deserted him  aha my boy you have got it at last he cried its pleasant to understand each other isnt it you see im a plainspoken fellow i dont wish to give offence if theres one thing more than another i pride myself on its my indulgence for human frailty but in my position here im obliged to be careful upon my soul i cant continue my acquaintance with a man whooh come come dont look as if you didnt understand me the circumstances are against you sir you have treated me infamously  under what circumstances have i treated you infamously hugh asked  under pretence of giving me a dinner mr vimpany shoutedthe worst dinner i ever sat down to  his wife signed to him to be silent he took no notice of her she insisted on being understood say no more she warned him in a tone of command  the brute side of his nature roused by mountjoys contemptuous composure was forcing its way outwards he set his wife at defiance  then dont let him look at me as if he thought i was in a state of intoxication cried the furious doctor theres the man miss who tried to make me tipsy he went on actually addressing himself to iris thanks to my habits of sobriety he has been caught in his own trap hes intoxicated ha friend mountjoy have you got the right explanation at last theres the door sir  mrs vimpany felt that this outrage was beyond endurance if something was not done to atone for it miss henley would be capableher face at that moment answered for herof leaving the house with mr mountjoy mrs vimpany seized her husband indignantly by the arm  you brute you have spoilt everything she said to him apologise directly to mr mountjoy you wont  i wont  experience had taught his wife how to break him to her will do you remember my diamond pin she whispered  he looked startled perhaps he thought she had lost the pin  where is it he asked eagerly  gone to london to be valued beg mr mountjoys pardon or i will put the money in the bankand not one shilling of it do you get  in the meanwhile iris had justified mrs vimpanys apprehensions her indignation noticed nothing but the insult offered to hugh she was too seriously agitated to be able to speak to him still admirably calm his one anxiety was to compose her  dont be afraid he said it is impossible that i can degrade myself by quarrelling with mr vimpany i only wait here to know what you propose to do you have mrs vimpany to think of  i have nobody to think of but you iris replied but for me you would never have been in this house after the insult that has been offered to youoh hugh i feel it toolet us return to london together i have only to tell rhoda we are going away and to make my preparations for travelling send for me from the inn and i will be ready in time for the next train  mrs vimpany approached mountjoy leading her husband  sorry i have offended you the doctor said beg your pardon its only a joke no offence i hope  his servility was less endurable than his insolence telling him that he need say no more mountjoy bowed to mrs vimpany and left the room she returned his bow mechanically in silence mr vimpany followed hugh outthinking of the diamond pin and eager to open the house door as another act of submission which might satisfy his wife  even a clever woman will occasionally make mistakes especially when her temper happens to have been roused mrs vimpany found herself in a false position due entirely to her own imprudence  she had been guilty of three serious errors in the first place she had taken it for granted that mr vimpanys restorative mixture would completely revive the sober state of his brains in the second place she had trusted him with her vengeance on the man who had found his way to her secrets through her husbands intemperance in the third place she had rashly assumed that the doctor in carrying out her instructions for insulting mountjoy would keep within the limits which she had prescribed to him when she hit on the audacious idea of attributing his disgraceful conduct to the temptation offered by his hosts example as a consequence of these acts of imprudence she had exposed herself to a misfortune that she honestly dreadedthe loss of the place which she had carefully maintained in miss henleys estimation in the contradictory confusion of feelings so often found in women this deceitful and dangerous creature had been conqueredlittle by little as she had herself described itby that charm of sweetness and simplicity in iris of which her own depraved nature presented no trace she now spoke with hesitation almost with timidity in addressing the woman whom she had so cleverly deceived at the time when they first met  must i give up all miss henley that i most value she asked  i hardly understand you mrs vimpany  i will try to make it plainer do you really mean to leave me this evening  i do  may i own that i am grieved to hear it your departure will deprive me of some happy hours in your company  your husbands conduct leaves me no alternative iris replied  pray do not humiliate me by speaking of my husband i only want to know if there is a harder trial of my fortitude still to come must i lose the privilege of being your friend  i hope i am not capable of such injustice as that iris declared it would be hard indeed to lay the blame of mr vimpanys shameful behaviour on you i dont forget that you made him offer an apology some women married to such a man as that might have been afraid of him no no you have been a good friend to meand i mean to remember it  mrs vimpanys gratitude was too sincerely felt to be expressed with her customary readiness she only said what the stupidest woman in existence could have said thank you  in the silence that followed the rapid movement of carriage wheels became audible in the street the sound stopped at the door of the doctors house    chapter x  the mockery of deceit  had mountjoy arrived to take iris away before her preparations for travelling were complete both the ladies hurried to the window but they were too late the rapid visitor already hidden from them under the portico was knocking smartly at the door in another minute a mans voice in the hall asked for miss henley the tonesclear mellow and pleasantly varied here and there by the irish accentwere not to be mistaken by any one who had already hear them the man in the hall was lord harry  in that serious emergency mrs vimpany recovered her presence of mind  she made for the door with the object of speaking to lord harry before he could present himself in the drawingroom but iris had heard him ask for her in the hall and that one circumstance instantly stripped of its concealments the character of the woman in whose integrity she had believed her first impression of mrs vimpanyso sincerely repented so eagerly atoned forhad been the right impression after all younger lighter and quicker than the doctors wife iris reached the door first and laid her hand on the lock  wait a minute she said  mrs vimpany hesitated for the first time in her life at a loss what to say she could only sign to iris to stand back iris refused to move she put her terrible question in the plainest words  how does lord harry know that i am in this house  the wretched woman listening intently for the sound of a step on the stairs refused to submit to a shameful exposure even now to her perverted moral sense any falsehood was acceptable as a means of hiding herself from discovery by iris in the very face of detection the skilled deceiver kept up the mockery of deceit  my dear she said what has come to you why wont you let me go to my room  iris eyed her with a look of scornful surprise what next she said are you impudent enough to pretend that i have not found you out yet  sheer desperation still sustained mrs vimpanys courage she played her assumed character against the contemptuous incredulity of iris as she had sometimes played her theatrical characters against the hissing and hooting of a brutal audience  miss henley she said you forget yourself  do you think i didnt see in your face iris rejoined that you heard him too answer my question  what question  you have just heard it  no  you false woman  dont forget miss henley that you are speaking to a lady  i am speaking to lord harrys spy  their voices rose loud the excitement on either side had reached its climax neither the one nor the other was composed enough to notice the sound of the carriagewheels leaving the house again in the meanwhile nobody came to the drawingroom door mrs vimpany was too well acquainted with the hotheaded irish lord not to conclude that he would have made himself heard and would have found his way to iris but for some obstacle below stairs for which he was not prepared the doctors wife did justice to the doctor at last another person had in all probability heard lord harrys voiceand that person might have been her husband  was it possible that he remembered the service which she had asked of him and even if he had succeeded in calling it to mind was his discretion to be trusted as those questions occurred to her the desire to obtain some positive information was more than she was able to resist mrs vimpany attempted to leave the drawingroom for the second time  but the same motive had already urged miss henley to action again the younger woman outstripped the older iris descended the stairs resolved to discover the cause of the sudden suspension of events in the lower part of the house    chapter xi  mrs vimpanys farewell  the doctors wife followed miss henley out of the room as far as the landingand waited there  she had her reasons for placing this restraint on herself the position of the landing concealed her from the view of a person in the hall if she only listened for the sound of voices she might safely discover whether lord harry was or was not still in the house in the first event it would be easy to interrupt his interview with iris before the talk could lead to disclosures which mrs vimpany had every reason to dread in the second event there would be no need to show herself  meanwhile iris opened the diningroom door and looked in  nobody was there the one other room on the ground floor situated at the back of the building was the doctors consultingroom she knocked at the door mr vimpanys voice answered come in there he was alone drinking brandy and water and smoking his big black cigar  where is lord harry she said  in ireland i suppose mr vimpany answered quietly  iris wasted no time in making useless inquiries she closed the door again and left him he too was undoubtedly in the conspiracy to keep her deceived how had it been done where was the wild lord at that moment  whilst she was pursuing these reflections in the hall rhoda came up from the servants teatable in the kitchen her mistress gave her the necessary instructions for packing and promised to help her before long mrs vimpanys audacious resolution to dispute the evidence of her own senses still dwelt on miss henleys mind too angry to think of the embarrassment which an interview with lord harry would produce after they had said their farewell words in ireland she was determined to prevent the doctors wife from speaking to him first and claiming him as an accomplice in her impudent denial of the truth if he had been by any chance deluded into leaving the house he would sooner or later discover the trick that had been played on him and would certainly return iris took a chair in the hall                   it is due to the doctor to relate that he had indeed justified his wifes confidence in him  the diamond pin undergoing valuation in london still represented a present terror in his mind the money the moneyhe was the most attentive husband in england when he thought of the money at the time when lord harrys carriage stopped at his housedoor he was in the diningroom taking a bottle of brandy from the cellaret in the sideboard looking instantly out of the window he discovered who the visitor was and decided on consulting his instructions in the pocketdiary the attempt was rendered useless as soon as he had opened the book by the unlucky activity of the servant in answering the door her master stopped her in the hall he was pleasantly conscious of the recovery of his cunning but his memory far from active under the most favourable circumstances was slower than ever at helping him now on the spur of the moment he could only call to mind that he had been ordered to prevent a meeting between lord harry and iris show the gentleman into my consultingroom he said  lord harry found the doctor enthroned on his professional chair surprised and delighted to see his distinguished friend the impetuous irishman at once asked for miss henley  gone mr vimpany answered  gonewhere the wild lord wanted to know next  to london  by herself  no with mr hugh mountjoy  lord harry seized the doctor by the shoulders and shook him you dont mean to tell me mountjoy is going to marry her  mr vimpany feared nothing but the loss of money the weaker and the older man of the two he nevertheless followed the young lords example and shook him with right goodwill lets see how you like it in your turn he said as for mountjoy i dont know whether he is married or singleand dont care  the devil take your obstinacy when did they start  the devil take your questions they started not long since  might i catch them at the station  yes if you go at once  so the desperate doctor carried out his wifes instructionswithout remembering the conditions which had accompanied them  the way to the station took lord harry past the inn he saw hugh mountjoy through the open house door paying his bill at the bar in an instant the carriage was stopped and the two men never on friendly terms were formally bowing to each other  i was told i should find you lord harry said with miss henley at the station  who gave you your information  vimpanythe doctor  he ought to know that the train isnt due at the station for an hour yet  has the blackguard deceived me one word more mr mountjoy is miss henley at the inn  no  are you going with her to london  i must leave miss henley to answer that  where is she sir  there is an end to everything my lord in the world we live in you have reached the end of my readiness to answer questions the englishman and the irishman looked at each other the anglosaxon was impenetrably cool the celt was flushed and angry they might have been on the brink of a quarrel but for lord harrys native quickness of perception and his exercise of it at that moment when he had called at mr vimpanys house and had asked for iris the doctor had got rid of him by means of a lie after this discovery at what conclusion could he arrive the doctor was certainly keeping iris out of his way reasoning in this rapid manner lord harry let one offence pass in his headlong eagerness to resent another he instantly left mountjoy again the carriage rattled back along the street but it was stopped before it reached mr vimpanys door  lord harry knew the people whom he had to deal with and took measures to approach the house silently on foot the coachman received orders to look out for a signal which should tell him when he was wanted again  mr vimpanys ears vigilantly on the watch for suspicious events detected no sound of carriage wheels and no noisy use of the knocker still on his guard however a ring at the housebell disturbed him in his consultingroom peeping into the hall he saw iris opening the door and stole back to his room the devil take her he said alluding to miss henley and thinking of the enviable proprietor of the diamond pin  at the unexpected appearance of iris lord harry forgot every consideration which ought to have been present to his mind at that critical moment  he advanced to her with both hands held out in cordial greeting she signed to him contemptuously to stand backand spoke in tones cautiously lowered after a glance at the door of the consultingroom  my only reason for consenting to see you she said is to protect myself from further deception your disgraceful conduct is known to me go now she continued pointing to the stairs and consult with your spy as soon as you like the irish lord listenedguiltily conscious of having deserved what she had said to himwithout attempting to utter a word in excuse  still posted at the head of the stairs the doctors wife heard iris speaking but the tone was not loud enough to make the words intelligible at that distance neither was any other voice audible in reply vaguely suspicions of some act of domestic treachery mrs vimpany began to descend the stairs at the turning which gave her a view of the hall she stopped thunderstruck by the discovery of lord harry and miss henley together  the presence of a third person seemed in some degree to relieve lord harry he ran upstairs to salute mrs vimpany and was met again by a cold reception and a hostile look  strongly and strangely contrasted the two confronted each other on the stairs the faded woman wan and ghastly under cruel stress of mental suffering stood face to face with a fine tall lithe man in the prime of his health and strength here were the bright blue eyes the winning smile and the natural grace of movement which find their own way to favour in the estimation of the gentler sex this irreclaimable wanderer among the perilous byways of the earthchristened irish blackguard among respectable members of society when they spoke of him behind his backattracted attention even among the men looking at his daring finelyformed face they noticed as an exception to a general rule in these days the total suppression by the razor of whiskers moustache and beard strangers wondered whether lord harry was an actor or a roman catholic priest among chance acquaintances those few favourites of nature who are possessed of active brains guessed that his life of adventure might well have rendered disguise necessary to his safety in more than one part of the world sometimes they boldly put the question to him the hot temper of an irishman in moments of excitement is not infrequently a sweet temper in moments of calm what they called lord harrys goodnature owned readily that he had been indebted on certain occasions to the protection of a false beard and perhaps a colouring of his face and hair to match the same easy disposition now asserted itself under the merciless enmity of mrs vimpanys eyes if i have done anything to offend you he said with an air of puzzled humility im sure i am sorry for it dont be angry arabella with an old friend why wont you shake hands  i have kept your secret and done your dirty work mrs vimpany replied and what is my reward miss henley can tell you how your irish blundering has ruined me in a ladys estimation shake hands indeed you will never shake hands with me again as long as you live  she said those words without looking at him her eyes were resting on iris now from the moment when she had seen the two together she knew that it was all over further denial in the face of plain proofs would be useless indeed submission was the one alternative left  miss henley she said if you can feel pity for another womans sorrow and shame let me have a last word with youout of this mans hearing  there was nothing artificial in her tones or her looks no acting could have imitated the sad sincerity with which she spoke touched by that change iris accompanied her as she ascended the stairs after a little hesitation lord harry followed them mrs vimpany turned on him when they reached the drawingroom landing must i shut the door in your face she asked  he was as pleasantly patient as ever  you neednt take the trouble to do that my dear ill only ask your leave to sit down and wait on the stairs when you have done with miss henley just call me in and by the way dont be alarmed in case of a little noisesay a heavy man tumbling downstairs if the blackguard its your misfortune to be married to happens to show himself i shall be under the necessity of kicking him thats all  mrs vimpany closed the door she spoke to iris respectfully as she might have addressed a stranger occupying a higher rank in life than herself  there is an end madam to one short acquaintance and as we both know an end to it for ever when we first metlet me tell the truth at lasti felt a malicious pleasure in deceiving you after that time i was surprised to find that you grew on my liking can you understand the wickedness that tried to resist you it was useless your good influence has been too strong for me strange isnt it i have lived a life of deceit among bad people what could you expect of me after that i heaped lies on liesi would have denied that the sun was in the heavensrather than find myself degraded in your opinion well that is all overuseless quite useless now pray dont mistake me i am not attempting to excuse myself a confession was due to you the confession is made it is too late to hope that you will forgive me if you will permit it i have only one favour to ask forget me  she turned away with a last hopeless look who said as plainly as if in words i am not worth a reply  generous iris insisted on speaking to her  i believe you are truly sorry for what you have done she said i can never forget thati can never forget you she held out her pitying hand mrs vimpany was too bitterly conscious of the past to touch it even a spy is not beneath the universal reach of the heartache there were tears in the miserable womans eyes when she had looked her last at iris henley    chapter xii  lord harrys defence  after a short interval the drawingroom door was opened again waiting on the threshold the irish lord asked if he might come in  iris replied coldly this is not my house she said i must leave you to decide for yourself  lord harry crossed the room to speak to her and stopped there was no sign of relenting towards him in that dearlyloved face i wonder whether it would be a relief to you he suggested with piteous humility if i went away  if she had been true to herself she would have said yes where is the woman to be found in her place with a heart hard enough to have set her that example she pointed to a chair he felt her indulgence gratefully following the impulse of the moment he attempted to excuse his conduct  there is only one thing i can say for myself he confessed i didnt begin by deceiving you while you had your eye on me iris i was an honourable man  this extraordinary defence reduced her to silence was there another man in the world who would have pleaded for pardon in that way im afraid i have not made myself understood he said may i try again  if you please  the vagabond nobleman made a resolute effort to explain himself intelligibly this time  see now we said goodbye over there in the poor old island well indeed i meant it when i owned that i was unworthy of you i didnt contradict you when you said you could never be my wife after such a life as i have led and do remember i submitted to your returning to england without presuming to make a complaint ah my sweet girl it was easy to submit while i could look at you and hear the sound of your voice and beg for that last kissand get it reverend gentlemen talk about the fall of adam what was that to the fall of harry when he was back in his own little cottage without the hope of ever seeing you again to the best of my recollection the serpent that tempted eve was up a tree i found the serpent that tempted me sitting waiting in my own armchair and bent on nothing worse than borrowing a trifle of money need i say who she was i dont doubt that you think her a wicked woman  never ready in speaking of acts of kindness on her own part iris answered with some little reserve i have learnt to think better of mrs vimpany than you suppose  lord harry began to look like a happy man for the first time since he had entered the room  i ought to have known it he burst out yours is the wellbalanced mind dear that tempers justice with mercy mother vimpany has had a hard life of it just change places with her for a minute or soand youll understand what she has had to go through find yourself for instance in ireland without the means to take you back to england add to that a husband who sends you away to make money for him at the theatre and a manager not an irishman thank god who refuses to engage youafter your acting has filled his dirty pockets in past daysbecause your beauty has faded with time doesnt your bright imagination see it all now my old friend arabella ready and anxious to serve meand a sinking at this poor fellows heart when he knew if he once lost the trace of you he might lose it for evertheres the situation as they call it on the stage i wish i could say for myself what i may say for mrs vimpany its such a pleasure to a clever woman to engage in a little deceitwe cant blame her can we  iris protested gently against a code of morality which included the right of deceit among the privileges of the sex lord harry slipped through her fingers with the admirable irish readiness he agreed with miss henley that he was entirely wrong  and dont spare me while youre about it he suggested lay all the blame of that shameful stratagem on my shoulders it was a despicable thing to do when i had you watched i acted in a manneri wont say unworthy of a gentleman have i been a gentleman since i first ran away from home why its even been said my way of speaking is no longer the way of a gentleman and small wonder too after the company ive kept ah well im off again darling on a sea voyage will you forgive me now or will you wait till i come back if i do come back god knows he dropped on his knees and kissed her hand anyway he said whether i live or whether i die it will be some consolation to remember that i asked your pardonand perhaps got it  take it harry i cant help forgiving you  she had done her best to resist him and she had answered in those merciful words  the effect was visible perilously visible as he rose from his knees her one chance of keeping the distance between them on which she had been too weak to insist was not to encourage him by silence abruptly desperately she made a commonplace inquiry about his proposed voyage tell me she resumed where are you going when you leave england  oh to find money dear if i canto pick up diamonds or to hit on a mine of gold and so forth  the fine observation of iris detected something not quite easy in his manner as he made that reply he tried to change the subject she deliberately returned to it your account of your travelling plans is rather vague she told him do you know when you are likely to return  he took her hand one of the rings on her fingers happened to be turned the wrong way he set it in the right position and discovered an opal ah the unlucky stone he cried and turned it back again out of sight she drew away her hand i asked you she persisted when you expect to return  he laughednot so gaily as usual  how do i know i shall ever get back he answered sometimes the seas turn traitor and sometimes the savages i have had so many narrow escapes of my life i cant expect my luck to last for ever he made a second attempt to change the subject i wonder whether youre likely to pay another visit to ireland my cottage is entirely at your disposal iris dear oh when im out of the way of course the place seemed to please your fancy when you saw it you will find it well taken care of i answer for that  iris asked who was taking care of his cottage  the wild lords face saddened he hesitated rose from his chair restlessly and walked away to the window returned and made up his mind to reply  my dear you know her she was the old housekeeper at  his voice failed him he was unable or unwilling to pronounce the name of arthurs farm  knowing it is needless to say that he had alluded to mrs lewson iris warmly commended him for taking care of her old nurse at the same time she remembered the unfriendly terms in which the housekeeper had alluded to lord harry when they had talked of him  did you find no difficulty she asked in persuading mrs lewson to enter your service  oh yes plenty of difficulty i found my bad character in my way as usual it was a relief to him at that moment to talk of mrs lewson the irish humour and the irish accent both asserted themselves in his reply the curious old creature told me to my face i was a scamp i took leave to remind her that it was the duty of a respectable person like herself to reform scamps i also mentioned that i was going away and she would be master and mistress too on my small property that softened her heart towards me you will mostly find old women amenable if you get at them by way of their dignity besides there was another lucky circumstance that helped me the neighbourhood of my cottage has some attraction for mrs lewson she didnt say particularly what it wasand i never asked her to tell me  surely you might have guessed it without being told iris reminded him mrs lewsons faithful heart loves poor arthurs memoryand arthurs grave is not far from your cottage  dont speak of him  it was said loudly peremptorily passionately he looked at her with angry astonishment in his face you loved him too he said can you speak of him quietly the noblest truest sweetest man that ever the heavens looked on foully assassinated and the wretch who murdered him still living freeoh what is gods providence aboutis there no retribution that will follow him no just hand that will revenge arthurs death  as those fierce words escaped him he was no longer the easy gentle joyous creature whom iris had known and loved the furious passions of the celtic race glittered savagely in his eyes and changed to a grey horrid pallor the healthy colour that was natural to his face oh my temper my temper he cried as iris shrank from him she hates me now and no wonder he staggered away from her and burst into a convulsive fit of crying dreadful to hear compassion divine compassion mastered the earthlier emotion of terror in the great heart of the woman who loved him she followed him and laid her hand caressingly on his shoulder i dont hate you my dear she said i am sorry for arthurand oh so sorry for you he caught her in his arms his gratitude his repentance his silent farewell were all expressed in a last kiss it was a moment never to be forgotten to the end of their lives before she could speak before she could think he had left her  she called him back through the open door he never returned he never even replied she ran to the window and threw it upand was just in time to see him signal to the carriage and leap into it her horror of the fatal purpose that was but too plainly rooted in himher conviction that he was on the track of the assassin self devoted to exact the terrible penalty of blood for bloodemboldened her to insist on being heard come back she cried i must i will speak with you  he waved his hand to her with a gesture of despair start your horses he shouted to the coachman alarmed by his voice and his look the man asked where he should drive to lord harry pointed furiously to the onward road drive he answered to the devil  the end of the first period   the second period  chapter xiii  iris at home  a little more than four months had passed since the return of iris to her fathers house  among other events which occurred during the earlier part of that interval the course adopted by hugh mountjoy when miss henleys suspicions of the irish lord were first communicated to him claims a foremost place  it was impossible that the devoted friend of iris could look at her when they met again on their way to the station without perceiving the signs of serious agitation only waiting until they were alone in the railwaycarriage she opened her heart unreservedly to the man in whose clear intellect and true sympathy she could repose implicit trust he listened to what she could repeat of lord harrys language with but little appearance of surprise iris had only reminded him of one among the disclosures which had escaped mr vimpany at the inn under the irresistible influence of good wine the doctor had revealed the irish lords motive for remaining in his own country after the assassination of arthur mountjoy hugh met the only difficulty in his way without shrinking from it he resolved to clear his mind of its natural prejudice against the rival who had been preferred to him before he assumed the responsibility of guiding iris by his advice  when he had in some degree recovered confidence in his own unbiased judgment he entered on the question of lord harrys purpose in leaving england  without attempting to dispute the conclusion at which iris had arrived he did his best to alleviate her distress in his opinion he was careful to tell her a discovery of the destination to which lord harry proposed to betake himself might be achieved the irish lords allusion to a new adventure which would occupy him in searching for diamonds or gold might indicate a contemplated pursuit of the assassin as well as a plausible excuse to satisfy iris it was at least possible that the murderer might have been warned of his danger if he remained in england and that he might have contemplated directing his flight to a distant country which would not only offer a safe refuge but also hold out in its mineral treasures a hope of gain assuming that these circumstances had really happened it was in lord harrys character to make sure of his revenge by embarking in the steamship by which the assassin of arthur mountjoy was a passenger  wild as this guess at the truth undoubtedly was it had one merit it might easily be put to the test  hugh had bought the days newspaper at the station he proposed to consult the shipping advertisements relating in the first place to communication with the diamondmines and the goldfields of south africa  this course of proceeding at once informed him that the first steamer bound for that destination would sail from london in two days time the obvious precaution to take was to have the dock watched and mountjoys steady old servant who knew lord harry by sight was the man to employ  iris naturally inquired what good end could be attained if the anticipated discovery actually took place  to this mountjoy answered that the one hopea faint hope he must needs confessof inducing lord harry to reconsider his desperate purpose lay in the influence of iris herself she must address a letter to him announcing that his secret had been betrayed by his own language and conduct and declaring that she would never again see him or hold any communication with him if he persisted in his savage resolution of revenge such was the desperate experiment which mountjoys generous and unselfish devotion to iris now proposed to try  the servant duly entrusted with miss henleys letter was placed on the watchand the event which had been regarded as little better than a forlorn hope proved to be the event that really took place lord harry was a passenger by the steamship  mountjoys man presented the letter entrusted to him and asked respectfully if there was any answer the wild lord read itlooked to use the messengers own words like a man cut to the heartseemed at a loss what to say or doand only gave a verbal answer i sincerely thank miss henley and i promise to write when the ship touches at madeira the servant continued to watch him when he went on board the steamer saw him cast a look backwards as if suspecting that he might have been followed and then lost sight of him in the cabin the vessel sailed after a long interval of delay but he never reappeared on the deck  the ambiguous message sent to her aroused the resentment of iris she thought it cruel for some weeks perhaps to come she was condemned to remain in doubt and was left to endure the trial of her patience without having mountjoy at hand to encourage and console her he had been called away to the south of france by the illness of his father  but the fortunes of miss henley at this period of her life had their brighter side she found reason to congratulate herself on the reconciliation which had brought her back to her father mr henley had received her not perhaps with affection but certainly with kindness if we dont get in each others way we shall do very well i am glad to see you again that was all he had said to her but it meant much from a soured and selfish man  her only domestic anxiety was caused by another failure in the health of her maid  the doctor declared that medical help would be of no avail while rhoda bennet remained in london in the country she had been born and bred and to the country she must return mr henleys large landed property on the north of london happened to include a farm in the neighbourhood of muswell hill wisely waiting for a favourable opportunity iris alluded to the good qualities which had made rhoda almost as much her friend as her servant and asked leave to remove the invalid to the healthy air of the farm  her anxiety about the recovery of a servant so astonished mr henley that he was hurried as he afterwards declared into granting his daughters request after this concession the necessary arrangements were easily made the influence of iris won the goodwill of the farmer and his wife rhoda as an expert and willing needlewoman being sure of a welcome for her own sake in a family which included a number of young children miss henley had only to order her carriage and to be within reach of the farm a week seldom passed without a meeting between the mistress and the maid  in the meantime mountjoy absent in france did not forget to write to iris  his letters offered little hope of a speedy return the doctors had not concealed from him that his fathers illness would end fatally but there were reserves of vital power still left which might prolong the struggle under these melancholy circumstances he begged that iris would write to him the oftener she could tell him of the little events of her life at home the more kindly she would brighten the days of a dreary life  eager to show even in a trifling matter how gratefully she appreciated mountjoys past kindness iris related the simple story of her life at home in weekly letters addressed to her good friend after telling hugh among other things of rhodas establishment at the farm she had some unexpected results to relate which had followed the attempt to provide herself with a new maid  two young women had been successively engagedeach recommended by the lady whom she had last served with that utter disregard of moral obligation which appears to be shamelessly on the increase in the england of our day the first of the two maids described as rather excitable revealed infirmities of temper which suggested a lunatic asylum as the only fit place for her the second young woman detected in stealing eaudecologne and using it mixed with water as an intoxicating drink claimed merciful construction of her misconduct on the ground that she had been misled by the example of her last mistress  at the third attempt to provide herself with a servant iris was able to report the discovery of a responsible person who told the truthan unmarried lady of middle age  in this case the young woman was described as a servant thoroughly trained in the performance of her duties honest sober industrious of an even temper and unprovided with a follower in the shape of a sweetheart even her name sounded favourably in the ear of a strangerit was fanny mere iris asked how a servant apparently possessed of a faultless character came to be in want of a situation at this question the lady sighed and acknowledged that she had made a dreadful discovery relating to the past life of her maid it proved to be the old the miserably old story of a broken promise of marriage and of the penalty paid as usual by the unhappy woman i will say nothing of my own feelings the maiden lady explained in justice to the other female servants it was impossible for me to keep such a person in my house and in justice to you i must most unwillingly stand in the way of fanny meres prospects by mentioning my reason for parting with her  if i could see the young woman and speak to her iris said i should like to decide the question of engaging her for myself  the lady knew the address of her discharged servant andwith some appearance of wondercommunicated it miss henley wrote at once telling fanny mere to come to her on the following day  when she woke on the next morning later than usual an event occurred which iris had been impatiently expecting for some time past she found a letter waiting on her bedside table side by side with her cup of tea lord harry had written to her at last  whether he used his pen or his tongue the irish lords conduct was always more or less in need of an apology here were the guilty ones new excuses expressed in his customary medley of frank confession and flowery language  i am fearing my angel that i have offended you you have too surely said to yourself this miserable harry might have made me happy by writing two linesand what does he do he sends a message in words which tell me nothing  my sweet girl the reason why is that i was in two minds when your man stopped me on my way to the ship  whether it was best for youi was not thinking of myselfto confess the plain truth or to take refuge in affectionate equivocation was more than i could decide at the time when minutes are enough for your intelligence my stupidity wants days well i saw it at last a man owes the truth to a true woman and you are a true woman there you find a process of reasoningi have been five days getting hold of it  but tell me one thing first brutus killed a man charlotte corday killed a man one of the two victims was a fine tyrant and the other a mean tyrant nobody blames those two historical assassins why then blame me for wishing to make a third is a mere modern murderer beneath my vengeance by comparison with two classical tyrants who did their murders by deputy the man who killed arthur mountjoy is next to cain alone the most atrocious homicide that ever trod the miry ways of this earth there is my reply i call it a crusher  so now my mind is easy darling let me make your mind easy next  when i left you at the window of vimpanys house i was off to the other railroad to find the murderer in his hidingplace by the seaside he had left it but i got a trace and went back to londonto the docks some villain in ireland who knows my purpose must have turned traitor anyhow the wretch has escaped me  yes i searched the ship in every corner he was not on board has he gone on before me by an earlier vessel or has he directed his flight to some other part of the world i shall find out in time his day of reckoning will come and he too shall know a violent death amen so be it amen  have i done now bear with me gentle iristhere is a word more to come  you will wonder why i went on by the steamshipall the way to south africawhen i had failed to find the man i wanted on board what was my motive you you alone are always my motive lucky men have found gold lucky men have found diamonds why should i not be one of them my sweet let us suppose two possible things my own elastic convictions would call them two likely things but never mind that say i come back a reformed character there is your only objection to me at once removed and take it for granted that i return with a fortune of my own finding in that case what becomes of mr henleys objection to me it melts as shakespeare says somewhere into thin air now do take my advice for once show this part of my letter to your excellent father with my love i answer beforehand for the consequences be happy my lady harryas happy as i amand look for my return on an earlier day than you may anticipate yours till death and after  harry   like the irish lord miss henley was in two minds while she rose and dressed herself there were parts of the letter for which she loved the writer and parts of it for which she hated him  what a prospect was before that reckless manwhat misery what horror might not be lying in wait in the dreadful future if he failed in the act of vengeance that violent death of which he had written so heedlessly might overtake him from another hand if he succeeded the law might discover his crime and the infamy of expiation on the scaffold might be his dreadful end she turned shuddering from the contemplation of those hideous possibilities and took refuge in the hope of his safe his guiltless return even if his visions of success even if his purposes of reform how hopeless at his age were actually realised could she consent to marry the man who had led his life had written this letter had contemplated and still cherished his merciless resolution of revenge no woman in her senses could let the bare idea of being his wife enter her mind iris opened her writingdesk to hide the letter from all eyes but her own as she secured it with the key her heart sank under the return of a terror remembered but too well once more the superstitious belief in a destiny that was urging lord harry and herself nearer and nearer to each other even when they seemed to be most widely and most surely separated thrilled her under the chilling mystery of its presence she dropped helplessly into a chair oh for a friend who could feel for her who could strengthen her whose wise words could restore her to her better and calmer self hugh was far away and iris was left to suffer and to struggle alone  heartfelt aspirations for help and sympathy oh irony of circumstances how were they answered the housemaid entered the room to announce the arrival of a discharged servant with a lost character  let the young woman come in iris said was fanny mere the friend whom she had been longing for she looked at her troubled face in the glassand laughed bitterly    chapter xiv  the ladys maid  it was not easy to form a positive opinion of the young woman who now presented herself in miss henleys room  if the turkish taste is truly reported as valuing beauty in the female figure more than beauty in the female face fanny meres personal appearance might have found in constantinople the approval which she failed to receive in london slim and well balanced firmly and neatly made she interested men who met her by accident and sometimes even women if they happened to be walking behind her when they quickened their steps and passing on looked back at her face they lost all interest in fanny from that moment painters would have described the defect in her face as want of colour she was one of the whitest of fair female human beings light flaxen hair faint blue eyes with no expression in them and a complexion which looked as if it had never been stirred by a circulation of blood produced an effect on her fellowcreatures in general which made them insensible to the beauty of her figure and the grace of her movements there was no betrayal of bad health in her strange pallor on the contrary she suggested the idea of rare physical strength her quietly respectful manner was so to say emphasised by an underlying selfpossession which looked capable of acting promptly and fearlessly in the critical emergencies of life otherwise the expression of character in her face was essentially passive here was a steady resolute young woman possessed of qualities which failed to show themselves on the surfacewhether good qualities or bad qualities experience alone could determine  finding it impossible judging by a first impression to arrive at any immediate decision favourable or adverse to the stranger iris opened the interview with her customary frankness leaving the consequences to follow as they might  take a seat fanny she said and let us try if we can understand each other i think you will agree with me that there must be no concealments between us you ought to know that your mistress has told me why she parted with you it was her duty to tell me the truth and it is my duty not to be unjustly prejudiced against you after what i have heard pray believe me when i say that i dont know and dont wish to know what your temptation may have been  i beg your pardon miss for interrupting you my temptation was vanity  whether she did or did not suffer in making that confession it was impossible to discover her tones were quiet her manner was unobtrusively respectful the pallor of her face was not disturbed by the slightest change of colour was the new maid an insensible person iris began to fear already that she might have made a mistake  i dont expect you to enter into particulars she said i dont ask you here to humiliate yourself  when i got your letter miss i tried to consider how i might show myself worthy of your kindness fanny answered the one way i could see was not to let you think better of me than i deserve when a person like me is told for the first time that her figure makes amends for her face she is flattered by the only compliment that has been paid to her in all her life my excuse miss if i have an excuse is a mean onei couldnt resist a compliment that is all i have to say  iris began to alter her opinion this was not a young woman of the ordinary type it began to look possible and more than possible that she was worthy of a helping hand the truth seemed to be in her  i understand you and feel for you having replied in those words iris wisely and delicately changed the subject let me hear how you are situated at the present time she continued are your parents living  my father and mother are dead miss  have you any other relatives  they are too poor to be able to do anything for me i have lost my characterand i am left to help myself  suppose you fail to find another situation iris suggested  yes miss  how can you help yourself  i can do what other girls have done  what do you mean  some of us starve on needlework some take to the streets some end it in the river if there is no other chance for me i think i shall try that way said the poor creature as quietly as if she was speaking of some customary prospect that was open to her there will be nobody to be sorry for meand as i have read drowning is not a very painful death  you shock me fanny i for one should be sorry for you  thank you miss  and try to remember iris continued that there may be chances in the future which you dont see yet you speak of what you have read and i have already noticed how clearly and correctly you express yourself you must have been educated was it at home or at school  i was once sent to school fanny replied not quite willingly  was it a private school  yes  that short answer warned iris to be careful  recollections of school she said goodhumouredly are not the pleasantest recollections in some of our lives perhaps i have touched on a subject which is disagreeable to you  you have touched on one of my disappointments miss while my mother lived she was my teacher after her death my father sent me to school when he failed in business i was obliged to leave just as i had begun to learn and like it besides the girls found out that i was going away because there was no money at home to pay the feesand that mortified me there is more that i might tell you i have a reason for hating my recollections of the schoolbut i mustnt mention that time in my life which your goodness to me tries to forget  all that appealed to her so simply and so modestly in that reply was not lost on iris after an interval of silence she said  can you guess what i am thinking of fanny  no miss  i am asking myself a question if i try you in my service shall i never regret it  for the first time strong emotion shook fanny mere her voice failed her in the effort to speak iris considerately went on  you will take the place she said of a maid who has been with me for yearsa good dear creature who has only left me through illhealth i must not expect too much of you i cannot hope that you will be to me what rhoda bennet has been  fanny succeeded in controlling herself is there any hope she asked of my seeing rhoda bennet  why do you wish to see her  you are fond of her missthat is one reason  and the other  rhoda bennet might help me to serve you as i want to serve you she might perhaps encourage me to try if i could follow her example fanny paused and clasped her hands fervently the thought that was in her forced its way to expression its so easy to feel grateful she saidand oh so hard to show it  come to me her new mistress answered and show it tomorrow  moved by that compassionate impulse iris said the words which restored to an unfortunate creature a lost character and a forfeited place in the world    chapter xv  mr henleys temper  provided by nature with ironclad constitutional defences against illness mr henley was now and then troubled with groundless doubts of his own state of health acting under a delusion of this kind he imagined symptoms which rendered a change of residence necessary from his town house to his country house a few days only after his daughter had decided on the engagement of her new maid  iris gladly even eagerly adapted her own wishes to the furtherance of her fathers plans sorely tried by anxiety and suspense she needed all that rest and tranquillity could do for her the first week in the country produced an improvement in her health enjoying the serene beauty of woodland and field breathing the delicious purity of the airsometimes cultivating her own corner in the garden and sometimes helping the women in the lighter labours of the dairyher nerves recovered their tone and her spirits rose again to their higher level  in the performance of her duties the new maid justified miss henleys confidence in her during the residence of the household in the country  she showed in her own undemonstrative way a grateful sense of her mistresss kindness her various occupations were intelligently and attentively pursued her even temper never seemed to vary she gave the servants no opportunities of complaining of her but one peculiarity in her behaviour excited hostile remark belowstairs on the occasions when she was free to go out for the day she always found some excuse for not joining any of the other female servants who might happen to be similarly favoured the one use she made of her holiday was to travel by railway to some place unknown always returning at the right time in the evening iris knew enough of the sad circumstances to be able to respect her motives and to appreciate the necessity for keeping the object of these solitary journeys a secret from her fellowservants  the pleasant life in the country house had lasted for nearly a month when the announcement of hughs approaching return to england reached iris the fatal end of his fathers long and lingering illness had arrived and the funeral had taken place business connected with his succession to the property would detain him in london for a few days submitting to this necessity he earnestly expressed the hope of seeing iris again the moment he was at liberty  hearing the good news mr henley obstinately returned to his plansalready twice thwartedfor promoting the marriage of mountjoy and iris  he wrote to invite hugh to his house in a tone of cordiality which astonished his daughter and when the guest arrived the genial welcome of the host had but one defectmr henley overacted his part he gave the two young people perpetual opportunities of speaking to each other privately and on the principle that none are so blind as those who wont see he failed to discover that the relations between them continued to be relations of friendship do what he might hughs long attendance on his dying father had left him depressed in spirits iris understood him and felt for him he was not ready with his opinion of the new maid after he had seen fanny mere my inclination he said is to trust the girl and yet i hesitate to follow my inclinationand i dont know why  when hughs visit came to an end he continued his journey in a northerly direction the property left to him by his father included a cottage standing in its own grounds on the scotch shore of the solway firth the place had been neglected during the long residence of the elder mr mountjoy on the continent hughs present object was to judge by his own investigation of the necessity for repairs  on the departure of his guest mr henley still obstinately hopeful of the marriage on which he had set his mind assumed a jocular manner towards iris and asked if the scotch cottage was to be put in order for the honeymoon her reply gently as it was expressed threw him into a state of fury his vindictive temper revelled not only in harsh words but in spiteful actions he sold one of his dogs which had specially attached itself to iris and seeing that she still enjoyed the country he decided on returning to london  she submitted in silence but the events of that past time when her fathers merciless conduct had driven her out of his house returned ominously to her memory she said to herself is a day coming when i shall leave him again it was comingand she little knew how    chapter xvi  the doctor in full dress  mr henleys household had been again established in london when a servant appeared one morning with a visiting card and announced that a gentleman had called who wished to see miss henley she looked at the card the gentleman was mr vimpany  on the point of directing the man to say that she was engaged iris checked herself  mrs vimpanys farewell words had produced a strong impression on her there had been moments of doubt and gloom in her later life when the remembrance of that unhappy woman was associated with a feeling perhaps a morbid feeling of selfreproach it seemed to be hard on the poor penitent wretch not to have written to her was she still leading the same dreary life in the mouldering old town or had she made another attempt to return to the ungrateful stage the gross husband impudently presenting himself with his card and his message could answer those questions if he could do nothing else for that reason only iris decided that she would receive mr vimpany  on entering the room she found two discoveries awaiting her for which she was entirely unprepared  the doctors personal appearance exhibited a striking change he was dressed in accordance with the strictest notions of professional propriety entirely in black more remarkable still there happened to be a french novel among the books on the tableand that novel mr vimpany barbarous mr vimpany was actually reading with an appearance of understanding it  i seem to surprise you said the doctor is it this he held up the french novel as he put the question  i must own that i was not aware of the range of your accomplishments iris answered  oh dont talk of accomplishments i learnt my profession in paris for nigh on three years i lived among the french medical students noticing this book on the table i thought i would try whether i had forgotten the languagein the time that has passed you know since those days well my memory isnt a good one in most things but strange to say force of habit i suppose some of my french sticks by me still i hope i see you well miss henley might i ask if you noticed the new address when i sent up my card  i only noticed your name  the doctor produced his pocketbook and took out a second card with pride he pointed to the address 5 redburn road hampstead heath with pride he looked at his black clothes strictly professional isnt it he said i have bought a new practice and i have become a new man it isnt easy at first no by jingoi beg your pardoni was about to say my own respectability rather bothers me i shall get used to it in time if you will allow me ill take a liberty no offence i hope  he produced a handful of his cards and laid them out in a neat little semicircle on the table  a word of recommendation when you have the chance would be a friendly act on your part he explained capital air in redburn road and a fine view of the heath out of the garret windowsbut its rather an outoftheway situation not that i complain beggars mustnt be choosers i should have preferred a practice in a fashionable part of london but our little windfall of money  he came to a full stop in the middle of a sentence the sale of the superb diamond pin by means of which lord harry had repaid mrs vimpanys services was of all domestic events the last which it might be wise to mention in the presence of miss henley he was awkwardly silent taking advantage of that circumstance iris introduced the subject in which she felt interested  how is mrs vimpany she asked  oh shes all right  does she like your new house  the doctor made a strange reply i really cant tell you he said  do you mean that mrs vimpany declines to express an opinion  he laughed in all my experience he said i never met with a woman who did that no no the fact is my wife and i have parted company theres no need to look so serious about it incompatibility of temper as the saying is has led us to a friendly separation equally a relief on both sides she goes her way i go mine  his tone disgusted irisand she let him see it is it of any use to ask you for mrs vimpanys address she inquired  his atrocious goodhumour kept its balance as steadily as ever sorry to disappoint you mrs vimpany hasnt given me her address curious isnt it the fact is she moped a good deal after you left us talked of her duty and the care of her soul and that sort of thing when i hear where she is ill let you know with pleasure to the best of my belief shes doing nurses work somewhere  nurses work what do you mean  oh the right thingall in the fashion she belongs to what they call a sisterhood goes about you know in a shabby black gown with a poke bonnet at least so lord harry told me the other day  in spite of herself iris betrayed the agitation which those words instantly roused in her lord harry she exclaimed where is he in london  yesat parkers hotel  when did he return  oh a few days ago andwhat do you thinkhes come back from the goldfields a lucky man damn it ive let the cat out of the bag i was to keep the thing a secret from everybody and from you most particularly hes got some surprise in store for you dont tell him what ive done we had a little misunderstanding in past days at honeybuzzardand now we are friends again i dont want to lose his lordships interest  iris promised to be silent but to know that the wild lord was in england again and to remain in ignorance whether he had or had not returned with the stain of bloodshed on him was more than she could endure  there is one question i must ask you she said i have reason to fear that lord harry left this country with a purpose of revenge  mr vimpany wanted no further explanation yes yes i know you may be easy about that theres been no mischief done either one way or the other the man he was after when he landed in south africa he told me so himself has escaped him  with that reply the doctor got up in a hurry to bring his visit to an end he proposed to take to flight he remarked facetiously before miss henley wheedled him into saying anything more  after opening the door however he suddenly returned to iris and added a last word in the strictest confidence  if you wont forget to recommend me to your friends he said ill trust you with another secret you will see his lordship in a day or two when he returns from the races goodbye  the races what was lord harry doing at the races    chapter xvii  on hampstead heath  iris had only to remember the manner in which she and mountjoy had disappointed her father to perceive the serious necessity of preventing mountjoys rival from paying a visit at mr henleys house  she wrote at once to lord harry at the hotel which mr vimpany had mentioned entreating him not to think of calling on her being well aware that he would insist on a meeting she engaged to write again and propose an appointment in making this concession iris might have found it easier to persuade herself that she was yielding to sheer necessity if she had not been guiltily conscious of a feeling of pleasure at the prospect of seeing lord harry again returning to her an innocent man there was some influence in this train of thought which led her mind back to hugh she regretted his absencewondered whether he would have proposed throwing her letter to the irish lord into the firesighed closed the envelope and sent the letter to the post  on the next day she had arranged to drive to muswell hill and to pay the customary visit to rhoda heavy rain obliged her to wait for a fitter opportunity it was only on the third day that the sky cleared and the weather was favourable again on a sunshiny autumn morning with a fine keen air blowing she ordered the open carriage noticing while fanny mere was helping her to dress that the girl looked even paler than usual she said with her customary kindness to persons dependent on her you look as if a drive in the fresh air would do you goodyou shall go with me to the farm and see rhoda bennet  when they stopped at the house the farmers wife appeared attending a gentleman to the door iris at once recognised the local medical man youre not in attendance i hope on rhoda bennet she said  the doctor acknowledged that there had been some return of the nervous derangement from which the girl suffered he depended mainly he said on the weather allowing her to be out as much as possible in the fresh air and on keeping her free from all agitation rhoda was so far on the way to recovery that she was now walking in the garden by his advice he had no fear of her provided she was not too readily encouraged in her present state to receive visitors her mistress would be of course an exception to this rule but even miss henley would perhaps do well not to excite the girl by prolonging her visit there was one other suggestion which he would venture to make while he had the opportunity rhoda was not as he thought warmly enough clothed for the time of year and a bad cold might be easily caught by a person in her condition  iris entered the farmhouse leaving fanny mere after what the doctor had said on the subject of visitors to wait for her in the carriage  after an absence of barely ten minutes miss henley returned personally changed not at all to her own advantage by the introduction of a novelty in her dress she had gone into the farmhouse wearing a handsome mantle of sealskin when she came out again the mantle had vanished and there appeared in its place a common cloak of drabcoloured cloth noticing the expression of blank amazement in the maids face iris burst out laughing  how do you think i look in my new cloak she asked  fanny saw nothing to laugh at in the sacrifice of a sealskin mantle i must not presume miss to give an opinion she said gravely  at any rate iris continued you must be more than mortal if my change of costume doesnt excite your curiosity i found rhoda bennet in the garden exposed to the cold wind in this ugly flimsy thing after what the doctor had told me it was high time to assert my authority i insisted on changing cloaks with rhoda she made an attempt poor dear to resist but she knows me of oldand i had my way i am sorry you have been prevented from seeing her you shall not miss the opportunity when she is well again do you admire a fine view very well we will vary the drive on our return go back she said to the coachman by highgate and hampstead  fannys eyes rested on the shabby cloak with a wellfounded distrust of it as a protection against the autumn weather she ventured to suggest that her mistress might feel the loss in an open carriage of the warm mantle which she had left on rhodas shoulders  iris made light of the doubt expressed by her maid but by the time they had passed highgate and had approached the beginning of the straight road which crosses the high ridge of hampstead heath she was obliged to acknowledge that she did indeed feel the cold you ought to be a good walker she said looking at her maids firm wellknit figure exercise is all i want to warm me what do you say to going home on foot fanny was ready and willing to accompany her mistress the carriage was dismissed and they set forth on their walk  as they passed the inn called the spaniards two women who were standing at the garden gate stared at iris and smiled a few paces further on they were met by an errandboy he too looked at the young lady and put his hand derisively to his head with a shrill whistle expressive of malicious enjoyment i appear to amuse these people iris said what do they see in me  fanny answered with an effort to preserve her gravity which was not quite successfully disguised i beg your pardon miss i think they notice the curious contrast between your beautiful bonnet and your shabby cloak  persons of excitable temperament have a sense of ridicule and a dread of it unintelligible to their fellowcreatures who are made of coarser material for the moment iris was angry why didnt you tell me of it she asked sharply before i sent away the carriage how can i walk back with everybody laughing at me  she pausedreflected a littleand led the way off the high road on the right to the fine clump of firtrees which commands the famous view in that part of the heath  theres but one thing to be done she said recovering her good temper we must make my grand bonnet suit itself to my miserable cloak you will pull out the feather and rip off the lace and keep them for yourself if you like and then i ought to look shabby enough from head to foot i am sure no not here they may notice us from the roadand what may the fools not do when they see you tearing the ornaments off my bonnet come down below the trees where the ground will hide us  they had nearly descended the steep slope which leads to the valley below the clump of firs when they were stopped by a terrible discovery  close at their feet in a hollow of the ground was stretched the insensible body of a man he lay on his side with his face turned away from them an open razor had dropped close by him iris stooped over the prostate man to examine his face blood flowing from a frightful wound in his throat was the first thing that she saw her eyes closed instinctively recoiling from that ghastly sight the next instant she opened them again and saw his face  dying or dead it was the face of lord harry  the shriek that burst from her on making that horrible discovery was heard by two men who were crossing the lower heath at some distance they saw the women and ran to them one of the men was a labourer the other better dressed looked like a foreman of works he was the first who arrived on the spot  enough to frighten you out of your senses ladies he said civilly its a case of suicide i should say by the look of it  for gods sake let us do something to help him iris burst out i know him i know him  fanny equal to the emergency asked miss henley for her handkerchief joined her own handkerchief to it and began to bandage the wound try if his pulse is beating she said quietly to her mistress the foreman made himself useful by examining the suicides pockets iris thought she could detect a faint fluttering in the pulse is there no doctor living near she cried is there no carriage to be found in this horrible place  the foreman had discovered two letters iris read her own name on one of them the other was addressed to the person who may find my body she tore the envelope open it contained one of mr vimpanys cards with these desperate words written on it in pencil take me to the doctors address and let him bury me or dissect me whichever he pleases iris showed the card to the foreman is it near here she asked yes miss we might get him to that place in no time if there was a conveyance of any kind to be found still preserving her presence of mind fanny pointed in the direction of the spaniards inn we might get what we want there she said shall i go  iris signed to her to attend to the wounded man and ascended the sloping ground she ran on towards the road the men directed by fanny raised the body and slowly followed her diverging to an easier ascent as iris reached the road a fourwheel cab passed her without an instants hesitation she called to the driver to stop he pulled up his horse she confronted a solitary gentleman staring out of the window of the cab and looking as if he thought that a lady had taken a liberty with him iris allowed the outraged stranger no opportunity of expressing his sentiments breathless as she was she spoke first  pray forgive meyou are alone in the cabthere is room for a gentleman dangerously woundedhe will bleed to death if we dont find help for himthe place is close byoh dont refuse me she looked back holding fast by the cab door and saw fanny and the men slowly approaching bring him here she cried  do nothing of the sort shouted the gentleman in possession of the cab  but fanny obeyed her mistress and the men obeyed fanny iris turned indignantly to the merciless stranger i ask you to do an act of christian kindness she said how can you how dare you hesitate  drive on cried the stranger  drive on at your peril iris added on her side  the cabman sat silent and stolid on the box waiting for events  slowly the men came in view bearing lord harry still insensible the handkerchiefs on his throat were saturated with blood at that sight the cowardly instincts of the stranger completely mastered him let me out he clamoured let me out  finding the cab left at her disposal iris actually thanked him he looked at her with an evil eye i have my suspicions i can tell you he muttered if this comes to a trial in a court of law im not going to be mixed up with it innocent people have been hanged before now when appearances were against them  he walked off and by way of completing the revelation of his own meanness forgot to pay his fare  on the point of starting the horse to pursue him the cabman was effectually stopped iris showed him a sovereign upon this hint like othello he spoke  all right miss i see your poor gentleman is ableeding youll take carewont youthat he doesnt spoil my cushions the driver was not a illconditioned man he put the case of his property indulgently with a persuasive smile iris turned to the two worthy fellows who had so readily given her their help and bade them goodbye with a solid expression of her gratitude which they both remembered for many a long day to come fanny was already in the cab supporting lord harrys body iris joined her the cabman drove carefully to mr vimpanys new house    chapter xviii  professional assistance  number five was near the centre of the row of little suburban houses called redburn road  when the cab drew up at the door mr vimpany himself was visible looking out of the window on the ground floorand yawning as he looked iris beckoned to him impatiently anything wrong he asked as he approached the door of the cab she drew back and silently showed him what was wrong the doctor received the shock with composure when he happened to be sober and sad looking for patients and failing to find them mr vimpanys capacity for feeling sympathy began and ended with himself  this is a new scrape even for lord harry he remarked lets get him into the house  the insensible man was carried into the nearest room on the ground floor pale and trembling iris related what had happened and asked if there was no hope of saving him  patience mr vimpany answered ill tell you directly  he removed the bandages and examined the wound theres been a deal of blood lost he said ill try and pull him through while i am about it miss go upstairs if you please and find your way to the drawingroom iris hesitated the doctor opened a neat mahogany box the tools of my trade he continued im going to sew up his lordships throat shuddering as she heard those words iris hurried out of the room fanny followed her mistress up the stairs in her own very different way the maid was as impenetrably composed as mr vimpany himself there was a second letter found in the gentlemans pocket miss she said will you excuse my reminding you that you have not read it yet  iris read the lines that follow  forgive me my dear for the last time my letter is to say that i shall trouble you no more in this worldand as for the other world who knows i brought some money back with me from the goldfields it was not enough to be called a fortunei mean the sort of fortune which might persuade your father to let you marry me well here in england i had an opportunity of making ten times more of it on the turf and let me add with private information of the horses which i might certainly count on to win i dont stop to ask by what cruel roguery i was tempted to my ruin my money is lost and with it my last hope of a happy and harmless life with you comes to an end i die iris dear with the death of that hope something in me seems to shrink from suicide in the ugly gloom of great overgrown london i prefer to make away with myself among the fields where the green will remind me of dear old ireland when you think of me sometimes say to yourself the poor wretch loved meand perhaps the earth will lie lighter on harry for those kind words and the flowers if you favour me by planting a few may grow prettier on my grave  there it ended  the heart of iris sank as she read that melancholy farewell expressed in language at once wild and childish if he survived his desperate attempt at selfdestruction to what end would it lead in silence the woman who loved him put his letter back in her bosom watching her attentivelyaffected it was impossible to say how by that mute distressfanny mere proposed to go downstairs and ask once more what hope there might be for the wounded man iris knew the doctor too well to let the maid leave her on a useless errand  some men might be kindly ready to relieve my suspense she said the man downstairs is not one of them i must wait till he comes to me or sends for me but there is something i wish to say to you while we are alone you have been but a short time in my service fanny is it too soon to ask if you feel some interest in me  if i can comfort you or help you miss be pleased to tell me how she made that reply respectfully in her usual quiet manner her pale cheeks showing no change of colour her faint blue eyes resting steadily on her mistresss face iris went on  if i ask you to keep what has happened on this dreadful day a secret from everybody may i trust youlittle as you know of meas i might have trusted rhoda bennet  i promise it miss in saying those few words the undemonstrative woman seemed to think that she had said enough  iris had no alternative but to ask another favour  and whatever curiosity you may feel will you be content to do me a kindnesswithout wanting an explanation  it is my duty to respect my mistresss secrets i will do my duty no sentiment no offer of respectful sympathy a positive declaration of fidelity left impenetrably to speak for itself was the girls heart hardened by the disaster which had darkened her life or was she the submissive victim of that inbred reserve which shrinks from the frank expression of feeling and lives and dies selfimprisoned in its own secrecy a third explanation founded probably on a steadier basis was suggested by miss henleys remembrance of their first interview fannys nature had revealed a sensitive side when she was first encouraged to hope for a refuge from ruin followed perhaps by starvation and death judging so far from experience a sound conclusion seemed to follow when circumstances strongly excited the girl there was a dormant vitality in her that revived at other times when events failed to agitate her by a direct appeal to personal interests her constitutional reserve held the rule she could be impenetrably honest steadily industrious truly gratefulbut the intuitive expression of feeling on ordinary occasions was beyond her reach  after an interval of nearly half an hour mr vimpany made his appearance pausing in the doorway he consulted his watch and entered on a calculation which presented him favourably from a professional point of view  allow for time lost in reviving my lord when he fainted and stringing him up with a drop of brandy and washing my hands look how clean they are i havent been more than twenty minutes in mending his throat not bad surgery miss henley  is his life safe mr vimpany  thanks to his luckyes  his luck  to be sure in the first place he owes his life to your finding him when you did a little later and it would have been all over with lord harry second piece of luck catching the doctor at home just when he was most wanted third piece of luck our friend didnt know how to cut his own throat properly you neednt look black at me miss im not joking a suicide with a razor in his hand has generally one chance in his favourhe is ignorant of anatomy that is my lords case he has only cut through the upper fleshy part of his throat and has missed the larger blood vessels take my word for it he will do well enough now thanks to you thanks to me and thanks to his own ignorance what do you say to that way of putting it ha my brains are in good working order today i havent been drinking any of mr mountjoys claretdo you take the joke miss henley  chuckling over the recollection of his own drunken audacity he happened to notice fanny mere  hullo is this another injured person in want of me youre as white as a sheet miss if youre going to faint do me a favourwait till i can get the brandybottle oh its natural to you is it i see a thick skin and a slow circulation you will live to be an old woman a friend of yours miss henley  fanny answered composedly for herself i am miss henleys maid sir  whats become of the other one mr vimpany asked aye aye staying at a farmhouse for the benefit of her health is she if i had been allowed time enough i would have made a cure of rhoda bennet there isnt a medical man in england who knows more than i do of the nervous maladies of womenand what is my reward is my waitingroom crammed with rich people coming to consult me do i live in a fashionable square have i even been made a baronet damn iti beg your pardon miss henleybut it is irritating to a man of my capacity to be completely neglected for the last three days not a creature has darkened the doors of this house could i say a word to you  he led iris mysteriously into a corner of the room about our friend downstairs he began  when may we hope that he will be well again mr vimpany  maybe in three weeks in a month at most i have nobody here but a stupid servant girl we ought to have a competent nurse i can get a thoroughly trained person from the hospital but theres a little difficulty i am an outspoken man when i am poor i own i am poor my lord must be well fed the nurse must be well fed would you mind advancing a small loan to provide beforehand for the payment of expenses  iris handed her purse to him sick of the sight of mr vimpany is that all she asked making for the door  much obliged thats all  as they approached the room on the ground floor iris stopped her eyes rested on the doctor even to that coarse creature the eloquent look spoke for her fanny noticed it and suddenly turned her head aside over the maids white face there passed darkly an expression of unutterable contempt her mistresss weakness had revealed itselfweakness for one of the betrayers of women weakness for a man in the meantime mr vimpany having got the money was ready to humour the enviable young lady with a wellfilled purse  do you want to see my lord before you go he asked amused at the idea mind you mustnt disturb him no talking and no crying ready now look at him  there he lay on a shabby little sofa in an ugly little room his eyes closed one helpless hand hanging down a stillness on his ghastly face horribly suggestive of the stillness of deaththere he lay the reckless victim of his love for the woman who had desperately renounced him again and again who had now saved him for the third time ah how her treacherous heart pleaded for him can you drive him away from you after this you who love him what does your coldblooded prudence say when you look at him now  she felt herself drawn roughly and suddenly back into the passage the door was closed the doctor was whispering to her hold up miss i expected better things of you come comeno fainting youll find him a different man tomorrow pay us a visit and judge for yourself  after what she had suffered iris hungered for sympathy isnt it pitiable she said to her maid as they left the house  i dont know miss  you dont know good heavens are you made of stone have you no such thing as a heart in you  not for the men fanny answered i keep my pity for the women  iris knew what bitter remembrances made their confession in those words how she missed rhoda bennet at that moment    chapter xix  mr henley at home  for a month mountjoy remained in his cottage on the shores of the solway firth superintending the repairs  his correspondence with iris was regularly continued and for the first time in his experience of her was a cause of disappointment to him  her replies revealed an incomprehensible change in her manner of writing which became more and more marked in each succeeding instance notice it as he might in his own letters no explanation followed on the part of his correspondent she who had so frankly confided her joys and sorrows to him in past days now wrote with a reserve which seemed only to permit the most vague and guarded allusion to herself the changes in the weather the alternation of public news that was dull and public news that was interesting the absence of her father abroad occasioned by doubt of the soundness of his investments in foreign securities vague questions relating to hughs new place of abode which could only have proceeded from a preoccupied mindthese were the topics on which iris dwelt in writing to her faithful old friend it was hardly possible to doubt that something must have happened which she had reasonsserious reasons as it seemed only too natural to inferfor keeping concealed from mountjoy try as he might to disguise it from himself he now knew how dear how hopelessly dear she was to him by the anxiety that he suffered and by the jealous sense of injury which defied his selfcommand his immediate superintendence of the workmen at the cottage was no longer necessary leaving there a representative whom he could trust he resolved to answer his last letter received from iris in person  the next day he was in london  calling at the house he was informed that miss henley was not at home and that it was impossible to say with certainty when she might return while he was addressing his inquiries to the servant mr henley opened the library door is that you mountjoy he asked come in i want to speak to you  short and thickset with a thinlipped mouth a coarselyflorid complexion and furtive greenish eyes hard in his manner and harsh in his voice mr henley was one of the few heartless men who are innocent of deception on the surface he was externally a person who inspired at first sight feelings of doubt and dislike his manner failed to show even a pretence of being glad to see hugh what he had to say he said walking up and down the room and scratching his bristly irongray hair from time to time those signs of restlessness indicated to those who knew him well that he had a selfish use to make of a fellowcreature and failed to see immediately how to reach the end in view  i say mountjoy he began have you any idea of what my daughter is about  i dont even understand what you mean hugh replied for the last month i have been in scotland  you and she write to each other dont you  yes  hasnt she told you  excuse me for interrupting you mr henley she has told me nothing  mr henley stared absently at the superblybound books on his libraryshelves never degraded by the familiar act of reading and scratched his head more restlessly than ever  look here young man when you were staying with me in the country i rather hoped it might end in a marriage engagement you and iris disappointed menot for the first time but women do change their minds suppose she had changed her mind after having twice refused you suppose she had given you an opportunity  hugh interrupted him again its needless to suppose anything of the sort sir she would not have given me an opportunity  dont fence with me mountjoy ill put it in a milder way if you prefer being humbugged do you feel any interest in that perverse girl of mine  hugh answered readily and warmly the truest interest  even mr henley was human his ugly face looked uglier still it assumed the selfsatisfied expression of a man who had carried his point  now i can go on my friend with what i had to say to you i have been abroad on business and only came back the other day the moment i saw iris i noticed something wrong about her if i had been a stranger i should have said that young woman is not easy in her mind perfectly useless to speak to her about it quite happy and quite wellthere was her own account of herself i tried her maid next a whitelivered sulky creature one of the steadiest liars i have ever met with i know of nothing amiss with my mistress sir there was the maids way of keeping the secret whatever it may be i dont know whether you may have noticed it in the course of your acquaintance with mei hate to be beaten  no mr henley i have not noticed it  then you are informed of it now have you seen my housekeeper  once or twice sir  come youre improving we shall make something of you in course of time well the housekeeper was the next person i spoke to about my daughter had she seen anything strange in miss iris while i was away from home theres a dash of malice in my housekeepers composition i dont object to a dash of malice when the old woman is pleased she shows her yellow fangs she had something to tell me the servants have been talking sir about miss iris out with it maam what do they say they notice sir that their young lady has taken to going out in the forenoon regularly every day always by herself and always in the same direction i dont encourage the servants mr henley there was something insolent in the tone of suspicion that they adopted i told them that miss iris was merely taking her walk they reminded me that it must be a cruelly long walk miss iris being away regularly for four or five hours together before she came back to the house after that says the housekeeper i thought it best to drop the subject what do you think of it yourself mountjoy do you call my daughters conduct suspicious  i see nothing suspicious mr henley when iris goes out she visits a friend  and always goes in the same direction and always visits the same friend mr henley added i felt a curiosity to know who that friend might be and i made the discovery yesterday when you were staying in my house in the country do you remember the man who waited on you  mountjoy began to feel alarmed for iris he answered as briefly as possible  your valet he said  thats it well i took my valet into my confidencenot for the first time i can tell you an invaluable fellow when iris went out yesterday he tracked her to a wretched little suburban place near hampstead heath called redburn road she rang the bell at number five and was at once let inevidently well known there my clever man made inquiries in the neighbourhood the house belongs to a doctor who has lately taken it name of vimpany  mountjoy was not only startled but showed it plainly mr henley still pacing backwards and forwards happened by good fortune to have his back turned towards his visitor at that moment  now i ask you as a man of the world mr henley resumed what does this mean if youre too cautious to speak outand i must say it looks like itshall i set you the example  just as you please sir  very well then ill tell you what i suspect when iris is at home and when theres something amiss in my family i believe that scoundrel lord harry to be at the bottom of it theres my experience and theres my explanation i was on the point of ordering my carriage to go to the doctor myself and insist on knowing what the attraction is that takes my daughter to his house when i heard your voice in the hall you tell me you are interested in iris very well you are just the man to help me  may i ask how mr henley  of course you may you can find your way to her confidence if you choose to try she will trust you when she wont trust her father i dont care two straws about her other secrets but i do want to know whether she is or is not plotting to marry the irish blackguard satisfy me about that and you neednt tell me anything more may i count on you to find out how the land lies  mountjoy listened hardly able to credit the evidence of his own senses he was actually expected to insinuate himself into the confidence of iris and then to betray her to her father he rose and took his hatand without even the formality of a bow opened the door  does that mean no mr henley called after him  most assuredly mountjoy answeredand closed the door behind him    chapter xx  first suspicions of iris  from the last memorable day on which iris had declared to him that he might always count on her as his friend but never as his wife hugh had resolved to subject his feelings to a rigorous control as to conquering his hopeless love he knew but too well that it would conquer him on any future occasion when he and iris happened to meet  he had been true to his resolution at what cost of suffering he and he alone knew sincerely unaffectedly he had tried to remain her friend but the nature of the truest and the firmest man has its weak place where the subtle influence of a woman is concerned deeply latent beyond the reach of his own power of sounding there was jealousy of the irish lord lurking in mountjoy and secretly leading his mind when he hesitated in those emergencies of his life which were connected with iris ignorant of the influence which was really directing him he viewed with contempt mr henleys suspicions of a secret understanding between his daughter and the man who was by her own acknowledgment unworthy of the love with which it had been her misfortune to regard him at the same time hughs mind was reluctantly in search of an explanation which might account without degrading iris for her having been traced to the doctors house in his recollection of events at the old country town he found a motive for her renewal of intercourse with such a man as mr vimpany in the compassionate feeling with which she regarded the doctors unhappy wife there might well be some humiliating circumstance recently added to the other trials of mrs vimpanys married life which had appealed to all that was generous and forgiving in the nature of iris knowing nothing of the resolution to live apart which had latterly separated the doctor and his wife mountjoy decided on putting his idea to the test by applying for information to mrs vimpany at her husbands house  in the nature of a sensitive man the bare idea of delay under these circumstances was unendurable hugh called the first cab that passed him and drove to hampstead  carefulmorbidly careful perhapsnot to attract attention needlessly to himself he stopped the cab at the entrance to redburn road and approached number five on foot a servantgirl answered the door mountjoy asked if mrs vimpany was at home  the girl made no immediate reply she seemed to be puzzled by mountjoys simple question her familiar manner with its vulgar assumption of equality in the presence of a stranger revealed the londonbred maidservant of modern times did you say mrs vimpany she inquired sharply  yes  theres no such person here  it was mountjoys turn to be puzzled is this mr vimpanys house he said  yes to be sure it is  and yet mrs vimpany doesnt live here  no mrs vimpany has darkened these doors the girl declared positively  are you sure you are not making a mistake  quite sure i have been in the doctors service since he first took the house  determined to solve the mystery if it could be done mountjoy asked if he could see the doctor no mr vimpany had gone out  theres a young person comes to us the servant continued i wonder whether you mean her when you ask for mrs vimpany the name she gives is henley  is miss henley here now  you cant see hershes engaged  she was not engaged with mrs vimpany for no such person was known in the house she was not engaged with the doctor for the doctor had gone out mountjoy looked at the hatstand in the passage and discovered a mans hat and a mans greatcoat to whom did they belong certainly not to mr vimpany who had gone out repellent as it was mr henleys idea that the explanation of his daughters conduct was to be found in the renewed influence over her of the irish lord now presented itself to hughs mind under a new point of view he tried in vain to resist the impression that had been produced on him a sense of injury which he was unable to justify to himself took possession of him come what might of it he determined to set at rest the doubts of which he was ashamed by communicating with iris his cardcase proved to be empty when he opened it but there were letters in his pocket addressed to him at his hotel in london removing the envelope from one of these he handed it to the servant take that to miss henley and ask when i can see her  the girl left him in the passage and went upstairs to the drawingroom  in the flimsilybuilt little house he could hear the heavy step of a man crossing the room above and then the resonant tones of a mans voice raised as if in anger had she given him already the right to be angry with her he thought of the time when the betrayal of lord harrys vindictive purpose in leaving england had frightened herwhen he had set aside his own sense of what was due to him for her sakeand had helped her to communicate by letter with the man whose fatal ascendency over iris had saddened his life was what he heard now the return that he had deserved  after a short absence the servant came back with a message  miss henley begs you will excuse her she will write to you  would this promised letter be like the other letters which he had received from her in scotland mountjoys gentler nature reminded him that he owed it to his remembrance of happier days and truer friendship to wait and see  he was just getting into the cab on his return to london when a closed carriage with one person in it passed him on its way to redburn road in that person he recognised mr henley as the cabdriver mounted to his seat hugh saw the carriage stop at number five    chapter xxi  the parting scene  the evening had advanced and the candles had just been lit in mountjoys sittingroom at the hotel  his anxiety to hear from iris had been doubled and trebled since he had made the discovery of her fathers visit to the doctors house at a time when it was impossible to doubt that lord harry was with her hughs jealous sense of wrong was now mastered by the nobler emotions which filled him with pity and alarm when he thought of iris placed between the contending claims of two such men as the heartless mr henley and the reckless irish lord he had remained at the hotel through the long afternoon on the chance that she might write to him speedily by the hand of a messengerand no letter had arrived he was still in expectation of news which might reach him by the evening post when the waiter knocked at the door  a letter mountjoy asked  no sir the man answered a lady  before she could raise her veil hugh had recognised iris her manner was subdued her face was haggard her hand lay cold and passive in his hand when he advanced to bid her welcome he placed a chair for her by the fire she thanked him and declined to take it with the air of a woman conscious of committing an intrusion she seated herself apart in a corner of the room  i have tried to write to you and i have not been able to do it she said that with a dogged resignation of tone and manner so unlike herself that mountjoy looked at her in dismay my friend she went on your pity is all i may hope for i am no longer worthy of the interest you once felt in me  hugh saw that it would be useless to remonstrate he asked if it had been his misfortune to offend her  no she said you have not offended me  then what in heavens name does this change in you mean  it means she said as coldly as ever that i have lost my selfrespect it means that my father has renounced me and that you will do well to follow his example have i not led you to believe that i could never be the wife of lord harry well i have deceived youi am going to marry him  i cant believe it iris i wont believe it  she handed him the letter in which the irishman had declared his resolution to destroy himself hugh read it with contempt did my lords heart fail him he asked scornfully  he would have died by his own hand mr mountjoy  oh irismr  i will say hugh if you prefer itbut the days of our familiar friendship are none the less at an end i found lord harry bleeding to death from a wound in his throat it was in a lonely place on hampstead heath i was the one person who happened to pass by it for the third time you see it has been my destiny to save him how can i forget that my mind will dwell on it i try to find happinessoh only happiness enough for mein cheering my poor irishman on his way back to the life that i have preserved there is my motive if i have a motive day after day i have helped to nurse him day after day i have heard him say things to mewhat is the use of repeating them after years of resistance i have given way let that be enough my one act of discretion has been to prevent a quarrel between my father and harry i beg your pardon i ought to have said lord harry when my father came to the house i insisted on speaking with him alone i told him what i have just told you he said think again before you make your choice between that man and me if you decide to marry him you will live and die without one farthing of my money to help you he put his watch on the table between us and gave me five minutes to make up my mind it was a long five minutes but it ended at last he asked me which he was to doleave his will as it was or go to his lawyer and make another i said you will do as you please sir no it was not a hasty replyyou cant make that excuse for me i knew what i was saying and i saw the future i was preparing for myself as plainly as you see it  hugh could endure no longer the reckless expression of her despair  no he cried you dont see your future as i see it will you hear what i have to say before it is too late  it is too late already but i will listen to you if you wish it  and while you listen mountjoy added you will acquit me of being influenced by a selfish motive i have loved you dearly perhaps in secret i love you still but this i know if you were to remain a single woman for the rest of your life there would be no hope for me do you believe that i am speaking the truth  you always speak the truth  i speak in your interest at least you think you see your future life plainlyyou are blind to your future life you talk as if you were resigned to suffer are you resigned to lose your sense of right and wrong are you resigned to lead the life of an outlaw andworse stillnot to feel the disgrace of it  go on hugh  you wont answer me  i wont shock you  you dont discourage me my dear i am still obstinate in the hope of restoring you to your calmer and truer self let me do every justice to lord harry i believe sincerely believe that his miserable life has not utterly destroyed in him the virtues which distinguish an honourable man but he has one terrible defect in his nature there is the fatal pliability which finds companionable qualities in bad friends in this aspect of his character he is a dangerous manand he may be forgive me a bad husband it is a thankless task to warn you to any good purpose a wifeand a loving wife more than anotherfeels the deteriorating influence of a husband who is not worthy of her his ways of thinking are apt to become little by little her ways of thinking she makes allowances for him which he does not deserve her sense of right and wrong becomes confused and before she is aware of it herself she has sunk to his level are you angry with me  how can i be angry with you perhaps you are right  do you really mean that  oh yes  then for gods sake reconsider your decision let me go to your father  mere waste of time iris answered nothing that you can say will have the least effect on him  at any rate mountjoy persisted i mean to try  had he touched her she smiledhow bitterly hugh failed to perceive  shall i tell you what happened to me when i went home today she said i found my maid waiting in the hallwith everything that belongs to me packed up for my departure the girl explained that she had been forced to obey my fathers positive orders i knew what that meanti had to leave the house and find a place to live in  not by yourself iris  nowith my maid she is a strange creature if she feels sympathy she never expresses it i am your grateful servant miss where you go i go that was all she said i was not disappointedi am getting used to fanny mere already mine is a lonely lotisnt it i have acquaintances among the few ladies who sometimes visit at my fathers house but no friends my mothers family as i have always been told cast her off when she married a man in trade with a doubtful reputation i dont even know where my relations live isnt lord harry good enough for me as i am now when i look at my prospects is it wonderful if i talk like a desperate woman there is but one encouraging circumstance that i can see this misplaced love of mine that everybody condemns has oddly enough a virtue that everybody must admire it offers a refuge to a woman who is alone in the world  mountjoy denied indignantly that she was alone in the world  is there any protection that a man can offer to a woman he asked which i am not ready and eager to offer to you oh iris what have i done to deserve that you should speak of yourself as friendless in my hearing  he had touched her at last their tender charm showed itself once more in her eyes and in her smile she rose and approached him  what exquisite kindness it must be she said that blinds a clever man like you to obstacles which anyone else can see remember dear hugh what the world would say to that protection which your true heart offers to me are you my near relation are you my guardian are you even an old man ah me you are only an angel of goodness whom i must submit to lose i shall still count on your kindness when we see each other no more you will pity me when you hear that i have fallen lower and lower you will be sorry for me when i end in disgracing myself  even then iris we shall not be separated the loving friend who is near you now will be your loving friend still  for the first time in her life she threw her arms round him in the agony of that farewell she held him to her bosom goodbye dear she said faintlyand kissed him  the next moment a deadly pallor overspread her face she staggered as she drew back and dropped into the chair that she had just left in the fear that she might faint mountjoy hurried out in search of a restorative his bedchamber was close by at the end of the corridor and there were smellingsalts in his dressingcase as he raised the lid he heard the door behind him the one door in the room locked from the outer side  he rushed to the door and called to her from the farther end of the corridor her voice reached him for the last time repeating the last melancholy word goodbye no renewal of the miserable parting scene no more of the heartacheiris had ended it    chapter xxii  the fatal words  when mountjoy had rung for the servant and the bedroom door had been unlocked it was too late to follow the fugitive her cab was waiting for her outside and the attention of the porter had been distracted at the same time by a new arrival of travellers at the hotel  it is more or less in the nature of all men who are worthy of the name to take refuge from distress in action hugh decided on writing to iris and on making his appeal to her father that evening he abstained from alluding in his letter to the manner in which she had left him it was her right it was even her duty to spare herself all that he asked was to be informed of her present place of residence so that he might communicate the resultin writing only if she preferred itof his contemplated interview with her father he addressed his letter to the care of mr vimpany to be forwarded and posted it himself  this done he went on at once to mr henleys house  the servant who opened the door had evidently received his orders mr henley was not at home mountjoy was in no humour to be trifled with he pushed the man out of his way and made straight for the diningroom there as his previous experience of the habits of the household had led him to anticipate was the man whom he was determined to see the table was laid for mr henleys late dinner  hughs wellmeant attempt to plead the daughters cause with the father ended as iris had said it would end  after hotly resenting the intrusion on him that had been committed mr henley declared that a codicil to his will depriving his daughter absolutely of all interest in his property had been legally executed that day for a time mountjoys selfcontrol had resisted the most merciless provocation all that it was possible to effect by patient entreaty and respectful remonstrance he had tried again and again and invariably in vain at last mr henleys unbridled insolence triumphed hugh lost his temperand in leaving the heartless old man used language which he afterwards remembered with regret  to feel that he had attempted to assert the interests of iris and that he had failed was in hughs heated state of mind an irresistible stimulant to further exertion it was perhaps not too late yet to make another attempt to delay if not to prevent the marriage  in sheer desperation mountjoy resolved to inform lord harry that his union with miss henley would be followed by the utter ruin of her expectations from her father whether the wild lord only considered his own interests or whether he was loyally devoted to the interests of the woman whom he loved in either case the penalty to be paid for the marriage was formidable enough to make him hesitate  the lights in the lower window and in the passage told hugh that he had arrived in good time at redburn road  he found mr vimpany and the young irishman sitting together in the friendliest manner under the composing influence of tobacco primed as he would have said himself with only a third glass of grog the hospitable side of the doctors character was displayed to view he at once accepted mountjoys visit as offering a renewal of friendly relations between them  forgive and forget he said theres the way to settle that little misunderstanding after our dinner at the inn you know mr mountjoy my lord thats right draw in your chair mountjoy my professional prospects threaten me with ruinbut while i have a roof over my head theres always a welcome for a friend my dear fellow i have every reason to believe that the doctor who sold me this practice was a swindler the money is gone and the patients dont come well i am not quite bankrupt yet i can offer you a glass of grog mix for yourselfwell make a night of it  hugh explained with the necessary excuses that his object was to say a few words to lord harry in private the change visible in the doctors manner when he had been made acquainted with this circumstance was not amiably expressed he had the air of a man who suspected that an unfair advantage had been taken of him lord harry on his side appeared to feel some hesitation in granting a private interview to mr mountjoy  is it about miss henley he asked  hugh admitted that it was lord harry thereupon suggested that they might be acting wisely if they avoided the subject mountjoy answered that there were on the contrary reasons for approaching the subject sufficiently important to have induced him to leave london for hampstead at a late hour of the night  hearing this lord harry rose to lead the way to another room excluded from his visitors confidence mr vimpany could at least remind mountjoy that he exercised authority as master of the house oh take him upstairs my lord said the doctor you are at home under my humble roof  the two young men faced each other in the barelyfurnished drawingroom both sufficiently doubtful of the friendly result of the conference to abstain from seating themselves hugh came to the point without wasting time in preparatory words admitting that he had heard of miss henleys engagement he asked if lord harry was aware of the disastrous consequences to the young lady which would follow her marriage the reply to this was frankly expressed the irish lord knew nothing of the consequences to which mr mountjoy had alluded hugh at once enlightened him and evidently took him completely by surprise  may i ask sir he said if you are speaking from your own personal knowledge  i have just come my lord from mr henleys house and what i have told you i heard from his own lips  there was a pause hugh was already inclined to think that he had raised an obstacle to the immediate celebration of the marriage a speedy disappointment was in store for him lord harry was too fond of iris to be influenced in his relations with her by mercenary considerations  you put it strongly he said but let me tell you miss henley is far from being so dependent on her fatherhe ought to be ashamed of himself but thats neither here nor therei say she is far from being so dependent on her father as you seem to think i am not i beg to inform you without resources which i shall offer to her with all my heart and soul perhaps you wish me to descend to particulars oh its easily done i have sold my cottage in ireland  for a large sumin these times hugh inquired  never mind the sum mr mountjoylet the fact be enough for you and while we are on the question of money a disgusting question with which i refuse to associate the most charming woman in existence dont forget that miss henley has an income of her own derived as i understand from her mothers fortune you will do me the justice sir to believe that i shall not touch a farthing of it  certainly but her mothers fortune mountjoy continued obstinately presenting the subject on its darkest side consists of shares in a company shares rise and falland companies some times fail  and a friends anxiety about miss henleys affairs sometimes takes a mighty disagreeable form the irishman added his temper beginning to show itself without disguise lets suppose the worst that can happen and get all the sooner to the end of a conversation which is far from being agreeable to me well say if you like that miss henleys shares are waste paper and her pockets god bless her as empty as pockets can be does she run any other risk that occurs to your ingenuity in becoming my wife  yes she does hugh was provoked into saying in the case you have just supposed she runs the risk of being left a destitute widowif you die  he was prepared for an angry replyfor another quarrel added on that disastrous night to the quarrel with mr henley to his astonishment lord harrys brightlyexpressive eyes rested on him with a look of mingled distress and alarm god forgive me he said to himself i never thought of that what am i to do what am i to do  mountjoy observed that deep discouragement and failed to understand it  here was a desperate adventurer whose wanderings had over and over again placed his life in jeopardy now apparently overcome by merely having his thoughts directed to the subject of death to place on the circumstances such a construction as this was impossible after a moments reflection the other alternative was to assume that there must be some anxiety burdening lord harrys mind which he had motives for keeping concealedand here indeed the true explanation had been found the irish lord had reasons known only to himself for recoiling from the contemplation of his own future after the murder of arthur mountjoy he had severed his connection with the assassinating brotherhood of the invincibles and he had then been warned that he took this step at the peril of his life if he remained in great britain after he had made himself an object of distrust to his colleagues the discovery by the secret tribunal of his return from south africa would be followed inevitably by the sentence of death such was the terrible position which mountjoys reply had ignorantly forced him to confront his fate depended on the doubtful security of his refuge in the doctors house  while hugh was still looking at him in grave doubt a new idea seemed to spring to life in lord harrys mind he threw off the oppression that had weighed on his spirits in an instant his manner towards mountjoy changed with the suddenness of a flash of light from the extreme of coldness to the extreme of cordiality  i have got it at last he exclaimed lets shake hands my dear sir youre the best friend i have ever had  the cool englishman asked in what way  in this way to be sure you have reminded me that i can provide for miss henleyand the sooner the better theres our friend the doctor downstairs ready to be my reference dont you see it  obstacles that might prevent the marriage mountjoy was ready enough to see facilities that might hasten the marriage found his mind hard of access to new impressions  are you speaking seriously he said  the irishmans irritable temper began to show itself again  why do you doubt it he asked  i fail to understand you mountjoy replied  neveras events were yet to provehad words of such serious import fallen from lord harrys lips as the words that he spoke next  clear your mind of jealousy he said and you will understand me well enough i agree with you that i am bound to provide for my widowand i mean to do it by insuring my life  the end of the second period    third period    chapter xxiii  news of iris  after his interview with the irish lord mountjoy waited for two days in the expectation of hearing from iris no reply arrived had mr vimpany failed to forward the letter that had been entrusted to him  on the third day hugh wrote to make inquiries  the doctor returned the letter that had been confided to his care and complained in his reply of the ungrateful manner in which he had been treated miss henley had not trusted him with her new address in london and lord harry had suddenly left redburn road bidding his host goodbye in a few lines of commonplace apology and nothing more mr vimpany did not deny that he had been paid for his medical services but he would ask was nothing due to friendship was one man justified in enjoying another mans hospitality and then treating him like a stranger i have done with them bothand i recommend you my dear sir to follow my example in those terms the angry and sober doctor expressed his sentiments and offered his advice  mountjoy laid down the letter in despair  his last poor chance of preventing the marriage depended on his being still able to communicate with irisand she was as completely lost to him as if she had taken flight to the other end of the world it might have been possible to discover her by following the movements of lord harry but he too had disappeared without leaving a trace behind him the precious hours and days were passingand hugh was absolutely helpless  tortured by anxiety and suspense he still lingered at the hotel in london more than once he decided on giving up the struggle and returning to his pretty cottage in scotland more than once he deferred taking the journey at one time he dreaded to hear that iris was married if she wrote to him at another time he felt mortified and disappointed by the neglect which her silence implied was she near him or far from him in england or out of england who could say  after more weary days of waiting and suffering a letter arrived addressed to mountjoy in a strange handwriting and bearing the postmark of paris the signature revealed that his correspondent was lord harry  his first impulse was to throw the letter into the fire unread there could be little doubt after the time that had passed of the information that it would contain could he endure to be told of the marriage of iris by the man who was her husband never there was something humiliating in the very idea of it he arrived at that conclusionand what did he do in spite of it he read the letter  lord harry wrote with scrupulous politeness of expression he regretted that circumstances had prevented him from calling on mr mountjoy before he left england after the conversation that had taken place at mr vimpanys house he felt it his duty to inform mr mountjoy that he had insured his lifeand he would add for a sum of money amply and more than amply sufficient to provide for his wife in the event of her surviving him lady harry desired her kind regards and would write immediately to her old and valued friend in the meantime he would conclude by repeating the expression of his sense of obligation to mr mountjoy  hugh looked back at the first page of the letter in search of the writers address it was simply paris the intention to prevent any further correspondence or any personal communication could hardly have been more plainly implied in another moment the letter was in the fire  in two days more hugh heard from iris  she too wrote regretfully of the sudden departure from england adding however that it was her own doing a slip of the tongue on lord harrys part in the course of conversation had led her to fear that he was still in danger from political conspirators with whom he had imprudently connected himself she had accordingly persuaded him to tell her the whole truth and had thereupon insisted on an immediate departure for the continent she and her husband were now living in paris lord harry having friends in that city whose influence might prove to be of great importance to his pecuniary prospects some sentences followed expressing the writers grateful remembrance of all that she had owed to hugh in past days and her earnest desire that they might still hear of each other from time to time by correspondence she could not venture to anticipate the pleasure of receiving a visit from him under present circumstances but she hoped that he would not object to write to her addressing his letters for the present to postrestante  in a postscript a few words were added alluding to mr vimpany hugh was requested not to answer any inquiries which that bad man might venture to make relating to her husband or to herself in the bygone days she had been thankful to the doctor for the care which he had taken medically speaking of rhoda bonnet but since that time his behaviour to his wife and the opinions which he had expressed in familiar conversation with lord harry had convinced her that he was an unprincipled person all further communication with him if her influence could prevent it must come to an end  still as far as ever from feeling reconciled to the marriage mountjoy read this letter with a feeling of resentment which disinclined him to answer it  he believed quite erroneously that iris had written to him under the superintendence of her husband there were certain phrases which had been as he chose to suspect dictated by lord harrys distrustjealous distrust perhapsof his wifes friend mountjoy would wait to reply until as he bitterly expressed it iris was able to write to him without the assistance of her master  again he thought of returning to scotlandand again he hesitated  on this occasion he discovered objections to the cottage which had not occurred to him while iris was a single woman the situation was solitary his nearest neighbours were fishermen here and there at some little distance there were only a few scattered houses inhabited by retired tradesmen further away yet there was the countryseat of an absent person of distinction whose health suffered in the climate of scotland the lonely life in prospect on the shores of the solway now daunted mountjoy for the first time  he decided on trying what society in london would do to divert his mind from the burdens and anxieties that weighed on it acquaintances whom he had neglected were pleasantly surprised by visits from their rich and agreeable young friend he attended dinner parties he roused hope in mothers and daughters by accepting invitations to balls he reappeared at his club was there any relief to his mind in this was there even amusement no he was acting a part and he found it a hard task to keep up appearances after a brief and brilliant interval society knew him no more  left by himself again he enjoyed one happy evening in london it was the evening on which he relented in spite of himself and wrote to iris    chapter xxiv  lord harrys honeymoon  the next day hugh received a visit from the last person in the little world of his acquaintance whom he expected to see the lost mrs vimpany presented herself at the hotel  she looked unnaturally older since mountjoy had last seen her her artificial complexion was gone the discarded rouge that had once overlaid her cheeks through a long succession of years had left the texture of the skin coarse and had turned the colour of it to a dull yellowish tinge her hair once so skilfully darkened was now permitted to tell the truth and revealed the sober colouring of age in gray the lower face had fallen away in substance and even the penetrating brightness of her large dark eyes was a little dimmed all that had been left in her of the attractions of past days owed its vital preservation to her stage training her suave grace of movement and the deep elocutionary melody of her voice still identified mrs vimpanydisguised as she was in a dress of dull brown shorn without mercy of the milliners hideous improvements to the figure will you shake hands with me mr mountjoy those were the first words she said to him in a sad subdued manner on entering the room  why not hugh asked giving her his hand  you can have no very favourable remembrance of me she answered but i hope to produce a better impressionif you can spare me a little of your time you may or may not have heard of my separation from my husband anyway it is needless to trouble you on the subject you know mr vimpany you can guess what i have suffered and why i have left him if he comes to you i hope you will not tell him where lady harry is  hugh interposed pray dont speak of her by that name call her iris as i do  a faint reflection of the old stagesmile trembled on mrs vimpanys worn and weary face  ah mr mountjoy i know whom she ought to have married the worst enemy of women is their ignorance of menand they only learn to know better when it is too late i try to be hopeful for iris in the time to come but my fears conquer me  she paused sighed and pressed her open hand on her bosom unconsciously betraying in that action some of the ineradicable training of the theatre  i am almost afraid to say that i love iris she resumed but this i know if i am not so bad as i once was i owe it to that dearest and sweetest of women but for the days that i passed in her company i might never have tried to atone for my past life by works of mercy when other people take the way of amendment i wonder whether they find it as hard to follow at first as i did  there is no doubt of it mrs vimpanyif people are sincere beware of the sinners who talk of sudden conversion and perfect happiness may i ask how you began your new life  i began unhappily mr mountjoyi joined a nursing sisterhood before long a dispute broke out among them think of women who call themselves christians quarrelling about churches and church servicespriests vestments and attitudes and candles and incense i left them and went to a hospital and found the doctors better christians than the sisters i am not talking about my own poor self as you will soon see without a reason my experience in the hospital led to other things i nursed a lady through a tedious illness and was trusted to take her to some friends in the south of france on my return i thought of staying for a few days in parisit was an opportunity of seeing how the nurses did their work in the french hospitals and oh it was far more than that in paris i found iris again  by accident hugh asked  i am not sure mrs vimpany answered that there are such things as meetings by accident she and her husband were among the crowds of people on the boulevards who sit taking their coffee in view of the other crowds passing along the street i went by without noticing them she saw me and sent lord harry to bring me back i have been with them every day at her invitation from that time to this and i have seen their life  she stopped noticing that hugh grew restless i am in doubt she said whether you wish to hear more of their life in paris  mountjoy at once controlled himself  go on he said quietly  even if i tell you that iris is perfectly happy  go on hugh repeated  may i confess she resumed that her husband is irresistiblenot only to his wife but even to an old woman like me after having known him for years at his worst as well as at his best i am still foolish enough to feel the charm of his high spirits and his delightful goodhumour sober english people if they saw him now would almost think him a fit subject to be placed under restraint one of his wild irish ideas of expressing devotion to his wife is that they shall forget they are married and live the life of lovers when they dine at a restaurant he insists on having a private room he takes her to public balls and engages her to dance with him for the whole evening when she stays at home and is a little fatigued he sends me to the piano and whirls her round the room in a waltz nothing revives a woman he says like dancing with the man she loves when she is out of breath and i shut up the piano do you know what he does he actually kisses meand says he is expressing his wifes feeling for me when she is not able to do it herself he sometimes dines out with men and comes back all on fire with the good wine and more amiable than ever on these occasions his pockets are full of sweetmeats stolen for his angel from the dessert am i a little tipsy he asks oh dont be angry its all for love of you i have been in the highest society my darling proposing your health over and over and over again and drinking to you deeper than all the rest of the company you dont blame me ah but i blame myself i was wrong to leave you and dine with men what do i want with the society of men when i have your society drinking your health is a lame excuse i will refuse all invitations for the future that dont include my wife andmindhe really means it at the time two or three days later he forgets his good resolutions and dines with the men again and comes home with more charming excuses and stolen sweetmeats and good resolutions i am afraid i weary you mr mountjoy  you surprise me hugh replied why do i hear all this of lord harry  mrs vimpany left her chair the stage directions of other days had accustomed her to rise when the character she played had anything serious to say her own character still felt the animating influence of dramatic habit she rose now and laid her hand impressively on mountjoys shoulder  i have not thoughtlessly tried your patience she said now that i am away from the influence of lord harry i can recall my former experience of him and i am afraid i can see the end that is coming he will drift into bad company he will listen to bad advice and he will do things in the future which he might shrink from doing now when that time comes i fear him i fear him  when that time comes hugh repeated if i have any influence left over his wife he shall find her capable of protecting herself will you give me her address in paris  willinglyif you will promise not to go to her till she really needs you  who is to decide when she needs me  i am to decide mrs vimpany answered iris writes to me confidentially if anything happens which she may be unwilling to trust to a letter i believe i shall hear of it from her maid  are you sure the maid is to be relied on mountjoy interposed  she is a silent creature so far as i know anything of her mrs vimpany admitted and her manner doesnt invite confidence but i have spoken with fanny mere i am satisfied that she is true to her mistress and grateful to her mistress in her own strange way if iris is in any danger i shall not be left in ignorance of it does this incline you to consult with me before you decide on going to paris dont stand on ceremony say honestly yes or no  honestly hugh said yes  he was at once trusted with the address of iris at the same time mrs vimpany undertook that he should know what news she received from paris as soon as she knew it herself on that understanding they parted for the time being    chapter xxv  the doctor in difficulties  slowly the weeks passed strictly mrs vimpany kept her promise  when she heard from iris the letter was always sent to hugh to be returned after he had read it events in the lives of the newlymarried pair many of which pointed to the end that mrs vimpany saw and dreaded were lightly sometimes jestingly related by the young wife her blind belief in her husband sincerely asserted in the earlier part of the correspondence began to betray in her later letters signs of self delusion it was sad indeed to see that bright intelligence rendered incapable of conceiving suspicions which might have occurred to the mind of a child  when the latest news from paris followed in due course mountjoy was informed of it by a note from mrs vimpany expressed in these terms  my last letter from iris is really no letter at all it simply encloses a circular with her love and asks me to send it on to you if it is in your power to make inquiries in the right quarter i am sure you will not hesitate to take the trouble there can be little doubt as i think that lord harry is engaged in a hazardous speculation more deeply than his wife is willing to acknowledge  the circular announced the contemplated publication of a weekly newspaper printed partly in english and partly in french having its chief office in paris and being intended to dispute the advantages of a european circulation with the wellknown continental journal called galignanis messenger a first list of contributors included names of some notoriety in the literature of england and the literature of france speculators who wished to know in the first place on what security they might reckon were referred to the managing committee represented by persons of importance in the financial worlds of london and paris  being in a position to make the inquiries which mrs vimpany had suggested hugh received information which verified the statements contained in the circular and vouched for the good faith of those persons who were concerned in directing the speculation so far so good  but when the question of success was next discussed the authorities consulted shook their wise heads it was impossible to say what losses might not be suffered and what sums of money might not be required before the circulation of the new journal would justify the hope of success this opinion hugh communicated to mrs vimpany iris was informed of it by that days post  a longer time than usual elapsed before any further news of lord harry and his wife was received by mountjoy when he did at last hear again from mrs vimpany she forwarded a letter from iris dated from a new address in the suburb of paris called passy  from motives of economy iris wrote her husband had decided on a change of residence they were just established in their new abode with the advantages of a saving in rent a pretty little garden to cultivate and purer air to breathe than the air of paris there the letter ended without the slightest allusion to the forthcoming newspaper or to the opinion that had been pronounced on the prospects of success  in forwarding this letter mrs vimpany wrote on the blank page as follows i am sorry to add that some disquieting news of my husband has reached me for the present i will say no more it is at least possible that the report may not be worthy of belief  a few days later the report was confirmed under circumstances which had certainly not been foreseen mr vimpany himself arrived at the hotel on a visit to mountjoy  always more or less superior to the amiable weakness of modesty the doctor seemed to have risen higher than ever in his own estimation since hugh had last seen him he strutted he stared confidently at persons and things authority was in his voice when he spoke and lofty indulgence distinguished his manner when he listened  how are you he cried with a grand gaiety as he entered the room fine weather isnt it for the time of year you dont look well i wonder whether you notice any change in me  you seem to be in good spirits hugh replied not very cordially  do i carry my head high mr vimpany went on when calamity strikes at a man dont let him cringe and cry for pitylet him hit back again those are my principles look at me now do look at me here i am a cultivated person a member of an honourable profession a man of art and accomplishmentstripped of every blessed thing belonging to me but the clothes i stand up in give me your hand mountjoy its the hand sir of a bankrupt  you dont seem to mind it much mountjoy remarked  why should i mind it asked the doctor there isnt a medical man in england who has less reason to reproach himself than i have have i wasted money in rash speculations not a farthing have i been fool enough to bet at horse races my worst enemy darent say it of me what have i done then i have toiled after virtuethats what i have done oh theres nothing to laugh at when a doctor tries to be the medical friend of humanity when he only asks leave to cure disease to soothe pain to preserve lifeisnt that virtue and what is my reward i sit at home waiting for my suffering fellowcreatures and the only fellowcreatures who come to me are too poor to pay i have gone my rounds calling on the rich patients whom i bought when i bought the practice not one of them wanted me men women and children were all inexcusably healthydevil take them is it wonderful if a man becomes bankrupt in such a situation as mine by jupiter i go farther than that i say a man owes it to himself as a protest against undeserved neglect to become a bankrupt if you will allow me ill take a chair  he sat down with an air of impudent independence and looked round the room a little cabinet containing liqueurs stood open on the sideboard mr vimpany got up again may i take a friendly liberty he saidand helped himself without waiting for permission  hugh bore with this mindful of the mistake that he had committed in consenting to receive the doctor at the same time he was sufficiently irritated to take a friendly liberty on his side he crossed the room to the sideboard and locked up the liqueurs mr vimpanys brazen face flushed deeply not with shame he opened his lips to say something worthy of himself controlled the impulse and burst into a boisterous laugh he had evidently some favour still to ask  devilish good he broke out cheerfully do you remember the landladys claret ha you dont want to tempt me this time well well to return to my bankruptcy  hugh had heard enough of his visitors bankruptcy i am not one of your creditors he said  mr vimpany made a smart reply dont you be too sure of that wait a little  do you mean mountjoy asked that you have come here to borrow money of me  timegive me time the doctor pleaded this is not a matter to be dispatched in a hurry this is a matter of business you will hardly believe it he resumed but i have actually been in my present position once before he looked towards the cabinet of liqueurs if i had the key he said i should like to try a drop more of your good curacoa you dont see it  i am waiting to hear what your business is hugh replied  mr vimpanys pliable temper submitted with perfect amiability quite right he said let us return to business i am a man who possesses great fertility of resource on the last occasion when my creditors pounced on my property do you think i was discouraged nothing of the sort my regular medical practice had broken down under me very welli tried my luck as a quack in plain english i invented a patent medicine the one thing wanting was money enough to advertise it false friends buttoned up their pockets you see  oh yes i see  in that case mr vimpany continued you will not be surprised to hear that i draw on my resources again you have no doubt noticed that we live in an age of amateurs amateurs write paint compose music perform on the stage i too am one of the accomplished persons who have taken possession of the field of art did you observe the photographic portraits on the walls of my diningroom they are of my doing sirwhether you observed them or not i am one of the handy medical men who can use the photograph not that i mention it generally the public have got a narrowminded notion that a doctor ought to be nothing but a doctor my name wont appear in a new work that i am contemplating of course you want to know what my new work is ill tell you in the strictest confidence imagine if you can a series of superb photographs of the most eminent doctors in england with memoirs of their lives written by themselves published once a month price halfacrown if there isnt money in that idea there is no money in anything exert yourself my good friend tell me what you think of it  i dont understand the subject mountjoy replied may i ask why you take me into your confidence  because i look upon you as my best friend  you are very good but surely mr vimpany you have older friends in your circle of acquaintance than i am  not one the doctor answered promptly whom i trust as i trust you let me give you a proof of it  is the proof in any way connected with money hugh inquired  i call that hard on me mr vimpany protested no unfriendly interruptions mountjoy i offer a proof of kindly feeling do you mean to hurt me  certainly not go on  thank you a little encouragement goes a long way with me i have found a bookseller who will publish my contemplated work on commission not a soul has yet seen the estimate of expenses i propose to show it to you  quite needless mr vimpany  why quite needless  because i decline lending you the money  no no mountjoy you cant really mean that  i do mean it  no  yes  the doctors face showed a sudden change of expressiona sinister and threatening change dont drive me into a corner he said think of it again  hughs capacity for controlling himself gave way at last  do you presume to threaten me he said understand if you please that my mind is made up and that nothing you can say or do will alter it  with that declaration he rose from his chair and waited for mr vimpanys departure  the doctor put on his hat his eyes rested on hugh with a look of diabolical malice the time is not far off mr mountjoy when you may be sorry you refused me he said those words deliberatelyand took his leave  released from the mans presence hugh found himself strangely associating the interests of iris with the languageotherwise beneath noticewhich mr vimpany had used on leaving the room  in desperate straits for want of money how would the audacious bankrupt next attempt to fill his empty purse if he had by any chance renewed his relations with his irish friendand such an event was at least possiblehis next experiment in the art of raising a loan might take him to paris lord harry had already ventured on a speculation which called for an immediate outlay of money and which was only expected to put a profit into his pocket at some future period in the meanwhile his resources in money had their limits and his current expenses would make imperative demands on an illfilled purse if the temptation to fail in his resolution to respect his wifes fortune was already trying his fortitude what better excuse could be offered for yielding than the necessities of an old friend in a state of pecuniary distress  looking at the position of iris and at the complications which threatened it from this point of view mountjoy left the hotel to consult with mrs vimpany it rested with her to decide whether the circumstances justified his departure for paris    chapter xxvi  london and paris  informed of all that hugh could tell her relating to his interview with her husband mrs vimpany understood and appreciated his fears for the future she failed however to agree with him that he would do well to take the journey to france under present circumstances  wait a little longer in london she said if iris doesnt write to me in the next few days there will be a reason for her silence and in that case as i have already told you i shall hear from fanny mere you shall see me when i get a letter from paris  on the last morning in the week mrs vimpany was announced the letter that she brought with her had been written by fanny mere with the pen in her hand the maids remarkable character expressed itself as strongly as ever  madami said i would let you know what goes on here when i thought there was need of it there seems to be need now mr vimpany came to us yesterday he has the spare bedroom my mistress says nothing and writes nothing for that reason i send you the present writingyour humble servant f  mountjoy was perplexed by this letter plain as it was  it seems strange he said that iris herself has not written to you she has never hitherto concealed her opinion of mr vimpany  she is concealing it now mr vimpanys wife replied gravely  do you know why  i am afraid i do iris will not hesitate at any sacrifice of herself to please lord harry she will give him her money when he wants it if he tells her to alter her opinion of my husband she will obey him he can shake her confidence in me whenever he pleases and he has very likely done it already  surely it is time for me to go to her now hugh said  full time mrs vimpany admittedif you can feel sure of yourself in the interests of iris can you undertake to be cool and careful  in the interests of iris i can undertake anything  one word more mrs vimpany continued before you take your departure no matter whether appearances are for him or against him be always on your guard with my husband let me hear from you while you are away and dont forget that there is an obstacle between you and iris which will put even your patience and devotion to a hard trial  you mean her husband  i do  there was no more to be said hugh set forth on his journey to paris                   on the morning after his arrival in the french capital mountjoy had two alternatives to consider he might either write to iris and ask when it would be convenient to her to receive himor he might present himself unexpectedly in the cottage at passy reflection convinced him that his best chance of placing an obstacle in the way of deception would be to adopt the second alternative and to take lord harry and the doctor by surprise  he went to passy the lively french taste had brightened the cottage with colour the fair white window curtains were tied with rosecoloured ribbons the blinds were gaily painted the chimneys were ornamental the small garden was a paradise of flowers when mountjoy rang the bell the gate was opened by fanny mere she looked at him in grave astonishment  do they expect you she asked  never mind that hugh answered are they at home  they have just finished breakfast sir  do you remember my name  yes sir  then show me in  fanny opened the door of a room on the ground floor and announced mr mountjoy  the two men were smoking iris was watering some flowers in the window her colour instantly faded when hugh entered the room in doubt and alarm her eyes questioned lord harry he was in his sweetest state of goodhumour urged by the genial impulse of the moment he set the example of a cordial reception this is an agreeable surprise indeed he said shaking hands with mountjoy in his easy amiable way its kind of you to come and see us relieved of anxiety evidently when she had not expected it iris eagerly followed her husbands example her face recovered its colour and brightened with its prettiest smile mr vimpany stood in a corner his cigar went out his own wife would hardly have known him againhe actually presented an appearance of embarrassment lord harry burst out laughing look at him iris the doctor is shy for the first time in his life the irish goodhumour was irresistible the young wife merrily echoed her husbands laugh mr vimpany observing the friendly reception offered to hugh felt the necessity of adapting himself to circumstances he came out of his corner with an apology sorry i misbehaved myself mr mountjoy when i called on you in london shake hands no offenceeh iris in feverish high spirits mimicked the doctors coarse tones when he repeated his favourite form of excuse lord harry clapped his hands delighted with his wifes clever raillery ha mr mountjoy you dont find that her married life has affected her spirits may i hope that you have come here to breakfast the table is ready as you see  and i have been taking lessons hugh in french ways of cooking eggs iris added pray let me show you what i can do the doctor chimed in facetiously im lady harrys medical referee youll find her french delicacies half digested for you sir before you can open your mouth signed clarence vimpany member of the college of surgeons remembering mrs vimpanys caution hugh concealed his distrust of this outbreak of hospitable gaiety and made his excuses lord harry followed with more excuses on his part he deplored itbut he was obliged to go out had mr mountjoy met with the new paper which was to beat galiguani out of the field the continental herald there was the title forty thousand copies of the first number have just flown all over europe we have our agencies in every town of importance at every point of the compass and one of the great proprietors my dear sir is the humble individual who now addresses you his bright eyes sparkled with boyish pleasure as he made that announcement of his own importance if mr mountjoy would kindly excuse him he had an appointment at the office that morning get your hat vimpany the fact is our friend here carries a case of consumption in his pocket consumption of the purse you understand i am going to enrol him among the contributors to the newspaper a series of articles between ourselves exposing the humbug of physicians and asserting with fine satirical emphasis the overstocked state of the medical profession ah well youll be glad wont you to talk over old times with iris my angel show our good friend the continental herald and mind you keep him here till we get back doctor look alive mr mountjoy au revoir they shook hands again heartily as mrs vimpany had confessed there was no resisting the irish lord  but hughs strange experience of that morning was not at an end yet    chapter xxvii  the bride at home  left alone with the woman whose charm still held him to her cruelly as she had tried his devotion by her marriage mountjoy found the fluent amiability of the husband imitated by the wife she too when the door had hardly closed on lord harry was bent on persuading hugh that her marriage had been the happiest event of her life  will you think the worse of me she began if i own that i had little expectation of seeing you again  certainly not iris  consider my situation she went on when i remember how you tried oh conscientiously tried to prevent my marriagehow you predicted the miserable results that would follow if harrys life and my life became onecould i venture to hope that you would come here and judge for yourself dear and good friend i have nothing to fear from the result your presence was never more welcome to me than it is now  whether it was attributable to prejudice on mountjoys part or to keen and just observation he detected something artificial in the ring of her enthusiasm there was not the steady light of truth in her eyes which he remembered in the past and better days of their companionship he was a littlejust a littleirritated the temptation to remind her that his distrust of lord harry had once been her distrust too proved to be more than his frailty could resist  your memory is generally exact he said but it hardly serves you now as well as usual  what have i forgotten  you have forgotten the time my dear when your opinion was almost as strongly against a marriage with lord harry as mine  her answer was ready on the instant ah i didnt know him then as well as i know him now  some men in mountjoys position might have been provoked into hinting that there were sides to her husbands character which she had probably not discovered yet but hughs gentle temperruffled for a moment onlyhad recovered its serenity her friend was her true friend still he said no more on the subject of her marriage  old habits are not easily set aside he reminded her i have been so long accustomed to advise you and help you that i find myself hoping there may be some need for my services still is there no way in which i might relieve you of the hateful presence of mr vimpany  my dear hugh i wish you had not mentioned mr vimpany  mountjoy concluded that the subject was disagreeable to her after the opinion of him which you expressed in your letter to me he said i ought not to have spoken of the doctor pray forgive me  iris looked distressed oh you are quite mistaken the poor doctor has been sadly misjudged and ishe shook her head and sighed penitentlyand i she resumed am one among other people who have ignorantly wronged him pray consult my husband hear what he can tell youand you will pity mr vimpany the newspaper makes such large demands on our means that we can do little to help him with your recommendation he might find some employment  he has already asked me to assist him iris and i have refused i cant agree with your change of opinion about mr vimpany  why not is it because he has separated from his wife  that is one reason among many others mountjoy replied  indeed indeed you are wrong lord harry has known mrs vimpany for years and he saysi am truly sorry to hear itthat the separation is her fault  hugh changed the subject again the purpose which had mainly induced him to leave england had not been mentioned yet  alluding to the newspaper and to the heavy pecuniary demands made by the preliminary expenses of the new journal he reminded iris that their long and intimate friendship permitted him to feel some interest in her affairs i wont venture to express an opinion he added let me only ask if lord harrys investments in this speculation have compelled him to make some use of your little fortune  my husband refused to touch my fortune iris answered butshe paused there do you know how honourably how nobly he has behaved she abruptly resumed he has insured his life he has burdened himself with the payment of a large sum of money every year and all for me if i am so unfortunate which god forbid as to survive him when a large share in the newspaper was for sale do you think i could be ungrateful enough to let him lose the chance of making our fortune when the profits begin to come in i insisted on advancing the moneywe almost quarrelled about itbut you know how sweet he is i said dont distress me and the dearest of men let me have my own way  mountjoy listened in silence to have expressed what he felt would have been only to mortify and offend iris old habit as he had said had made the idea of devoting himself to her interests the uppermost idea in his mind he asked if the money had all been spent hearing that some of it was still left he resolved on making the attempt to secure the remains of her fortune to herself  tell me he said have you ever heard of such a thing as buying an annuity  she knew nothing about it he carefully explained the method by which a moderate sum of money might be made to purchase a sufficient income for life she offered no objection when he proposed to write to his lawyer in london for the necessary particulars but when he asked her to tell him what the sum was of which she might be still able to dispose iris hesitated and made no reply  this time hugh arrived at the right conclusion  it was only too plain to him that what remained of her money represented an amount so trifling that she was ashamed to mention it of the need for helping her there could be no doubt now and as for the means no difficulties presented themselves to mountjoyalways excepting the one obstacle likely to be offered by the woman herself experience warned him to approach her delicately by the indirect way  you know me well enough he said to feel sure that i am incapable of saying anything which can embarrass you or cause a moments misunderstanding between two old friends wont you look at me iris when i am speaking to you  she still looked away from him i am afraid of what you are going to say to me she answered coldly  then let me say it at once in one of your letters written long sincei dont suppose you remember ityou told me that i was an obstinate man when i once took a thing into my head you were quite right my dear i have taken it into my head that you will be as ready as ever to accept my advice and will leave me as your man of business to buy the annuity  she stopped him  no she cried i wont hear a word more do you think i am insensible to years of kindness that i have never deserved do you think i forget how nobly you have forgiven me for those cruel refusals which have saddened your life is it possible that you expect me to borrow money of you she started wildly to her feet i declare as god hears me i would rather die than take that base that shameful advantage of all your goodness to me the woman never lived who owed so much to a man as i owe to youbut not money oh my dear not money not money  he was too deeply touched to be able to speak to herand she saw it what a wretch i am she said to herself i have made his heart ache  he heard those words still feeling for hernever never for himselfhe tried to soothe her in the passion of her selfreproach she refused to hear him pacing the room from end to end she fanned the fiery emotion that was consuming her now she reviled herself in language that broke through the restraints by which good breeding sets its seal on a womans social rank and now again she lost herself more miserably still and yielded with hysteric recklessness to a bitter outburst of gaiety  if you wish to be married happily she cried never be as fond of any other woman as you have been of me we are none of us worth it laugh at us hughdo anything but believe in us we all lie my friend and i have been lyingshamelessly shamelessly  he tried to check her dont talk in that way iris he said sternly  she laughed at him talk she repeated it isnt that its a confession  i dont desire to hear your confession  you must hear ityou have drawn it out of me come well enjoy my humiliation together contradict every word i said to you about that brute and blackguard the doctorand you will have the truth what horrid inconsistency isnt it i cant help myself i am a wretched unreasonable creature i dont know my own mind for two days together and all through my husbandi am so fond of him harry is delightfully innocent hes like a nice boy he never seemed to think of mr vimpany till it was settled between them that the doctor was to come and stay hereand then he persuaded meoh i dont know howto see his friend in quite a new light i believed himand i believe him stilli mean i would believe him but for you will you do me a favour i wish you wouldnt look at me with those eyes that wont lie i wish you wouldnt speak to me with that voice which finds things out oh good heavens do you suppose i would let you think that my husband is a bad man and my marriage an unhappy one never if it turns my blood to sit and eat at the same table with mr vimpany im not cruel enough to blame the dear doctor its my wickedness thats to blame we shall quarrel if you tell me that harry is capable of letting a rascal be his friend im happy im happy im happydo you understand that oh hugh i wish you had never come to see me  she burst into a passionate fit of weeping broken down at last under the terrible strain laid on her let me hide myself was all that iris could say to her old friendbefore she ran out of the room and left him    chapter xxviii  the maid and the keyhole  deeply as she had grieved him keenly as he felt that his worst fears for her threatened already to be realised it was characteristic of mountjoy that he still refused to despair of iriseven with the husbands influence against him  the moral deterioration of her revealed in the false words that she had spoken and in the deceptions that she had attempted would have justified the saddest misgivings but for the voluntary confession which had followed and the signs which it had shown of the better nature still struggling to assert itself how could hugh hope to encourage that effort of resistance to the evil influences that were threatening herfirst and foremost among them being the arrival of vimpany at the cottage his presence kept her in a state of perpetual contention between her own wise instincts which distrusted him and her husbands authoritative assertions which recommended him to her confidence no greater service could be rendered to iris than the removal of this manbut how could it be accomplished without giving offence to her husband mountjoys mind was still in search of a means of overcoming the obstacle thus presented when he heard the door open had iris recovered herself or had lord harry and his friend returned  the person who now entered the room was the strange and silent maid fanny mere  can i speak to you sir  certainly what is it  please give me your address  for your mistress  yes  does she wish to write to me  yes  hugh gave the strange creature the address of his hotel in paris for a moment her eyes rested on him with an expression of steady scrutiny she opened the door to go outstoppedconsideredcame back again  i want to speak for myself she said do you care to hear what a servant has to say  mountjoy replied that he was ready to hear what she had to say she at once stepped up to him and addressed him in these words  i think you are fond of my mistress  an ordinary man might have resented the familiar manner in which she had expressed herself mountjoy waited for what was still to come fanny mere abruptly went on with a nearer approach to agitation in her manner than she had shown yet  my mistress took me into her service she trusted me when other ladies would have shown me the door when she sent for me to see her my character was lost i had nobody to feel for me nobody to help me she is the one friend who held out a hand to me i hate the men i dont care for the women except one being a servant i mustnt say i love that one if i was a lady i dont know that i should say it love is cant love is rubbish tell me one thing is the doctor a friend of yours  the doctor is nothing of the kind  perhaps he is your enemy  i can hardly say that  she looked at hugh discontentedly i want to get at it she said why cant we understand each other will you laugh at me if i say the first thing that comes into my head are you a good swimmer  an extraordinary question even from fanny mere it was put seriouslyand seriously mountjoy answered it he said that he was considered to be a good swimmer  perhaps she continued you have saved peoples lives  i have twice been so fortunate as to save lives he replied  if you saw the doctor drowning would you save him i wouldnt  do you hate him as bitterly as that hugh asked  she passed the question over without notice i wish you would help me to get at it she persisted suppose you could rid my mistress of that man by giving him a kick would you up with your foot and do it  yeswith pleasure  thank you sir now ive got it mr mountjoy the doctor is the curse of my mistresss life i cant bear to see it if we are not relieved of him somehow i shall do something wrong when i wait at table and see him using his knife i want to snatch it out of his hand and stick it into him i had a hope that my lord might turn him out of the house when they quarrelled my lord is too wicked himself to do it for the love of god sir help my mistressor show me the way how  mountjoy began to be interested how do you know he asked that lord harry and the doctor have quarrelled  without the slightest appearance of embarrassment fanny mere informed him that she had listened at the door while her master and his friend were talking of their secrets she had also taken an opportunity of looking through the keyhole i suppose sir said this curious woman still speaking quite respectfully you have never tried that way yourself  certainly not  wouldnt you do it to serve my mistress  no  and yet youre fond of her you are a merciful onethe only merciful one so far as i knowamong men perhaps if you were frightened about her you might be more ready with your help i wonder whether i can frighten you will you let me try  the womans faithful attachment to iris pleaded for her with hugh try if you like he said kindly  speaking as seriously as ever fanny proceeded to describe her experience at the keyhole what she had seen was not worth relating what she had heard proved to be more important  the talk between my lord and the doctor had been about raising money they had different notions of how to do that my lords plan was to borrow what was wanted on his lifeinsurance the doctor told him he couldnt do that till his insurance had been going on for three or four years at least i have something better and bolder to propose says mr vimpany it must have been also something wickedfor he whispered it in the masters ear my lord didnt take to it kindly how do you think i could face my wife he says if she discovered me the doctor says dont be afraid of your wife lady harry will get used to many things which she little thought of before she married you says my lord to that i have done my best vimpany to improve my wifes opinion of you if you say much more i shall come round to her way of thinking drop itall right says the doctor ill drop it now and wait to pick it up again till you come to your last bank note there the talk ended for that dayand fanny would be glad to know what mr mountjoy thought of it  i think you have done me a service hugh replied  tell me how sir  i can only tell you this fanny you have shown me how to relieve your mistress of the doctor  for the first time the maids impenetrable composure completely failed her the smouldering fire in fanny mere flamed up she impulsively kissed mountjoys hand the moment her lips touched it she shrank back the natural pallor of her face became whiter than ever startled by the sudden change hugh asked if she was ill  she shook her head  it isnt that yours is the first mans hand i have kissed since she checked herself i beg you wont ask me about it i only meant to thank you sir i do thank you with all my hearti mustnt stay here any longer  as she spoke the sound of a key was heard opening the lock of the cottagedoor lord harry had returned    chapter xxix  the conquest of mr vimpany  the irish lord came inwith his medical friend sulkily in attendance on him he looked at fanny and asked where her mistress was  my lady is in her room sir  hearing this he turned sharply to mountjoy on the point of speaking he seemed to think better of it and went to his wifes room the maid followed get rid of him now she whispered to hugh glancing at the doctor mr vimpany was in no very approachable humourstanding at the window with his hands in his empty pockets gloomily looking out but hugh was not disposed to neglect the opportunity he ventured to say you dont seem to be in such good spirits as usual  the doctor gruffly expressed his opinion that mr mountjoy would not be particularly cheerful in his place my lord had taken him to the office on the distinct understanding that he was to earn a little pocketmoney by becoming one of the contributors to the newspaper and how had it ended the editor had declared that his list of writers was full and begged leave to suggest that mr vimpany should wait for the next vacancy a most impertinent proposal had lord harrya proprietor rememberexerted his authority not he his lordship had dropped the doctor like a hot potato and had meanly submitted to his own servant what did mr mountjoy think of such conduct as that  hugh answered the question with his own end in view paving the way for mr vimpanys departure from the cottage at passy he made a polite offer of his services  cant i help you out of your difficulty he said  you cried the doctor have you forgotten how you received me sir when i asked for a loan at your hotel in london  hugh admitted that he might have spoken hastily you took me by surprise he said and perhaps i was mistaken on my side i thought you were to say the least of it not particularly civil you did certainly use threatening language when you left me no man likes to be treated in that way  mr vimpanys big bold eyes stared at mountjoy in a state of bewilderment are you trying to make a fool of me he asked  i am incapable mr vimpany of an act of rudeness towards anybody  if you come to that the doctor stoutly declared i am incapable too its plain to me that we have been misunderstanding each other wait a bit i want to go back for a moment to that threatening language which you complained of just now i was sorry for what i had said as soon as your door was shut on me on my way downstairs i did think of turning back and making a friendly apology before i gave you up suppose i had done that mr vimpany asked wondering internally whether mountjoy was foolish enough to believe him  hugh advanced a little nearer to the design that he had in view  you might have found me more kindly disposed towards you he said than you had anticipated  this encouraging reply cost him an effort he had stooped to the unworthy practice of perverting what he had said and done on a former occasion to serve a present interest remind himself as he might of the end which in the interests of iris did really appear to justify the means he still sank to a place in his own estimation which he was honestly ashamed to occupy  under other circumstances his hesitation slight as it was might have excited suspicion as things were mr vimpany could only discover golden possibilities that dazzled his eyes i wonder whether youre in the humour he said to be kindly disposed towards me now  it was needless to be careful of the feelings of such man as this suppose you had the money you want in your pocket hugh suggested what would you do with it  go back to london to be sure and publish the first number of that work of mine i told you of  and leave your friend lord harry  what good is my friend to me hes nearly as poor as i amhe sent for me to advise himi put him up to a way of filling both our pockets and he wouldnt hear of it what sort of a friend do you call that  pay him and get rid of him there was the course of proceeding suggested by the private counsellor in mountjoys bosom  have you got the publishers estimate of expenses he asked  the doctor instantly produced the document  to a rich man the sum required was after all trifling enough mountjoy sat down at the writingtable as he took up a pen mr vimpanys protuberant eyes looked as if they would fly out of his head  if i lend you the money hugh began  yes yes cried the doctor  i do so on condition that nobody is to know of the loan but ourselves  oh sir on my sacred word of honour an order on mountjoys bankers in paris for the necessary amount with something added for travelling expenses checked mr vimpany in full career of protestation he tried to begin again my friend my benefactor  he was stopped once more his friend and benefactor pointed to the clock  if you want the money today you have just time to get to paris before the bank closes  mr vimpany did want the moneyalways wanted the money his gratitude burst out for the third time god bless you  the object of that highly original form of benediction pointed through the window in the direction of the railway station mr vimpany struggled no longer to express his feelingshe had made his last sacrifice to appearanceshe caught the train  the door of the room had been left open a voice outside said has he gone  come in fanny said mountjoy he will return to london either tonight or tomorrow morning  the strange maid put her head in at the door ill be at the terminus she said and make sure of him  her head suddenly disappeared before it was possible to speak to her again was there some other person outside the other person entered the room it was lord harry he spoke without his customary smile  i want a word with you mr mountjoy  about what my lord  that direct question seemed to confuse the irishman he hesitated  about you he said and stopped to consider and another person he added mysteriously  hugh was constitutionally a hater of mysteries he felt the need of a more definite reply and asked for it plainly  does your lordship associate that other person with me  yes i do  who is the person  my wife    chapter xxx  saxon and celt  when amicable relations between two men happen to be in jeopardy there is least danger of an ensuing quarrel if the friendly intercourse has been of artificial growth on either side in this case the promptings of selfinterest and the laws of politeness have been animating influences throughout acting under conditions which assist the effort of selfcontrol and for this reason the man who has never really taken a high place in our regard is unprovided with those sharpest weapons of provocation which make unendurable demands on human fortitude in a true attachment on the other hand there is an innocent familiarity implied which is forgetful of ceremony and blind to consequences the affectionate freedom which can speak kindly without effort is sensitive to offence and can speak harshly without restraint when the friend who wounds us has once been associated with the sacred memories of the heart he strikes at a tender place and no considerations of propriety are powerful enough to stifle our cry of rage and pain the enemies who have once loved each other are the bitterest enemies of all  thus the curt exchange of question and answer which had taken place in the cottage at passy between two gentlemen artificially friendly to one another led to no regrettable result lord harry had been too readily angry he remembered what was due to mr mountjoy mr mountjoy had been too thoughtlessly abrupt he remembered what was due to lord harry the courteous irishman bowed and pointed to a chair the wellbred englishman returned the polite salute and sat down my lord broke the silence that followed  may i hope that you will excuse me he began if i walk about the room movement seems to help me when i am puzzled how to put things nicely sometimes i go round and round the subject before i get at it im afraid im going round and round now have you arranged to make a long stay in paris  circumstances mountjoy answered would probably decide him  you have no doubt been many times in paris before this lord harry continued do you find it at all dull now  wondering what he could possibly mean hugh said he never found paris dulland waited for further enlightenment the irish lord persisted  people mostly think paris isnt as gay as it used to be not such good plays and such good actors as they had at one time the restaurants inferior and society very much mixed people dont stay there as long as they used im told that americans are getting disappointed and are trying london for a change  could he have any serious motive for this irrelevant way of talking or was he to judge by his own account of himself going round and round the subject of his wife and his guest before he could get at it  suspecting him of jealousy from the first hugh failednaturally perhaps in his positionto understand the regard for iris and the fear of offending her by which her jealous husband was restrained lord harry was attempting awkwardly indeed to break off the relations between his wife and her friend by means which might keep the true state of his feelings concealed from both of them ignorant of this claim on his forbearance it was mountjoys impression that he was being trifled with once more he waited for enlightenment and waited in silence  you dont find my conversation interesting lord harry remarked still with perfect goodhumour  i fail to see the connection mountjoy acknowledged between what you have said so far and the subject on which you expressed your intention of speaking to me pray forgive me if i appear to hurry youor if you have any reasons for hesitation  far from being offended this incomprehensible man really appeared to be pleased you read me like a book he exclaimed its hesitation thats the matter with me im a variable man if theres something disagreeable to say there are times when i dash at it and times when i hang back can i offer you any refreshment he asked getting away from the subject again without so much as an attempt at concealment  hugh thanked him and declined  not even a glass of wine such white burgundy my dear sir as you seldom taste  hughs british obstinacy was roused he repeated his reply lord harry looked at him gravely and made a nearer approach to an open confession of feeling than he had ventured on yet  with regard now to my wife when i went away this morning with vimpanyhes not such good company as he used to be soured by misfortune poor devil i wish he would go back to london as i was sayingi mean as i was about to sayi left you and lady harry together this morning two old friends glad as i supposed to have a gossip about old times when i come back i find you left here alone and i am told that lady harry is in her room what do i see when i get there i see the finest pair of eyes in the world and the tale they tell me is we have been crying when i ask what may have happened to account for thisnothing dear is all the answer i get whats the impression naturally produced on my mind there has been a quarrel perhaps between you and my wife  i fail entirely lord harry to see it in that light  ah likely enough mines the irish point of view as an englishman you fail to understand it let that be one thing mr mountjoy ill take the freedom of saying at once ill thank you next time to quarrel with me  you force me to tell you my lord that you are under a complete delusion if you suppose that there has been any quarrel or approach to a quarrel between lady harry and myself  you tell me that on your word of honour as a gentleman  most assuredly  sir i deeply regret to hear it  which does your lordship deeply regret that i have spoken to you on my word of honour or that i have not quarrelled with lady harry  both sir by the piper that played before moses both  hugh got up and took his hat we may have a better chance of understanding each other he suggested if you will be so good as to write to me  put your hat down again mr mountjoy and pray have a moments patience ive tried to like you sirand im bound in candour to own that ive failed to find a bond of union between us maybe this frank confession annoys you  far from it you are going straight to your subject at last if i may venture to say so  the irish lords goodhumour had completely disappeared by this time his handsome face hardened and his voice rose the outbreak of jealous feeling which motives honourable to himself had hitherto controlled now seized on its freedom of expression his language betrayed as on some former occasions that association with unworthy companions which had been one of the evil results of his adventurous life  maybe ill go straighter than you bargain for he replied im in two humours about you my commonsense tells me that youre my wifes friend and the best of friends do sometimes quarrel dont they well sir you deny it on your own account i find myself forced back on my other humourand its a black humour i can tell you you may be my wifes friend my fine fellow but youre something more than that you have always been in love with herand youre in love with her now thank you for your visit but dont repeat it say do we understand each other at last  i have too sincere a respect for lady harry to answer you mountjoy said at the same time let me acknowledge my obligations to your lordship you have reminded me that i did a foolish thing when i called here without an invitation i agree with you that the sooner my mistake is set right the better  he replied in those words and left the cottage  on the way back to his hotel hugh thought of what mrs vimpany had said to him when they had last seen each other dont forget that there is an obstacle between you and iris which will put even your patience and your devotion to a hard trial the obstacle of the husband had set itself up and had stopped him already  his own act a necessary act after the language that had been addressed to him had closed the doors of the cottage and had put an end to future meetings between iris and himself if they attempted to communicate by letter lord harry would have opportunities of discovering their correspondence of which his jealousy would certainly avail itself through the wakeful night hughs helpless situation was perpetually in his thoughts there seemed to be no present alternative before him but resignation and a return to england    chapter xxxi  the school for husbands  on the next day mountjoy heard news of iris which was not of a nature to relieve his anxieties he received a visit from fanny mere  the leavetaking of mr vimpany on the previous evening was the first event which the maid had to relate she had been present when the doctor said goodbye to the master and mistress business in london was the reason he gave for going away the master had taken the excuse as if he really believed in it and seemed to be glad to get rid of his friend the mistress expressed her opinion that mr vimpanys return to london must have been brought about by an act of liberality on the part of the most generous of living men your friend has as i believe got some money from my friend she said to her husband my lord had looked at her very strangely when she spoke of mr mountjoy in that way and had walked out of the room as soon as his back was turned fanny had obtained leave of absence she had carried out her intention of watching the terminus and had seen mr vimpany take his place among the passengers to london by the mail train  returning to the cottage it was fannys duty to ascertain if her services were required in her mistresss room  on reaching the door she had heard the voices of my lord and my lady and as mr mountjoy would perhaps be pleased to know had been too honourable to listen outside on this occasion she had at once gone away and had waited until she should be sent for after a long interval the bell that summoned her had been rung she had found the mistress in a state of agitation partly angry and partly distressed and had ventured to ask if anything unpleasant had happened no reply was made to that inquiry fanny had silently performed the customary duties of the nighttoilet in getting my lady ready for bed they had said goodnight to each other and had said no more  in the morning that present morning being again in attendance as usual the maid had found lady harry in a more indulgent frame of mind still troubled by anxieties but willing to speak of them now  she had begun by talking of mr mountjoy  i think you like him fanny everybody likes him you will be sorry to hear that we have no prospect of seeing him again at the cottage there she had stopped something that she had not said yet seemed to be in her mind and to trouble her she was near to crying poor soul but struggled against it i have no sister she said and no friend who might be like a sister to me it isnt perhaps quite right to speak of my sorrow to my maid still there is something hard to bear in having no kind heart near onei mean no other woman to speak to who knows what women feel it is so lonely hereoh so lonely i wonder whether you understand me and pity me never forgetting all that she owed to her mistressif she might say so without seeming to praise herselffanny was truly sorry it would have been a relief to her if she could have freely expressed her opinion that my lord must be to blame when my lady was in trouble being a man he was by nature cruel to women the wisest thing his poor wife could do would be to expect nothing from him the maid was sorely tempted to offer a little good advice to this effect but she was afraid of her own remembrances if she encouraged them by speaking out boldly it would be better to wait for what the mistress might say next  lord harrys conduct was the first subject that presented itself when the conversation was resumed  my lady mentioned that she had noticed how he looked and how he left the room when she had spoken in praise of mr mountjoy she had pressed him to explain himselfand she had made a discovery which proved to be the bitterest disappointment of her life her husband suspected her her husband was jealous of her it was too cruel it was an insult beyond endurance an insult to mr mountjoy as well as to herself if that best and dearest of good friends was to be forbidden the house if he was to go away and never to see her or speak to her again of one thing she was determinedhe should not leave her without a kind word of farewell he should hear how truly she valued him yes and how she admired and felt for him would fanny not do the same thing in her place and fanny had remembered the time when she might have done it for such a man as mr mountjoy mind you stay indoors this evening sir the maid continued looking and speaking so excitedly that hugh hardly knew her again my mistress is coming to see you and i shall come with her  such an act of imprudence was incredible you must be out of your senses mountjoy exclaimed  im out of myself sir if thats what you mean fanny answered i do so enjoy treating a man in that way the masters going out to dinnerhell know nothing about itand cried the cool cold woman of other times he richly deserves it  hugh reasoned and remonstrated and failed to produce the slightest effect  his next effort was to write a few lines to lady harry entreating her to remember that a jealous man is sometimes capable of acts of the meanest duplicity and that she might be watched when he gave the note to fanny to deliver she informed him respectfully that he had better not trust her a person sometimes meant to do right she reminded him and sometimes ended in doing wrong rather than disappoint her mistress she was quite capable of tearing up the letter on her way home and saying nothing about it hugh tried a threat next your mistress will not find me if she comes here i shall go out tonight the impenetrable maid looked at him with a pitying smile and answered  not you  it was a humiliating reflectionbut fanny mere understood him better than he understood himself  all that mountjoy had said and done in the way of protest had been really dictated by consideration for the young wife if he questioned his conscience selfish delight in the happy prospect of seeing iris again asserted itself as the only view with which he looked forward to the end of the day when the evening approached he took the precaution of having his own discreet and faithful servant in attendance to receive lady harry at the door of the hotel before the ringing of the bell could summon the porter from his lodge on calm consideration the chances seemed to be in favour of her escaping detection by lord harry the jealous husband of the stage who sooner or later discovers the innocent or guilty couple as the case may be is not always the husband of the world outside the theatre with this fragment of experience present in his mind hugh saw the door of his sittingroom cautiously opened at an earlier hour than he had anticipated his trustworthy representative introduced a lady closely veiledand that lady was iris    chapter xxxii  goodbye to iris  lady harry lifted her veil and looked at mountjoy with sad entreaty in her eyes are you angry with me she asked  i ought to be angry with you he said this is a very imprudent iris  its worse than that she confessed its reckless and desperate dont say i ought to have controlled myself i cant control the shame i feel when i think of what has happened can i let you gooh what a return for your kindnesswithout taking your hand at parting come and sit by me on the sofa after my poor husbands conduct you and i are not likely to meet again i dont expect you to lament it as i do even your sweetness and your patienceso often triedmust be weary of me now  if you thought that possible my dear you would not have come here tonight hugh reminded her while we live we have the hope of meeting again nothing in this world lasts irisnot even jealousy lord harry himself told me that he was a variable man sooner or later he will come to his senses  those words seemed to startle iris i hope you dont think that my husband is brutal to me she exclaimed still resenting even the appearance of a reflection on her marriage and still forgetting what she herself had said which justified a doubt of her happiness have you formed a wrong impression she went on has fanny mere innocently  mountjoy noticed for the first time the absence of the maid it was a circumstance which justified him in interrupting irisfor it might seriously affect her if her visit to the hotel happened to be discovered  i understood he said that fanny was to come here with you  yes yes she is waiting in the carriage we are careful not to excite attention at the door of the hotel the coachman will drive up and down the street till i want him again never mind that i have something to say to you about fanny she thinks of her own troubles poor soul when she talks to me and exaggerates a little without meaning it i hope she has not misled you in speaking of her master it is base and bad of him unworthy of a gentleman to be jealousand he has wounded me deeply but dear hugh his jealousy is a gentle jealousy i have heard of other men who watch their wiveswho have lost all confidence in themwho would even have taken away from me such a trifle as this she smiled and showed to mountjoy her duplicate key of the cottage door ah harry is above such degrading distrust as that there are times when he is as heartily ashamed of his own weakness as i could wish him to be i have seen him on his knees before me shocked at his conduct he is no hypocrite indeed his repentance is sincere while it lastsonly it doesnt last his jealousy rises and falls like the wind he said last night when the wind was high if you wish to make me the happiest creature on the face of the earth dont encourage mr mountjoy to remain in paris try to make allowances for him  i would rather make allowances iris for you do you too wish me to leave paris  sitting very near to himnearer than her husband might have liked to seeiris drew away a little did you mean to be cruel in saying that she asked i dont deserve it  it was kindly meant hugh assured her if i can make your position more endurable by going away i will leave paris tomorrow  iris moved back again to the place which she had already occupied she was eager to thank him for a reason not yet mentioned as she had never thanked him yet silently and softly she offered her gratitude to hugh by offering her cheek the irritating influence of lord harrys jealousy was felt by both of them at that moment he kissed her cheekand lingered over it she was the first to recover herself  when you spoke just now of my position with my husband she said you reminded me of anxieties hugh in which you once shared and of services which i can never forget  preparing him in those words for the disclosure which she had now to make iris alluded to the vagabond life of adventure which lord harry had led the restlessness in his nature which that life implied had latterly shown itself again and his wife had traced the cause to a letter from ireland communicating a report that the assassin of arthur mountjoy had been seen in london and was supposed to be passing under the name of carrigeen hugh would understand that the desperate resolution to revenge the murder of his friend with which lord harry had left england in the past time had been urged into action once more he had not concealed from iris that she must be resigned to his leaving her for awhile if the report which had reached him from ireland proved to be true it would be useless and worse than useless to remind this reckless man of the danger that threatened him from the invincibles if he returned to england in using her power of influencing the husband who still loved her iris could only hope to exercise a salutary restraint in her own domestic interests appealing to him for indulgence by careful submission to any exactions on which his capricious jealousy might insist would sad necessity excuse her if she accepted mountjoys offer to leave paris for the one reason that her husband had asked it of her as a favour  hugh at once understood her motive and assured her of his sympathy  you may depend upon my returning to london tomorrow he said in the meantime is there no better way in which i can be of use to you if your influence fails do you see any other chance of keeping lord harrys desperate purpose under control  it had only that day occurred to iris that there might be some prospect of an encouraging result if she could obtain the assistance of mrs vimpany  the doctors wife was well acquainted with lord harrys past life when he happened to be in ireland and she had met many of his countrymen with whom he had associated if one of those friends happened to be the officious person who had written to him it was at least possible that mrs vimpanys discreet interference might prevent his mischievous correspondent from writing again lord harry waiting for more news would in this event wait in vain he would not know where to go or what to do nextand with such a nature as his the end of his patience and the end of his resolution were likely to come together  hugh handed his pocketbook to iris of the poor chances in her favour the last was to his mind the least hopeless of the two  if you have discovered the name of your husbands correspondent he said write it down for me and i will ask mrs vimpany if she knows him i will make your excuses for not having written to her lately and in any case i answer for her being ready to help you  as iris thanked him and wrote the name the clock on the chimneypiece struck the hour  she rose to say farewell with a restless hand she halflowered her veil and raised it again you wont mind my crying she said faintly trying to smile through her tears this is the saddest parting i have ever known dear dear hughgoodbye  great is the law of duty but the elder law of love claims its higher right never in all the years of their friendship had they forgotten themselves as they forgot themselves now for the first time her lips met his lips in their farewell kiss in a moment more they remembered the restraints which honour imposed on them they were only friends again silently she lowered her veil silently he took her arm and led her down to the carriage it was moving away from them at a slow pace towards the other end of the street instead of waiting for its return they followed and overtook it  we shall meet again he whispered  she answered sadly dont forget me  mountjoy turned back as he approached the hotel he noticed a tall man crossing from the opposite side of the street not two minutes after iris was on her way home her jealous husband and her old friend met at the hotel door  lord harry spoke first i have been dining out he said and i came here to have a word with you mr mountjoy on my road home  hugh answered with formal politeness let me show your lordship the way to my rooms  oh its needless to trouble you lord harry declared i have so little to saydo you mind walking on with me for a few minutes  mountjoy silently complied he was thinking of what might have happened if iris had delayed her departureor if the movement of the carriage had been towards instead of away from the hotel in either case it had been a narrow escape for the wife from a dramatic discovery by the husband  we irishmen lord harry resumed are not famous for always obeying the laws but it is in our natures to respect the law of hospitality when you were at the cottage yesterday i was inhospitable to my guest my rude behaviour has weighed on my mind sinceand for that reason i have come here to speak to you it was illbred on my part to reproach you with your visit and to forbid you oh quite needlessly i dont doubt to call on me again if i own that i have no desire to propose a renewal of friendly intercourse between us you will understand me i am sure with my way of thinking the less we see of each other for the future the better it may be but for what i said when my temper ran away with me i ask you to accept my excuses and the sincere expression of my regret  your excuses are accepted my lord as sincerely as you have offered them mountjoy answered so far as i am concerned the incident is forgotten from this moment  lord harry expressed his courteous acknowledgments spoken as becomes a gentleman he said i thank you  there it ended they saluted each other they wished each other goodnight a mere formality hugh thought when they had parted  he had wronged the irish lord in arriving at that conclusion but time was to pass before events helped him to discover his error    chapter xxxiii  the decree of fate  on his arrival in london mountjoy went to the nurses institute to inquire for mrs vimpany  she was again absent in attendance on another patient the address of the house known only to the matron was on this occasion not to be communicated to any friend who might make inquiries a bad case of scarlet fever had been placed under the nurses care and the danger of contagion was too serious to be trifled with  the events which had led to mrs vimpanys present employment had not occurred in the customary course  a nurse who had recently joined the institute had been first engaged to undertake the case at the express request of the suffering personwho was said to be distantly related to the young woman on the morning when she was about to proceed to the scene of her labours news had reached her of the dangerous illness of her mother mrs vimpany who was free at the time and who felt a friendly interest in her young colleague volunteered to take her place upon this a strange request had been addressed to the matron on behalf of the sick man he desired to be informed of it if the new nurse was an irishwoman hearing that she was an englishwoman he at once accepted her services being himself as an additional element of mystery in the matter an irishman  the matrons english prejudices at once assumed that there had been some discreditable event in the mans life which might be made a subject of scandalous exposure if he was attended by one of his own countrypeople she advised mrs vimpany to have nothing to do with the afflicted stranger the nurse answered that she had promised to attend on himand she kept her promise  mountjoy left the institute after vainly attempting to obtain mrs vimpanys address the one concession which the matron offered to make was to direct his letter and send it to the post if he would be content with that form of communication  on reflection he decided to write the letter  prompt employment of time might be of importance if it was possible to prevent any further communication with lord larry on the part of his irish correspondent using the name with which iris had provided him hugh wrote to inquire if it was familiar to mrs vimpany as the name of a person with whom she had been at any time acquainted in this event he assured her that an immediate consultation between them was absolutely necessary in the interests of iris he added in a postscript that he was in perfect health and that he had no fear of infectionand sent his letter to the matron to be forwarded  the reply reached him late in the evening it was in the handwriting of a stranger and was to this effect  dear mr mountjoyit is impossible that i can allow you to run the risk of seeing me while i am in my present situation so serious is the danger of contagion in scarlet fever that i dare not even write to you with my own hand on notepaper which has been used in the sick room this is no mere fancy of mine the doctor in attendance here knows of a case in which a small piece of infected flannel communicated the disease after an interval of no less than a year i must trust to your own good sense to see the necessity of waiting until i can receive you without any fear of consequences to yourself in the meantime i may answer your inquiry relating to the name communicated in your letter i first knew the gentleman you mention some years since we were introduced to each other by lord harry and i saw him afterwards on more than one occasion  mountjoy read this wise and considerate reply to his letter with indignation  here was the good fortune for which he had not dared to hope declaring itself in favour of iris here if mrs vimpany could be persuaded to write to her friend was the opportunity offered of keeping the hottempered irish husband passive and harmless by keeping him without further news of the assassin of arthur mountjoy under these encouraging circumstances the proposed consultation which might have produced such excellent results had been rejected thanks to a contemptible fear of infection excited by a story of a trumpery piece of flannel  hugh snatched up the unfortunate letter cast away on the floor to tear it in pieces and throw it into the wastepaper basketand checked himself his angry hand had seized on it with the blank leaf of the notepaper uppermost  on that leaf he discovered two little lines of print presenting in the customary form the address of the house at which the letter had been written the writer in taking the sheet of paper from the case must have accidentally turned it wrong side uppermost on the desk and had not cared to recopy the letter or had not discovered the mistake restored to his best goodhumour hugh resolved to surprise mrs vimpany by a visit on the next day which would set the theory of contagion at defiance and render valuable service to iris at a crisis in her life  having time before him for reflection in the course of the evening he was at no loss to discover a formidable obstacle in the way of his design  whether he gave his name or concealed his name when he asked for mrs vimpany at the housedoor she would in either case refuse to see him the one accessible person whom he could consult in this difficulty was his faithful old servant  that experienced manformerly employed at various times in the army in the police and in service at a public schoolobtained leave to make some preliminary investigations on the next morning  he achieved two important discoveries in the first place mrs vimpany was living in the house in which the letter to his master had been written in the second place there was a page attached to the domestic establishment already under notice to leave his situation who was accessible to corruption by means of a bribe the boy would be on the watch for mr mountjoy at two oclock on that day and would show him where to find mrs vimpany in the room near the sick man in which she was accustomed to take her meals  hugh acted on his instructions and found the page waiting to admit him secretly to the house leading the way upstairs the boy pointed with one hand to a door on the second floor and held out the other hand to receive his money while he pocketed the bribe and disappeared mountjoy opened the door  mrs vimpany was seated at a table waiting for her dinner when hugh showed himself she started to her feet with a cry of alarm  are you mad she exclaimed how did you get here what do you want here dont come near me  she attempted to pass hugh on her way out of the room he caught her by the arm led her back to her chair and forced her to seat herself again iris is in trouble he pleaded and you can help her  the fever she cried heedless of what he had said keep back from methe fever  for the second time she tried to get out of the room for the second time hugh stopped her  fever or no fever he persisted i have something to say to you in two minutes i shall have said it and i will go  in the fewest possible words he described the situation of iris with her jealous husband mrs vimpany indignantly interrupted him  are you running this dreadful risk she asked with nothing to say to me that i dont know already her husband jealous of her of course he is jealous of her leave meor i will ring for the servant  ring if you like hugh answered but hear this first my letter to you alluded to a consultation between us which might be necessary in the interests of iris imagine her situation if you can the assassin of arthur mountjoy is reported to be in london and lord harry has heard of it  mrs vimpany looked at him with horror in her eyes  gracious god she cried the man is hereunder my care oh i am not in the conspiracy to hide the wretch i knew no more of him than you do when i offered to nurse him the names that have escaped him in his delirium have told me the truth  as she spoke a second door in the room was opened an old woman showed herself for a moment trembling with terror hes breaking out again nurse help me to hold him  mrs vimpany instantly followed the woman into the bedroom wait and listen she said to mountjoyand left the door open  the quick fierce muttering tones of a man in delirium were now fearfully audible his maddened memory was travelling back over his own horrible life he put questions to himself he answered himself  who drew the lot to kill the traitor i did i did who shot him on the road before he could get to the wood i did i did arthur mountjoy traitor to ireland set that on his tombstone and disgrace him for ever listen boyslisten there is a patriot among you i am the patriotpreserved by a merciful providence ha my lord harry search the earth and search the sea the patriot is out of your reach nurse whats that the doctor said of me the fever will kill him well what does that matter as long as lord harry doesnt kill me open the doors and let everybody hear of it i die the death of a saintthe greatest of all saintsthe saint who shot arthur mountjoy oh the heat the heat the burning raging heat the tortured creature burst into a dreadful cry of rage and pain it was more than hughs resolution could support he hurried out of the house                    ten days passed a letter in a strange handwriting reached iris at passy  the first part of the letter was devoted to the irish desperado whom mrs vimpany had attended in his illness  when she only knew him as a suffering fellowcreature she had promised to be his nurse did the discovery that he was an assassin justify desertion or even excuse neglect no the nursing art like the healing art is an act of mercyin itself too essentially noble to inquire whether the misery that it relieves merits help all that experience all that intelligence all that care could offer the nurse gave to the man whose hand she would have shrunk from touching in friendship after she had saved his life  a time had come when the fever threatened to take lord harrys vengeance out of his hands the crisis of the disease declared itself with the shadow of death on him the wretch lived through itsaved by his strong constitution and by the skilled and fearless woman who attended on him at the period of his convalescence friends from ireland accompanied by a medical man of their own choosing presented themselves at the house and asked for him by the name under which he passedcarrigeen with every possible care he was removed to what destination had never been discovered from that time all trace of him had been lost  terrible news followed on the next page  the subtle power of infection had asserted itself against the poor mortal who had defied it hugh mountjoy stricken by the man who had murdered his brother lay burning under the scarlet fire of the fever  but the nurse watched by him night and day    chapter xxxiv  my lords mind  here my oldvagabondvimpany is an interesting case for youthe cry of a patient with a sick mind  look over it and prescribe for your wild irish friend if you can  you will perhaps remember that i have never thoroughly trusted you in all the years since we have known each other at this later date in our lives when i ought to see more clearly than ever what an unfathomable man you are am i rash enough to be capable of taking you into my confidence  i dont know what i am going to do i feel like a man who has been stunned to be told that the murderer of arthur mountjoy had been seen in londonto be prepared to trace him by his paltry assumed name of carrigeento wait vainly for the next discovery which might bring him within reach of retribution at my handsand then to be overwhelmed by the news of his illness his recovery and his disappearance these are the blows which have stupefied me only think of it he has escaped me for the second time fever that kills thousands of harmless creatures has spared the assassin he may yet die in his bed and be buried with the guiltless dead around him in a quiet churchyard i cant get over it i shall never get over it  add to this anxieties about my wife and maddening letters from creditorsand dont expect me to write reasonably  what i want to know is whether your art or whatever you call it can get at my diseased mind through my healthy body you have more than once told me that medicine can do this the time has come for doing it i am in a bad way and a bad end may follow my only medical friend deliver me from myself  in any case let me beg you to keep your temper while you read what follows  i have to confess that the devil whose name is jealousy has entered into me and is threatening the tranquillity of my married life you dislike iris i knowand she returns your hostile feeling towards her try to do my wife justice nevertheless as i do i dont believe my distrust of her has any excuseand yet i am jealous more unreasonable still i am as fond of her as i was in the first days of the honeymoon is she as fond as ever of me you were a married man when i was a boy let me give you the means of forming an opinion by a narrative of her conduct under what i admit to have been very trying circumstances  when the first information reached iris of hugh mountjoys dangerous illness we were at breakfast it struck her dumb she handed the letter to me and left the table  i hate a man who doesnt know what it is to want money i hate a man who keeps his temper i hate a man who pretends to be my wifes friend and who is secretly in love with her all the time what difference did it make to me whether hugh mountjoy ended in living or dying if i had any interest in the matter it ought by rights seeing that i am jealous of him to be an interest in his death well i declare positively that the alarming news from london spoilt my breakfast there is something about that friend of my wifethat smug prosperous wellbehaved englishmanwhich seems to plead for him god knows how when my mind is least inclined in his favour while i was reading about his illness i found myself hoping that he would recoverand i give you my sacred word of honour i hated him all the time  my irish friend is madyou will say your irish friend my dear follow does not dispute it  let us get back to my wife she showed herself again after a long absence having something at last to say to her husband  i am innocently to blame she began for the dreadful misfortune that has fallen on mr mountjoy if i had not given him a message to mrs vimpany he would never have insisted on seeing her and would never have caught the fever it may help me to bear my misery of selfreproach and suspense if i am kept informed of his illness there is no fear of infection by my receiving letters i am to write to a friend of mrs vimpany who lives in another house and who will answer my inquiries do you object dear harry to my getting news of hugh mountjoy every day while he is in danger  i was perfectly willing that she should get that news and she ought to have known it  it seemed to me to be also a bad sign that she made her request with dry eyes she must have cried when she first heard that he was likely to sink under an attack of fever why were her tears kept hidden in her own room when she came back to me her face was pale and hard and tearless dont you think she might have forgotten my jealousy when i was so careful myself not to show it my own belief is that she was longing to go to london and help your wife to nurse the poor man and catch the fever and die with him if he died  is this bitter perhaps it is tear it off and light your pipe with it  well the correspondence relating to the sick man continued every day and every dayoh vimpany another concession to my jealousyshe handed the letters to me to read i made excuses we irish are good at that if we are good at nothing else and declined to read the medical reports one morning when she opened the letter of that day there passed over her a change which is likely to remain in my memory as long as i live never have i seen such an ecstasy of happiness in any womans face as i saw when she read the lines which informed her that the fever was mastered iris is sweet and delicate and brightessentially fascinating in a word but she was never a beautiful woman until she knew that mountjoys life was safe and she will never be a beautiful woman again unless the time comes when my death leaves her free to marry him on her weddingday he will see the transformation that i sawand he will be dazzled as i was  she looked at me as if she expected me to speak  i am glad indeed i said that he is out of danger  she ran to meshe kissed me i wouldnt have believed it was in her to give such kisses now i have your sympathy she said my happiness is complete do you think i was indebted for these kisses to myself or to that other man no nohere is an unworthy doubt i discard it vile suspicion shall not wrong iris this time  and yet  shall i go on and write the rest of it  poor dear arthur mountjoy once told me of a foreign author who was in great doubt of the right answer to some tough question that troubled him he went into his garden and threw a stone at a tree if he hit the tree the answer would beyes if he missed the tree the answer would beno i am going into the garden to imitate the foreign author you shall hear how it ends  i have hit the tree as a necessary consequence i must go on and write the rest of it  there is a growing estrangement between iris and myselfand my jealousy doesnt altogether account for it sometimes it occurs to me that we are thinking of what our future relations with mountjoy are likely to be and are ashamed to confess it to each other sometimesand perhaps this second and easiest guess may be the right onei am apt to conclude that we are only anxious about money matters i am waiting for her to touch on the subject and she is waiting for me and there we are at a deadlock  i wish i had some reason for going to some other place i wish i was lost among strangers i should like to find myself in a state of danger meeting the risks that i used to run in my vagabond days now i think of it i might enjoy this last excitement by going back to england and giving the invincibles a chance of shooting me as a traitor to the cause but my wife would object to that  suppose we change the subject  you will be glad to hear that you knew something of law as well as of medicine i sent instructions to my solicitor in london to raise a loan on my lifeinsurance what you said to me turns out to be right i cant raise a farthing for three years to come out of all the thousands of pounds which i shall leave behind me when i die  are my prospects from the newspaper likely to cheer me after such a disappointment as this the new journal i have the pleasure of informing you is much admired when i inquire for my profits i hear that the expenses are heavy and i am told that i must wait for a rise in our circulation how long nobody knows  i shall keep these pages open for a few days more on the chance of something happening which may alter my present position for the better   my position has altered for the worse  i have been obliged to fill my empty purse for a little while by means of a bit of stamped paper and how shall i meet my liabilities when the note falls due let time answer the question for the present the evil day is put off in the meanwhile if that literary speculation of yours is answering no better than my newspaper i can lend you a few pounds to get on with what do you say on second thoughts to coming back to your old quarters at passy and giving me your valuable advice by word of mouth instead of by letter  come and feel my pulse and look at my tongueand tell me how these various anxieties of mine are going to end before we are any of us a year older shall i like you be separated from my wifeat her request oh not at mine or shall i be locked up in prison and what will become of you do you take the hint doctor    chapter xxxv  my ladys mind  entreat lady harry not to write to me she will be tempted to do so when she hears that there is good hope of mr mountjoys recovery but even from that loving and generous heart i must not accept expressions of gratitude which would only embarrass me all that i have done as a nurse and all that i may yet hope to do is no more than an effort to make amends for my past life iris has my hearts truest wishes for her happiness until i can myself write to her without danger let this be enough   in those terms dearest of women your friend has sent your message to me my love respects as well as admires you your wishes are commands to me at the same time i may find some relief from the fears of the future that oppress me if i can confide them to friendly ears may i not harmlessly write to you if i only write of my own poor self  try dear to remember those pleasant days when you were staying with us in our honeymoon time at paris  you warned me one evening when we were alone to be on my guard against any circumstances which might excite my husbands jealousy since then the trouble that you foresaw has fallen on me mainly i am afraid through my own want of selfcontrol it is so hard for a woman when she really loves a man to understand a state of mind which can make him doubt her  i have discovered that jealousy varies let me tell you what i mean  lord harry was silent and sullen ah how well i knew what that meant while the life of our poor hugh was in jeopardy when i read the good news which told me that he was no longer in danger i dont know whether there was any change worth remarking in myselfbut there was a change in my husband delightful to see his face showed such sweet sympathy when he looked at me he spoke so kindly and nicely of hugh that i could only express my pleasure by kissing him you will hardly believe me when i tell you that his hateful jealousy appeared again at that moment he looked surprised he looked suspicioushe looked i declare as if he doubted whether i meant it with all my heart when i kissed him what incomprehensible creatures men are we read in novels of women who are able to manage their masters i wish i knew how to manage mine  we have been getting into debt for some weeks past this sad state of things has been a burden on my mind day after day i have been expecting him to speak of our situation and have found him obstinately silent is his mind entirely occupied with other things or is he unwilling to speak of our anxieties because the subject humiliates him yesterday i could bear it no longer  our debts are increasing i said have you thought of any way of paying them  i had feared that my question might irritate him to my relief he seemed to be diverted by it  the payment of debts he replied is a problem that i am too poor to solve perhaps i got near to it the other day  i asked how  well he said i found myself wishing i had some rich friends bythebye how is your rich friend what have you heard lately of mr mountjoy  i have heard that he is steadily advancing towards recovery  likely i dare say to return to france when he feels equal to it my husband remarked he is a goodnatured creature if he finds himself in paris again i wonder whether he will pay us another visit  he said this quite seriously on my side i was too much as astonished to utter a word my bewilderment seemed to amuse him in his own pleasant way he explained himself  i ought to have told you my dear that i was in mr mountjoys company the night before he returned to england we had said some disagreeable things to each other here in the cottage while you were away in your room my tongue got the better of my judgment in short i spoke rudely to our guest thinking over it afterwards i felt that i ought to make an apology he received my sincere excuses with an amiability of manner and a grace of language which raised him greatly in my estimation  there you have lord harrys own words who would suppose that he had ever been jealous of the man whom he spoke of in this way  i explain it to myself partly by the charm in hughs look and manner which everybody feels partly by the readiness with which my husbands variable nature receives new impressions i hope you agree with me in any case pray let hugh see what i have written to you in this place and ask him what he thinks of it  note by mrs vimpanyi shall certainly not be foolish enough to show what she has written to mr mountjoy poor deluded iris miserable fatal marriage  encouraged as you will easily understand by the delightful prospect of a reconciliation between them i was eager to take my first opportunity of speaking freely of hugh up to that time it had been a hard trial to keep to myself so much that was deeply interesting in my thoughts and hopes but my hours of disappointment were not at an end yet we were interrupted  a letter was brought to usone of many already receivedinsisting on immediate payment of a debt that had been too long unsettled the detestable subject of our poverty insisted on claiming attention when there was a messenger outside waiting for my poor harrys last french bank note  what is to be done i said when we were left by ourselves again  my husbands composure was something wonderful he laughed and lit a cigar  we have got to the crisis he said the question of money has driven us into a corner at last my darling have you ever heard of such a thing as a promissory note  i was not quite so ignorant as he supposed me to be i said i had heard my father speak of promissory notes  this seemed to fail in convincing him your father he remarked used to pay his notes when they fell due  i betrayed my ignorance after all doesnt everybody do the same i asked  he burst out laughing we will send the maid to get a bit of stamped paper he said ill write the message for her this time  those last words alluded to fannys ignorance of the french language which made it necessary to provide her with written instructions when she was sent on an errand in our domestic affairs i was able to do this but in the present case i only handed the message to her when she returned with a slip of stamped paper harry called to me to come to the writingtable  now my sweet he said see how easily money is to be got with a scratch of the pen  i looked over his shoulder in less than a minute it was done and he had produced ten thousand francs on paperin english money as he told me four hundred pounds this seemed to be a large loan i asked how he proposed to pay it back he kindly reminded me that he was a newspaper proprietor and as such possessed of the means of inspiring confidence in persons with money to spare they could afford it seems to give him three months in which to arrange for repayment in that time as he thought the profits of the new journal might come pouring in he knew best of course  we took the next train to paris and turned our bit of paper into notes and gold never was there such a delightful companion as my husband when he has got money in his pocket after so much sorrow and anxiety for weeks past that memorable afternoon was like a glimpse of paradise  on the next morning there was an end to my shortlived enjoyment of no more than the latter half of a day  watching her opportunity fanny mere came to me while i was alone carrying a thick letter in her hand she held it before me with the address uppermost  please to look at that she said  the letter was directed in harrys handwriting to mr vimpany at a publishing office in london fanny next turned the envelope the other way  look at this side she resumed  the envelope was specially protected by a seal bearing a device of my husbands own invention that is to say the initials of his name harry norland surmounted by a starhis lucky star as he paid me the compliment of calling it on the day when he married me i was thinking of that day now fanny saw me looking with a sad heart at the impression on the wax she completely misinterpreted the direction taken by my thoughts  tell me to do it my lady she proceeded and ill open the letter  i looked at her she showed no confusion i can seal it up again she coolly explained with a bit of fresh wax and my thimble perhaps mr vimpany wont be sober enough to notice it  do you know fanny that you are making a dishonourable proposal to me i said  i know theres nothing i can do to help you that i wont do she answered and you know why i have made a dishonourable proposalhave i that comes quite naturally to a lost woman like me shall i tell you what honour means it means sticking at nothing in your service please tell me to open the letter  how did you come by the letter fanny  my master gave it to me to put in the post  then post it  the strange creature so full of contrariesso sensitive at one time so impenetrable at anotherpointed again to the address  when the master writes to that man she went ona long letter if you will notice and a sealed letteryour ladyship ought to see what is inside it i havent a doubt myself that theres writing under this seal which bodes trouble to you the spare bedroom is empty do you want to have the doctor for your visitor again dont tell me to post the letter till ive opened it first  i do tell you to post the letter  fanny submitted so far but she had a new form of persuasion to try before her reserves of resistance were exhausted if the doctor comes back she continued will your ladyship give me leave to go out whenever i ask for it  this was surely presuming on my indulgence are you not expecting a little too much i suggestednot unkindly  if you say that my lady she answered i shall be obliged to ask you to suit yourself with another maid  there was a tone of dictation in this which i found beyond endurance in my anger i said leave me whenever you like  i shall leave you when im deadnot before was the reply that i received but if you wont let me have my liberty without going away from you for a time i must gofor your sake  for my sake pray observe that  she went on  try to see it my lady as i do if we have the doctor with us again i must be able to watch him  why  because he is your enemy as i believe  how can he hurt me fanny  through your husband my lady if he can do it in no other way mr vimpany shall have a spy at his heels dishonourable oh dishonourable again never mind i dont pretend to know what that villain means to do if he and my lord get together again but this i can tell you if its in womans wit to circumvent him here i am with my mind made up with my mind made up she repeated fiercelyand recovered on a sudden her customary character as a quiet welltrained servant devoted to her duties ill take my masters letter to the post now she said is there anything your ladyship wants in the town  what do you think of fanny mere ought i to have treated this last offer of her services as i treated her proposal to open the letter i was not able to do it  the truth is i was so touched by her devotion to me that i could not prevail on myself to mortify her by a refusal i believe there may be a good reason for the distrust of the doctor which possesses her so strongly and i feel the importance of having this faithful and determined woman for an ally let me hope that mr vimpanys return if it is to take place may be delayed until you can safely write with your own hand such a letter of wise advice as i sadly need  in the meantime give my love to hugh and say to this dear friend all that i might have said for myself if i had been near him but take care that his recovery is not retarded by anxiety for me pray keep him in ignorance of the doubts and fears with which i am now looking at the future if i was not so fond of my husband i should be easier in my mind this sounds contradictory but i believe you will understand it for a while my dear goodbye    chapter xxxvi  the doctor means mischief  on the day after lord harrys description of the state of his mind reached london a gentleman presented himself at the publishing office of messrs boldside brothers and asked for the senior partner mr peter boldside when he sent in his card it bore the name of mr vimpany  to what fortunate circumstance am i indebted sir for the honour of your visit the senior partner inquired his ingratiating manners his genial smile his roundly resonant voice were personal advantages of which he made a merciless use the literary customer who entered the office hesitating before the question of publishing a work at his own expense generally decided to pay the penalty when he encountered mr peter boldside  i want to inquire about the sale of my work mr vimpany replied  ah doctor you have come to the wrong man you must go to my brother  mr vimpany protested you mentioned the terms when i first applied to you he said and you signed the agreement  that is in my department the senior partner gently explained and i shall write the cheque when as we both hope your large profits shall fall due but our sales of works are in the department of my brother mr paul boldside he rang a bell a clerk appeared and received his instructions mr paul goodmorning doctor  mr paul was personally speaking his brother repeatedwithout the deep voice and without the genial smile conducted to the office of the junior partner mr vimpany found himself in the presence of a stranger occupied in turning over the pages of a newspaper when his name was announced the publisher started and handed his newspaper to the doctor  this is a coincidence he said i was looking sir for your name in the pages which i have just put into your hand surely the editor cant have refused to publish your letter  mr vimpany was sober and therefore sad and therefore again not to be trifled with by a mystifying reception i dont understand you he answered gruffly what do you mean  is it possible that you have not seen last weeks number of the paper mr paul asked and you a literary man he forthwith produced the last weeks number and opened it at the right place read that sir he said with something in his manner which looked like virtuous indignation  mr vimpany found himself confronted by a letter addressed to the editor it was signed by an eminent physician whose portrait had appeared in the first serial part of the new workaccompanied by a brief memoir of his life which purported to be written by himself not one line of the autobiography this celebrated person declared had proceeded from his pen mr vimpany had impudently published an imaginary memoir full of false reports and scandalous inventionsand this after he had been referred to a trustworthy source for the necessary particulars stating these facts the indignant physician cautioned readers to beware of purchasing a work which so far as he was concerned was nothing less than a fraud on the public  if you can answer that letter sir mr paul boldside resumed the better it will be i can tell you for the sale of your publication  mr vimpany made a reckless reply i want to know how the thing sells never mind the letter  never mind the letter the junior partner repeated a positive charge of fraud is advanced by a man at the head of his profession against a work which we have publishedand you say never mind the letter  the rough customer of the boldsides struck his fist on the table bother the letter i insist on knowing what the sale is  still preserving his dignity mr paul like mr peter rang for the clerk and briefly gave an order mr vimpanys account he saidand proceeded to admonish mr vimpany himself  you appear sir to have no defence of your conduct to offer our firm has a reputation to preserve when i have consulted with my brother we shall be under the disagreeable necessity  here as he afterwards told his brother the publisher was brutally interrupted by the author  if you will have it said this rude man here it is in two words the doctors portrait is the likeness of an ass as he couldnt do it himself i wanted materials for writing his life he referred me to the year of his birth the year of his marriage the year of this that and the other who cares about dates the public likes to be tickled by personal statements very welli tickled the public there you have it in a nutshell  the clerk appeared at that auspicious moment with the authors account neatly exhibited under two sides a debtor side which represented the expenditure of hugh mountjoys money and a creditor side which represented so far mr vimpanys profits amount of these last 3l 14s 10d  mr vimpany tore up the account threw the pieces in the face of mr paul and expressed his sentiments in one opprobrious word swindlers  the publisher said you shall hear of us sir through our lawyer  and the author answered go to the devil   once out in the streets again the first open door at which mr vimpany stopped was the door of a tavern he ordered a glass of brandy and water and a cigar  it was then the hour of the afternoon between the time of luncheon and the time of dinner when the business of a tavern is generally in a state of suspense the diningroom was empty when mr vimpany entered it and the waiters unoccupied attention was in want of an object having nothing else to notice he looked at the person who had just come in the deluded stranger was drinking fiery potatobrandy and smoking at the foreign price an english cigar would his taste tell him the melancholy truth no it seemed to matter nothing to him what he was drinking or what he was smoking now he looked angry and now he looked puzzled and now he took a long letter from his pocket and read it in places and marked the places with a pencil up to some mischief was the waiters interpretation of these signs the stranger ordered a second glass of grog and drank it in gulps and fell into such deep thought that he let his cigar go out evidently a man in search of an idea and to all appearance he found what he wanted on a sudden in a hurry he paid his reckoning and left his small change and his unfinished cigar on the table and was off before the waiter could say thank you  the next place at which he stopped was a fine house in a spacious square a carriage was waiting at the door the servant who opened the door knew him  sir james is going out again sir in two minutes the man said mr vimpany answered i wont keep him two minutes  a bell rang from the room on the ground floor and a gentleman came out as mr vimpany was shown in sir jamess stethoscope was still in his hand his latest medical fee lay on the table some other day vimpany the great surgeon said i have no time to give you now  will you give me a minute the humble doctor asked  very well what is it  i am down in the world now sir james as you knowand i am trying to pick myself up again  very creditable my good fellow how can i help you come comeout with it you want something  i want your great name to do me a great service i am going to france a letter of introduction from you will open doors which might be closed to an unknown man like myself  what doors do you mean sir james asked  the doors of the hospitals in paris  wait a minute vimpany have you any particular object in view  a professional object of course the ready doctor answered i have got an idea for a new treatment of diseases of the lungs and i want to see if the french have made any recent discoveries in that direction  sir james took up his penand hesitated his illstarred medical colleague had been his fellowstudent and his friend in the days when they were both young men they had seen but little of each other since they had gone their different waysone of them on the high road which leads to success the other down the byways which end in failure the famous surgeon felt a passing doubt of the use which his needy and vagabond inferior might make of his name for a moment his pen was held suspended over the paper but the man of great reputation was also a man of great heart old associations pleaded with him and won their cause his companion of former times left the house provided with a letter of introduction to the chief surgeon at the hotel dieu in paris  mr vimpanys next and last proceeding for that day was to stop at a telegraphoffice and to communicate economically with lord harry in three words  expect me tomorrow    chapter xxxvii  the first quarrel  early in the morning of the next day lord harry received the doctors telegram iris not having risen at the time he sent for fanny mere and ordered her to get the spare room ready for a guest the maids busy suspicion tempted her to put a venturesome question she asked if the person expected was a lady or a gentleman  what business is it of yours who the visitor is her master asked sharply always easy and goodhumoured with his inferiors in general lord harry had taken a dislike to his wifes maid from the moment when he had first seen her his irish feeling for beauty and brightness was especially offended by the unhealthy pallor of the womans complexion and the sullen selfsuppression of her manner all that his native ingenuity had been able to do was to make her a means of paying a compliment to his wife your maid has one merit in my eyes he said she is a living proof of the sweetness of your temper  iris joined her husband at the breakfasttable with an appearance of disturbance in her face seldom seen during the dull days of her life at passy i hear of somebody coming to stay with us she said not mr vimpany again i hope and trust  lord harry was careful to give his customary morning kiss before he replied why shouldnt my faithful old friend come and see me again he asked with his winning smile  pray dont speak of that hateful man she answered as your faithful old friend he is nothing of the kind what did you tell me when he took leave of us after his last visit and i owned i was glad that he had gone you said faith my dear im as glad as you are  her goodnatured husband laughed at this little picture of himself ah my darling how many more times am i to make the same confession to my pretty priest try to remember without more telling that its one of my misfortunes to be a man of many tempers there are times when i get tired to death of mr vimpany and there are times when the cheery old devil exercises fascinations over me i declare youre spoiling the eyebrows that i admire by letting them twist themselves into a frown after the trouble i have taken to clear your mind of prejudice against an unfortunate man its disheartening to find you so hard on the poor fellows faults and so blind to his virtues  the time had been when this remonstrance might have influenced his wifes opinion she passed it over without notice now  does he come here by your invitation she asked  how else should he come here my dear  she looked at her husband with doubt too plainly visible in her eyes i wonder what your motive is for sending for him she said  he was just lifting his teacup to his lipshe put it down again when he heard those words  are you ill this morning he asked  no  have i said anything that has offended you  certainly not  then i must tell you this iris i dont approve of what you have just said it sounds to my mind unpleasantly like suspicion of me and suspicion of my friend i see your face confessing it my lady at this moment  you are half right harry and no more what you see in my face is suspicion of your friend  founded on what if you please  founded on what i have seen of him and on what i know of him when you tried to alter my opinion of mr vimpany some time since i did my best to make my view your view i deceived myself for your sake i put the best construction on what he said and did when he was staying here it was well meant but it was of no use in a thousand different ways while he was doing his best to win my favour his true self was telling tales of him under the fair surface mr vimpany is a bad man he is the very worst friend you could have about you at any timeand especially at a time when your patience is tried by needy circumstances  one word iris the more eloquent you are the more i admire you only dont mention my needy circumstances again  she passed over the interruption as she had already passed over the remonstrance without taking notice of it  dearest you are always good to me she continued gently am i wrong in thinking that love gives me some little influence over you still women are vainare they notand i am no better than the rest of them flatter your wifes vanity harry by attaching some importance to her opinion is there time enough yet to telegraph to mr vimpany quite out of the question is it well then if he must come here dopray pray do consider me dont let him stay in the house ill find a good excuse and take a bedroom for him in the neighbourhood anywhere else so long as he is not here he turns me cold when i think of him sleeping under the same roof with ourselves not with us oh harry not with us  her eyes eagerly searched her husbands face she looked there for indulgence she looked for conviction no he was still admiring her  on my word of honour he burst out you fascinate me what an imagination you have got one of these days iris i shall be prouder of you than ever i shall find you a famous literary character i dont mean writing a novel women who cant even hem a handkerchief can write a novel its poetry im thinking of irish melodies by lady harry that beat tom moore what a gift and there are fortunes made as i have heard by people who spoil fair white paper to some purpose i wish i was one of them  have you no more to say to me she asked  what more should there be you wouldnt have me take you seriously in what you have just said of vimpany  why not  oh come come my darling just consider with a bedroom empty and waiting upstairs is my old vimpany to be sent to quarters for the night among strangers i wouldnt speak harshly to you iris for the whole world and i dont deny that the convivial doctor may be sometimes a little too fond of his drop of grog you will tell me maybe that he hasnt got on nicely with his wife and i grant it there are not many people who set such a pretty example of matrimony as we do poor humanitytheres all thats to be said about it but when you tell me that vimpany is a bad man and the worst friend i could possibly have and so forthwhat better can i do than set it down to your imagination ive a pretty fancy myself and i think i see my angel inventing poetical characters up among congenial clouds whats the matter surely you havent done breakfast yet  yes  are you going to leave me  i am going to my room  youre in a mighty hurry to get away i never meant to vex you iris ah well if you must leave the table ill have the honour of opening the door for you at any rate i wonder what youre going to do  to cultivate my imagination she answered with the first outbreak of bitterness that had escaped her yet  his face hardened there seems to be something like bearing malice in this he said are you treating me for the first time to an exhibition of enmity what am i to call it if its not that  call it disappointment she suggested quietly and left him  lord harry went back to his breakfast his jealousy was up in arms again shes comparing me with her absent friend he said to himself and wishing she had married the amiable mountjoy instead of me  so the first quarrel endedand mr vimpany had been the cause of it    chapter xxxviii  ici on parle francais  the doctor arrived in good time for dinner and shook hands with the irish lord in excellent spirits  he looked round the room and asked where my lady was lord harrys reply suggested the presence of a cloud on the domestic horizon he had been taking a long ride and had only returned a few minutes since iris would as he supposed join them immediately  the maid put the soup on the table and delivered a message her mistress was suffering from a headache and was not well enough to dine with the gentlemen  as an old married man mr vimpany knew what this meant he begged leave to send a comforting message to the suffering lady of the house would fanny be good enough to say that he had made inquiries on the subject of mr mountjoys health before he left london the report was still favourable there was nothing to complain of but the afterweakness which had followed the fever on that account only the attendance of the nurse was still a matter of necessity with my respects to lady harry he called after fanny as she went out in dogged silence  i have begun by making myself agreeable to your wife the doctor remarked with a selfapproving grin perhaps she will dine with us tomorrow pass the sherry  the remembrance of what had happened at the breakfasttable that morning seemed to be dwelling disagreeably on lord harrys mind he said but littleand that little related to the subject on which he had already written at full length to his medical friend  in an interval when the service of the table required the attendance of fanny in the kitchen mr vimpany took the opportunity of saying a few cheering words he had come he remarked prepared with the right sort of remedy for an ailing state of mind and he would explain himself at a fitter opportunity lord harry impatiently asked why the explanation was deferred if the presence of the maid was the obstacle which caused delay it would be easy to tell her that she was not wanted to wait  the wary doctor positively forbade this  he had observed fanny during his previous visit and had discovered that she seemed to distrust him the woman was sly and suspicious since they had sat down to dinner it was easy to see that she was lingering in the room to listen to the conversation on one pretence or another if she was told not to wait there could be no doubt of her next proceeding she would listen outside the door take my word for it the doctor concluded there are all the materials for a spy in fanny mere  but lord harry was obstinate chafing under the sense of his helpless pecuniary position he was determined to hear at once what remedy for it vimpany had discovered  we can set that womans curiosity at defiance he said  how  when you were learning your profession you lived in paris for some years didnt you  all right  well then you cant have entirely forgotten your french  the doctor at once understood what this meant and answered significantly by a wink he had found an opportunity he said of testing his memory not very long since time had undoubtedly deprived him of his early mastery over the french language but he could still allowing for a few mistakes make a shift to understand it and speak it there was one thing however that he wanted to know first could they be sure that my ladys maid had not picked up french enough to use her ears to some purpose lord harry easily disposed of this doubt so entirely ignorant was the maid of the language of the place in which she was living that she was not able to ask the tradespeople for the simplest article of household use unless it was written for her in french before she was sent on an errand  this was conclusive when fanny returned to the diningroom she found a surprise waiting for her the two gentlemen had taken leave of their nationality and were talking the language of foreigners   an hour later when the dinnertable had been cleared the maids domestic duties took her to lady harrys room to make tea she noticed the sad careworn look on her mistresss face and spoke of it at once in her own downright way  i thought it was only an excuse she said when you gave me that message to the gentlemen at dinnertime are you really ill my lady  i am a little out of spirits iris replied  fanny made the tea i can understand that she said to herself as she moved away to leave the room im out of spirits myself  iris called her back i heard you say just now fanny that you were out of spirits yourself if you were speaking of some troubles of your own i am sorry for you and i wont say any more but if you know what my anxieties are and share them  mine is the biggest share of the two fanny broke out abruptly it goes against the grain with me to distress you my lady but we are beginning badly and you ought to know it the doctor has beaten me already  beaten you already iris repeated tell me plainly what you mean  here it is if you please as plainly as words can say it mr vimpany has somethingsomething wicked of courseto say to my master and he wont let it pass his lips here in the cottage  why not  because he suspects me of listening at the door and looking through the keyhole i dont know my lady that he doesnt even suspect you ive learnt something in the course of my life he says to my master and its a rule with me to be careful of what i talk about indoors when there are women in the house what are you going to do tomorrow he says my lord told him there was to be a meeting at the newspaper office the doctor says ill go to paris with you the newspaper office isnt far from the luxembourg gardens when you have done your business you will find me waiting at the gate what i have to tell you you shall hear out of doors in the gardensand in an open part of them too where there are no lurkingplaces among the trees my master seemed to get angry at being put off in this way what is it you have got to tell me he says is it anything like the proposal you made when you were on your last visit here the doctor laughed tomorrow wont be long in coming he says patience my lordpatience there was no getting him to say a word more now what am i to do how am i to get a chance of listening to him out in an open garden without being seen theres what i mean when i say he has beaten me its you my ladyits you who will suffer in the end  you dont know that fanny  no my ladybut im certain of it and here i am as helpless as yourself my temper has been quiet since my misfortune it would be quiet still but for this the one animating motive the one exasperating influence in that sad and secret life was still the mistresss welfarestill the safety of the generous woman who had befriended and forgiven her she turned aside from the table to hide her ghastly face  pray try to control yourself as iris spoke she pointed kindly to a chair there is something that i want to say when you are composed again i wont hurry you i wont look at you sit down fanny  she appeared to shrink from being seated in her mistresss presence please to let me go to the window she said the air will help me  to the window she went and struggled with the passionate self so steadily kept under at other times so obstinately conquered now what did you wish to say to me she asked  you have surprisedyou have perplexed me iris said i am at a loss to understand how you discovered what seems to have passed between your master and mr vimpany you dont surely mean to tell me that they talked of their private affairs while you were waiting at table  i dont tell lies my lady fanny declared impulsively they talked of nothing else all through the dinner  before you iris exclaimed  there was a pause fear and shame confessed themselves furtively on the maids colourless face silently swiftly she turned to the door had a slip of the tongue hurried her into the betrayal of something which it was her interest to conceal dont be alarmed iris said compassionately i have no wish to intrude on your secrets  with her hand on the door fanny mere closed it again and came back  i am not so ungrateful she said as to have any secrets from you its hard to confess what may lower me in your good opinion but it must be done i have deceived your ladyshipand i am ashamed of it i have deceived the doctorand i glory in it my master and mr vimpany thought they were safe in speaking french while i was waiting on them i know french as well as they do  iris could hardly believe what she heard do you really mean what you say she asked  theres that much good in me fanny replied i always mean what i say  why did you deceive me why have you been acting the part of an ignorant woman  the deceit has been useful in your service the obstinate maid declared perhaps it may be useful again  was that what you were thinking of iris said when you allowed me to translate english into french for you and never told me the truth  at any rate i will tell you the truth now no i was not thinking of you when you wrote my errands for me in frenchi was thinking again of some advice that was once given to me  was it advice given by a friend  given by a man my lady who was the worst enemy i have ever had  her considerate mistress understood the allusion and forbade her to distress herself by saying more but fanny felt that atonement as well as explanation was due to her benefactress slowly painfully she described the person to whom she had referred he was a frenchman who had been her musicmaster during the brief period at which she had attended a school he had promised her marriage he had persuaded her to elope with him the little money that they had to live on was earned by her needle and by his wages as accompanist at a musichall while she was still able to attract him and to hope for the performance of his promise he amused himself by teaching her his own language when he deserted her his letter of farewell contained among other things the advice to which she had alluded  in your station of life this man had written knowledge of french is still a rare accomplishment keep your knowledge to yourself english people of rank have a way of talking french to each other when they dont wish to be understood by their inferiors in the course of your career you may surprise secrets which will prove to be a little fortune if you play your cards properly anyhow it is the only fortune i have to leave to you such had been the villains parting gift to the woman whom he had betrayed  she had hated him too bitterly to be depraved by his advice  on the contrary when the kindness of a friend now no longer in england had helped her to obtain her first employment as a domestic servant she had thought it might be to her interest to mention that she could read write and speak french the result proved to be not only a disappointment but a warning to her for the future such an accomplishment as a knowledge of a foreign language possessed by an englishwoman in her humble rank of life was considered by her mistress to justify suspicion questions were asked which it was impossible for her to answer truthfully small scandal drew its own conclusionsher life with the other servants became unendurableshe left her situation  from that time until the happy day when she met with iris concealment of her knowledge of french became a proceeding forced on her by her own poor interests her present mistress would undoubtedly have been taken into her confidence if the opportunity had offered itself but iris had never encouraged her to speak of the one darkest scene in her life and for that reason she had kept her own counsel until the date of her mistresss marriage distrusting the husband and the husbands confidential friendfor were they not both menshe had thought of the vile frenchmans advice and had resolved to give it a trial not with the degrading motive which he had suggested but with the vague presentiment of making a discovery of wickedness threatening mischief under a french disguise which might be of service to her benefactress at some future time  and i may still turn it to your advantage my lady fanny ventured to add if you will consent to say nothing to anybody of your having a servant who has learnt french  iris looked at her coldly and gravely must i remind you she said that you are asking my help in practicing a deception on my husband  i shall be sent away fanny answered if you tell my master what i have told you  this was indisputably true iris hesitated in her present situation the maid was the one friend on whom she could rely before her marriage she would have recoiled from availing herself under any circumstances of such services as fannys reckless gratitude had offered to her but the moral atmosphere in which she was living had begun as mrs vimpany had foreseen to exert its baneful influence the mistress descended to bargaining with the servant  deceive the doctor she said and i well remember that it may be for my good she stopped and considered for a moment her noble nature rallied its forces and prompted her next words but respect your master if you wish me to keep your secret i forbid you to listen to what my lord may say when he speaks with mr vimpany tomorrow  i have already told your ladyship that i shall have no chance of listening to what they say to each other out of doors fanny rejoined but i can watch the doctor at any rate we dont know what he may not do when he is left by himself while my master is at the meeting i want to try if i can follow that rogue through the streets without his finding me out please to send me on an errand to paris tomorrow  you will be running a terrible risk her mistress reminded her if mr vimpany discovers you  ill take my chance of that was the reckless reply  iris consented    chapter xxxix  the mystery of the hospital  on the next morning lord harry left the cottage accompanied by the doctor  after a long absence he returned alone his wifes worst apprehensions roused by what fanny had told her were more than justified by the change which she now perceived in him his eyes were bloodshot his face was haggard his movements were feeble and slow he looked like a man exhausted by some internal conflict which had vibrated between the extremes of anger and alarm im tired to death he said get me a glass of wine  she waited on him with eager obedience and watched anxiously for the reviving effect of the stimulant  the little irritabilities which degrade humanity only prolong their mischievous existence while the surface of life stagnates in calm their annihilation follows when strong emotion stirs in the depths and raises the storm the estrangement of the day before passed as completely from the minds of the husband and wifeboth strongly agitatedas if it had never existed allmastering fear was busy at their hearts fear in the woman of the unknown temptation which had tried the man fear in the man of the telltale disturbance in him which might excite the womans suspicion without venturing to look at him iris said i am afraid you have heard bad news without venturing to look at her lord harry answered yes at the newspaper office she knew that he was deceiving her and he felt that she knew it for awhile they were both silent  from time to time she anxiously stole a look at him  his mind remained absorbed in thought there they were in the same roomseated near each other united by the most intimate of human relationshipsand yet how far how cruelly far apart the slowest of all laggard minutes the minutes which are reckoned by suspense followed each other tardily and more tardily before there appeared the first sign of a change he lifted his drooping head sadly longingly he looked at her the unerring instinct of true love encouraged his wife to speak to him  i wish i could relieve your anxieties she said simply is there nothing i can do to help you  come here iris  she rose and approached him in the past days of the honeymoon and its sweet familiarities he had sometimes taken her on his knee he took her on his knee now and put his arm round her kiss me he said  with all her heart she kissed him he sighed heavily his eyes rested on her with a trustful appealing look which she had never observed in them before  why do you hesitate to confide in me she asked dear harry do you think i dont see that something troubles you  yes he said there is something that i regret  what is it  iris he answered i am sorry i asked vimpany to come back to us  at that unexpected confession a bright flush of joy and pride overspread his wifes face again the unerring instinct of love guided her to discovery of the truth the opinion of his wicked friend must have been accidentally justified at the secret interview of that day by the friend himself in tempting her husband vimpany had said something which must have shocked and offended him the result as she could hardly doubt had been the restoration of her domestic influence to its helpful freedom of controlwhether for the time only it was not in her nature at that moment of happiness to inquire after what you have just told me she ventured to say i may own that i am glad to see you come home alone  in that indirect manner she confessed the hope that friendly intercourse between the two men had come to an end his reply disappointed her  vimpany only remains in paris he said to present a letter of introduction he will follow me home  soon she asked piteously  in time for dinner i suppose she was still sitting on his knee his arm pressed her gently when he said his next words i hope you will dine with us today iris  yesif you wish it  i wish it very much something in me recoils from being alone with vimpany besides a dinner at home without you is no dinner at all  she thanked him for that little compliment by a look at the same time her grateful sense of her husbands kindness was embittered by the prospect of the doctors return is he likely to dine with us often now she was bold enough to say  i hope not  perhaps he was conscious that he might have made a more positive reply he certainly took refuge in another subjectmore agreeable to himself  my dear you have expressed the wish to relieve my anxieties he said and you can help me i think in that way i have a letter to writeof some importance iris to your interests as well as to minewhich must go to ireland by todays post you shall read it and say if you approve of what i have done dont let me be disturbed this letter i can tell you will make a hard demand on my poor brainsi must go and write in my own room  left alone with the thoughts that now crowded on her mind iris found her attention claimed once more by passing events fanny mere arrived to report herself on her return from paris  she had so managed her departure from passy as to precede lord harry and mr vimpany and to watch for their arrival in paris by a later train they had driven from the railway to the newspaper officewith the maid in attendance on them in another cab when they separated the doctor proceeded on foot to the luxembourg gardens wearing a plain black dress and protected from close observation by her veil fanny followed him cautiously keeping at a sufficient distance now on one side of the street and now on the other when my lord joined his friend she just held them in view and no more as they walked up and down in the barest and loneliest part of the gardens that they could find their talk having come to an end they parted her master was the first who came out into the street walking at a great rate and looking most desperately upset mr vimpany next appeared sauntering along with his hands in his pockets grinning as if his own villainous thoughts were thoroughly amusing him fanny was now more careful than ever not to lose sight of the doctor the course which he pursued led them to the famous hospital called the hotel dieu  at the entrance she saw him take a letter out of his pocket and give it to the porter soon afterwards a person appeared who greeted him politely and conducted him into the building for more than an hour fanny waited to see mr vimpany come out again and waited in vain what could he possibly want in a french hospital and why had he remained in that foreign institution for so long a time baffled by these mysteries and weary after much walking fanny made the best of her way home and consulted her mistress  even if iris had been capable of enlightening her the opportunity was wanting lord harry entered the room with the letter which he had just written open in his hand as a matter of course the maid retired    chapter xl  dire necessity  the irish lord had a word to say to his wife before he submitted to her the letter which he had just written  he had been summoned to a meeting of proprietors at the office of the newspaper convened to settle the terms of a new subscription rendered necessary by unforeseen expenses incurred in the interests of the speculation the vote that followed after careful preliminary consultation authorised a claim on the purses of subscribing proprietors which sadly reduced the sum obtained by lord harrys promissory note nor was this inconvenience the only trial of endurance to which the irish lord was compelled to submit the hope which he had entertained of assistance from the profits of the new journal when repayment of the loan that he had raised became due was now plainly revealed as a delusion ruin stared him in the face unless he could command the means of waiting for the pecuniary success of the newspaper during an interval variously estimated at six months or even at a year to come  our case is desperate enough he said to call for a desperate remedy keep up your spirits irisi have written to my brother  iris looked at him in dismay  surely she said you once told me you had written to your brother and he answered you in the cruellest manner through his lawyers  quite true my dear but this time there is one circumstance in our favourmy brother is going to be married the lady is said to be an heiress a charming creature admired and beloved wherever she goes there must surely be something to soften the hardest heart in that happy prospect read what i have written and tell me what you think of it  the opinion of the devoted wife encouraged the desperate husband the letter was dispatched by the post of that day  if boisterous good spirits can make a man agreeable at the dinnertable then indeed mr vimpany on his return to the cottage played the part of a welcome guest he was inexhaustible in gallant attentions to his friends wife he told his most amusing stories in his happiest way he gaily drank his hosts fine white burgundy and praised with thorough knowledge of the subject the succulent french dishes he tried lord harry with talk on politics talk on sport and wonderful to relate in these days talk on literature the preoccupied irishman was equally inaccessible on all three subjects when the dessert was placed on the tablestill bent on making himself agreeable to lady harrymr vimpany led the conversation to the subject of floriculture in the interests of her ladyships pretty little garden he advocated a complete change in the system of cultivation and justified his revolutionary views by misquoting the published work of a great authority on gardening with such polite obstinacy that iris eager to confute him went away to fetch the book the moment he had entrapped her into leaving the room the doctor turned to lord harry with a sudden change to the imperative mood in look and manner  what have you been about he asked since we had that talk in the gardens today have you looked at your empty purse and are you wise enough to take my way of filling it  as long as theres the ghost of a chance left to me lord harry replied ill take any way of filling my purse but yours  does that mean you have found a way  do me a favour vimpany defer all questions till the end of the week  and then i shall have your answer  without fail i promise it hush  iris returned to the diningroom with her book and polite mr vimpany owned in the readiest manner that he had been mistaken  the remaining days of the week followed each other wearily during the interval lord harrys friend carefully preserved the character of a model guesthe gave as little trouble as possible every morning after breakfast the doctor went away by the train every morning with similar regularity he was followed by the resolute fanny mere pursuing his way through widely different quarters of paris he invariably stopped at a public building invariably presented a letter at the door and was invariably asked to walk in inquiries patiently persisted in by the english maid led in each case to the same result the different public buildings were devoted to the same benevolent purpose like the hotel dieu they were all hospitals and mr vimpanys object in visiting them remained as profound a mystery as ever  early on the last morning of the week the answer from lord harrys brother arrived hearing of it iris ran eagerly into her husbands room the letter was already scattered in fragments on the floor what the tone of the earls inhuman answer had been in the past time that it was again now  iris put her arms round her husbands neck oh my poor love what is to be done  he answered in one reckless word nothing  is there nobody else who can help us she asked  ah well darling theres perhaps one other person still left  who is the person  who should it be but your own dear self  she looked at him in undisguised bewilderment only tell me harry what i can do  write to mountjoy and ask him to lend me the money  he said it in those shameless words he said it she who had sacrificed mountjoy to the man whom she had married was now asked by that man to use mountjoys devotion to her as a means of paying his debts iris drew back from him with a cry of disgust  you refuse he said  do you insult me by doubting it she answered  he rang the bell furiously and dashed out of the room she heard him on the stairs ask where mr vimpany was the servant replied in the garden my lord  smoking a cigar luxuriously in the fine morning air the doctor saw his excitable irish friend hastening out to meet him  dont hurry he said in full possession of his impudent goodhumour and dont lose your temper will you take my way out of your difficulties or will you not which is ityes or no  you infernal scoundrelyes  my dear lord i congratulate you  on what sir  on being as great a scoundrel as i am    chapter xli  the man is found  the unworthy scheme by means of which lord harry had proposed to extricate himself from his pecuniary responsibilities had led to serious consequences it had produced a state of deliberate estrangement between man and wife  iris secluded herself in her own room her husband passed the hours of every day away from the cottage sometimes in the company of the doctor sometimes among his friends in paris his wife suffered acutely under the selfimposed state of separation to which wounded pride and keenly felt resentment compelled her to submit no friend was near her in whose compassionate advice she might have token refuge not even the sympathy of her maid was offered to the lonely wife  with the welfare of iris as her one end in view fanny mere honestly believed that it would be better and safer for lady harry if she and her husband finally decided on living separate lives the longer my lord persisted in keeping the doctor with him as his guest the more perilously he was associated with a merciless wretch who would be capable of plotting the ruin of anyoneman or woman high person or low personwho might happen to be an obstacle in his way so far as a person in her situation could venture on taking the liberty the maid did her best to widen the breach between her master and her mistress  while fanny was making the attempt to influence lady harry and only producing irritation as the result vimpany was exerting stronger powers of persuasion in the effort to prejudice the irish lord against any proposal for reconciliation which might reach him through his wife  i find an unforgiving temper in your charming lady the doctor declared it doesnt show itself on the surface my dear fellow but there it is take a wise advantage of circumstancessay you will raise no inconvenient objections if she wants a separation by mutual consent now dont misunderstand me i only recommend the sort of separation which will suit our convenience you know as well as i do that you can whistle your wife back again  mr vimpanys friend was rude enough to interrupt him there  i call that a coarse way of putting it lord harry interposed  put it how you like for yourself the doctor rejoined lady harry may be persuaded to come back to you when we want her for our grand project in the meantime for i am always a considerate man where women are concerned we act delicately towards my lady in sparing her the discovery ofwhat shall i call our coming enterpriseventuresome villainy which might ruin you in your wifes estimation do you see our situation now as it really is very well pass the bottle and drop the subject for the present  the next morning brought with it an event which demolished the doctors ingenious arrangement for the dismissal of iris from the scene of action lord and lady harry encountered each other accidentally on the stairs  distrusting herself if she ventured to look at him iris turned her eyes away from her husband he misinterpreted the action as an expression of contempt anger at once inclined him to follow mr vimpanys advice  he opened the door of the diningroom empty at that moment and told iris that he wished to speak with her what his villainous friend had suggested that he should say on the subject of a separation he now repeated with a repellent firmness which he was far from really feeling the acting was bad but the effect was produced for the first time his wife spoke to him  do you really mean it she asked  the tone in which she said those words sadly and regretfully telling its tale of uncontrollable surprise the tender remembrance of past happy days in her eyes the quivering pain expressive of wounded love that parted her lips in the effort to breathe freely touched his heart try as he might in the wretched pride of the moment to conceal it he was silent  if you are weary of our married life she continued say so and let us part i will go away without entreaties and without reproaches whatever pain i may feel you shall not see it a passing flush crossed her face and left it pale again she trembled under the consciousness of returning lovethe blind love that had so cruelly misled her at a moment when she most needed firmness her heart was sinking she resisted struggled recovered herself quietly and even firmly she claimed his decision does your silence mean she asked that you wish me to leave you  no man who had loved her as tenderly as her husband had loved her could have resisted that touching selfcontrol he answered his wife without uttering a wordhe held out his arms to her the fatal reconciliation was accomplished in silence  at dinner on that day mr vimpanys bold eyes saw a new sight and mr vimpanys rascally lips indulged in an impudent smile my lady appeared again in her place at the dinnertable at the customary time the two men were left alone over their wine the reckless irish lord rejoicing in the recovery of his wifes tender regard drank freely understanding and despising him the doctors devilish gaiety indulged in facetious reminiscences of his own married life  if i could claim a sovereign he said for every quarrel between mrs vimpany and myself i put it at a low average when i declare that i should be worth a thousand pounds how does your lordship stand in that matter shall we say a dozen breaches of the marriage agreement up to the present time  say twoand no more to come his friend answered cheerfully  no more to come the doctor repeated my experience says plenty more to come i never saw two people less likely to submit to a peaceable married life than you and my lady ha you laugh at that its a habit of mine to back my opinion ill bet you a dozen of champagne there will be a quarrel which parts you two for good and all before the year is out do you take the bet  done cried lord harry i propose my wifes good health vimpany in a bumper she shall drink confusion to all false prophets in the first glass of your champagne  the post of the next morning brought with it two letters  one of them bore the postmark of london and was addressed to lady harry norland it was written by mrs vimpany and it contained a few lines added by hugh mountjoy my strength is slow in returning to me he wrote but my kind and devoted nurse says that all danger of infection is at an end you may write again to your old friend if lord harry sees no objection as harmlessly as in the happy past time my weak hand begins to tremble already how glad i shall be to hear from you it is happily for me quite needless to add  in her delight at receiving this good news iris impulsively assumed that her husband would give it a kindly welcome on his side she insisted on reading the letter to him he said coldly i am glad to hear of mr mountjoys recoveryand took up the newspaper was this unworthy jealousy still strong enough to master him even at that moment his wife had forgotten it why had he not forgotten it too  on the same day iris replied to hugh with the confidence and affection of the bygone time before her marriage after closing and addressing the envelope she found that her small store of postage stamps was exhausted and sent for her maid mr vimpany happened to pass the open door of her room while she was asking for a stamp he heard fanny say that she was not able to accommodate her mistress allow me to make myself useful the polite doctor suggested he produced a stamp and fixed it himself on the envelope when he had proceeded on his way downstairs fannys distrust of him insisted on expressing itself he wanted to find out what person you have written to she said let me make your letter safe in the post in five minutes more it was in the box at the office  while these trifling events were in course of progress mr vimpany had gone into the garden to read the second of the two letters delivered that morning addressed to himself on her return from the postoffice fanny had opportunities of observing him while she was in the greenhouse trying to revive the perishing flowersneglected in the past days of domestic trouble  noticing her after he had read his letter over for the second time mr vimpany sent the maid into the cottage to say that he wished to speak with her master lord harry joined him in the gardenlooked at the letterand handing it back turned away the doctor followed him and said something which seemed to be received with objection mr vimpany persisted nevertheless and apparently carried his point the two gentlemen consulted the railway timetable and hurried away together to catch the train to paris  fanny mere returned to the conservatory and absently resumed her employment among the flowers on what evil errand had the doctor left the cottage and why on this occasion had he taken the master with him  the time had been when fanny might have tried to set these questions at rest by boldly following the two gentlemen to paris trusting to her veil to her luck and to the choice of a separate carriage in the train to escape notice but although her illjudged interference with the domestic affairs of lady harry had been forgiven she had not been received again into favour unreservedly conditions were imposed which forbade her to express any opinion on her masters conduct and which imperatively ordered her to leave the protection of her mistressif protection was really neededin his lordships competent hands i gratefully appreciate your kind intentions iris had said with her customary tenderness of regard for the feelings of others but i never wish to hear again of mr vimpany or of the strange suspicions which he seems to excite in your mind still as gratefully devoted to iris as ever fanny viewed the change in my ladys way of thinking as one of the deplorable results of her return to her husband and waited resignedly for the coming time when her wise distrust of two unscrupulous men would be justified  condemned to inaction for the present lady harrys maid walked irritably up and down the conservatory forgetting the flowers through the open back door of the cottage the cheap clock in the hall poured its harsh little volume of sound striking the hour i wonder she said to herself if those two wicked ones have found their way to a hospital yet that guess happened to have hit the mark the two wicked ones were really approaching a hospital well known to the doctor by more previous visits than one at the door they were met by a french physician attached to the institutionthe writer of the letter which had reached mr vimpany in the morning  this gentleman led the way to the official department of the hospital and introduced the two foreigners to the french authorities assembled for the transaction of business  as a medical man mr vimpanys claims to general respect and confidence were carefully presented he was a member of the english college of surgeons he was the friend as well as the colleague of the famous president of that college who had introduced him to the chief surgeon of the hotel dieu other introductions to illustrious medical persons in paris had naturally followed presented under these advantages mr vimpany announced his discovery of a new system of treatment in diseases of the lungs having received his medical education in paris he felt bound in gratitude to place himself under the protection of the princes of science resident in the brilliant capital of france in that hospital after much fruitless investigation in similar institutions he had found a patient suffering from the form of lung disease which offered to him the opportunity that he wanted it was impossible that he could do justice to his new system unless the circumstances were especially favourable air more pure than the air of a great city and bedroom accommodation not shared by other sick persons were among the conditions absolutely necessary to the success of the experiment these and other advantages were freely offered to him by his noble friend who would enter into any explanations which the authorities then present might think it necessary to demand  the explanations having been offered and approved there was a general move to the bed occupied by the invalid who was an object of professional interest to the english doctor  the patients name was oxbye he was a native of denmark and had followed in his own country the vocation of a schoolmaster his knowledge of the english language and the french had offered him the opportunity of migrating to paris where he had obtained employment as translator and copyist earning his bread poorly enough in this way he had been prostrated by the malady which had obliged him to take refuge in the hospital the french physician under whose medical care he had been placed having announced that he had communicated his notes enclosed in a letter to his english colleague and having frankly acknowledged that the result of the treatment had not as yet sufficiently justified expectation the officers of the institution spoke next the dane was informed of the nature of mr vimpanys interest in him and of the hospitable assistance offered by mr vimpanys benevolent friend and the question was then put whether he preferred to remain where he was or whether he desired to be removed under the conditions which had just been stated  tempted by the prospect of a change which offered to him a bedchamber of his own in the house of a person of distinctionwith a garden to walk about in and flowers to gladden his eyes when he got betteroxbye eagerly adopted the alternative of leaving the hospital pray let me go the poor fellow said i am sure i shall be the better for it without opposing this decision the responsible directors reminded him that it had been adopted on impulse and decided that it was their duty to give him a little time for consideration  in the meanwhile some of the gentlemen assembled at the bedside looking at oxbye and then looking at lord harry had observed a certain accidental likeness between the patient and milord the philanthropist who was willing to receive him the restraints of politeness had only permitted them to speak of this curious discovery among themselves at the later time however when the gentlemen had taken leave of each other mr vimpanyfinding himself alone with lord harryhad no hesitation in introducing the subject on which delicacy had prevented the frenchmen from entering  did you look at the dane he began abruptly  of course i did  and you noticed the likeness  not i  the doctors uproarious laughter startled the people who were walking near them in the street heres another proof he burst out of the true saying that no man knows himself you dont deny the likeness i suppose  do you yourself see it lord harry asked  mr vimpany answered the question scornfully is it likely that i should have submitted to all the trouble i have taken to get possession of that man if i had not seen a likeness between his face and yours  the irish lord said no more when his friend asked why he was silent he gave his reason sharply enough i dont like the subject    chapter xlii  the mettlesome maid  on the evening of that day fanny mere entering the diningroom with the coffee found lord harry and mr vimpany alone and discovered as soon as she opened the door that they changed the language in which they were talking from english to french  she continued to linger in the room apparently occupied in setting the various objects on the sideboard in order her master was speaking at the time he asked if the doctor had succeeded in finding a bedroom for himself in the neighbourhood to this mr vimpany replied that he had got the bedroom also that he had provided himself with something else which it was equally important to have at his disposal i mean he proceeded in his bad french that i have found a photographic apparatus on hire we are ready now for the appearance of our interesting danish guest  and when the man comes lord harry added what am i to say to my wife how am i to find an excuse when she hears of a hospital patient who has taken possession of your bedroom at the cottageand has done it with my permission and with you to attend on him  the doctor sipped his coffee we have told a story that has satisfied the authorities he said coolly repeat the story to your wife  she wont believe it lord harry replied  mr vimpany waited until he had lit another cigar and had quite satisfied himself that it was worth smoking  you have yourself to thank for that obstacle he resumed if you had taken my advice your wife would have been out of our way by this time i suppose i must manage it if you fail leave her ladyship to me in the meanwhile theres a matter of more importance to settle first we shall want a nurse for our poor dear invalid where are we to find her  as he stated that difficulty he finished his coffee and looked about him for the bottle of brandy which always stood on the dinnertable in doing this he happened to notice fanny convinced that her mistress was in danger after what she had already heard the maids anxiety and alarm had so completely absorbed her that she had forgotten to play her part instead of still busying herself at the sideboard she stood with her back to it palpably listening cunning mr vimpany possessing himself of the brandy made a request too entirely appropriate to excite suspicion  some fresh cold water if you please was all that he said  the moment that fanny left the room the doctor addressed his friend in english with his eye on the door news for you my boy we are in a pretty picklelady harrys maid understands french  quite impossible lord harry declared  we will put that to the test mr vimpany answered watch her when she comes in again  what are you going to do  i am going to insult her in french observe the result  in another minute fanny returned with the fresh water as she placed the glass jug before mr vimpany he suddenly laid his hand on her arm and looked her straight in the face vous nous avez mis dedans drolesse he said  in english you have taken us in you jade  an uncontrollable look of mingled rage and fear made its plain confession in fannys face she had been discovered she had heard herself called drolesse she stood before the two men selfcondemned her angry master threatened her with instant dismissal from the house the doctor interfered  no no he said you mustnt deprive lady harry at a moments notice of her maid such a clever maid too he added with his rascally smile an accomplished person who understands french and is too modest to own it  the doctor had led fanny through many a weary and unrewarded walk when she had followed him to the hospitals he had now inflicted a deliberate insult by calling her drolesse and he had completed the sum of his offences by talking contemptuously of her modesty and her mastery of the french language the womans detestation of him which under ordinary circumstances she might have attempted to conceal was urged into audaciously asserting itself by the strong excitement that now possessed her driven to bay fanny had made up her mind to discover the conspiracy of which mr vimpany was the animating spirit by a method daring enough to be worthy of the doctor himself  my knowledge of french has told me something she said i have just heard mr vimpany that you want a nurse for your invalid gentleman with my lords permission suppose you try me  fannys audacity was more than her masters patience could endure he ordered her to leave the room  the peacemaking doctor interfered again my dear lord let me beg you will not be too hard on the young woman he turned to fanny with an effort to look indulgent which ended in the reappearance of his rascally smile thank you my dear for your proposal he said i will let you know if we accept it tomorrow  fannys unforgiving master pointed to the door she thanked mr vimpany and went out lord harry eyed his friend in angry amazement are you mad he asked  tell me something first the doctor rejoined is there any english blood in your family  lord harry answered with a burst of patriotic feeling i regret to say my family is adulterated in that manner my grandmother was an englishwoman  mr vimpany received this extract from the page of family history with a coolness all his own  its a relief to hear that he said you may be capable by the grandmothers side of swallowing a dose of sound english sense i can but try at any rate that woman is too bold and too clever to be treated like an ordinary servanti incline to believe that she is a spy in the employment of your wife whether i am right or wrong in this latter case the one way i can see of paring the cats claws is to turn her into a nurse do you find me mad now  madder than ever  ah you dont take after your grandmother now listen to me do we run the smallest risk if fanny finds it her interest to betray us suppose we ask ourselves what she has really found out she knows we have got a sick man from a hospital coming heredoes she know what we want him for not she neither you nor i said a word on that subject but she also heard us agree that your wife was in our way what does that matter did she hear us say what it is that we dont want your wife to discover not she i tell you again very well thenif fanny acts as oxbyes nurse shy as the young woman may be she innocently associates herself with the end that we have to gain by the danish gentlemans death oh you neednt look alarmed i mean his natural death by lung diseaseno crime my noble friend no crime  the irish lord sitting near the doctor drew his chair back in a hurry  if theres english blood in my family he declared ill tell you what vimpany theres devils blood in yours  anything you like but irish blood the cool scoundrel rejoined  as he made that insolent reply fanny came in again with a sufficient excuse for her reappearance she announced that a person from the hospital wished to speak to the english doctor  the messenger proved to be a young man employed in the secretarys office oxbye still persisting in his desire to be placed under mr vimpanys care one last responsibility rested on the official gentlemen now in charge of him they could implicitly trust the medical assistance and the gracious hospitality offered to the poor danish patient but before he left them they must also be satisfied that he would be attended by a competent nurse if the person whom mr vimpany proposed to employ in this capacity could be brought to the hospital it would be esteemed a favour and if her account of herself satisfied the physician in charge of oxbyes case the dane might be removed to his new quarters on the same day  the next morning witnessed the first in a series of domestic incidents at the cottage which no prophetic ingenuity could have foreseen mr vimpany and fanny mere actually left passy together on their way to paris    chapter xliii  fiction attempted by my lord  the day on which the doctor took his newlyappointed nurse with him to the hospital became an occasion associated with distressing recollections in the memory of iris  in the morning fanny mere had asked for leave to go out for some time past this request had been so frequently granted with such poor results so far as the maids own designs were concerned that lady harry decided on administering a tacit reproof by means of a refusal fanny made no attempt at remonstrance she left the room in silence  half an hour later iris had occasion to ring for her attendant the bell was answered by the cookwho announced in explanation of her appearance that fanny mere had gone out more distressed than displeased by this reckless disregard of her authority on the part of a woman who had hitherto expressed the most grateful sense of her kindness iris only said send fanny to me as soon as she comes back  two hours passed before the truant maid returned  i refused to let you go out this morning lady harry said and you have taken the liberty of leaving the house for two hours you might have made me understand in a more becoming manner that you intended to leave my service  steadily respectful fanny answered i dont wish to leave your ladyships service  then what does your conduct mean  it means if you please that i had a duty to doand did it  a duty to yourself iris asked  no my lady a duty to you  as she made that strange reply the door was opened and lord harry entered the room when he saw fanny mere he turned away again in a hurry to go out i didnt know your maid was with you he said another time will do  his permitting a servant to be an obstacle in his way when he wished to speak to his wife was a concession so entirely unbecoming in the master of the house and so strangely contrary to his customary sense of what was due to himself that iris called him back in astonishment she looked at her maid who at once understood her and withdrew what can you possibly be thinking of she said to her husband when they were alone putting that question she noticed an embarrassment in his manner and an appearance of confusion in his face which alarmed her has something happened she asked and is it so serious that you hesitate to mention it to me  he sat down by her and took her hand the loving look in his eyes which she knew so well was not in them now they expressed doubt and something with it which suggested an effort at conciliation  i am fearing i shall surprise you he said  dont keep me in suspense she returned what is it  he smiled uneasily its something about vimpany  having got as far as that he stopped she drew her hand away from him i understand now she said i must endeavour to control myselfyou have something to tell me which will try my temper  he held up his hands in humorous protest ah my darling heres your vivid imagination again making mountains out of molehills as they say its nothing half so serious as you seem to think i have only to tell you of a little change  a little change she repeated what change  well my dear you see he hesitated and recovered himself i mean you must know that vimpanys plans are altered he wont any longer occupy his bedroom in the cottage here  iris looked inexpressibly relieved going away at last she exclaimed oh harry if you have been mystifying me i hope you will never do it again it isnt like you its cruel to alarm me about nothing mr vimpanys empty bedroom will be the most interesting room in the house when i look into it tonight  lord harry got up and walked to the window as a sign of trouble in his mind and of an instinctive effort to relieve it the object of this movement was wellknown to iris she followed him and stood by his side it was now plain to her that there was something more to be toldand that he was hesitating how to confide it to his wife  go on she said resignedly  he had expected her to take his arm or perhaps to caress him or at least to encourage him by her gentlest words and her prettiest smiles the steady selfrestraint which she now manifested was a sign as he interpreted it of suppressed resentment shrinking honestly shrinking from the bare possibility of another quarrel he confronted the hard necessities of further confession  well now he said its only thisyou mustnt look into the empty bedroom tonight  why not  ah for the best of all good reasons because you might find somebody in there  this reply excited her curiosity her eyes rested on him eagerly some friend of yours she asked  he persisted in an assumption of goodhumour which betrayed itself as mere artifice in the clumsiest manner i declare i feel as if i were in a court of justice being crossexamined by a lawyer of skill and dexterity well my sweet counsellor nonot exactly a friend of mine  she reflected for a moment you dont surely mean one of mr vimpanys friends she said  he pretended not to have heard her and pointed to the view of the garden from the window isnt it a lovely day lets go and look at the flowers he suggested  did you not hear what i said to you just now she persisted  i beg your pardon dear i was thinking of something else suppose we go into the garden  when women have a point to gain in which they are interested how many of them are capable of deferring it to a better opportunity one in a thousand perhaps iris kept her place at the window resolved on getting an answer  i asked you harry whether the person who is to occupy our spare bedroom tonight was one of mr vimpanys friends  say one of mr vimpanys patientsand you will be nearer the truth he answered with an outburst of impatience  she could hardly believe him do you mean a person who is really ill she said  of course i mean it he said irritated into speaking out at last  a man or a woman  a man  may i ask if he comes from england  he comes from one of the french hospitals anything more  iris left her husband to recover his goodhumour and went back to her chair the extraordinary disclosure which she had extracted from him had produced a stupefying effect on her mind her customary sympathy with him her subtle womanly observation of his character her intimate knowledge of his merits and his defects failed to find the rational motive which might have explained his conduct she looked round at him with mingled feelings of perplexity and distrust  he was still at the window but he had turned his back on the view of the garden his eyes were fixed in furtive expectation on his wife was he waiting to hear her say something more she ran the risk and said it  i dont quite understand the sacrifice you seem to be making to mr vimpany she confessed will you tell me dear what it means  here was the opportunity offered of following the doctors advice and putting his wifes credulity to the test with her knowledge of vimpany would she really believe the story which had imposed on the strangers who managed the hospital lord harry made up his mind to try the experiment no matter what the result might be it would bring the responsibilities that were crushing him to an end he need say no more if the deception succeeded he could do no more if it failed under the influence of this cheering reflection he recovered his temper his handsome face brightened again with its genial boyish smile  what a wonderful woman you are he cried isnt it just the thing that i am here for to tell you what i meanand my clever wife sees through and through me and reminds me of what i must do pay my fee beforehand iris give me a kissand my poor meaning shall be offered in return it will help me if you remember one thing vimpany and i are old friends and theres nothing we wont do to accommodate each other mind that  tried fairly on its own merits the stupid fiction invented by the doctor produced an effect for which lord harry was not prepared the longer iris listened the more strangely iris looked at him not a word fell from her lips when he had done he noticed that she had turned pale it seemed to be almost possible that he had frightened her  if his birdwitted brains could have coupled cause and effect this was exactly the result which he might have anticipated  she was asked to believe that a new system of medical practice had been invented by such a person as mr vimpany she was asked to believe that an invalid from a foreign hospital who was a perfect stranger to lord harry had been willingly made welcome to a bedroom at the cottage she was asked to believe that this astounding concession had been offered to the doctor as a tribute of friendship after her husband had himself told her that he regretted having invited vimpany for the second time to become his guest here was one improbable circumstance accumulated on another and a clever woman was expected to accept the monstrous excuses thus produced as a trustworthy statement of facts irresistibly the dread of some evil deed in secret contemplation cast its darkening presence on the wifes mind lord harrys observation had not misled him when he saw iris turn pale and when the doubt was forced on him whether he might not have frightened her  if my explanation of this little matter has satisfied you he ventured to resume we need say no more about it  i agree with you she answered let us say no more about it conscious in spite of the effort to resist it of a feeling of oppression while she was in the same room with a man who had deliberately lied to her and that man her husband she reminded lord harry that he had proposed to take a walk in the garden out in the pure air under the bright sky she might breathe more freely come to the flowers she said  they went to the garden togetherthe wife fearing the deceitful husband the husband fearing the quickwitted wife  watching each other like two strangers they walked silently side by side and looked now and then at the collection of flowers and plants iris noticed a delicate fern which had fallen away from the support to which it had been attached she stopped and occupied herself in restoring it to its place when she looked round again after attending to the plant her husband had disappeared and mr vimpany was waiting in his place    chapter xliv  fiction improved by the doctor  where is lord harry iris asked  the reply startled her lord harry leaves me to say to your ladyship what he has not had resolution enough to say for himself  i dont understand you mr vimpany  the doctor pointed to the fern which had just been the object of lady harrys care  you have been helping that sickly plant there to live and thrive he said and i have felt some curiosity in watching you there is another sickly plant which i have undertaken to rear if the thing can be done my gardening is of the medical kindi can only carry it on indoorsand whatever else it may be i tell you plainly like the outspoken sort of fellow i am its not likely to prove agreeable to a lady no offence i hope your humble servant is only trying to produce the right sort of impressionand takes leave to doubt his lordship in one particular  in what particular sir  ill put it in the form of a question maam has my friend persuaded you to make arrangements for leaving the cottage  iris looked at lord harrys friend without attempting to conceal her opinion of him  i call that an impertinent question she said by what right do you presume to inquire into what my husband and i may or may not have said to each other  will you do me a favour my lady or if that is asking too much perhaps you will not object to do justice to yourself suppose you try to exercise the virtue of selfcontrol  quite needless mr vimpany pray understand that you are not capable of making me angry  many thanks lady harry you encourage me to go on when i was bold enough to speak of your leaving the cottage my motive was to prevent you from being needlessly alarmed  did this mean that he was about to take her into his confidence all her experience of him forbade her to believe it possible but the doubts and fears occasioned by her interview with her husband had mastered her better sense and the effort to conceal from the doctor the anxiety under which she suffered was steadily weakening the influence of her selfrespect why should i be alarmed she asked in the vain hope of encouraging him to tell the truth  the doctor arrived at a hasty conclusion on his side believing that he had shaken her resolution he no longer troubled himself to assume the forms of politeness which he had hitherto with some difficulty contrived to observe  in this curious little world of ours he resumed we enjoy our lives on infernally hard terms we live on condition that we die the man i want to cure may die in spite of the best i can do for himhe may sink slowly by what we medical men call a hard death for example it wouldnt much surprise me if i found some difficulty in keeping him in his bed he might roam all over your cottage when my back was turned or he might pay the debt of natureas somebody calls itwith screaming and swearing if you were within hearing of him im afraid you might be terrified and with the best wish to be useful i couldnt guarantee if the worst happened to keep him quiet in your place if you will allow me to advise you  iris interrupted him instead of confessing the truth he was impudently attempting to frighten her i dont allow a person in whom i have no confidence to advise me she said i wish to hear no more  mr vimpany found it desirable to resume the forms of politeness either he had failed to shake her resolution or she was sufficiently in possession of herself to conceal what she felt  one last word he said i wont presume to advise your ladyship i will merely offer a suggestion my lord tells me that hugh mountjoy is on the way to recovery you are in communication with him by letter as i happened to notice when i did you that trifling service of providing a postagestamp why not go to london and cheer your convalescent friend harry wont mind iti beg your pardon i ought to have said lord harry come come my dear lady i am a rough fellow but i mean well take a holiday and come back to us when my lord writes to say that he can have the pleasure of receiving you again he waited for a moment am i not to be favoured with an answer he asked  my husband shall answer you  with those parting words iris turned her back on him  she entered the cottage now in one room and now in another she searched for lord harry he was nowhere to be found had he purposely gone out to avoid her her own remembrance of vimpanys language and vimpanys manner told her that so it must bethe two men were in league together of all dangers unknown danger is the most terrible to contemplate lady harrys last resources of resolution failed her she dropped helplessly into a chair  after an intervalwhether it was a long or a short lapse of time she was unable to decidesomeone gently opened the door had her husband felt for her had he returned come in she cried eagerly come in    chapter xlv  fact related by fanny  the person who now entered the room was fanny mere  but one interest was stirring in the mind of iris now do you know where your master is she asked  i saw him go out the maid replied which way i didnt particularly notice she was on the point of adding and i didnt particularly care when she checked herself yesterday and today my lady things have come to my knowledge which i must not keep to myself the resolute woman continued if a servant may say such a thing without offence i have never been so truly my mistresss friend as i am now i beg you to forgive my boldness there is a reason for it  so she spoke with no presumption in her looks with no familiarity in her manner the eyes of her friendless mistress filled with tears the offered hand of her friendless mistress answered in silence fanny took that kind hand and pressed it respectfullya more demonstrative woman than herself might perhaps have kissed it she only said thank you my lady and went on with what she felt it her duty to relate  as carefully as usual as quietly as usual she repeated the conversation at lord harrys table describing also the manner in which mr vimpany had discovered her as a person who understood the french language and who had cunningly kept it a secret in this serious state of things the doctoryes the doctor himselfhad interfered to protect her from the anger of her master and more wonderful still for a reason which it seemed impossible to dispute he wanted a nurse for the foreigner whose arrival was expected on that evening and he had offered the place to fanny your ladyship will i hope excuse me i have taken the place  this amazing end to the strange events which had just been narrated proved to be more than iris was immediately capable of understanding i am in the dark she confessed is mr vimpany a bolder villain even than i have supposed him to be  that he most certainly is fanny said with strong conviction as to what he really had in his wicked head when he engaged me i shall find that out in time anyway i am the nurse who is to help him when i disobeyed you this morning my lady it was to go to the hospital with mr vimpany i was taken to see the person whose nurse i am to be a poor feeble polite creature who looked as if he couldnt hurt a flyand yet i promise you he startled me i saw a likeness the moment i looked at him  a likeness to anybody whom i know iris asked  to the person in all the world my lady whom you know most nearlya likeness to my master  what  oh its no fancy i am sure of what i say to my mind that danish mans likeness to my lord is if you will excuse my language a nasty circumstance i dont know why or whereforeall i can say is i dont like it and i shant rest until i have found out what it means besides this my lady i must know the reason why they want to get you out of their way please to keep up your heart i shall warn you in time when i am sure of the danger  iris refused to sanction the risk involved in this desperate design its you who will be in danger she exclaimed  in her coolest state of obstinacy fanny answered thats in your ladyships serviceand that doesnt reckon  feeling gratefully this simple and sincere expression of attachment iris held to her own opinion nevertheless  you are in my service she said i wont let you go to mr vimpany give it up fanny give it up  ill give it up my lady when i know what the doctor means to donot before  the assertion of authority having failed iris tried persuasion next  as your mistress it is my duty to set you an example she resumed one of us must be considerate and gentle in a disputelet me try to be that one there can be no harm and there may be some good in consulting the opinion of a friend some person in whose discretion we can trust  am i acquainted with the person your ladyship is thinking of fanny inquired in that case a friend will know what we want of her by tomorrow morning i have written to mrs vimpany  the very person i had in my mind fanny when may we expect to hear from her  if mrs vimpany can put what she has to say to us into few words fanny replied we shall hear from her tomorrow by telegraph  as she answered her mistress in those cheering words they were startled by a heavy knock at the door of the room under similar circumstances lord harrys delicate hand would have been just loud enough to be heard and no more iris called out suspiciously whos there  the doctors gross voice answered can i say a word if you please to fanny mere  the maid opened the door mr vimpanys heavy hand laid bold of her arm pulled her over the threshold and closed the door behind her after a brief absence fanny returned with news of my lord  a commissioner had arrived with a message for the doctor and fanny was charged to repeat it or not just as she thought right under the circumstances lord harry was in paris he had been invited to go to the theatre with some friends and to return with them to supper if he was late in getting home he was anxious that my lady should not be made uneasy after having authorised mr vimpanys interference in the garden the husband evidently had his motives for avoiding another interview with the wife iris was left alone to think over that discovery fanny had received orders to prepare the bedroom for the doctors patient    chapter xlvi  man and wife  towards evening the dane was brought to the cottage  a feeling of pride which forbade any display of curiosity strengthened perhaps by an irresistible horror of vimpany kept iris in her room nothing but the sound of footsteps outside told her when the suffering man was taken to his bedchamber on the same floor she was afterwards informed by fanny that the doctor turned down the lamp in the corridor before the patient was helped to ascend the stairs as a means of preventing the mistress of the house from plainly seeing the strangers face and recognising the living likeness of her husband  the hours advancedthe bustle of domestic life sank into silenceeverybody but iris rested quietly in bed  through the wakeful night the sense of her situation oppressed her sinking spirits mysteries that vaguely threatened danger made their presence felt and took their dark way through her thoughts the cottage in which the first happy days of her marriage had been passed might ere long be the scene of some evil deed provoking the lifelong separation of her husband and herself were these the exaggerated fears of a woman in a state of hysterical suspicion it was enough for iris to remember that lord harry and mr vimpany had been alike incapable of telling her the truth the first had tried to deceive her the second had done his best to frighten her why if there was really nothing to be afraid ofwhy the hours of the early morning came and still she listened in vain for the sound of my lords footstep on the stairs still she failed to hear the cautious opening of his dressingroom door leaving her chair iris rested on the bed as time advanced exhaustion mastered her she slept  awakening at a late hour she rang for fanny mere the master had just returned he had missed the latest nighttrain to passy and rather than waste money on hiring a carriage at that hour he had accepted the offer of a bed at the house of his friends he was then below stairs hoping to see lady harry at breakfast  his wife joined him  not even at the time of the honeymoon had the irish lord been a more irresistibly agreeable man than he was on that memorable morning his apologies for having failed to return at the right time were little masterpieces of grace and gaiety the next best thing to having been present at the theatrical performance of the previous night was to hear his satirical summary of the story of the play contrasting delightfully with his critical approval of the fine art of the actors the time had been when iris would have resented such merciless trifling with serious interests as this in these earlier and better days she would have reminded him affectionately of her claim to be received into his confidenceshe would have tried all that tact and gentleness and patience could do to win his confession of the ascendency exercised over him by his vile friendand she would have used the utmost influence of her love and her resolution to disunite the fatal fellowship which was leading him to his ruin  but iris henley was lady harry now  she was sinkingas mrs vimpany had feared as mountjoy had foreseenlower and lower on the descent to her husbands level with a false appearance of interest in what he was saying she waited for her chance of matching him with his own weapons of audacious deceit he ignorantly offered her the opportunitysetting the same snare to catch his wife which she herself had it in contemplation to use for entrapping her husband into a confession of the truth  ah welli have said more than enough of my last nights amusement he confessed its your turn now my dear have you had a look at the poor fellow whom the doctor is going to cure he asked abruptly eager to discover whether she had noticed the likeness between oxbye and himself  her eyes rested on him attentively i have not yet seen the person you allude to she answered is mr vimpany hopeful of his recovery  he took out his case and busied himself in choosing a cigar in the course of his adventurous life he had gained some knowledge of the effect of his own impetuous temper on others and of difficulties which he had experienced when circumstances rendered it necessary to keep his face in a state of discipline  oh theres no reason for anxiety he said with an overacted interest in examining his cigar mr oxbye is in good hands  people do sometimes sink under an illness she quietly remarked  without making any reply he took out his matchbox his hand trembled a little he failed at the first attempt to strike a light  and doctors sometimes make mistakes iris went on  he was still silent at the second attempt he succeeded with the match and lit his cigar  suppose mr vimpany made a mistake she persisted in the case of this stranger it might lead to deplorable results  lord harry lost his temper and with it his colour  what the devil do you mean he cried  i might ask in my turn she said what have i done to provoke an outbreak of temper i only made a remark  at that critical moment fanny mere entered the room with a telegram in her hand  for you my lady  iris opened the telegram the message was signed by mrs vimpany and was expressed in these words you may feel it your duty to go to your father he is dangerously ill  lord harry saw a sudden change in his wifes face that roused his guilty suspicions is it anything about me he asked  iris handed the telegram to him in silence having looked at it he desired to hear what her wishes were  the telegram expresses my wishes she said have you any objection to my leaving you  none whatever he answered eagerly go by all means  if it had still been possible for her to hesitate that reply would have put an end to all further doubt she turned away to leave the room he followed her to the door  i hope you dont think there is any want of sympathy on my part he said you are quite right to go to your father that was all i meant he was agitated honestly agitated while he spoke iris saw it and felt it gratefully she was on the point of making a last appeal to his confidence when he opened the door for her dont let me detain you he said his voice faltered he suddenly turned aside before she could look at him  fanny was waiting in the hall eager to see the telegram she read it twice and reflected for a moment how often do things fit themselves to ones wishes in this convenient way she asked herself its lucky she privately decidedalmost too lucky let me pack up your things she continued addressing her mistress while i have some time to myself mr oxbye is asleep  as the day wore on the noble influences in the nature of iris failing fast yet still at rare intervals struggling to assert themselves inspired her with the resolution to make a last attempt to give her husband an opportunity of trusting her he was not in his room not in any other part of the house not in the garden the hours passedshe was left to eat her dinner in solitude for the second time he was avoiding her for the second time he distrusted the influence of his wife with a heavy heart she prepared for her departure by the nightmail  the duties of the new nurse kept her in the cottage filled with alarm for the faithful creature whom she was leavingto what fate who could sayiris kissed her at parting  fannys faint blue eyes filled with tears she dashed them away and held her mistress for an instant in her arms i know whom you are thinking of she whispered he is not here to bid you goodbye let me see what i can find in his room iris had already looked round the room in the vain hope of finding a letter fanny rushed up the stairs determined on a last searchand ran down again with a folded morsel of flimsy foreign notepaper in her hand my ugly eyes are quicker than yours she said the air must have come in at the window and blown it off the table iris eagerly read the letter  i dare not deny that you will be better away from us but only for a while forgive me dearest i cannot find the courage to say goodbye those few words spoke for himand no more  briefly on her side but not unkindly his wife answered him  you have spared me a bitter moment may i hope to find the man whom i have trusted and honoured when i come back goodbye  when were they to meet again and how    chapter xlvii  the patient and my lord  there now remained but one other person in lord harrys household whose presence on the scene was an obstacle to be removed  this person was the cook on condition of her immediate departure excused by alleged motives of economy she received a months wages from her master in advance of the sum due to her and a written character which did ample justice to her many good qualities the poor woman left her employment with the heartiest expressions of gratitude to the end of her days she declared the irish lord to be a nobleman by nature republican principles inherited from her excellent parents disinclined her to recognise him as a nobleman by birth  but another sweet and simple creature was still left to brighten the sinister gloom in the cottage  the good dane sorely tried the patience of fanny mere this countryman of hamlet as he liked to call himself was a living protest against the sentiments of inveterate contempt and hatred with which his nurse was accustomed to regard the men when pain spared him at intervals mr oxbye presented the bright blue eyes and the winning smile which suggested the resemblance to the irish lord his beardless face thin towards the lower extremities completed the likeness in some degree only the daring expression of lord harry in certain emergencies never appeared nursing him carefully on the severest principles of duty as distinguished from inclination fanny found herself in the presence of a male human being who in the painless intervals of his malady wrote little poems in her praise asked for a few flowers from the garden and made prettily arranged nosegays of them devoted to herself cried when she told him he was a fool and kissed her hand five minutes afterwards when she administered his medicine and gave him no pleasant sweet thing to take the disagreeable taste out of his mouth this gentle patient loved lord harry loved mr vimpany loved the furious fanny resist it as she might on her obstinate refusal to confide to him the story of her lifeafter he had himself set her the example at great lengthhe persisted in discovering for himself that this interesting woman was a victim of sorrows of the heart in another state of existence he was offensively certain that she would be living with him you are frightfully pale you will soon die i shall break a bloodvessel and follow you we shall sit side by side on clouds and sing together everlastingly to accompaniment of celestial harps oh what a treat like a child he screamed when he was in pain and like a child he laughed when the pain had gone away when she was angry enough with him to say if i had known what sort of man you were i would never have undertaken to nurse you he only answered my dear let us thank god together that you did not know there was no temper in him to be roused and worse still on buoyant days when his spirits were lively there was no persuading him that he might not live long enough to marry his nurse if he only put the question to her often enough what was to be done with such a man as this fanny believed that she despised her feeble patient at the same time the food that nourished him was prepared by her own handswhile the other inhabitants of the cottage were left in the absence of the cook to the tough mercies of a neighbouring restaurant first and foremost among the many good deeds by which the conduct of women claims the gratitude of the other sex is surely the manner in which they let an unfortunate man master them without an unworthy suspicion of that circumstance to trouble the charitable serenity of their minds  carefully on the lookout for any discoveries which might enlighten her fanny noticed with everincreasing interest the effect which the harmless dane seemed to produce on my lord and the doctor  every morning after breakfast lord harry presented himself in the bedroom every morning his courteous interest in his guest expressed itself mechanically in the same form of words  mr oxbye how do you find yourself today  sometimes the answer would be gracious lord i am suffering pain sometimes it was dear and admirable patron i feel as if i might get well again on either occasion lord harry listened without looking at mr oxbyesaid he was sorry to hear a bad account or glad to hear a good account without looking at mr oxbyemade a remark on the weather and took his leave without looking at mr oxbye nothing could be more plain than that his polite inquiries once a day were unwillingly made and that it was always a relief to him to get out of the room so strongly was fannys curiosity excited by this strange behaviour that she ventured one day to speak to her master  i am afraid my lord you are not hopeful of mr oxbyes recovering  mind your own business was the savage answer that she received  fanny never again took the liberty of speaking to him but she watched him more closely than ever he was perpetually restless now he wandered from one room to another and walked round and round the garden smoking incessantly now he went out riding or took the railway to paris and disappeared for the day on the rare occasions when he was in a state of repose he always appeared to have taken refuge in his wifes room fannys keyholeobservation discovered him thinking miserably seated in his wifes chair it seemed to be possible that he was fretting after lady harry but what did his conduct to mr oxbye mean what was the motive which made him persist without an attempt at concealment in keeping out of mr vimpanys way and treated in this rude manner how was it that his wicked friend seemed to be always amused never offended  as for the doctors behaviour to his patient it was in fannys estimation worthy of a savage  he appeared to feel no sort of interest in the man who had been sent to him from the hospital at his own request and whose malady it was supposed to be the height of his ambition to cure when mr oxbye described his symptoms mr vimpany hardly even made a pretence at listening with a frowning face he applied the stethoscope felt the pulse looked at the tongueand drew his own conclusions in sullen silence if the nurse had a favourable report to make he brutally turned his back on her if discouraging results of the medical treatment made their appearance at night and she felt it a duty to mention them he sneered as if he doubted whether she was speaking the truth mr oxbyes inexhaustible patience and amiability made endless allowances for his medical advisor it is my misfortune to keep my devoted doctor in a state of perpetual anxiety he used to say and we all know what a trial to the temper is the consequence of unrelieved suspense i believe in mr vimpany fanny was careful not to betray her own opinion by making any reply her doubts of the doctor had by this time become terrifying doubts even to herself whenever an opportunity favoured her she vigilantly watched him one of his ways of finding amusement in his leisure hours was in the use of a photographic apparatus he took little pictures of the rooms in the cottage which were followed by views in the garden those having come to an end he completed the mystification of the nurse by producing a portrait of the dane while he lay asleep one day after he had been improving in health for some little time past fanny asked leave to look at the likeness when it had been printed from the negative in the garden he first examined it himselfand then deliberately tore it up and let the fragments fly away in the wind i am not satisfied with it was all the explanation he offered one of the garden chairs happened to be near him he sat down and looked like a man in a state of torment under his own angry thoughts  if the patients health had altered for the worse and if the tendency to relapse had proved to be noticeable after medicine had been administered fannys first suspicions might have taken a very serious turn but the change in oxbyesleeping in purer air and sustained by better food than he could obtain at the hospitalpointed more and more visibly to a decided gain of vital strength his hollow checks were filling out and colour was beginning to appear again on the pallor of his skin strange as the conduct of lord harry and mr vimpany might be there was no possibility thus far of connecting it with the position occupied by the danish guest nobody who had seen his face when he was first brought to the cottage could have looked at him again after the lapse of a fortnight and have failed to discover the signs which promise recovery of health    chapter xlviii  the mistress and the maid  in the correspondence secretly carried on between the mistress in london and the maid at passy it was fanny meres turn to write next she decided on delaying her reply until she had once more given careful consideration to the first letter received from lady harry announcing her arrival in england and a strange discovery that had attended it  before leaving paris iris had telegraphed instructions to mrs vimpany to meet her at the terminus in london her first inquiries were for her father the answer given with an appearance of confusion and even of shame was that there was no need to feel anxiety on the subject of mr henleys illness relieved on hearing this good news iris naturally expressed some surprise at her fathers rapid recovery she asked if the doctors had misunderstood his malady when they believed him to be in danger to this question mrs vimpany had replied by making an unexpected confession  she owned that mr henleys illness had been at no time of any serious importance a paragraph in a newspaper had informed her that he was suffering from nothing worse than an attack of gout it was a wicked act to have exaggerated this report and to have alarmed lady harry on the subject of her fathers health mrs vimpany had but one excuse to offer fannys letter had filled her with such unendurable doubts and forebodings that she had taken the one way of inducing lady harry to secure her own safety by at once leaving passythe way by a false alarm deceit so sincerely repented so resolutely resisted had tried its power of temptation again and had prevailed  when i thought of you at the mercy of my vile husband mrs vimpany said with your husband but too surely gained as an accomplice my good resolutions failed me is it only in books that a true repentance never stumbles again or am i the one fallible mortal creature in the world i am ashamed of myself but oh lady harry i was so frightened for you try to forgive me i am so fond of you and so glad to see you here in safety dont go back for gods sake dont go back  iris had no intention of returning while the doctor and his patient were still at passy and she found in mrs vimpanys compassion good reason to forgive an offence committed through devotion to herself and atoned for by sincere regret  fanny looked carefully over the next page of the letter which described lady harrys first interview with mr mountjoy since his illness the expressions of happiness on renewing her relations with her old and dear friend confirmed the maid in her first impression that there was no fear of a premature return to passy with the wish to see lord harry again as the motive she looked over the later letters nextand still the good influence of mr mountjoy seemed to be in time ascendant there was anxiety felt for fannys safety and curiosity expressed to hear what discoveries she might have made but the only allusions to my lord contained ordinary inquiries relating to the state of his health and on one occasion there was a wish expressed to know whether he was still on friendly terms with mr vimpany there seemed to be no fear of tempting her mistress to undervalue the danger of returning to the cottage if she mentioned the cheering improvement now visible in mr oxbye and yet fanny still hesitated to trust her first impressions even after they had been confirmed her own sad experience reminded her of the fatal influence which an unscrupulous man can exercise over the woman who loves him it was always possible that lady harry might not choose to confide the state of her feelings towards her husband to a person who after all only occupied the position of her maid the absence in her letters of any expressions of affectionate regret was no proof that she was not thinking of my lord so far as he was personally concerned the danes prospects of recovery would appear to justify the action of the doctor and his accomplice distrusting them both as resolutely as ever and determined to keep lady harry as long as possible at the safe distance of london fanny mere in writing her reply preserved a discreet silence on the subject of mr oxbyes health  at this point wilkie collins health prevented his finishing the novel    chapter xlix  the nurse is sent away  you have repented and changed your mind vimpany said lord harry  i repented the doctor repeated with a laugh you think me capable of that do you  the man is growing stronger and better every day you are going to make him recover after all i was afraidhe corrected himselfi thoughtthe word was the truerthat you were going to poison him  you thought i was goingwe were going my lordto commit a stupid and a useless crime and with our clever nurse present all the time watching with the suspicions of a cat and noting every change in the symptoms noi confess his case has puzzled me because i did not anticipate this favourable change wellit is all for the best fanny sees him grow stronger every daywhatever happens she can testify to the care with which the man has been treated so far she thought she would have us in her power and we have her  you are mighty clever vimpany but sometimes you are too clever for me and perhaps too clever for yourself  let me make myself clearerconscious of the nurses suspicions he leaned forward and whispered fanny must go now is the time the man is recovering the man must go the next patient will be your lordship himself now do you understand  partly  enough if i am to act it is sufficient for you to understand step by step our suspicious nurse is to go that is the next step leave me to act  lord harry walked away he left the thing to the doctor it hardly seemed to concern him a dying man a conspiracy a fraudyet the guilty knowledge of all this gave him small uneasiness he carried with him his wifes last note may i hope to find on my return the man whom i have trusted and honoured his conscience callous as regards the doctors scheme filled him with remorse wheneverwhich was fifty times a dayhe took this little rag of a note from his pocketbook and read it again yes she would always find the man on her returnthe man whom she had trusted and honouredthe latter clause he passed overit would be of course the same man whether she would still be able to trust and honour himthat question he did not put to himself after all the doctor was actingnot he himself  and he remembered hugh mountjoy iris would be with himthe man whose affection was only brought out in the stronger light by his respect his devotion and his delicacy she would be in his society she would understand the true meaning of this respect and delicacy she would appreciate the depth of his devotion she would contrast hugh the man she might have married with himself the man she did marry  and the house was wretched without her and he hated the sight of the doctordesperate and reckless  he resolved to write to iris he sat down and poured out his heart but not his conscience to her  as for our separation he said i and only i am to blame it is my own abominable conduct that has caused it give me your pardon dearest iris if i have made it impossible for you to live with me it is also impossible for me to live without you so am i punished the house is dull and lonely the hours crawl i know not how to kill the time my life is a misery and a burden because you are not with me yet i have no right to complain i ought to rejoice in thinking that you are happy in being relieved of my presence my dear i do not ask you to come at presenthe remembered indeed that her arrival at this juncture might be seriously awkwardi cannot ask you to come back yet but let me have a little hopelet me feel that in the sweetness of your nature you will believe in my repentance and let me look forward to a speedy reunion in the future  when he had written this letter which he would have done better to keep in his own hands for awhile he directed it in a feigned hand to lady harry norland care of hugh mountjoy at the latters london hotel mountjoy would not know iriss correspondent and would certainly forward the letter he calculatedwith the knowledge of her affectionate and impulsive naturethat iris would meet him halfway and would return whenever he should be able to call her back he did not calculate as will be seen on the step which she actually took  the letter despatched he came back to the cottage happierhe would get his wife again he looked in at the sickroom the patient was sitting up chatting pleasantly it was the best day he had known the doctor was sitting in a chair placed beside the bed and the nurse stood quiet selfcomposed but none the less watchful and suspicious  you are going on so well my man doctor vimpany was saying that we shall have you out and about again in a day or two not quite yet thoughnot quite yet he pulled out his stethoscope and made an examination with an immense show of professional interest my treatment has succeeded you seehe made a note or two in his pocketbookhas succeeded he repeated they will have to acknowledge that  gracious sir i am grateful i have given a great deal too much trouble  a medical case can never give too much troublethat is impossible remember oxbye it is science which watches at your bedside you are not oxbye you are a case it is not a man it is a piece of machinery that is out of order science watches she sees you through and through though you are made of solid flesh and bones and clothed to science you are transparent her business is not only to read your symptoms but to set the machinery right again  the dane overwhelmed could only renew his thanks  can he stand do you think nurse the doctor went on let us trynot to walk about much today but to get out of bed if only to prove to himself that he is so much better to make him understand that he is really nearly well come nurse let us give him a hand  in the most paternal manner possible the doctor assisted his patient weak after so long a confinement to his bed to get out of bed and supported him while he walked to the open window and looked out into the garden there he said that is enough not too much at first tomorrow he will have to get up by himself well fanny you agree at last i suppose that i have brought this poor man round at last eh  his look and his words showed what he meant you thought that some devilry was intended that was what the look meant you proposed to nurse this man in order to watch for and to discover this devilry very well what have you got to say  all that fanny had to say was submissively that the man was clearly much better and she added he had been steadily improving ever since he came to the cottage  that is what she said but she said it without the light of confidence in her eyesshe was still doubtful and suspicious whatever power the doctor had of seeing the condition of lungs and hidden machinery he certainly had the power of reading this womans thoughts he saw as clearly as if upon a printed page the bewilderment of her mind she knew that something was intendedsomething not for her to know that the man had been brought to the cottage to be made the subject of a scientific experiment she did not believe she had looked to see him die but he did not die he was mending fast in a little while he would be as well as ever he had been in his life what had the doctor done it for was it really possible that nothing was ever intended beyond a scientific experiment which had succeeded in the case of any other man the womans doubts would have been entirely removed in the case of dr vimpany these doubts remained there are some men of whom nothing good can be believed whether of motive or of action for if their acts seem good their motive must be bad many women know or fancy they know such a manone who seems to them wholly and hopelessly bad besides what was the meaning of the secret conversation and the widespread colloquies of the doctor and my lord and why at first was the doctor so careless about his patient  the time has come at last said the doctor that evening when the two men were alone for this woman to go the man is getting well rapidly he no longer wants a nurse there is no reason for keeping her if she has suspicions there is no longer the least foundation for them she has assisted at the healing of a man desperately sick by a skilful physician what more nothingpositively nothing  can she tell my wife so much and no more asked lord harry will there be no more  she can tell her ladyship no more because she will have no more to tell the doctor replied quietly she would like to learn more she is horribly disappointed that there is no more to tell but she shall hear no more she hates me but she hates your lordship more  why  because her mistress loves you still such a woman as this would like to absorb the whole affection of her mistress in herself you laugh she is a servant and a common person how can such a person conceive an affection so strong as to become a passion for one so superior but it is true it is perfectly well known and there have been many recorded instances of such a woman say a servant greatly inferior in station conceiving a desperate affection for her mistress accompanied by the fiercest jealousy fanny mere is jealousand of you she hates you she wants your wife to hate you she would like nothing better than to go back to her mistress with the proofs in her hand of such acts on your partsuch acts i say he chose his next words carefully as would keep her from you for ever  shes a devil i dare say said lord harry carelessly what do i care what does it matter to me whether a ladys maid more or less hates me or loves me  there spoke the aristocrat my lord remember that a ladys maid is a woman you have been brought up to believe perhaps that people in service are not men and women that is a mistakea great mistake fanny mere is a womanthat is to say an inferior form of man and there is no man in the world so low or so base as not to be able to do mischief the power of mischief is given to every one of us it is the true the only equality of manwe can all destroy what a shot in the dark the striking of a lucifer match the false accusation the false witness the defamation of characterupon my word it is far more dangerous to be hated by a woman than by a man and this excellent and faithful fanny devoted to her mistress hates you my lord even morehe paused and laughedeven more than the charming mrs vimpany hates her husband never mind tomorrow we see the last of fanny mere she goes she leaves her patient rapidly recovering that is the fact that she carries awaynot the fact she hoped and expected to carry away she goes tomorrow and she will never come back again  the next morning the doctor paid a visit to his patient rather earlier than usual he found the man going on admirably fresh in colour lively and cheerful chatting pleasantly with his nurse  so said dr vimpany after the usual examination and questions this is better than i expected you are now able to get up you can do so byandby after breakfast you can dress yourself you want no more help nurse he turned to fanny i think that we have done with you i am satisfied with the careful watch you have kept over my patient if ever you think of becoming a nurse by profession rely on my recommendation the experiment he added thoughtfully has fully succeeded i cannot deny that it has been owing partly to the intelligence and patience with which you have carried out my instructions but i think that your services may now be relinquished  when am i to go sir she asked impassively  in any other case i should have said stay a little longer if you please use your own convenience in your case i must say go to your mistress her ladyship was reluctant to leave you behind she will be glad to have you back again how long will you take to get ready  i could be ready in ten minutes if it were necessary  that is not necessary you can take the night mail via dieppe and newhaven it leaves paris at 950 give yourself an hour to get from station to station any time therefore this evening before seven oclock will do perfectly well you will ask his lordship for any letters or messages he may have  yes sir fanny replied with your permission sir i will go at once so as to get a whole day in paris  as you please as you please said the doctor wondering why she wanted a day in paris but it could have nothing to do with his sick man he left the room promising to see the dane again in an hour or two and took up a position at the garden gate through which the nurse must pass in about half an hour she walked down the path carrying her box the doctor opened the gate for her  goodbye fanny he said again many thanks for your care and your watchfulnessespecially the latter i am very glad he said with what he meant for the sweetest smile but it looked like a grin that it has been rewarded in such a way as you hardly perhaps expected  thank you sir said the girl the man is nearly well now and can do without me very well indeed  the box is too heavy for you fanny nay i insist upon it i shall carry it to the station for you  it was not far to the station and the box was not too heavy but fanny yielded it he wants to see me safe out of the station she thought  i will see her safe out of the place he thought  ten minutes later the doors of the salle dattente were thrown open the train rolled in and fanny was carried away  the doctor returned thoughtfully to the house the time was come for the execution of his project everybody was out of the way  she is gone he said when lord harry returned for breakfast at eleven i saw her safely out of the station  gone his confederate echoed and i am alone in the house with you andand  the sick manhenceforth yourself my lord yourself    chapter l  in the alcove  the doctor was wrong fanny mere did return though he did not discover the fact  she went away in a state of mind which is dangerous when it possesses a woman of determination the feminine mind loves to understand motives and intentions it hates to be puzzled fanny was puzzled fanny could not understand what had been intended and what was now meant for first a man apparently dying had been brought into the housewhy then the man began slowly to recover and the doctor whose attentions had always been of the most slender character grew more morose every day then he suddenly on the very day when he sent her away became cheerful congratulated the patient on his prospect of recovery and assisted in getting him out of bed for a change the cook having been sent away there was now no one in the house but the dane the doctor and lord harry  man hunts wild creatures woman hunts man fanny was impelled by the hunting instinct she was sent out of the house to prevent her hunting she began to consider next how without discovery she could return and carry on the hunt  everything conspired to drive her back the mystery of the thing the desire to baffle or at least to discover a dark design the wish to be of service to her mistress and the hope of finding out something which would keep iris from going back to her husband fanny was unable to comprehend the depth of her mistresss affection for lord harry but that she was foolishly weakly in love with him and that she would certainly return to him unless plain proofs of real villainy were preparedso much fanny understood very well when the omnibus set her down she found a quiet hotel near the terminus for dieppe she spent the day walking aboutto see the shops and streets she would have explained to consider the situation she should have explained she bought a new dress a new hat and a thick veil so as to be disguised at a distance as for escaping the doctors acuteness by any disguise should he meet her face to face that was impossible but her mind was made upshe would run any risk meet any danger in order to discover the meaning of all this  next morning she returned by an omnibus service which would allow her to reach the cottage at about a quarterpast eleven she chose this time for two reasons first because breakfast was sent in from the restaurant at eleven and the two gentlemen would certainly be in the salle a manger over that meal and next because the doctor always visited his patient after breakfast she could therefore hope to get in unseen which was the first thing  the spare bedroomthat assigned to the patientwas on the groundfloor next to the diningroom it communicated with the garden by french windows and by a small flight of steps  fanny walked cautiously along the road past the gardengate a rapid glance assured her that no one was there she hastily opened the gate and slipped in she knew that the windows of the sickroom were closed on the inner side and the blinds were still down the patient therefore had not yet been disturbed or visited the windows of the diningroom were on the other side of the house the woman therefore slipped round to the back where she found as she expected the door wide open in the hall she heard the voices of the doctor and lord harry and the clicking of knives and forks they were at breakfast  one thing morewhat should she say to oxbye what excuse should she make for coming back how should she persuade him to keep silence about her presence his passion suggested a plan and a reason she had come back she would tell him for love of him to watch over him unseen by the doctor to go away with him when he was strong enough to travel he was a simple and a candid soul and he would fall into such a little innocent conspiracy meantime it would be quite easy for her to remain in the house perfectly undisturbed and unknown to either of the gentlemen  she opened the door and looked in  so far no reason would be wanted the patient was sleeping peacefully but not in the bed he was lying partly dressed and covered with a blanket on the sofa with the restlessness of convalescence he had changed his couch in the morning after a wakeful night and was now sleeping far into the morning  the bed as is common in french houses stood in an alcove a heavy curtain hung over a rod also in the french manner part of this curtain lay over the head of the bed  the woman perceived the possibility of using the curtain as a means of concealment there was a space of a foot between the bed and the wall she placed herself therefore behind the bed in this space at the head where the curtain entirely concealed her nothing was more unlikely than that the doctor should look behind the bed in that corner then with her scissors she pierced a hole in the curtain large enough for her to see perfectly without the least danger of being seen and she waited to see what would happen  she waited for half an hour during which the sleeping man slept on without movement and the voices of the two men in the salle a manger rose and fell in conversation presently there was silence broken only by an occasional remark they have lit their cigars fanny murmured they will take their coffee and in a few minutes they will be here  when they came in a few minutes later they had their cigars and lord harrys face was slightly flushed perhaps with the wine he had taken at breakfastperhaps with the glass of brandy after his coffee  the doctor threw himself into a chair and crossed his legs looking thoughtfully at his patient lord harry stood over him  every day he said the man gets better  he has got better every day so far said the doctor  every day his face gets fatter and he grows less like me  it is true said the doctor  thenwhat the devil are we to do  wait a little longer said the doctor  the woman in her hidingplace hardly dared to breathe  what asked lord harry you mean that the man after all  wait a little longer the doctor repeated quietly  tell melord harry bent over the sick man eagerlyyou think  look here the doctor said which of us two has had a medical educationyou or i  you of course  yes i of course then i tell you as a medical man that appearances are sometimes deceptive this man for instancehe looks better he thinks he is recovering he feels stronger you observe that he is fatter in the face his nurse fanny mere went away with the knowledge that he was much better and the conviction that he was about to leave the house as much recovered as such a patient with such a disorder can expect  well  well my lord allow me to confide in you medical men mostly keep their knowledge in such matters to themselves we know and recognise symptoms which to you are invisible by these symptomsby those symptoms he repeated slowly and looking hard at the other man i know that this manno longer oxbye my patient butanotheris in a highly dangerous condition i have noted the symptoms in my bookhe tapped his pocketfor future use  and whenwhen lord harry was frightfully pale his lips moved but he could not finish the sentence the thing he had agreed to was terribly near and it looked uglier than he had expected  oh when the doctor replied carelessly perhaps todayperhaps in a week here you see science is sometimes baffled i cannot say  lord harry breathed deeply if the man is in so serious a condition he said is it safe or prudent for us to be alone in the house without a servant and without a nurse  i was not born yesterday my lord i assure you said the doctor in his jocular way they have found me a nurse she will come today my patients life is humanly speakinglord harry shudderedperfectly safe until her arrival  wellbut she is a stranger she must know whom she is nursing  certainly she will be toldi have already told herthat she is going to nurse lord harry norland a young irish gentleman she is a stranger that is the most valuable quality she possesses she is a complete stranger as for you what are you anything you please an english gentleman staying with me under the melancholy circumstances of his lordships illness what more natural the english doctor is staying with his patient and the english friend is staying with the doctor when the insurance officer makes inquiries as he is very likely to do the nurse will be invaluable for the evidence she will give  he rose pulled up the blinds noiselessly and opened the windows neither the fresh air nor the light awoke the sleeping man  vimpany looked at his watch time for the medicine he said wake him up while i get it ready  would you notat leastsuffer him to have his sleep out asked lord harry again turning pale  wake him up shake him by the shoulder do as i tell you said the doctor roughly he will go to sleep again it is one of the finer qualities of my medicine that it sends people to sleep it is a most soothing medicine it causes a deepa profound sleep wake him up i say he went to the cupboard in which the medicines were kept lord harry with some difficulty roused the sick man who awoke dull and heavy asking why he was disturbed  time for your medicine my good fellow said the doctor take it and you shall not be disturbed againi promise you that  the door of the cupboard prevented the spy from seeing what the doctor was doing but he took longer than usual in filling the glass lord harry seemed to observe this for he left the dane and looked over the doctors shoulder what are you doing he asked in a whisper  better not inquire my lord said the doctor what do you know about the mysteries of medicine  why must i not inquire  vimpany turned closing the cupboard behind him in his hand was a glass full of the stuff he was about to administer  if you look in the glass he said you will understand why  lord harry obeyed he saw a face ghastly in pallor he shrank back and fell into a chair saying no more  now my good friend said the doctor drink this and youll be betterever so much better ever so much better whythat is brave he looked at him strangely how do you like the medicine  oxbye shook his head as a man who has taken something nauseous i dont like it at all he said it doesnt taste like the other physic  no i have been changing itimproving it  the dane shook his head again theres a pain in my throat he said it stingsit burns  patiencepatience it will pass away directly and you will lie down again and fall asleep comfortably  oxbye sank back upon the sofa his eyes closed then he opened them again looking about him strangely as one who is suffering some new experience again he shook his head again he closed his eyes and he opened them no more he was asleep  the doctor stood at his head watching gravely lord harry in his chair leaned forward also watching but with white face and trembling hands  as they watched the mans head rolled a little to the side turning his face more towards the room then a curious and terrifying thing happened his mouth began slowly to fall open  is heis heis he fainting lord harry whispered  no he is asleep did you never see a man sleep with his mouth wide open  they were silent for a space  the doctor broke the silence  theres a good light this morning he said carelessly i think i will try a photograph stop let me tie up his mouth with a handkerchiefso the patient was not disturbed by the operation though the doctor tied up the handkerchief with vigour enough to awaken a sound sleeper nowwell see if he looks like a postmortem portrait  he went into the next room and returned with his camera in a few minutes he had taken the picture and was holding the glass negative against the dark sleeve of his coat so as to make it visible we shall see how it looks he said when it is printed at present i dont think it is good enough as an imitation of you to be sent to the insurance offices nobody i am afraid who knew you would ever take this for a postmortem portrait of lord harry well we shall see perhaps byandbytomorrowwe may be able to take a better photograph eh lord harry followed his movements watching him closely but said nothing his face remained pale and his fingers still trembled there was now no doubt at all in his mind not only as to vimpanys intentions but as to the crime itself he dared not speak or move  a ring at the door pealed through the house lord harry started in his chair with a cry of terror  that said the doctor quietly is the nursethe new nursethe stranger he took off the handkerchief from oxbyes face looked about the room as if careful that everything should be in its right place and went out to admit the woman lord harry sprang to his feet and passed his hand over the sick mans face  is it done he whispered can the man be poisoned is he already deadalready before my eyes  he laid his finger on the sick mans pulse but the doctors step and voice stopped him then the nurse came in following vimpany she was an elderly quietlooking french woman  lord harry remained standing at the side of the sofa hoping to see the man revive  now said vimpany cheerfully here is your patient nurse he is asleep now let him have his sleep outhe has taken his medicine and will want nothing more yet awhile if you want anything let me know we shall be in the next room or in the gardensomewhere about the house come my friend he drew away lord harry gently by the arm and they left the room  behind the curtain fanny mere began to wonder how she was to get off unseen  the nurse left alone looked at her patient who lay with his head turned partly round his eyes closed his mouth open a strange sleep she murmured but the doctor knows i suppose he is to have his sleep out  a strange sleep indeed thought the watcher she was tempted at this moment to disclose herself and to reveal what she had seen but the thought of lord harrys complicity stopped her with what face could she return to her mistress and tell her that she herself was the means of her husband being charged with murder she stayed herself therefore and waited  chance helped her at last to escape  the nurse took off her bonnet and shawl and began to look about the room she stepped to the bed and examined the sheets and pillowcase as a good french housewife should would she throw back the curtain if sowhat would happen next then it would become necessary to take the new nurse into confidence otherwisefanny did not put the remainder of this sentence into words it remained a terror it meant that if vimpany found out where she had been and what she had seen and heard there would be two instead of one cast into a deep slumber  the nurse turned from the bed however attracted by the halfopen door of the cupboard here were the medicine bottles she took them out one by one looked at them with professional curiosity pulled out the corks smelt the contents replaced the bottles then she went to the window which stood open she stepped out upon the stone steps which led into the garden looking about her to breathe the soft air of noon among the flowers  she came back and it again seemed as if she would examine the bed but her attention was attracted by a small bookcase she began to pull down the books one after the other and to turn them over as a halfeducated person does in the hope of finding something amusing she found a book with pictures then she sat down in the armchair beside the sofa and began to turn over the leaves slowly how long was this going to last  it lasted about half an hour the nurse laid down the volume with a yawn stretched herself yawned again crossed her hands and closed her eyes she was going to sleep if she would only fall so fast asleep that the woman behind the curtain could creep away  but sometimes at the sleepiest moment sleep is driven away by an accident the accident in this case was that the nurse before finally dropping off remembered that she was nursing a sick man and sat up to look at him before she allowed herself to drop off  stung with sudden inspiration she sprang to her feet and bent over the man does he breathe she asked she bent lower his pulse does it beat she caught his wrist  doctor she shrieked running into the garden doctor comecome quick he is dead  fanny mere stepped from her hidingplace and ran out of the back door and by the garden gate into the road  she had escaped she had seen the crime committed she knew now at least what was intended and why she was sent away the motive for the crime she could not guess    chapter li  what next  what should she do with the terrible secret  she ought to inform the police but there were two objections first the nurse may have been mistaken in supposing her patient to be dead she herself had no choice but to escape as she did next the dreadful thought occurred to her that she herself until the previous day had been the mans nursehis only nurse day and night what was to prevent the doctor from fixing the guilt of poisoning upon herself nay it would be his most obvious line of action the man was left alone all the morning the day before he had shown every sign of returning strength she would have to confess that she was in hiding how long had she been there why was she in hiding was it not after she had poisoned the man and when she heard the doctors footstep naturally ignorant of poisons and their symptoms it seemed to her as if these facts so put together would be conclusive against her therefore she determined to keep quiet in paris that day and to cross over by the night boat from dieppe in the evening she would at first disclose everything to mrs vimpany and to mountjoy as to what she would tell her mistress she would be guided by the advice of the others  she got to london in safety and drove straight to mr mountjoys hotel proposing first to communicate the whole business to him but she found in his sittingroom mrs vimpany herself  we must not awake him she said whatever news you bring his perfect recovery depends entirely on rest and quiet thereshe pointed to the chimneypieceis a letter in my ladys handwriting i am afraid i know only too well what it tells him  what does it tell  this very morning mrs vimpany went on i called at her lodging she has gone away  gone away my lady gone away where is she gone  where do you think she is most likely to have gone  notohnot to her husband not to himoh this is more terriblefar more terriblethan you can imagine  you will tell me why it is now so much more terrible meantime i find that the cabman was told to drive to victoria that is all i know i have no doubt however but that she has gone back to her husband she has been in a disturbed despondent condition ever since she arrived in london mr mountjoy has been as kind as usual but he has not been able to chase away her sadness whether she was fretting after her husband or whetherbut this i hardly thinkshe was comparing the man she had lost with the man she had takenbut i do not know all i do know is that she has been uneasy ever since she came from france and what i believe is that she has been reproaching herself with leaving her husband without good cause  good cause echoed fanny oh good gracious if she only knew theres cause enough to leave a hundred husbands  nothing seemed to rouse her mrs vimpany continued without regarding the interruption i went with her to the farm to see her former maid rhoda the girls health is reestablished she is engaged to marry the farmers brother lady harry was kind and said the most pleasant things she even pulled off one of her prettiest rings and gave it to the girl but i could see that it was an effort for her to appear interestedher thoughts were with her husband all the time i was sure it would end in this way and i am not in the least surprised but what will mr mountjoy say when he opens the letter  back to her husband fanny repeated oh what shall we do  tell me what you mean what has happened  i must tell you i thought i would tell mr mountjoy first but i must tell you although she stopped  although it concerns my husband never mind that considerationgo on fanny told the story from the beginning  when she had finished mrs vimpany looked towards the bedroom door thank god she said that you told this story to me instead of to mr mountjoy at all events it gives me time to warn you not to tell him what you have told me we can do nothing meantime there is one thing you must dogo away do not let mr mountjoy find you here he must not learn your story if he hears what has happened and reads her letter nothing will keep him from following her to passy he will see that there is every prospect of her being entangled in this vile conspiracy and he will run any risk in the useless attempt to save her he is too weak to bear the journeyfar too weak for the violent emotions that will follow and oh how much too weak to cope with my husbandas strong and as crafty as he is unprincipled  then what in heavens name are we to do  anythinganythingrather than suffer mr mountjoy in his weak state to interfere between man and wife  yesyesbut such a man mrs vimpany he was present when the dane was poisoned he knew that the man was poisoned he sat in the chair his face white and he said nothing oh it was as much as i could do not to rush out and dash the glass from his hands lord harry said nothing  my dear do you not understand what you have got to do  fanny made no reply  considermy husbandlord harryneither of them knows that you were present you can return with the greatest safety and then whatever happens you will be at hand to protect my lady consider again as her maid you can be with her alwaysin her own room at night everywhere and at all times while mr mountjoy could only be with her now and then and at the price of not quarrelling with her husband  yes said fanny  and you are strong and mr mountjoy is weak and ill  you think that i should go back to passy  at once without the delay of an hour lady harry started last night do you start this evening she will thus have you with her twentyfour hours after her arrival  fanny rose  i will go she said it terrifies me even to think of going back to that awful cottage with that dreadful man yet i will go mrs vimpany i know that it will be of no use whatever is going to happen now will happen without any power of mine to advance or to prevent i am certain that my journey will prove useless but i will go yes i will go this evening  then with a final promise to write as soon as possibleas soon as there should be anything to communicatefanny went away  mrs vimpany alone listened from the bedroom came no sound at all mr mountjoy slept still when he should be strong enough it would be time to let him know what had been done but she sat thinkingthinkingeven when one has the worst husband in the world and very well knows his character it is disagreeable to hear such a story as fanny had told that wife this morning    chapter lii  the dead mans photograph  he is quite dead said the doctor with one finger on the mans pulse and another lifting his eyelid he is dead i did not look for so speedy an end it is not half an hour since i left him breathing peacefully did he show signs of consciousness  no sir i found him dead  this morning he was cheerful it is not unusual in these complaints i have observed it in many cases of my own experience on the last morning of life at the very moment when death is standing on the threshold with uplifted dart the patient is cheerful and even joyous he is more hopeful than he has felt for many months he thinksnay he is surethat he is recovering he says he shall be up and about before long he has not felt so strong since the beginning of his illness then death strikes him and he falls he made this remark in a most impressive manner  nothing remains he said but to certify the cause of death and to satisfy the proper forms and authorities i charge myself with this duty the unfortunate young man belonged to a highly distinguished family i will communicate with his friends and forward his papers one last office i can do for him for the sake of his family nurse i will take a last photograph of him as he lies upon his deathbed lord harry stood in the doorway listening with an aching and a fearful heart he dared not enter the chamber it was the chamber of death what was his own part in calling the destroying angel who is at the beck and summons of every maneven the meanest call him and he comes order him to strikeand he obeys but under penalties  the doctors prophecy then had come true but in what way and by what agency the man was dead what was his own share in the mans death he knew when the dane was brought into the house that he was brought there to die as the man did not die but began to recover fast he had seen in the doctors face that the man would have to die he had heard the doctor prophesy out of his medical knowledge that the man would surely die and then after the nurse had been sent away because her patient required her services no longer he had seen the doctor give the medicine which burned the patients throat what was that medicine not only had it burned his throat but it caused him to fall into a deep sleep in which his heart ceased to beat and his blood ceased to flow  he turned away and walked out of the cottage for an hour he walked along the road then he stopped and walked back ropes drew him he could no longer keep away he felt as if something must have happened possibly he would find the doctor arrested and the police waiting for himself to be charged as an accomplice or a principal  he found no such thing the doctor was in the salon with letters and official forms before him he looked up cheerfully  my english friend he said the unexpected end of this young irish gentleman is a very melancholy affair i have ascertained the name of the family solicitors and have written to them i have also written to his brother as the head of the house i find also by examination of his papers that his life is insuredthe amount is not stated but i have communicated the fact of the death the authoritiesthey are very properly careful in such mattershave received the necessary notices and forms tomorrow all legal forms having been gone through we bury the deceased  so soon  so soon in these eases of advanced pulmonary disease the sooner the better the french custom of speedy interment may be defended as more wholesome than our own on the other hand i admit that it has its weak points cremation is perhaps the best and only method of removing the dead which is open to no objections except one i mean of course the chance that the deceased may have met with his death by means of poison but such cases are rare and in most instances would be detected by the medical man in attendance before or at the time of death i think we need notmy dear friend you look ill are you upset by such a simple thing as the death of a sick man let me prescribe for you a glass of brandy neat so he went into the salle a manger and returned with his medicine take that now let us talk the doctor continued his conversation in a cheerfully scientific strain never alluding to the conspiracy or to the consequences which might follow he told hospital stories bearing on deaths sudden and unexpected some of them he treated in a jocular vein the dead man in the next room was a case he knew of many similar and equally interesting cases when one has arrived at looking upon a dead man as a case there is little fear of the ordinary human weakness which makes us tremble in the awful presence of death  presently steps were heard outside the doctor rose and left the roombut returned in a few minutes  the croquemorts have come he said they are with the nurse engaged upon their business it seems revolting to the outside world to them it is nothing but the daily routine of work bytheway i took a photograph of his lordship in the presence of the nurse unfortunatelybut look at it  it is the face of the dead manlord harry turned away i dont want to see it i cannot bear to see it you forgeti was actually present when  not when he died come dont be a fool what i was going to say was this the face is no longer in the least like you nobody who ever saw you once even would believe that this is your face the creaturehe has given us an unconscionable quantity of troublewas a little like you when he first came i was wrong in supposing that this likeness was permanent now he is dead he is not in the least like you i ought to have remembered that the resemblance would fade away and disappear in death come and look at him  no no  weakness death restores to every man his individuality no two men are like in death though they may be like in life well it comes to this we are going to bury lord harry norland tomorrow and we must have a photograph of him as he lay on his deathbed  well  well my friend go upstairs to your own room and i will follow with the camera   in a quarter of an hour he was holding the glass against his sleeve  admirable he said the cheek a little sunkenthat was the effect of the chalk and the adjustment of the shadowsthe eyes closed the face white the hands composed it is admirable who says that we cannot make the sun tell lies  as soon as he could get a print of the portrait he gave it to lord harry  there he said we shall get a better print tomorrow this is the first copy  he had mounted it on a frame of card and had written under it the name once borne by the dead man with the date of his death the picture seemed indeed that of a dead man lord harry shuddered  there he said everything else has been of no use to usthe presence of the sick manthe suspicions of the nursehis deatheven his deathhas been of no use to us we might have been spared the memorythe awful memoryof this death  you forget my english friend that a dead body was necessary for us we had to bury somebody why not the man oxbye    chapter liii  the wifes return  of course mrs vimpany was quite right iris had gone back to her husband she arrived in fact at the cottage in the evening just before darkin the falling day when some people are more than commonly sensitive to sights and sounds and when the eyes are more apt than at other times to be deceived by strange appearances iris walked into the garden finding no one there she opened the door with her own key and let herself in the house struck her as strangely empty and silent she opened the diningroom door no one was there like all french diningrooms it was used for no other purpose than for eating and furnished with little more than the barest necessaries she closed the door and opened that of the salon that also was empty she called her husband there was no answer she called the name of the cook there was no answer it was fortunate that she did not open the door of the spare room for there lay the body of the dead man she went upstairs to her husbands room that too was empty but there was something lying on the tablea photograph she took it up her face became white suddenly and swiftly she shrieked aloud then drooped the picture and fell fainting to the ground for the photograph was nothing less than that of her husband dead in his white graveclothes his hands composed his eyes closed his cheek waxen  the cry fell upon the ears of lord harry who was in the garden below he rushed into the house and lifted his wife upon the bed the photograph showed him plainly what had happened  she came to her senses again but seeing her husband alive before her and remembering what she had seen she shrieked again and fell into another swoon  what is to be done now asked the husband what shall i tell her how shall i make her understand what can i do for her  as for help there was none the nurse was gone on some errand the doctor was arranging for the funeral of oxbye under the name of lord harry norland the cottage was empty  such a fainting fit does not last for ever iris came round and sat up looking wildly around  what is it she cried what does it mean  it means my love that you have returned to your husband he laid an arm round her and kissed her again and again  you are my harrylivingmy own harry  your own harry my darling what else should i be  tell me then what does it meanthat picturethat horrid photograph  that means nothingnothinga freaka joke of the doctors what could it mean he took it up why my dear i am livingliving and well what should this mean but a joke  he laid it on the table again face downwards but her eyes showed that she was not satisfied men do not make jokes on death it is a sorry jest indeed to dress up a man in graveclothes and make a photograph of him as of one dead  but youyou my iris you are heretell me how and whyand when and everything never mind that stupid picture tell me  i got your letter harry she replied  my letter he repeated oh my dear you got my letter and you saw that your husband loved you still  i could not keep away from you harry whatever had happened i stayed as long as i could i thought about you day and night and at last iii came back are you angry with me harry  angry good god my dearest angry he kissed her passionatelynot the less passionately that she had returned at a time so terrible what was he to say to her how was he to tell her while he showered kisses on her he was asking himself these questions when she found outwhen he should confess to her the whole truthshe would leave him again yet he did not understand the nature of the woman who loves he held her in his arms his kisses pleaded for him they mastered hershe was ready to believe to accept to surrender even her truth and honesty and she was ready though she knew it not to become the accomplice of a crime rather than leave her husband again she would do everything  yet lord harry felt there was one reservation he might confess everything except the murder of the dane no word of confession had passed the doctors lips yet he knew too well that the man had been murdered and so far as the man had been chosen for his resemblance to himself that was perfectly useless because the resemblance though striking at the first had been gradually disappearing as the man oxbye grew better and was now as we have seen wholly lost after death  i have a great deala great dealto tell you dear said the husband holding both her hands tenderly you will have to be very patient with me you must make up your mind to be shocked at first though i shall be able to convince you that there was really nothing else to be donenothing else at all  oh go on harry tell me all hide nothing  i will tell you all he replied  first where is that poor man whom the doctor brought here and fanny nursed and where is fanny  the poor man he replied carelessly made so rapid a recovery that he has got on his legs and gone awayi believe to report himself to the hospital whence he came it is a great triumph for the doctor whose new treatment is now proved to be successful he will make a grand flourish of trumpets about it i dare say if all he claims for it is true he has taken a great step in the treatment of lung diseases  iris had no disease of the lungs and consequently cared very little for the scientific aspect of the question  where is my maid then  fanny she went awaylet me see today is fridayon wednesday morning it was no use keeping her here the man was well and she was anxious to get back to you so she started on wednesday morning proposing to take the night boat from dieppe she must have stopped somewhere on the way  i suppose she will go to see mrs vimpany i will send her a line there  certainly that will be sure to find her  well harry is there anything else to tell me  a great deal he repeated that photograph iris which frightened you so much has been very carefully taken by vimpany for a certain reason  what reason  there are occasions he replied when the very best thing that can happen to a man is the belief that he is dead such a juncture of affairs has happened to myselfand to youat this moment it is convenienteven necessaryfor me that the world should believe me dead in point of fact i must be dead henceforth not for anything that i have done or that i am afraid ofdont think that no it is for the simple reason that i have no longer any money or any resources whatever that is why i must be dead had you not returned in this unexpected manner my dear you would have heard of my death from the doctor and he would have left it to chance to find a convenient opportunity of letting you know the truth i am however deeply grieved that i was so careless as to leave that photograph upon the table  i do not understand she said you pretend to be dead  yes i must have money i have some lefta very little i must have money and in order to get it i must be dead  how will that help  why my dear i am insured and my insurances will be paid after my death but not before  oh must you get moneyeven by a she hesitated  call it a conspiracy my dear if you please as there is no other way whatever left i must get money that way  oh this is dreadful a conspiracy harry aafraud  if you please that is the name which lawyers give to it  but oh harryit is a crime it is a thing for which men are tried and found guilty and sentenced  certainly if they are found out meantime it is only the poor ignorant clumsy fool who gets found out in the city these things are done every day quite as a matter of course he added carelessly it is not usual for men to take their wives into confidence but in this case i must take you into confidence i have no choice as you will understand directly  tell me harry who first thought of this way  vimpany of course oh give him the credit where real cleverness is concerned vimpany suggested the thing he found me wellnigh as desperately hard up as he is himself he suggested it at first i confess i did not like it i refused to listen to any more talk about it but you see when one meets destitution face to face one will do anythingeverything besides as i will show you this is not really a fraud it is only an anticipation of a few years however there was another reason  was it to find the money to meet the promissory note  my dear you may forgetyou may resolve never to throw the thing in my teeth but my love for you will never suffer me to forget that i have lost your little fortune in a doubtful speculation it is all gone never to be recovered again and this after i had sworn never to touch a farthing of it irishe started to his feet and walked about the room as one who is agitated by emotioniris i could face imprisonment for debt i could submit to pecuniary ruin for that matter the loss of money would not cause me the least trouble but i cannot endure to have ruined you  oh harry as if i mind everything that i have is yours when i gave you myself i gave all takeuselose it all as you think i should never feel reproach far less utter a word of blame dearest harry if that is all  no it is the knowledge that you will not even feel reproach that is my constant accuser at my death you will get all back again but i am not old i may live for many many years to come how can i wait for my own death when i can repair this wickedness by a single stroke  but by another wickednessand worse  nonot another crime remember that this money is mine it will come to my heirs some day as surely as tomorrows sun will rise sooner or later it will be mine i will make it sooner that is all the insurance company will lose nothing but the paltry interest for the remainder of my life my dear if it is disgraceful to do this i will endure disgrace it is easier to bear that than constant selfreproach which i feel when i think of you and the losses i have inflicted upon you  again he folded her in his arms he knelt before her he wept over her carried out of herself by this passion iris made no more resistance  is itis it she asked timidly too late to draw back  it is too late he replied thinking of the dead man below it is too late all is completed  my poor harry what shall we do how shall we live how shall we contrive never to be found out  she would not leave him then she accepted the situation he was amazed at the readiness with which she fell but he did not understand how she was ready to cling to him for better for worse through worse evils than this nor could he understand how things formerly impossible to her had been rendered possible by the subtle deterioration of the moral nature when a woman of lofty mind at the beginning loves and is united to a man of lower nature and coarser fibre than herself only a few months before iris would have swept aside these sophistrics with swift and resolute hand now she accepted them  you have fallen into the doctors hands dear she said pray heaven it brings us not into worse evils what can i say it is through love of your wifethrough love of your wifeoh husband she threw herself into his arms and forgave everything and accepted everything henceforth she would bethough this she knew notthe willing instrument of the two conspirators    chapter liv  another step  i have left this terrible thing about once too often already and lord harry took it from the table let me put it in a place of safety  he unlocked a drawer and opened it i will put it here he said whyas if suddenly recollecting somethinghere is my will i shall be leaving that about on the table next iris my dear i have left everything to you all will be yours he took out the document keep it for me iris it is yours you may as well have it now and then i know in your careful hands it will be quite safe not only is everything left to you but you are the sole executrix  iris took the will without a word she understood now what it meant if she was the sole executrix she would have to act if everything was left to her she would have to receive the money thus at a single step she became not only cognisant of the conspiracy but the chief agent and instrument to carry it out  this done her husband had only to tell her what had to be done at once in consequence of her premature arrival he had planned he told her not to send for hernot to let her know or suspect anything of the truth until the money had been paid to the widow by the insurance company as things had turned out it would be best for both of them to leave passy at oncethat very eveningbefore her arrival was known by anybody and to let vimpany carry out the rest of the business he was quite to be trustedhe would do everything that was wanted already he said the office will have received from the doctor a notification of my death yesterday evening he wrote to everybodyto my brotherconfound himand to the family solicitor every moment that i stay here increases the danger of my being seen and recognisedafter the office has been informed that i am dead  where are we to go  i have thought of that there is a little quiet town in belgium where no english people ever come at all we will go there then we will take another name we will be buried to the outer world and will live for the rest of our lives for ourselves alone do you agree  i will do harry whatever you think best  it will be for a time only when all is ready you will have to step to the frontthe will in your hand to be provedto receive what is due to you as the widow of lord harry norland you will go back to belgium after awhile so as to disarm suspicion to become once more the wife of william linville  iris sighed heavily then she caught her husbands eyes gathering with doubt and she smiled again  in everything harry she said i am your servant when shall we start  immediately i have only to write a letter to the doctor where is your bag is this all let me go first to see that no one is about have you got the will oh it is hereyesin the bag i will bring along the bag  he ran downstairs and came up quickly  the nurse has returned he said she is in the spare room  what nurse  the nurse who came after fanny left the man was better but the doctor thought it wisest to have a nurse to the end he explained hurriedly and she suspected nothing till afterwards come down quietlygo out by the backdoorshe will not see you so iris obeyed she went out of her own house like a thief or like her own maid fanny had she known she passed through the garden and out of the garden into the road there she waited for her husband  lord harry sat down and wrote a letter  dear doctor he said while you are arranging things outside an unexpected event has happened inside nothing happens but the unexpected my wife has come back it is the most unexpected event of any anything else might have happened most fortunately she has not seen the spare bedroom and has no idea of its contents  at this point reassure yourself  my wife has gone  she found on the table your first print of the negative the sight of this before she saw me threw her into some kind of swoon from which however she recovered  i have explained things to a certain point she understands that lord harry norland is deceased she does not understand that it was necessary to have a funeral there is no necessity to tell her of that i think she understands that she must not seem to have been here therefore she goes away immediately  the nurse has not seen her no one has seen her  she understands further that as the widow heir and executrix of lord harry she will have to prove his will and to receive the money due to him by the insurance company she will do this out of love for her husband i think that the persuasive powers of a certain person have never yet been estimated at their true value  considering the vital importance of getting her out of the place before she can learn anything of the spare bedroom and of getting me out of the place before any messenger can arrive from the london office i think you will agree with me that i am right in leaving passyand pariswith lady harry this very afternoon  you may write to william linville posterestante louvain belgium i am sure i can trust you to destroy this letter  louvain is a quiet outoftheway place where one can live quite separated from all old friends and very cheaply  considering the small amount of money that i have left i rely upon you to exercise the greatest economy i do not know how long it may be before just claims are paid upperhaps in two monthsperhaps in sixbut until things are settled there will be tightness  at the same time it will not be difficult as soon as lady harry goes to london to obtain some kind of advance from the family solicitor on the strength of the insurance due to her from her late husband  i am sorry dear doctor to leave you alone over the obsequies of this unfortunate gentleman you will also have i hear a good deal of correspondence with his family you may possibly have to see them in england all this you will do and do very well your bill for medical attendance you will do well to send in to the widow  one word more fanny mere the maid has gone to london but she has not seen lady harry as soon as she hears that her mistress has left london she will be back to passy she may come at any moment i think if i were you i would meet her at the garden gate and send her on it would be inconvenient if she were to arrive before the funeral  my dear doctor i rely on your sense your prudence and your capabilityyours very sincerely  your english friend   he read this letter very carefully nothing in it he thought the least dangerous and yet something suggested danger however he left it he was obliged to caution and warn the doctor and he was obliged to get his wife away as quietly as possible  this done he packed up his things and hurried off to the station and passy saw him no more  the next day the mortal remains of lord harry norland were lowered into the grave    chapter lv  the adventures of a faithful maid  it was about five oclock on saturday afternoon the funeral was over the unfortunate young irish gentleman was now lying in the cemetery of auteuil in a grave purchased in perpetuity his name age and rank were duly inscribed in the registers and the cause of his death was vouched for by the english physician who had attended him at the request of his family he was accompanied in going through the formalities by the respectable woman who had nursed the sick man during his last seizure everything was perfectly in order the physician was the only mourner at the funeral no one was curious about the little procession a funeral more or less excites no attention  the funeral completed the doctor gave orders for a single monument to be put in memory of lord harry norland thus prematurely cut off he then returned to the cottage paid and dismissed the nurse taking her address in case he should find an opportunity as he hoped to recommend her among his numerous and distinguished clientele and proceeded to occupy himself in setting everything in order before giving over the key to the landlord first of all he removed the medicine bottles from the cupboard with great care leaving nothing most of the bottles he threw outside into the dusthole one or two he placed in a fire which he made for the purpose in the kitchen they were shortly reduced to two or three lumps of molten glass these contained no doubt the mysteries and secrets of science then he went into every room and searched in every possible place for any letters or papers which might have been left about letters left about are always indiscreet and the consequences of an indiscretion may be farreaching and incalculable satisfied at last that the place was perfectly cleared he sat down in the salon and continued his business correspondence with the noble family and the solicitors thus engaged he heard footsteps outside footsteps on the gravel footsteps on the doorstop he got up not without the slightest show of nervousness and opened the door lord harry was right there stood the woman who had been his first nursethe woman who overheard and watchedthe woman who suspected the suspicion and the intention of watching were legible in her eyes still she had come back to renew her watch  in her hand she carried her box which she had lugged along from the place where the omnibus had deposited her she made as if she were stepping in but the big form of the doctor barred the way  oh he said carelessly it is you who told you to come back  is my mistress at home  no she is not he made no movement to let her pass  i will come in please and wait for her  he still stood in the way  what time will she return  have you heard from her  no  did she leave orders that you were to follow her  no none that i received i thought  servants should never think they should obey  i know my duty dr vimpany without learning it from you will you let me pass  he withdrew and she entered  come in by all means he said if you desire my society for a short time but you will not find your mistress here  not here where is she then  had you waited in london for a day or two you would i dare say have been informed as it is you have had your journey for nothing  has she not been here  she has not been here  dr vimpany said the woman driven to desperation i dont believe you i am certain she has been here what have you done with her  dont you believe me that is sad indeed but one cannot always help these wanderings you do not believe me melancholy truly  you may mock as much as you like where is she  where indeed  she left london to join his lordship where is he  i do not know he who would answer that question would be a wise man indeed  can i see him  certainly not he has gone away on a long journey by himself  then i shall wait for him here she added with decision in this house  by all means  she hesitated there was an easy look about the doctor which she did not like  i believe she said that my mistress is in the house she must be in the house what are you going to do with her i believe you have put her somewhere  indeed  you would do anything i will go to the police  if you please  oh doctor tell me where she is  you are a faithful servant it is good in these days to find a woman so zealous on account of her mistress come in good and faithful search the house all over come inwhat are you afraid of put down your box and go and look for your mistress fanny obeyed she ran into the house opened the doors of the salon and the diningroom one after the other no one was there she ran up the stairs and looked into her mistresss room nothing was there not even a ribbon or a hairpin to show the recent presence of a woman she looked into lord harrys room nothing was there if a woman leaves hairpins about a man leaves his toothbrush nothing at all was there then she threw open the armoire in each room nothing behind the doors she came downstairs slowly wondering what it all meant  may i look in the spare room she asked expecting to be roughly refused  by all meansby all means said the doctor blandly you know your way about if there is anything left belonging to your mistress or to you pray take it  she tried one more question  how is my patient how is mr oxbye  he is gone  gone where has he gone to gone  he went away yesterdayfriday he was a grateful creature i wish we had more such grateful creatures as well as more such faithful servants he said something about finding his way to london in order to thank you properly a good soul indeed  gone she repeated why on thursday morning i saw him she checked herself in time  it was on wednesday morning that you saw him and he was then recovering rapidly  but he was far too weak to travel  you may be quite certain that i should not have allowed him to go away unless he was strong enough  fanny made no reply she had seen with her own eyes the man lying still and white as if in death she had seen the new nurse rushing off crying that he was dead now she was told that he was quite well and that he had gone away but it was no time for thought  she was on the point of asking where the new nurse was but she remembered in time that it was best for her to know nothing and to awaken no suspicions she opened the door of the spare room and looked in yes the man was gonedead or aliveand there were no traces left of his presence the place was cleared up the cupboard stood with open doors empty the bed was made the curtain pushed back the sofa was in its place against the wall the window stood open nothing in the room at all to show that there had been an occupant only two days before she stared blankly the dead man was gone then had her senses altogether deceived her was he not dead but only sleeping was her horror only a thing of imagination behind her in the hall stood the doctor smiling cheerful  she remembered that her first business was to find her mistress she was not connected with the dane she closed the door and returned to the hall  well asked the doctor have you made any discoveries you see that the house is deserted you will perhaps learn before long why now what will you do will you go back to london  i must find her ladyship  the doctor smiled  had you come here in a different spirit he said i would have spared you all this trouble you come however with suspicion written on your face you have always been suspecting and watching it may be in a spirit of fidelity to your mistress but such a spirit is not pleasing to other people especially when there is not a single person who bears any resentment towards that mistress therefore i have allowed you to run over the empty house and to satisfy your suspicious soul lady harry is not hidden here as for lord harrybut you will hear in due time no doubt and now i dont mind telling you that i have her ladyships present address  oh what is it  she appears to have passed through paris on her way to switzerland two days ago and has sent here her address for the next fortnight she has now i suppose arrived there the place is berne the hotel  but how do i know that she wants you  of course she wants me  or of course you want her very good yours is the responsibility not mine her address is the hotel dangleterre shall i write it down for you there it is hotel dangleterre berne now you will not forget she will remain there for one fortnight only after that i cannot say whither she may go and as all her things have been sent away and as i am going away i am not likely to hear  oh i must go to her i must find her cried the woman earnestly if it is only to make sure that no evil is intended for her  that is your business for my own part i know of no one who can wish her ladyship any evil  is my lord with her  i dont know whether that is your business i have already told you that he is gone if you join your mistress in berne you will very soon find out if he is there as well something in his tone made fanny look up quickly but his face revealed nothing what shall you do then asked the doctor you must make up your mind quickly whether you will go back to england or whether you will go on to switzerland you cannot stay here because i am putting together the last things and i shall give the landlord the key of the house this evening all the bills are paid and i am going to leave the place  i do not understand there is the patient she murmured vaguely what does it mean i cannot understand  my good creature he replied roughly what the devil does it matter to me whether you understand or whether you do not understand her ladyship is as i have told you at berne if you please to follow her there do so it is your own affair not mine if you prefer to go back to london do so stillyour own affair is there anything else to say  nothing fanny took up her boxthis time the doctor did not offer to carry it for her  where are you going he asked what have you decided  i can get round by the chemin de fer de ceinture to the lyons station i shall take the first cheap train which will take me to berne  bon voyage said the doctor cheerfully and shut the door   it is a long journey from paris to berne even for those who can travel first class and expressthat is if sixteen hours can be called a long journey for those who have to jog along by third class stopping at all the little country stations it is a long and tedious journey indeed the longest journey ends at last the train rolled slowly into the station of berne and fanny descended with her box her wanderings were over for the present she would find her mistress and be at rest  she asked to be directed to the hotel dangleterre the swiss guardian of the peace with the cocked hat stared at her she repeated the question  hotel dangleterre he echoed there is no hotel dangleterre in berne  yes yes there is i am the maid of a lady who is staying at that hotel  no there is no hotel dangleterre he reported there is the hotel bernehof  no she took out the paper and showed it to himlady harry norland hotel dangleterre berne  there is the hotel de belle vue the hotel du faucon the hotel victoria the hotel schweizerhof there is the hotel schrodel the hotel schneider the pension simkin  fanny as yet had no other suspicion than that the doctor had accidentally written a wrong name her mistress was at berne she would be in one of the hotels berne is not a large place very good she would go round to the hotels and inquire she did so there are not in fact more than half a dozen hotels in berne where an english lady could possibly stay fanny went to every one of these no one had heard of any such lady they showed her the lists of their visitors she inquired at the postoffice no lady of that name had asked for letters she asked if there were any pensions and went round them alluselessly  no other conclusion was possible the doctor had deceived her wilfully to get her out of the way he sent her to berne he would have sent her to jericho if her purse had been long enough to pay the fare she was tricked  she counted her money there was exactly twentyeight shillings and tenpence in her purse  she went back to the cheapest and dirtiest of the pensions she had visited she stated her caseshe had missed milady her mistressshe must stay until she should receive orders to go on and moneywould they take her in until one or the other arrived certainly they would take her in at five francs a day payable every morning in advance  she made a little calculationshe had twentyeight and tenpence exactly thirtyfive francsenough for seven days if she wrote to mrs vimpany at once she could get an answer in five days  she accepted the offer paid her five shillings was shown into a room and was informed that the dinner was served at six oclock  very good here she could rest at any rate and think what was to be done and first she wrote two lettersone to mrs vimpany and one to mr mountjoy  in both of these letters she told exactly what she had found neither lord harry nor his wife at the cottage the place vacated and the doctor on the point of going away in both letters she told how she had been sent all the way into switzerland on a fools errand and now found herself planted there without the means of getting home in the letter to mrs vimpany she added the remarkable detail that the man whom she had seen on the thursday morning apparently dead whose actual poisoning she thought she had witnessed was reported on the saturday to have walked out of the cottage carrying his things if he had any and proposing to make his way to london in order to find out his old nurse make what you can out of that she said for my own part i understand nothing  in the letter which she wrote to mr mountjoy she added a petition that he would send her money to bring her home this she said her mistress she knew would willingly defray  she posted these letters on tuesday and waited for the answers  mrs vimpany wrote back by return post   my dear fanny she said i have read your letter with the greatest interest i am not only afraid that some villainy is afloat but i am perfectly sure of it one can only hope and pray that her ladyship may be kept out of its influence you will be pleased to hear that mr mountjoy is better as soon as he was sufficiently recovered to stand the shock of violent emotion i put lady harrys letter into his hands it was well that i had kept it from him for he fell into such a violence of grief and indignation that i thought he would have had a serious relapse can any woman he cried be justified in going back to an utterly unworthy husband until he has proved a complete change what if she had received a thousand letters of penitence penitence should be shown by acts not words she should have waited he wrote her a letter which he showed me is there he asked anything in the letter which could justly offend her i could find nothing he told her but i fear too late that she risks degradationperhaps worse if there is anything worseif she persists in returning to her unworthy husband if she refuses to be guided by his advice on the last occasion on which he would presume to offer any device he begged that she would not answer let her silence sayno that was the substance of his letter up to the present moment no answer has been received from lady harry nor has he received so much as an acknowledgment of the letter what can be understood by this silence clearly refusal  you must return by way of paris though it is longer than by basle and laon mr mountjoy i know will send you the money you want he has told me as much i have done with lady harry he said her movements no longer concern me though i can never want interest in what she does but since the girl is right to stick to her mistress i will send her the moneynot as a loan to be paid back by iris but as a gift from myself  therefore my dear fanny stop in paris for one night at least and learn what has been done if you can find out the nurse and ask her what really happened with the knowledge that you already possess it will be hard indeed if we cannot arrive at the truth there must be people who supplied things to the cottagethe restaurant the pharmacien the laundress see them allyou know them already and we will put the facts together as for finding her ladyship that will depend entirely upon herself i shall expect you back in about a week if anything happens here i shall be able to tell you when you arrive  yours affectionately  l vimpany   this letter exactly coincided with fannys own views the doctor was now gone she was pretty certain that he was not going to remain alone in the cottage and the suburb of passy though charming in many ways is not exactly the place for a man of dr vimpanys temperament she would stay a day or even two days or more if necessary at passy she would make those inquiries  the second letter which reached her the same day was from mr mountjoy he told her what he had told mrs vimpany he would give her the money because he recognised the spirit of fidelity which caused fanny to go first to paris and then to berne  but he could not pretend to any right to interference in the affairs of lord and lady harry norland he enclosed a mandat postal for a hundred and twentyfive francs which he hoped would be sufficient for her immediate wants  she started on her returnjourney on the same daynamely saturday on sunday evening she was in a pension at passy ready to make those inquiries the first person whom she sought out was the rentierthe landlord of the cottage he was a retired tradesmanone who had made his modest fortune in a charcuterie and had invested it in house property fanny told him that she had been ladysmaid to lady harry norland in the recent occupancy of the cottage and that she was anxious to know her present address  merci mon dieu que saisje what do i know about it he replied the wife of the english milord is so much attached to her husband that she leaves him in his long illness  his long illness  certainlymademoiselle is not perhaps acquainted with the circumstanceshis long illness and does not come even to see his dead body after he is dead there is a wife for youa wife of the english fashion  fanny gasped  after he is dead is lord harry dead when did he die  but assuredly mademoiselle has not heard the english milord died on thursday morning a week and more ago of consumption and was buried in the cemetery of auteuil last saturday mademoiselle appears astonished  en effet monsieur i am astonished  already the tombstone is erected to the memory of the unhappy young man who is said to belong to a most distinguished family of ireland mademoiselle can see it with her own eyes in the cemetery  one word more monsieur if monsieur would have the kindness to tell her who was the nurse of milord in his last seizure  but certainly all the world knows the widow la chaise it was the widow la chaise who was called in by the doctor ah there is a manwhat a man what a miracle of science what devotion to his friend what admirable sentiments truly the english are great in sentiments when their insular coldness allows them to speak this widow can be foundeasily found  he gave fanny in fact the nurses address armed with this and having got out of the landlord the cardinal fact of lord harrys alleged death the ladysmaid went in search of this respectable widow  she found her in her own apartments a respectable woman indeed perfectly ready to tell everything that she knew and evidently quite unsuspicious of anything wrong she was invited to take charge of a sick man on the morning of thursday she was told that he was a young irish lord dangerously ill of a pulmonary disorder the doctor in fact informed her that his life hung by a thread and might drop at any moment though on the other hand he had known such cases linger on for many months she arrived as she had been ordered at midday she was taken into the sickroom by the doctor who showed her the patient placidly sleeping on a sofa the bed had been slept in and was not yet made after explaining the medicines which she was to administer and the times when they were to be given and telling her something about his diet the doctor left her alone with the patient  he was still sleeping profoundly said the nurse  you are sure that he was sleeping and not dead asked fanny sharply  mademoiselle i have been a nurse for many years i know my duties the moment the doctor left me i verified his statements i proved that the patient was sleeping by feeling his pulse and observing his breath  fanny made no reply she could hardly remind this respectable person that after the doctor left her she employed herself first in examining the cupboards drawers armoire and other things that she then found a book with pictures in which she read for a quarter of an hour or so that she then grew sleepy and dropped the book  i then continued the widow made arrangements against his wakingthat is to say i drew back the curtains and turned over the sheet to air the bedo madame madame surely this was needlessshook up the pillows and occupied myself in the cares of a conscientious nurse until the time came to administer the first dose of medicine then i proceeded to awaken my patient figure to yourself he whom i had left tranquilly breathing with the regularity of a convalescent rather than a dying man was dead he was dead  you are sure he was dead  as if i had never seen a dead body before i called the doctor but it was for duty only for i knew that he was dead  and then  then the doctorwho must also have known that he was deadfelt his pulse and his heart and looked at his eyes and declared that he was dead  and then  what then if a man is dead he is dead you cannot restore him to life yet one thing the doctor did he brought a camera and took a photograph of the dead man for the sake of his friends  oh he took a photograph ofof lord harry norland what did he do that for  i tell you for the sake of his friends  fanny was more bewildered than ever why on earth should the doctor want a photograph of the dane oxbye to show the friends of lord harry could he have made a blunder as stupid as it was uncalled for no one could possibly mistake the dead face of that poor dane for the dead face of lord harry  she had got all the information she wantedall in fact that was of any use to her one thing remained she would see the grave  the cemetery of auteuil is not so large as that of perelachaise nor does it contain so many celebrated persons as the latterperhaps the greatest cemetery as regards its illustrious dead in the whole world it is the cemetery of the better class the tombs are not those of immortals but of respectables  among them fanny easily found following the directions given to her the tomb she was searching after  on it was written in english sacred to the memory of lord harry norland second son of the marquis of malven then followed the date and the age and nothing more  fanny sat down on a bench and contemplated this mendacious stone  the dane oxbye she said was growing better fast when i went away that was the reason why i was sent away the very next day the doctor thinking me far away poisoned him i saw him do it the nurse was told that he was asleep and being left alone presently discovered that he was dead she has been told that the sick man is a young irish gentleman he is buried under the name of lord harry that is the reason i found the doctor alone and my lady where is she    chapter lvi  fannys narrative  fanny returned to london partly the slenderness of her resources gave her no choice partly she had learned all there was to learn and would do no good by staying longer at passy  she arrived with thirty shillings left out of mr mountjoys timely gift she sought a cheap lodging and found a room among people who seemed respectable which she could have for fourandsixpence a week with board at a shilling a day this settled she hastened to mr mountjoys hotel brimful of her news for mrs vimpany  everyone knows the disappointment when the one person in the world whom you want at the moment to see and to talk with proves to be out then the news has to be suppressed the conclusions the suspicions the guesses have to be postponed the active brain falls back upon itself  this disappointmentalmost as great as that at bernewas experienced by fanny mere at the hotel  mr mountjoy was no longer there  the landlady of the hotel who knew fanny came out herself and told her what had happened  he was better she said but still weak they sent him down to scotland in mrs vimpanys care he was to travel by quick or slow stages just as he felt able and ive got the address for you here it is oh and mrs vimpany left a message will you she says when you write send the letter to her and not to him she says you know why  fanny returned to her lodging profoundly discouraged she was filled with this terrible secret that she had discovered the only man who could advise at this juncture was mr mountjoy and he was gone and she knew not what had become of her mistress what could she do the responsibility was more than she could bear  the conversation with the french nurse firmly established one thing in her mind the man who was buried in the cemetery of auteuil with the name of lord harry norland on a headstone the man who had lingered so long with pulmonary disease was the man whose death she had witnessed it was oxbye the dane of that there could be no doubt equally there was no doubt in her own mind that he had been poisoned by the doctorby mrs vimpanys husbandin the presence and to all appearance with the consent and full knowledge of lord harry himself then her mistress was in the power of these two menvillains who had now added murder to their other crimes as for herself she was alone almost friendless in a week or two she would be penniless if she told her tale what mischief might she not do if she was silent what mischief might not follow  she sat down to write to the only friend she had but her trouble froze her brain she had not been able to put the case plainly words failed her  she was not at any time fluent with her pen she now found herself really unable to convey any intelligible account of what had happened to state clearly all that she knew so that the conclusion should be obvious and patent to the reader would have been at all times difficult and was now impossible she could only confine herself to a simple vague statement i can only say that from all i have seen and heard i have reasons for believing that lord harry is not dead at all she felt that this was a feeble way of summing up but she was not at the moment equal to more when i write again after i have heard from you i will tell you more today i cannot i am too much weighed down i am afraid of saying too much besides i have no money and must look for work i am not anxious however about my own future because my lady will not forsake me i am sure of that it is my anxiety about her and the dreadful secrets i have learned which give me no rest  several days passed before the answer came and then it was an answer which gave her little help i have no good news for you she said mr mountjoy continues weak whatever your secret i cannot ask you to communicate it to him in his present condition he has been grieved and angry beyond all belief by lady harrys decision to rejoin her husband it is hard to understand that a man should be so true a friend and so constant a lover yet he has brought himself to declare that he has broken off all friendly relations with her he could no longer endure london it was associated with thoughts and memories of her in spite of his weak condition he insisted on coming down here to his scotch villa ill as he was he would brook no delay we came down by very easy stages stopping at peterborough york durham newcastle and berwickat some places for one night and others for more in spite of all my precautions when we arrived at the villa he was dangerously exhausted i sent for the local doctor who seems to know something at all events he is wise enough to understand that this is not a case for drugs complete rest and absence from all agitating thoughts must be aimed at above all he is not to see the newspapers that is fortunate because i suppose lord harrys death has been announced in them and the thought that his former mistress is a widow might excite him very dangerously you will now understand why i left that message at the hotel for you and why i have not shown him your letter i told him it is true that you had returned without finding your mistress speak no more to me of lady harry he replied irritably so i have said no more as for money i have a few pounds by me which are at your service you can repay me at some future time i have thought of one thingthat new continental paper started by lord harry wherever she may be lady harry is almost sure to see that put an advertisement in it addressed to her stating that you have not heard of her address but that you yourself will receive any letter sent to some postoffice which you can find i think that such an advertisement will draw a reply from her unless she desires to remain in seclusion  fanny thought the suggestion worth adopting after careful consideration she drew up an advertisement  fanny h to lh i have not been able to ascertain your address please write to me at the post office hunter street london wc  she paid for the insertion of this advertisement three times on alternate saturdays they told her that this would be a more likely way than to take three successive saturdays then encouraged by the feeling that something however little had been done she resolved to sit down to write out a narrative in which she would set down in order everything that had happenedexactly as it had happened her intense hatred and suspicion of dr vimpany aided her strange to say to keep to the strictest fidelity as regards the facts for it was not her desire to make up charges and accusations she wanted to find out the exact truth and so to set it down that anybody who read her statement would arrive at the same conclusion as she herself had done in the case of an eyewitness there are thousands of things which cannot be produced in evidence which yet are most important in directing and confirming suspicions the attitude the voice the look of a speaker the things which he conceals as well as the things which he revealsall these are evidence but these fanny was unable to set down therefore it behoved her to be strictly careful  first she stated how she became aware that there was some secret scheme under consideration between lord harry and the doctor next she set down the fact that they began to talk french to each other thinking that she could not understand them that they spoke of deceiving lady harry by some statement which had already deceived the authorities that the doctor undertook to get the lady out of the house that they engaged herself as nurse to a sick man that she suspected from the beginning that their design was to profit in some way by the death of this sick than who bore a slight resemblance to lord harry himself and so on following the story as closely as she could remember to the death of the dane and her own subsequent conversation with the nurse she was careful to put in the dates day after day when she had done all thisit took a good deal of timeshe bought a manuscript book and copied it all out this enabled her to remember two or three facts which had escaped her at the beginning then she made another copy this time without names of people or place the second copy she forwarded as a registered letter to mrs vimpany with a letter of which this was the conclusion considering therefore that on wednesday morning i left lord harry in perfect health considering that on the thursday morning i saw the man who had been ill so long actually diehow i have told you in the packet enclosed considering that the nurse was called in purposely to attend a patient who was stated to have long been illthere can be no doubt whatever that the body in the cemetery is that of the unfortunate dane oxbye and that somewhere or other lord harry is alive and well  what have they done it for first of all i suppose to get money if it were not for the purpose of getting money the doctor would have had nothing to do with the conspiracy which was his own invention that is very certain your idea was they would try to get money out of the insurance offices i suppose that is their design but lord harry may have many other secret reasons of his own for wishing to be thought dead they say his life has been full of wicked things and he may well wish to be considered dead and gone lots of wicked men would like above all things i should think to be considered dead and buried but the money matter is at the bottom of all i am convinced what are we to do  what could they do these two women had got hold of a terrible secret neither of them could move it was too big a thing one cannot expect a woman to bring her own husbandhowever wicked a husband he may beto the awful shame and horror of the gallows if murder should be provedor to a lifelong imprisonment if the conspiracy alone should be brought home to him therefore mrs vimpany could do nothing as for fanny the mere thought of the pain she would inflict upon her mistress were lord harry through her interference to be brought to justice and an infamous sentence kept her quiet  meantime the announcement of lord harrys death had been made those who knew the family history spoke cheerfully of the event best timing he had ever done very good thing for his people one more bad lot out of the way dead sir and a very good thing too married i believe one of the men who have done everything pity they cant write a life of him these were the comments made upon the decease of this young gentleman such is fame next day he was clean forgotten just as if he had never existed such is life    chapter lvii  at louvain  not many english tourists go out of their way to visit louvain even though it has a hotel de ville surpassing even that of brussels itself and though one can get there in an hour from that city of youth and pleasure and there are no english residents at all in the placeat least none in evidence though perhaps there may be some who have gone there for the same reasons which led mr william linville and his wife to choose this spotin order to be private and secluded there are many more people than we know of who desire above all things seclusion and retirement and dread nothing so much as a chance meeting with an old friend  mr william linville took a small house furnished like the cottage at passy and also like that little villa standing in its own garden here with a cook and a maid iris set up her modest menage to ask whether she was happy would be absurd at no time since her marriage had she been happy to live under the condition of perpetual concealment is not in itself likely to make a woman any the happier fortunately she had no time to experience the full bitterness of the plan proposed by her husband  consider had their scheme actually been carried out quite successfully this pair still young would have found themselves condemned to transportation for life that was the first thing next they could never make any friends among their own countrymen or countrywomen for fear of discovery iris could never again speak to an english lady if they had children the risk would appear ten times more terrible the consequences ten times more awful the children themselves would have to grow up without family and without friends the husband cut off from intercourse with other men would be thrown back upon himself husband and wife with this horrible load laid upon them would inevitably grow to loathe and hate the sight of each other the man would almost certainly take to drink the womanbut we must not follow this line any further the situation lasted only so long as to give the wife a glimpse of what it might become in the future  they took their house and sat down in it they were very silent lord harry his great coup successfully carried so far sat taciturn and glum he stayed indoors all day only venturing out after dark for a man whose whole idea of life was motion society and action this promised ill  the monotony was first broken by the arrival of hughs letter which was sent in with other documents from passy iris read it she read it again trying to understand exactly what it meant then she tore it up if he only knew she said he would not have taken the trouble even to write this letter there is no answer hugh there can be nonenow act by your advice henceforth i must act by order i am a conspirator  two days afterwards came a letter from the doctor he did not think it necessary to say anything about fannys appearance or her journey to borne everything he wrote has so far gone well the world knows through the papers that lord harry is dead there will be now only the business of claiming the money for this purpose as his widow is the sole heiress and executrix it will be necessary for her to place the will and the policies of insurance in the hands of her husbands lawyers so that the will may be proved and the claims duly made forms will have to be signed the medical certificate of death and the forms attesting the burial are already in the lawyers hands the sooner the widow goes to london the better she should write to announce her arrival and she should write from paris as if she had been staying there after her husbands death  i have only to remind you my dear linville that you are indebted to me in a good round sum of course i shall be very pleased to receive a cheque for this sum in full as soon as you have touched the amount due to you i shall be in paris at the hotel continental where you may address me naturally there is no desire for concealment and if the insurance companies desire any information from me i am always ready and willing to afford it  lord harry gave this letter to his wife  she read it and laid it open in her lap  must it be harry oh must it be  there is no other way possible dear but really it is nothing you were not at passy when your husband died you had been in londonyou were in brusselsanywhere when you arrived it was all over you have seen his headstone dr vimpany had him in his care you knew he was ill but you thought it was a trifling matter which time would cure you go to the lawyers and present the will they have the policies and will do everything else you will not even have to sign anything the only thing that you must do is to get a complete rigout of widows weeds mindthere will not be the slightest doubt or question raised considering everything you will be more than justified in seeing no one and going nowhere  hughs letter breaking in upon her fools paradise had awakened the poor woman to her better self she had gone so far with the fraud as to acquiesce in it but she recoiled with horror and shame when this active part was forced upon her  oh harryshe burst into tears i cannoti cannot you ask me to be a liar and a thiefoh heavensa vile thief  it is too late iris we are all vile thieves it is too late to begin crying now  harryshe threw herself upon her kneesspare me let some other woman go and call herself your widow then i will go away and hide myself  dont talk nonsense iris he replied roughly i tell you it is far too late you should have thought of this before it is now all arranged  i cannot go she said  you must go otherwise all our trouble may prove useless  then i will not go she declared springing to her feet i will not degrade myself any further i will not go  harry rose too he faced her for a moment his eyes dropped even he remembered at that moment how great must be the fall of a woman who would consent to play such a part  you shall not go he said unless you like you can leave me to the consequences of my own actsto my own degradation go back to england in one thing only spare me do not tell what you know as for me i will forge a letter from you  forge a letter  it is the only way left open giving the lawyers authority to act and inclosing the will what will happen next by whose hands the money is to reach me i know not yet but you can leave me iris better that you should leave mei shall only drag you lower  why must you forge the letter why not come with me somewherethe world is largeto some place where you are not known and there let us begin a new life we have not much money but i can sell my watches and chains and rings and we shall have enough o harry for once be guidedlisten to me we shall find some humble manner of living and we may be happy yet there is no harm done if you have only pretended to be dead nobody has been injured or defrauded  iris you talk wildly do you imagine for one moment that the doctor will release me from my bargain  what bargain  whyof course he was to be paid for the part he has taken in the business without him it could never have been done at all  yesyesit was in the letter that you gave me she said conscious that such agreements belonged to works of fiction and to police courts  certainly i have to pay him a good large slice out of the money  it is fifteen thousand pounds is it not how much is to be paid to theto the doctor  we agreed that he was to have the half said lord harry laughing lightly but as i thought that seven thousand five hundred pounds was a sum of money which would probably turn his head and bring him to starvation in a year or two i told him that the whole amount was four thousand pounds therefore he is to have two thousand pounds for his share and quite enough too  treachery on treachery said his wife fraud on fraud would to god she added with a sigh that you had never met this man  i dare say it would have been better for me on the whole he replied but then my dear a man like myself is always meeting people whom it would have been better not to have met like will to like i suppose given the active villain and the passive consenter and they are sure to meet not that i throw stones at the worthy doctor not at all  we cannot harry said his wife  we cannot my dear bien entendu well iris there is no more to be said you know the situation completely you can back out of it if you please and leave me then i shall have to begin all over again a new conspiracy far more dangerous than the last well i shall not drag you down with me that is my resolution if it comes to public degradationbut it shall not iris i promise you one thing for once he looked as if he meant it death before dishonour death without your name being mixed up at all save with pity for being the wife of such a man  again he conquered her  harry she said i will go    chapter lviii  of course they will pay  three days afterwards a hansom cab drove to the offices of the very respectable firm of solicitors who managed the affairs of the norland family they had one or two other families as well and in spite of agricultural depression they made a very good thing indeed out of a very comfortable business the cab contained a lady in deep widows weeds  lady harry norland expected to be received with coldness and suspicion her husband she knew had not led the life expected in these days of a younger son nor had his record been such as to endear him to his elder brother then as may be imagined there were other tremors caused by a guilty knowledge of certain facts which might by some accident come out everybody has tremors for whom something may come out also iris had had no experience of solicitors and was afraid of them  instead of being received however by a gentleman as solemn as the court of chancery and as terrible as the court of assize she found an elderly gentleman of quiet paternal manners who held both her hands and looked as if he was weeping over her bereavement by long practice this worthy person could always at a moments notice assume the appearance of one who was weeping with his client  my dear lady he murmured my dear lady this is a terrible time for you  she started she feared that something had come out  in the moment of bereavement too to think of business  i have brought you she replied curtly my husbandsmy late husbandswill  thank you with your permissionthough it may detain your ladyshipi will read it humph it is short and to the point this will certainly give us little trouble i fear however that besides the insurances your ladyship will not receive much  nothing my husband was always a poor man as you know at the time of his death he left a small sum of money only i am as a matter of fact greatly inconvenienced  your ladyship shall be inconvenienced no longer you must draw upon us as regards lord harrys death we are informed by dr vimpany who seems to have been his friend as well as his medical adviser  dr vimpany had been living with him for some time  that he had a somewhat protracted illness  i was away from my husband i was staying here in londonon businessfor some time before his death i was not even aware that he was in any danger when i hurried back to passy i was too late my husband waswas already buried  it was most unfortunate and the fact that his lordship was not on speaking terms with the members of his own familypray understand that i am not expressing any opinion on the casebut this fact seems to render his end more unhappy  he had dr vimpany said iris in a tone which suggested to the lawyer jealousy or dislike of the doctor  well he said it remains to prove the will and to make our claims against the insurance office i have the policy here his lordship was insured in the royal unicorn life insurance company for the sum of 15000 pounds we must not expect to have this large claim satisfied quite immediately perhaps the office will take three months to settle but as i said before your ladyship can draw upon us  you are certain that the company will pay  assuredly why not they must pay  oh i thought that perhaps so large a sum  my dear madamthe man who administered so much real and personal property smiledfifteen thousand pounds is not what we call a very large sum why if an insurance company refused to pay a lawful claim it would cut its own throatabsolutely its very existence depends upon its meeting all just and lawful claims the death being proved it remains for the company to pay the insurance into the hands of the person entitled to receive it that is in this case to me acting for you  yesi seebut i thought that perhaps my husband having died abroad there might be difficulty  there might if he had died in central africa but he died in a suburb of paris under french law which in such matters is even more careful and exacting than our own we have the official papers and the doctors certificate we have besides a photograph of the unfortunate gentleman lying on his deathbedthis was well thought of it is an admirable likenessthe sun cannot liewe have also a photograph of the newly erected tombstone doubt dear me madam they could no more raise a doubt as to your husbands death than if he were buried in the family vault if anything should remove any ground for doubt it is the fact that the only person who benefits by his death is yourself if on the other hand he had been in the hands of persons who had reason to wish for his death there might have been suspicions of foul play which would have been matter for the policebut not for an insurance company  oh i am glad to learn at least that there will be no trouble i have no knowledge of business and i thought that  nonoyour ladyship need have no such ideas in fact i have already anticipated your arrival and have sent to the manager of the company he certainly went so far as to express a doubt as to the cause of death consumption in any form was not supposed to be in your husbands family but lord harryahemtried his constitutiontried his constitition as i put it  he had put it a little differently what he said was to the following effectlord harry norland sir was a devil there was nothing he did not do i only wonder that he has lived so long had i been told that he died of everything all together i should not have been surprised ordinary rapid consumption was too simple for such a man  iris gave the lawyer her london address obeyed him by drawing a hundred pounds half of which she sent to mr william linville at louvain and went home to wait she must now stay in london until the claim was discharged  she waited six weeks at the end of that time she learned from her solicitors that the company had settled and that they the lawyers had paid to her bankers the sum of 15000 pounds being the whole of the insurance  acting then on her husbands instructions she sought another bank and opened an account for one william linville gentleman residing abroad she gave herself as a reference left the usual signature of william linville and paid to his account a cheque for 8000 pounds she saw the manager of her own bank explained that this large cheque was for an investment and asked him to let her have 2000 pounds in bank notes this sum she added was for a special purpose the manager imagined that she was about to perform some act of charity perhaps an expiatory work on behalf of her late husband  she then wrote to dr vimpany who was in paris making an appointment with him her work of fraud and falsehood was complete  there has been no trouble at all she wrote to her husband and there will not be any the insurance company has already settled the claim i have paid 8000 pounds to the account of william linville my own bankerwho knows my fatherbelieves that the money is an investment my dear harry i believe that unless the doctor begins to worry uswhich he will do as soon as his money is all gonea clear course lies before us let us as i have already begged you to do go straight away to some part of america where you are certain not to be known you can dye your hair and grow a beard to make sure let us go away from every place and person that may remind us of time past perhaps in time we may recover something of the old peace andcan it ever bethe old selfrespect  there was going to be trouble however and that of a kind little expected impossible to be guarded against and it would be trouble caused by her own act and deed    chapter lix  the consequences of an advertisement  the trouble was made by iris herself  in this way  she saw fannys advertisement her first impulse was to take her back into her service but she remembered the necessity for concealment she must not place herselfshe realised already the fact that she had done a thing which would draw upon her the vengeance of the lawand her husband in the power of this woman whose fidelity might not stand the shock of some fit of jealousy rage or revenge for fancied slight she must henceforth be cut off altogether from all her old friends  she therefore answered the letter by one which contained no address and which she posted with her own hand at the general post office she considered her words carefully she must not say too much or too little  i enclose she said a bank note for ten pounds to assist you i am about to travel abroad but must under existing circumstances dispense with the services of a maid in the course of my travels i expect to be in brussels if therefore you have anything to tell me or to ask of me write to me at the poste restante of that city and in the course of six mouths or so i am tolerably sure to send for the letter in fact i shall expect to find a letter from you do not think that i have forgotten you or your faithful services though for a moment i am not able to call you to my side be patient  there was no address given in the letter this alone was mysterious if lady harry was in london and the letter was posted at the general post officewhy should she not give her address if she was abroad why should she hide her address in any case why should she do without a maidshe who had never been without a maidto whom a maid was as necessary as one of her hands oh she could never get along at all without a maid as for iriss business in london and her part in the conspiracy of course fanny neither knew nor suspected  she had recourse again to her only friendmrs vimpanyto whom she sent lady harrys letter and imploring her to lay the whole before mr mountjoy  he is getting so much stronger mrs vimpany wrote back that i shall be able to tell him every thing before long do not be in a hurry let us do nothing that may bring trouble upon her but i am sure that something is going onsomething wicked i have read your account of what has happened over and over again i am as convinced as you could possibly be that my husband and lord harry are trading on the supposed death of the letter we can do nothing let us wait  three days afterwards she wrote again  the opportunity for which i have been waiting has come at last mr mountjoy is i believe fully recovered this morning seeing him so well and strong i asked him if i might venture to place in his hands a paper containing a narrative  is it concerning iris he asked  it has to do with lady harryindirectly  for a while he made no reply then he asked me if it had also to do with her husband  with her husband and with mine i told him  again he was silent  after a bit he looked up and said i had promised myself never again to interfere in lady harry norlands affairs you wish me to read this document mrs vimpany  certainly i am most anxious that you should read it and should advise upon it  who wrote it  fanny mere lady harrys maid  if it is only to tell me that her husband is a villain he said i will not read it  if you were enabled by reading it to keep lady harry from a dreadful misfortune i suggested  give me the document he said  before i gave it to himit was in my pocketi showed him a newspaper containing a certain announcement  lord harry dead he cried impossible then iris is free  perhaps you will first read the document i drew it out of my pocket gave it to him and retired he should be alone while he read it  half an hour afterwards i returned i found him in a state of the most violent agitation without however any of the weakness which he betrayed on previous occasions  mrs vimpany he cried this is terrible there is no doubtnot the least doubtin my mind that the man oxbye is the man buried under the name of lord harry and that he was murderedmurdered in cold bloodby that worst of villains  my husband i said  your husbandmost unfortunate of wives as for lord harrys share in the murder it is equally plain that he knew of it even if he did not consent to it good heavens do you understand do you realise what they have done your husband and iriss husband may be triedactually triedfor murder and put to a shameful death think of it  i do think of it heaven knows i think of it every dayi think of it all day long but remember i will say nothing that will bring this fate upon them and fanny will say nothing without fannys evidence there cannot be even a suspicion of the truth  what does iris know about it  i think that she cannot know anything of the murder consider the dates on wednesday fanny was dismissed on thursday she returned secretly and witnessed the murder it was on thursday morning that lady harry drove to victoria on her return to passy as we all supposed and as i still suppose on saturday funny was back again the cottage was deserted she was told that the man oxbye had got up and walked away that her mistress had not been at the house at all but was travelling in switzerland and that lord harry was gone on a long journey and she was sent into switzerland to get her out of the way i gather from all this that lady harry was taken away by her husband directly she arrivedmost likely by nightand that of the murder she knew nothing  nonoshe could know nothing that at least they dared not tell her but about the rest how much does she know how far has she lent herself to the conspiracy mrs vimpany i shall go back to london tonight we will travel by the night train i feel quite strong enough  i began this letter in scotland i finish it in london  we are back again in town come to the hotel at once and see us  so there was now a man to advise for once fanny was thankful for the creation of man to the most misanthropic female there sometimes comes a time when she must own that man has his uses these two women had now got a man with whom to take counsel  i do not ask you said mr mountjoy with grave face how far this statement of yours is true i can see plainly that it is true in every particular  it is quite true sir every word of it is true i have been tempted to make out a worse case against the doctor but i have kept myself to the bare truth  you could not make out a worse case against any man it is the blackest case that i ever heard of or read it is the foulest murder i do not understand the exact presence of lord harry when the medicine was given did he see the doctor administer it did he say anything  he turned white when the doctor told him that the man was going to diethat day perhaps or next day when the doctor was pouring out the medicine he turned pale again and trembled while the doctor was taking the photograph he trembled again i think siri really thinkthat he knew all along that the man was going to die but when it came to the moment he was afraid if it had depended on him oxbye would be alive still  he was a consenting party well for the moment both of you keep perfect silence dont discuss the timing with each other lest you should be overheard bury the thing i am going to make some inquiries  the first thing was to find out what steps had been taken if any with insurance companies for iriss sake his inquiry had to be conducted quite openly his object must seem none other than the discovery of lady harry norlands present address when bankers insurance companies and solicitors altogether have to conduct a piece of business it is not difficult to ascertain such a simple matter  he found out the name of the family solicitor he went to the office sent in his card and stated his object as a very old friend of lady harrys he wanted to learn her address he had just come up from scotland where he had been ill and had only just learned her terrible bereavement  the lawyer made no difficulty at all there was no reason why he should lady harry had been in london she was kept in town for nearly two months by business connected with the unfortunate event but she had now goneshe was travelling switzerland or elsewhere as for her address a letter addressed to his care should be forwarded on hearing from her ladyship  her business i take it was the proving of the will and the arrangement of the property  that was the business which kept her in town  lady harry mr mountjoy went on had a little property of her own apart from what she may ultimately get from her father about five thousand poundsnot more  indeed she did not ask my assistance in respect of her own property  i suppose it is invested and in the hands of trustees but indeed i do not know lord harry himself i have heard was generally in a penniless condition were there any insurances  yes happily there was insurance paid for him by the family otherwise there would have been nothing for the widow  and this has been paid up i suppose  yes it has been paid into her private account  thank you said mr mountjoy with your permission i will address a letter to lady harry here will you kindly order it to be forwarded at the very earliest opportunity  iris he thought will not come to london any more she has been persuaded by her husband to join in the plot good heavens she has become a swindlera conspiratora fraudulent woman irisit is incredibleit is horrible what shall we do  he first wrote a letter to the care of the lawyers he informed her that he had made a discovery of the highest importance to herselfhe refrained from anything that might give rise to suspicion he implored her to give him an interview anywhere in any part of the worldalone he told her that the consequences of refusal might be fatalabsolutely fatalto her future happiness he conjured her to believe that he was anxious for nothing but her happiness that he was still as always her most faithful friend  well he could do no more he had not the least expectation that his letter would do any good he did not even believe that it would reach iris the money was received and paid over to her own account there was really no reason at all why she should place herself again in communication with these lawyers what would she do then one thing only remained with her guilty husband this guilty woman must remain in concealment for the rest of their days or until death released her of the man who was pretending to be dead at the best they might find some place where there would be no chance of anybody ever finding them who knew either of them before this wicked thing was done  but could she know of the murder  he remembered the instruction given to fanny she was to write to brussels let her therefore write at once he would arrange what she was to say under his dictation therefore fanny wrote as follows  my ladyi have received your ladyships letter and your kind gift of ten pounds i note your directions to write to you at brussels and i obey them  mr mountjoy who has been ill and in scotland has come back to london he begs me to tell you that he has had an interview with your lawyers and has learned that you have been in town on business the nature of which he has also learned he has left an important letter for you at their office they will forward it as soon as they learn your address  since i came back from passy i have thought it prudent to set down in writing an exact account of everything that happened there under my own observation mr mountjoy has read my story and thinks that i ought without delay to send a copy of it to you i therefore send you one in which i have left out all the names and put in a b and c instead by his directions he says that you will have no difficulty in filling up the names  i remain my dear lady  your ladyships most obedient and humble servant  fanny mere   this letter with the document was dispatched to brussels that night and this is the trouble which iris brought upon herself by answering fannys advertisement    chapter lx  on the eve of a change  iris returned to louvain by way of paris she had to settle up with the doctor  he obeyed her summons and called upon her at the hotel  well my lady he began in his gross voice rubbing his hands and laughing it has come off after all hasnt it  i do not desire dr vimpany to discuss anything with you we will proceed to settle what business we have together  to think that your ladyship should actually fall in he replied now i confess that this was to me the really difficult part of the job it is quite easy to pretend that a man is dead but not so easy to touch his money i really do not see how we could have managed at all without your cooperation well youve had no difficulty of course  none at all  i am to have half  i am instructed to give you two thousand pounds i have the money here for you  i hope you consider that i deserve this share  i think dr vimpany that whatever you get in the future or the present you will richly deserve you have dragged a man down to your own level  and a woman too  a woman too your reward will come i doubt not  if it always takes the form of banknotes i care not how great the reward may be you will doubtless as a good christian expect your own rewardfor him and for you  i have mine already she replied sadly now dr vimpany let me pay you and get rid of your company  he counted the money carefully and put it in the bankers bag in his coatpocket thank you my lady we have exchanged compliments enough over this job  i hopei praythat we may never set eyes on you again  i cannot say people run up against each other in the strangest manner especially people whove done shady things and have got to keep in the background  enoughenough  the background of the world is a very odd place i assure you it is full of interesting people the society has a piquancy which you will find i hope quite charming you will be known by another name of course  i shall not tell you by what name  tuttut i shall soon find out the background gets narrower when you fall into misery  what do you mean  i mean lady harry that your husband has no idea whatever as to the value of money the two thousand that you are taking him will vanish in a year or two what will you do then as for myself i know the value of money so well that i am always buying the most precious and delightful things with it i enjoy them immensely never any man enjoyed good things so much as i do but the delightful things cost money let us be under no illusions your ladyship and your noble husband and i all belong to the background and in a year or two we shall belong to the needy background i daresay that very soon after that the world will learn that we all belong to the criminal background i wish your ladyship a joyful reunion with your husband  he withdrew and iris set eyes on him no more but the prophecy with which he departed remained with her and it was with a heart foreboding fresh sorrows that she left paris and started for louvain   here began the new lifethat of concealment and false pretence iris put off her weeds but she never ventured abroad without a thick veil her husband discovering that english visitors sometimes ran over from brussels to see the hotel de ville never ventured out at all till evening they had no friends and no society of any kind  the house which stood secluded behind a high wall in its garden was in the quietest part of this quiet old city no sound of life and work reached it the pair who lived there seldom spoke to each other except at the midday breakfast and the dinner they did not meet iris sat in her own room silent lord harry sat in his or paced the garden walks for hours  thus the days went on monotonously the clock ticked the hours struck they took meals they slept they rose and dressed they took meals againthis was all their life this was all that they could expect for the future  the weeks went on for three months iris endured this life no news came to her from the outer world her husband had even forgotten the first necessary of modern lifethe newspaper it was not the ideal life of love apart from the world where the two make for themselves a garden of eden it was a prison in which two were confined together who were kept apart by their guilty secret  they ceased altogether to speak their very meals were taken in silence the husband saw continual reproach in his wifes eyes her sad and heavy look spoke more plainly than any words it is to this that you have brought me  one morning iris was idly turning over the papers in her desk there were old letters old photographs all kinds of trifling treasures that reminded her of the pasta woman keeps everything the little mementoes of her childhood her first governess her first school her school friendshipseverything as iris turned over these things her mind wandered back to the old days she became again a young girlinnocent fancy free she grew upshe was a woman innocent still then her mind jumped at one leap to the present and she saw herself as she wasinnocent no longer degraded and guilty the vile accomplice of a vile conspiracy  then as one who has been wearing coloured glasses puts them off and sees things in their own true colours she saw how she had been pulled down by a blind infatuation to the level of the man who had held her in his fascination she saw him as he wasreckless unstable careless of name and honour then for the first time she realised the depths into which she was plunged and the life which she was henceforth doomed to lead the blind love fell from herit was dead at last but it left her bound to the man by a chain which nothing could break she was in her right senses she saw things as they were but the knowledge came too late  her husband made no attempt to bridge over the estrangement which had thus grown up between them it became wider every day he lived apart and alone he sat in his own room smoking more cigars drinking more brandyandwater than was good for him sometimes he paced the gravel walks in the garden in the evening after dinner he went out and walked about the empty streets of the quiet city once or twice he ventured into a cafe sitting in a corner his hat drawn over his eyes but that was dangerous for the most part he kept in the streets and he spoke to no one  meantime the autumn had given place to winter which began in wet and dreary fashion day and night the rain fell making the gravel walks too wet and the streets impossible then lord harry sat in his room and smoked all day long and still the melancholy of the one increased and the boredom of the other  he spoke at last it was after breakfast  iris he said how long is this to continue  thiswhat  this lifethis miserable solitude and silence  till we die she replied what else do you expect you have sold our freedom and we must pay the price  no it shall end i will end it i can endure it no longer  you are still young you will perhaps have forty years more to liveall like thisas dull and empty it is the price we must pay  no he repeated it shall end i swear that i will go on like this no longer  you had better go to london and walk in piccadilly to get a little society  what do you care what i do or where i go  we will not reproach each other harry  whywhat else do you do all day long but reproach me with your gloomy looks and your silence  wellend it if you can find some change in the life  be gracious for a little and listen to my plan i have made a plan listen iris i can no longer endure this life it drives me mad  and me too that is one reason why we should not desire to change it mad people forget they think they are somewhere else for us to believe that we were somewhere else would be in itself happiness  i am resolved to change itto change it i sayat any risk we will leave louvain  we can i dare say iris replied coldly find another town french or belgian where we can get another cottage behind high walls in a garden and hide there  no i will hide no longer i am sick of hiding  go on what is your plan am i to pretend to be some one elses widow  we will go to america there are heaps of places in the states where no english people ever goneither tourists nor settlersplaces where they have certainly never heard of us we will find some quiet village buy a small farm and settle among the people i know something about farming we need not trouble to make the thing pay and we will go back to mankind again perhaps iriswhen we have gone back to the worldyou will he hesitatedyou will be able to forgive me and to regard me again with your old thoughts it was done for your sake  it was not done for my sake do not repeat that falsehood the old thoughts will never come back harry they are dead and gone i have ceased to respect you or myself love cannot survive the loss of selfrespect who am i that i should give love to anybody who are you that you should expect love  will you go with me to americalove or no love i cannot stay herei will not stay here  i will go with you wherever you please i should like not to run risks there are still people whom it would pain to see iris henley tried and found guilty with two others on a charge of fraudulent conspiracy  i wouldnt accustom myself if i were you iris to speak of things too plainly leave the thing to me and i will arrange it see now we will travel by a night train from brussels to calais we will take the crosscountry line from amiens to havre there we will take boat for new yorkno english people ever travel by the havre line once in america we will push up countryto kentucky or somewhereand find that quiet country place after that i ask no more i will settle down for the rest of my life and have no more adventures do you agree iris  i will do anything that you wish she replied coldly  very well let us lose no time i feel choked here will you go into brussels and buy a continental bradshaw or a baedeker or something that will tell us the times of sailing the cost of passage and all the rest of it we will take with us money to start us with you will have to write to your bankers we can easily arrange to have the money sent to new york and it can be invested thereexcept your own fortunein my new name we shall want no outfit for a fortnight at sea i have arranged it all beautifully child look like your old self he took an unresisting hand i want to see you smile and look happy again  you never will  yeswhen we have got ourselves out of this damnable unwholesome way of life when we are with our fellowcreatures again you will forget thisthis little businesswhich was you know after all an unhappy necessity  oh how can i ever forget  new interests will arise new friendships will be formed  harry it is myself that i cannot forgive teach me to forgive myself and i will forget everything  he pressed her no longer  well then he said go to brussels and get this information if you will not try to conquer this absurd moral sensitivenesswhich comes too lateyou will at least enable me to place you in a healthier atmosphere  i will go at once she said i will go by the next train  there is a train at a quarter to two you can do all you have to do and catch the train at five iristhe chance of a change made him impatientlet us go tomorrow let us go by the night express there will be english travellers but they shall not recognise me we shall be in calais at one in the morning we will go on by an early train before the english steamer comes in will you be ready  yes there is nothing to delay me i suppose we can leave the house by paying the rent i will go and do what you want  let us go this very night  if you please i am always ready  no there will be no time it will look like running away we will go tomorrow night besides you would be too tired after going to brussels and back iris we are going to be happy againi am sure we are he for one looked as if there was nothing to prevent a return of happiness he laughed and waved his hands a new skynew scenesnew workyou will be happy again iris you shall go dear get me the things i want  she put on her thick veil and started on her short journey the husbands sudden return to his former good spirits gave her a gleam of hope the change would be welcome indeed if it permitted him to go about among other men and to her if it gave her occupation as to forgettinghow could she forget the past so long as they were reaping the fruit of their wickedness in the shape of solid dividends she easily found what she wanted the steamer of the compagnie generale transatlantique left havre every eighth day they would go by that line the more she considered the plan the more it recommended itself they would at any rate go out of prison there would be a change in their life miserable condition to have no other choice of life but that of banishment and concealment no other prospect than that of continual fraud renewed by every post that brought them money  when she had got all the information that was wanted she had still an hour or two before her she thought she would spend the time wandering about the streets of brussels the animation and life of the cheerful citywhere all the people except the marketwomen are youngpleased her it was long since she had seen any of the cheerfulness that belongs to a busy street she walked slowly along up one street and down another looking into the shops she made two or three little purchases she looked into a place filled with tauchnitz editions and bought two or three books she was beginning to think that she was tired and had better make her way back to the station when suddenly she remembered the postoffice and her instructions to fanny mere  i wonder she said if fanny has written to me  she asked the way to the postoffice there was time if she walked quickly  at the poste restante there was a letter for hermore than a letter a parcel apparently a book  she received it and hurried back to the station  in the train she amused herself with looking through the leaves of her new books fanny meres letter she would read after dinner  at dinner they actually talked lord harry was excited with the prospect of going back to the world he had enjoyed his hermitage he said quite long enough give him the society of his fellowcreatures put me among cannibals he said and i should make friends with them but to live aloneit is the devil tomorrow we begin our new flight  after dinner he lit his cigar and went on chattering about the future iris remembered the packet she had got at the postoffice and opened it it contained a small manuscript book filled with writing and a brief letter she read the letter laid it down and opened the book    chapter lxi  the last discovery  i shall like to turn farmer lord harry went on talking while iris opened and began to read fannys manuscript after all my adventures to settle down in a quiet place and cultivate the soil on marketday we will drive into town togetherhe talked as if kentucky were warwickshireside by side in a spring cart i shall have samples of grain in bags and you will have a basket of butter and cream it will be an ideal life we shall dine at the ordinary and after dinner over a pipe and a glass of grog i shall discuss the weather and the crops and while we live in this retreat of ours over here the very name of harry norland will have been forgotten queer that we shall go on living long after we are dead and buried and forgotten in the novels the man turns up after he is supposed to be cast awaywreckeddrowneddead long ago but he never turns up when he is forgottenunless he is rip van winkle by gad iris when we are old people we will go home and see the old places together it will be something to look forward tosomething to live foreh  i feel quite happy this evening iris happier than i have been for months the fact is this infernal place has hipped us both confoundedly i didnt like to grumble but ive felt the monotony more than a bit and so have you its made you brood over things now for my part i like to look at the bright side here we are comfortably cut off from the past thats all done with nothing in the world can revive the memory of disagreeable things if we are only true to ourselves and agree to forget them what has been done can never be discovered not a soul knows except the doctor and between him and ourselves we are going to put a few thousandwhats the matter iris what the devil is the matter  for iris who had been steadily reading while her husband chattered on suddenly dropped the book and turned upon him a white face and eyes struck with horror  what is it lord harry repeated  oh is this true  what  i cannot say it oh my god can this be true  what speak iris he sprang to his feet is itis it discovered  discovered yes allallallis discovered  where how give me the thing iris quick who knows what is known  he snatched the book from her hands she shrank from his touch and pushed back her chair standing in an attitude of selfdefencewatching him as one would watch a dangerous creature  he swiftly read page after page eager to know the worst then he threw the book upon the table  well he said not lifting his eyes  the man was murderedmurdered she whispered  he made no reply  you looked on while he was murdered you looked on consenting you are a murderer  i had no share or part in it i did not know he was being poisoned  you knew when i was with you oh the dead manthe murdered manwas in the house at the very moment your hands were red with blood when you took me awayto get me out of the wayso that i should not know she stopped she could not go on  i did not know irisnot with certainty i thought he was dying when he came into the house he did not die he began to recover when the doctor gave him his medicineafter that woman went awayi suspected when he died my suspicions were stronger i challenged him he did not deny it believe me iris i neither counselled it nor knew of it  you acquiesced in it you consented you should have warned thethe other murderer that you would denounce him if the man died you took advantage of it his death enabled you to carry out your fraud with me as your accomplice with me i am an accomplice in a murder  no no iris you knew nothing of it no one can ever accuse you  you do not understand it is part of the accusation which i make against myself  as for what this woman writes her husband went on it is true i suppose it is useless to deny a single word of it she was hidden behind the curtain then she heard and saw all if vimpany had found her he was right no one so dangerous as a woman yes she has told you exactly what happened she suspected all along we should have sent her away and changed our plans this comes of being too clever nothing would do for the doctor but the mans death i hopedwe both hopedthat he would die a natural death he did not without a dead man we were powerless we had to get a dead man iris i will hide nothing more from you whatever happens i confess everything i knew that he was going to die when he began to get well i was filled with forebodings because i knew that he would never be allowed to go away how else could we find a dead body you cant steal a body you cant make one up you must have one for proof of death i sayhis voice was harsh and hoarsei say that i knew he must die i saw his death in the doctors face and there was no more money left for a new experiment if oxbye should get well and go away when it came to the point i was seized with mortal terror i would have given up everythingeverythingto see the man get up from his bed and go away but it was too late i saw the doctor prepare the final dose and when he had it to his lips i saw by his eyes that it was the drink of death i have told you all he concluded  you have told me all she repeated all good heavens all  i have hidden nothing from you now there is nothing more to tell  she stood perfectly stillher hands clasped her eyes set her face white and stern  what i have to do now she said lies plain before me  iris i implore you make no change in our plans let us go away as we proposed let the past be forgotten come with me  go with you with you with you oh she shuddered  iris i have told you all let us go on as if you had heard nothing we cannot be more separated than we have been for the last three months let us remain as we are until the time when you will be able to feel for meto pity my weaknessand to forgive me  you do not understand forgive you it is no longer a question of forgiveness who am i that my forgiveness should be of the least value to youor to any  what is the question then  i dont know a horrible crime has been committeda horrible ghastly dreadful crimesuch a thing as one reads of in the papers and wonders reading it what manner of wild beasts must be those who do such things perhaps one wonders besides what manner of women must be those who associate with those wild beasts my husband is one of those wild beastsmy husbandmy husbandandii am one of the women who are the fit companions of these wild creatures  you can say what you please

had you fallen dead at my feet on the day when you became my wife then i should have been sparedi should have been spared a great deal you are right iris your duty lies plainly before you as for me i must think of mine farewell the lips of a murderer are not fit to touch even the hem of your garments farewell  he left her she heard the hall door open and shut she would see her husband no more  she went to her own room and packed a single box with necessary things then she called the housemaid and informed her that she had been summoned to return suddenly to england she must reach brussels at least that evening the woman brought a porter who carried her box to the station and iris left louvainand her husbandfor ever    chapter lxii  the board of directors  at a board meeting of the royal unicorn life insurance company specially convened the chairman had to make a communication of a very remarkable character  gentlemen he said i call upon the secretary without further introduction to read a letter to consider which you are called together this day  the letter the secretary began is simply headed paris dated two days ago  only two days ago said the chairman mysteriously but of course that means nothing there has been plenty of time for him to change his residence i dare say he may be in london at our very elbow go on if you please  gentlementhe secretary proceeded to read the letter it is now three months since a claim was sent in to you by the firm of erskine mansfield denham  co solicitors of lincolns inn fields for the sum of 15000 pounds due to the heirs of lord harry norland in respect of an insurance effected upon his life  the claim gentlemen said the chairman was duly acknowledged and paid some weeks later it was a heavy loss but these things will occur and there seemed no reason to doubt the facts alleged or to dispute the claim  i write this letter the secretary continued reading in order to inform you that the claim was fraudulent inasmuch as lord harry norland was at the time and is still actually living  fraudulent the man still living at this point there was a sudden awakening everybody sat up and listened with all their ears  i may tell you gentlemen the chairman explained that the writer of this remarkable letter is none other than lord harry norland himself we will now proceed without further interruption  in conjunction with another person i devised and carried out successfully a plan by which i was enabled to touch at once and without the disagreeable necessity of previously expiring and being buried the whole of the money for which i was insured other people have attempted the same design i believe but the thing has hitherto been managed clumsily in my own case it has been managed with great dexterity and artistic skill as you will naturally be curious on a subject which interests you so closely i have no objection to reveal the method it is not enough to write to your office and state that a certain person is dead one must be prepared with proofs of the death should any doubt arise no proof of death is quite satisfactory without evidence as to the disposal of the dead body with that object we procured from the hotel dieu a patient apparently in an advanced state of consumption my accomplice being a medical man highly recommended was able to do this without suspicion we nursed him ostentatiously during the latter part of the illness he was nursed under the name of lord harry norland he died his name was entered in the official register as lord harry norland he was buried in the cemetery at auteuil near paris as lord harry norland a headstone marks his grave which is purchased in perpetuity the doctor certified the cause of his death and communicated the fact to the deceaseds brother lord malven and to the deceaseds solicitors the death was also announced to the papers the difficulties attendant on the successful conduct of the business are so great that you need not fear a repetition nobody in order to assist a fraud will consent to die and lend his own body it is seldom indeed that a sick man can be founda foreigner and friendlesswhose death will cause no curiosity and raise no questions add to this it is extremely difficult as i have now experienced to find the necessary assistance without encountering the objections of conscience  upon my word cried one of the directors this is a most wonderful letter i beg your pardon pray go on  we began very well we buried our man under the name of lord harry norland as i have said the difficulty then arose as to the presentation of the claim it was most desirable that the claim should be made by the person who would most naturally be the deceaseds heir and after proving his will and by his own solicitor  i am married i have no children i have not lived on good terms with my family it was therefore quite reasonable to expect that i should leave my wife sole heir and executrix it was also natural that she should go to my solicitorsthe family solicitorsand ask them to manage her affairs  with this object i confessed to my wife as much of the conspiracy as was necessary like many women she possesses in addition to every virtue a blessed devotion to her husband where he is concerned she is easily led even from the paths of honour i practised on that devotion i used all the arguments and persuasions based on that devotion necessary to convert a woman of honour into the accomplice of a conspiracy in brief i made my wife join in the fraud she consented to act for me persuaded that if she did not the conspiracy would be discovered the business has therefore been carried through with the greatest success you have paid the claim in full without question for me there was left the very comfortable provision of 15000 pounds with the consciousness of a daring and successful swindle unfortunately my wife has now discovered that her conscience will give her no peace or rest until full restitution of the money has been made she has informed me of her intention to send back without delay that part of it which lies at her bank in her own namethat is to say five thousand pounds  i do not suppose that as gentlemen you would be disposed to subject a woman who thus desires to repair a wrong to the degradation of a public prosecution no useful end in fact will be served in so doing it is in fact in the conviction that you will take no proceedings that i write this letter  further as i wish my wifes scruples of conscience to be completely set at rest i am prepared on an assurance that the matter will be allowed to drop to forward to you the remainder of the money less two thousand pounds which i have reason to believe will be sent to you in course of time i am also prepared to instruct my wife as my heir in the event of my death to make no claim on the company and i have requested my solicitor to cease paying the annual premium the company will therefore be the gainers of the whole premiums which have been paidnamely 300 pounds a year for ten years that is to say 3000 pounds  as for myself i will take the necessary steps as soon as you have given me that letter of assurance as regards the other principal in the conspiracy it is hardly worth your while to search after him i shall be obliged if you will be so good as to acknowledge this letter without delay with any assurance which you may be able to make as regards the person whom i have dragged into the affair i send you an address where a letter will find me you may wish to watch the house i assure you beforehand that it is useless i shall not go therei remain gentlemen  your obedient servant  harry norland   perhaps said the secretary it is in connection with this letter that i have this day received a packet of banknotes amounting in all to the sum of five thousand pounds the packet is endorsed restitution money  banknotes gentlemen said the chairman significantly may be traced if necessary  the directors looked at each other this was indeed a very remarkable story and one never before brought to the notice of any board  gentlemen said the chairman you have heard the letter you now have the case before you i should like to hear your views  we are likely to get most of our money back said one of the directors it seems to me by holding our tongues that is the main thing  if we could get lord harry himself said another i should say go for him but not for his wife i wonder we ever took his life at all if all stories are true about him he is as bad as they make em he ran away when he was a boy and went to sea he was a strolling actor after that he went out to the states and was reported to have been seen in the west he has been a ships steward he has been on the turf what has he not been  we have got the money said another that is the great thing we must remember that we should never have found out the thing unless  the company must not compound a felony said the chairman  certainly not by no means at the same time would any good purpose be served by public scandal in connection with a noble house  the noble house said another director who was radical may very well take care of itself question is would it do any good to anybody if we ran in the wife  who is she  you would expect a ruffian like lord harry to marry a woman like himself not at all he married a most charming creature named henleyiris henleyfather very well known in the city i heard of it at the time she would have himinfatuated about himsad business mr chairman i submit that it is quite impossible for us to take proceedings against this unfortunate lady who is doing her utmost to make restitution  the company must not compound a felony the chairman repeated  even if we do not get back that two thousand pounds said the secretary the company will lose nothing the surrender value must be considered  then another of the directors spoke we do not know where this lady is to be found she is probably passing under another name it is not our business to hunt her down  and if we found her we should have to prove the case and her guilty knowledge of the conspiracy said another how would this precious letter be taken as evidence why we do not even know that it is true we might exhume the body what would that prove after three months we might open up the case and spend a heap of money and create a great scandal and be none the better for it afterwards my advice is let the thing drop  well but objected another suppose we admit that the man is still living he may die and then there would be another claim upon us  of that said the chairman i think there need be no apprehension whatever you have heard his letter but i repeat we must not compound a felony  i submit mr chairman said one who had not spokenand he was a barristerthat the company knows nothing at all about lady harry norland we have had to deal with the firm of erskine mansfield denham  co of lincolns inn fields and a most respectable firm too on their representations we paid the money if it can be ascertained that we have been defrauded we must look to them if we have to prosecute anybody it must be that respectable firm  good said the chairman  i propose therefore that the secretary write to lord harry norland informing him that the company have had nothing at all to do with his wife and do not recognise her action in any way we shall then see what happens and can proceed in accordance  at this moment a card was brought in it was that of mr erskine himself senior partner in the very firm  he came in old eminently respectable but shaken he was greatly shaken gentlemen he said nervously i hasten to bring you a communication a most extraordinary communication which i have just received it is nothing less than a confessiona full confessionfrom a person whom i had every reason to believe was dead it is from lord harry norland  we know already said the chairman superior the main facts which you are going to lay before us we are met today in order to discuss our action in view of these facts there has been a conspiracy of a very artful and ingenious character it has been successful so far through the action of a woman by the action of the same woman it is sought to make restitution the hand of justice however  perhaps said the lawyer you will oblige me by allowing me to read the letter  pray read itthe chairman bowedthough i do not suppose it will add to the information we already possess  gentlementhe lawyer readyou will be surprised and pained to learn that i am notas you were given to understanddead but on the other hand living and in the enjoyment of rude health i see no reason why my life should not be prolonged to threescore years and ten  the claim therefore which you sent in to the royal unicorn life insurance company was fraudulent it was the result of a deeplaid conspiracy you have been made the innocent accomplice of a great crime  my wife who now knows the whole truth is most anxious for restitution to be made she is about to restore that portion of the money which lies in her name most of the rest will be sent back by myself on certain conditions  in communicating the fact of my being still alive to the head of my family you will please also to inform him that i authorise the discontinuance of the premium this will save the family 300 pounds a year this will be a solatium to him for the fact that his brother still lives to disgrace the name if i should die before the next premium is due i order my heirs not to claim the moneyi remain gentlemen your obedient servant  harry norland   the premium which should have been paid under ordinary circumstances said the secretary was due six weeks ago the policy has therefore expired  it is a characteristic letter said the lawyer lord harry was born to be a trouble to his family there has never been a time so far as i remember when he was not a trouble and a disgrace hitherto however he has avoided actual crimeat least actual detection now i suppose the game is up yet gentlemen the letter is not that of an utter villain  he will not be caught observed the chairman the letter is from too cool a hand he has prepared a retreat i dare say by this time he is in some safe and convenient disguise we are only concernedare we notfor the moment with the lady she has received the money from you we paid it to you on your representations  observe said the lawyer that the moment she learns the truth she hastens to make restitution  humph said the director turning over lord harrys letter so that the lawyer should not be able to read the contents have you seen her  i have not i expect to do so before long she will certainly call upon me  she will be illadvised said the chairman if she calls upon anybody just at present well sir i confess that i should be sorryevery member of this board would be sorryto see that lady placed in the dock beside her husband  in the interests of the noble family concerned i hope that neither of them will be placed in the dock  do you know who is the other manthe second principal  i can guess i do not know however where he is all i know is what i have communicated to youthe contents of this letter  one would like to get hold of the other man said the chairman presumably he does not belong to a noble family well sir i dont know what may be done but this company cannot i repeat compound a felony  certainly not most certainly not at present however you have got very little to go upon and unless evidence is forthcoming  we will not discuss that part of the business said the chairman a conspiracy has been undoubtedly entered into we may be compelled to bring an action of some kind against your firm mr erskine as regards the lady if she is guilty  nono said the lawyer upon my life sinned againstnot guilty  the chairman folded up lord harrys letter and gave it to the secretary  we are much obliged to you sir for your prompt action it is of course only what we should have expected of your firm meantime remember that the claim was made by you that you received the money andbut we will communicate with you in a few days  the secretary wrote such a letter as was suggested by return of post a cheque was sent signed by one william linville for the sum of eight thousand pounds the company had therefore recovered thirteen out of fifteen thousand pounds the secretary had another interview with mr erskine the result of which was that the company recovered the remaining two thousand pounds  every firm of solicitors contains its own secrets and keeps them therefore we need not inquire whether it was intended that this money should be paid by the firm or by the noble family to which lord harry norland belonged it is however certain that a few days afterwards mr hugh mountjoy called at the office and had a long conversation with the senior partner and that he left behind him a very big cheque  the subject has never been brought before the directors again it was indeed privately discussed and that frequently perhaps the story was whispered about outside the boardroom these things do get about there has been however a feeling that the thing which would have been perfectly successful but for the conscience of a woman concerned might be repeated with less tender consciences and so the companies be defrauded now the wickedness of the world is already so great that it needs no more teaching to make it worse on the whole the less said the better  besides the tragic event which happened a day or two later effectively prevented any further step that in itself was sufficient to wipe out the whole business    chapter lxiii  a refuge  it was all over iris had sent in her money she was in a small lodging found for her by fanny mere who called her cousin she stayed indoors all day long afraid of stirring abroad afraid to read the papers afraid that her husband was arrested on the charge of conspiracy and fraud afraid that some kind of hue and cry might be out after her  therefore when she heard a manly step on the stair she started and turned pale expecting nothing short of an armed messenger of the law she never was in this danger for a single minute but conscience made a coward of her  the step was that of hugh mountjoy  i found you out he said by means of fanny the girl knew that she was safe in letting me know your secret why are you in concealment  you cannot know all or you would not ask me that  i do know all and again i ask why are you in concealment  becauseoh hughspare me  i know all which is the reason why i cannot choose but come to see you come out of this poor place resume your own name there is no reason why you should not you were not present at passy when this conspiracy was hatched you got there after the funeral you naturally went to see the family solicitors iris what has the conspiracy to do with you it will be observed that hugh had not read the letter written to the directors of the company  do you know about the money  certainly you sent back all that you couldfive thousand pounds that showed your own innocence  hugh you know that i am guilty  the world will think that you are innocent at any rate you can come out and go about without fear tell me what are your plans  i have no plans i only want to hide my headsomewhere  yes we will talk about that presently meantime i have some news for you  news what news  really good news i have to tell you a thing which will surprise you  good news what good news is there for me  your husband has sent back the whole of the money  sent back to the insurance office  all has been sent back he wrote two lettersone to the solicitors and the other to the insurance company it is not likely now that anything can be said because the directors have accepted the money moreover it appears that they might have proceeded against the lawyers for the recovery of the money but that they have nothing to do either with you or with lord harry norland that is a difficult point however somebody it seems has compoundedor is going to compounda felony i do not understand exactly what this means or what dreadful consequences might follow but i am assured by the lawyers that we need apprehend nothing more all is over  iris heaved a profound sigh  then he is safe she said  you think of him first said hugh jealously yes he is safe and i do hope gone away out of the country never to come back any more the more important thing is that you should be safe from him as for the doctorbut i cannot speak of the doctor with common patience let him be left to the end which always awaits such men it is to be hoped that he will never wherever he goes feel himself in safety  i am safe said iris not only from my husband but from what else beside you know what i mean you mean that i as well as my husband am safe from that oh the fear of it has never left menever for one moment you tell me that i am safe from public disgrace and i rejoicewhen i ought to sink into the earth with shame she covered her face with her hands  iris we know what you have done we also know why you did it what need we say more the thing is finished and done with let us never again allude to it the question now iswhat will you do next where will you live  i do not know i have got fanny mere with me mrs vimpany is also anxious to live with me i am rich indeed since i have two faithful dependants and one friend  in such wealth iris you will always be rich now listen seriously i have a villa in the country it is far away from london in the scottish lowlandsquite out of the wayremote even from tourists and travellers it is a very lonely place but there is a pretty house with a great garden behind and a stretch of sand and seashore in front there one may live completely isolated i offer you that villa for your residence take it live in it as long as you please  no no i must not accept such a gift  you must irisyou shall i ask it of you as a proof of friendship and nothing more only i fear that you will get tired of the loneliness  nono she said i cannot get tired of loneliness it is all i want  there is no society at all  society society for me  i go to the neighbourhood sometimes for fishing you will let me call upon you  who else has such a right  then you will accept my offer  i feel that i must yes hugh yes with deepest gratitude  the next day she went down by the nightmail to scotland with her travelled mrs vimpany and fanny mere    chapter lxiv  the invincibles  the proceedings of lord harry after he had sent off that cheque were most remarkable if he had invitedactually courtedwhat followedhe could not have acted differently  he left london and crossed over to dublin  arrived there he went to a small hotel entirely frequented by irish americans and their friends it was suspected of being the principal place of resort of the invincibles it was known to be a house entirely given up to the nationalists he made no attempt to conceal his name he entered the hotel greeted the landlord cheerfully saluted the head waiter ordered his dinner and took no notice of the sullen looks with which he was received or the scowls which followed him about the coffeeroom where half a dozen men were sitting and talking for the most part in whispers  he slept there that night  the next day still openly and as if there was nothing to fear either from england or from ireland he walked to the station and took his ticket paying no attention to what all the world might have seen and understoodthat he was watched when he had taken his ticket two men immediately afterwards took tickets to the same place the place where he was going was that part of kerry where the invincibles had formerly assassinated arthur mountjoy  the two men who followed himwho took their tickets for the same placewho got into the same carriage with himwere two members of that same fraternity it is well known that he who joins that body and afterwards leaves it or disobeys its order or is supposed to betray its secrets incurs the penalty of death  on the unexpected arrival of lord harry at this hotel there had been hurriedly called together a meeting of those members then in dublin it was resolved that the traitor must be removed lots were cast and the lot fell upon one who remembered past acts of kindness done by lord harry to his own people he would fain have been spared this business but the rules of the society are imperative he must obey  it is the practice of the society when a murder has been resolved upon to appoint a second man whose duty it is to accompany the murderer and to see that he executes his task  in the afternoon about an hour before sunset the train arrived at the station where lord harry was to get down the stationmaster recognised him and touched his hat then he saw the two other men got down after him and he turned pale  i will leave my portmanteau said lord harry in the cloakroom it will be called for  afterwards the stationmaster remembered those words lord harry did not say i will call for it but it will be called for ominous words  the weather was cold a drizzling rain fell the day was drawing in lord harry left the station and started with quick step along the road which stretched across a dreary desolate piece of country  the two men walked after him one presently quickened his step leaving the second man twenty yards behind  the stationmaster looked after them till he could see them no longer then he shook his head and returned to his office  lord harry walking along the road knew that the two men were following him presently he became aware that one of them was quickening his pace  he walked on perhaps his cheeks paled and his lips were set close because he knew that he was walking to his death  the steps behind him approached fasterfaster lord harry never even turned his head the man was close behind him the man was beside him  mickey oflynn it is said lord harry  tis a  traitor you are said the man  your friends the invincibles told you that mickey why do you think i dont know man what are you here for well he stopped i am unarmed you have got a revolver in your handthe hand behind your back what are you stopping for  i cannot said the man  you must mickey oflynnyou must or its murdered youll be yourself said lord harry coolly why man tis but to lift your hand and then youll be a murderer for life i am anotherwe shall both be murderers then why dont you fire man  by  i cannot said mickey he held the revolver behind him but he did not lift his arm his eyes started his mouth was open the horror of the murderer was upon him before the murder was committed then he started look he cried look behind you my lord  lord harry turned the second man was upon him he bent forward and peered in his face  arthur mountjoys murderer he cried and sprang at his throat  one two three shots rang out in the evening air those who heard them in the roadside cabin at the railwaystation on the road shuddered they knew the meaning of those shots one more murder to load the soul of ireland  but lord harry lay dead in the middle of the road  the second man got up and felt at his throat  faith he said i thought i was murdered outright come mick let us drag him to the roadside  they did so and then with bent heads and slouched hats they made their way across country to another station where they would not be recognised as the two who had followed lord harry down the road  two mounted men of the constabulary rode along an hour later and found the body lying where it had been left  they searched the pockets they found a purse with a few sovereigns the portrait of a ladythe murdered mans wifea sealed envelope addressed to hugh mountjoy esq care of his london hotel and a cardcase nothing of any importance  it is lord harry norland said one the wild lordhe has met his end at last  the letter to iris was brief it said  farewell i am going to meet the death of one who is called a traitor to the cause i am the traitor of a cause far higher may the end that is already plotted for me be accepted as an atonement forgive me iris think of me as kindly as you can but i charge youit is my latest wordmourn not for one who has done his best to poison your life and to ruin your soul  in the other letter he said  i know the affection you have always entertained for iris she will tell you what she pleases about the past if she tells you nothing about her late husband think the worst and you will not be wrong remember that whatever she has done was done for me and at my instigation she ought to have married you instead of me  i am in the presence of death the men who are going to kill me are under this very roof they will kill me perhaps tonight perhaps they will wait for a quieter and a safer place but they will kill me  in the presence of death i rise superior to the pitiful jealousy with which i have always regarded you i now despise it i ask your pardon for it help iris to forget the action of her life of which she has most reason to be ashamed show that you forgive mewhen you have forgiven herand when you have helped her in the warmth and strength of your love to drive me out of your thoughts for ever  h n   epilogue  it is two years after the murder of lord harry norland the last event connected with this history  iris when she accepted hugh mountjoys offer of his scotch villa went there resolved to hide herself from the world too many people she thought knew her history and what she had done it was not likely that the directors of the insurance company would all hold their tongues about a scandal so very unusual even if they did not charge her with complicity as they could they would certainly tell the storyall the more readily since lord harrys murderof the conspiracy and its success she could never again she told herself be seen in the world  she was accompanied by her friend and maidthe woman whose fidelity to her had been so abundantly provedand by mrs vimpany who acted as housekeeper  after a decent interval hugh mountjoy joined her she was now a widow she understood very well what he wished to say and she anticipated him she informed him that nothing would ever induce her to become the wife of any other man after her degradation hugh received this intimation without a remark he remained in the neighbourhood however calling upon her frequently and offering no word of love but he became necessary to her the frequent visits became daily the afternoon visits were paid in the morning the visitor stayed all day when the time came for iris to yield and he left the house no more there seemed to be no change but still they continued their retired life and now i do not think they will ever change it again  their villa was situated on the north shore of the solway firth close to the outfall of the annan river but on the west bank opposite to the little town of annan at the back was a large garden the front looked out upon the stretch of sand at low tide and the water at high tide the house was provided with a good library iris attended to her garden walked on the sands read or worked they were a quiet household husband and wife talked little they walked about in the garden his arm about her waist or hand in hand the past if not forgotten was ceasing to trouble them it seemed a dreadful terrible dream it left its mark in a gentle melancholy which had never belonged to iris in the old days  and then happened the last event which the chronicler of this history has to relate  it began in the morning with a letter  mrs vimpany received it she knew the handwriting started and hid it quickly in her bosom as soon as she could get away to her own room she opened and read it  good and tender creaturei ascertained a good while ago thinking that probably i might have to make this kind of application to you where you were living and with whom it was not difficult i only had to connect you with mr hugh mountjoy and to find out where he lived i congratulate you on being so well able to take care of yourself you are probably settled for life in a comfortable home i feel as happy about it as if i had myself contributed to thus satisfactory result  i have no intention of making myself more disagreeable than i am obliged to do necessity however knows no law you will understand me when i tell you that i have spent all my money i do not regret the manner in which the money has been spent but the fact that it has all gone this it is which cuts me to the heart  i have also discovered that the late lamented lord harry whose death i myself have the greatest reasons to deplore played me a scurvy trick in regard to certain sums of money the amount for which he was insured was not less than 15000 pounds the amount as he stated it to me was only 4000 pounds in return for certain services rendered at a particular juncture i was to receive the half of the insurance money i only received 2000 pounds consequently there is still due to me the sum of 5500 pounds this is a large lump of money but mr mountjoy is i believe a wealthy man he will doubtless see the necessity of paying this money to me without further question or delay  you will therefore seek his presencehe is now i hear at home you may read to him any part of this letter that you please and you will let him know that i am in earnest a man with empty pockets cannot choose but be in earnest  he may very possibly object  very good in that case you will tell him that a fraud has been committed in connection with which i am prepared to make a full confession i consented on the death of my patient and at the earnest entreaty of lord harry norland to represent the dead man as his lordship i then went away resolving to have nothing more to do with the further villainy which i believe was carried on to the obtaining of the whole amount for which he was insured  the murder of lord harry immediately afterwards caused the company to drop their intended prosecution i shall reveal to them the present residence of his widow and shall place my evidence at their disposition whatever happens i shall make the facts of the case public this done nothing can hurt me while whether the public prosecutor intervenes or not neither mr hugh mountjoy nor his wife can ever show face to the world again  tell mr mountjoy i say whatever you please except that i am joking you must not tell him that i shall call tomorrow morning and shall expect to find the business as good as done  a v   mrs vimpany dropped the letter in dismay her husband had vanished out of her life for more than two years she hoped that she was effectually hidden she hoped that he had gone away to some faroff country where he would never more return alas this world of ours has no faroff country left and even if the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness so far as to go to the rocky mountains an express train and a swift boat will bring him back to his wickedness whenever he desires a little more enjoyment and the society of his old friends  mr vimpany was back again what should she do what would iris do what would mr mountjoy do  she read the letter again  two things were obvious first that he had no clue of the restitution and next that he had no idea of the evidence against him for the murder of the dane she resolved to communicate the latter fact only she was braver now than she had been formerly she saw more clearly that the way of the wicked man is not always so easy for him if he knew that his crime could be brought home to him that he would certainly be charged with murder if he dared to show himself or if he asked for money he would desist before such a danger the most hardened villain would shrink  she also understood that it was desirable to hide from him the nature of the evidence and the name of the only witness against him she would calmly tell him what would happen and bid him begone or take the consequences  yet even if he were driven off he would return she would live henceforth in continual apprehension of his return her tranquillity was gone  heavens that a man should have such power over the lives of others  she passed the most wretched day of her whole life she saw in anticipation the happiness of that household broken up she pictured his coming but she could not picture his departure for she had never seen him baffled and defeated  he would come in big burly with his farmerlike manner confident bullying masterful he would ask her what she had done he would swear at her when he learned that she had done nothing he would throw himself into the most comfortable chair stretch out his legs and order her to go and fetch mr mountjoy would she be subdued by him as of old would she find the courage to stand up to him for the sake of irisyes for the sake of the man who had been so kind to heryes  in the evening the two womenmrs vimpany and fannywere seated in the housekeepers room both had work in their laps neither was doing any work the autumnal day had been boisterous the wind was getting higher  what are you thinking of asked fanny  i was thinking of my husband if he were to come back fannyif he were to threaten  you would loose my tongueyou would let me speak  yes for her sake i would have shielded him onceif i could but not now i know at last that there is no single good thing left in him  you have heard from him i saw the letter this morning in the box i knew the handwriting i have been waiting for you to speak  hush yes fanny i have heard from him he wants money he will come here tomorrow morning and will threaten mr mountjoy keep your mistress in her own room persuade her to lie in bedanything  he does not know what i have seen charge him with the murder of the dane tell him said fanny her lips stiffening that if he dares to come againif he does not go awayhe shall be arrested for murder i will keep silence no longer  i willi am resolved oh who will rid us of this monster  outside the gale rose higherhigher still they heard it howling grinding branches together they heard the roaring and the rushing of the waters as the rising tide was driven over the shallow sands like a mountain reservoir at loose among the valleys below  in the midst of the tempest there came a sudden lull wind and water alike seemed hushed and out of the lull as if in answer to the womans question there came a loud crythe shriek of a man in deadly peril  the two women caught each other by the hand and rushed to the window they threw it open the tempest began again a fresh gust drove them back the waters roared the wind howled they heard the voice no more they closed the window and put up the shutters  it was long past midnight when they dared to go to bed one of them lay awake the whole night long in the roaring tempest she had seen an omen of the wrath of heaven about to fall once more upon her mistress  she was wrong the wrath of heaven fell upon one far more guilty  in the morning with the ebbing tide a dead body was found lashed to the posts of one of the standing nets in the solway it was recognised by hugh who went out to look at it and found it the body of vimpany  whether he was on his way back to annan or whether he intended to call at the villa that evening instead of next morning no one can tell his wife shed tears but they were tears of relief the man was buried as a stranger hugh kept his counsel mrs vimpany put the letter in the fire neither of them thought it wise to disturb the mind of iris by any mention of the man some days later however mrs vimpany came downstairs in a widows cap  to iriss look of interrogation she replied calmly yes i heard the other day he is dead is it not bettereven for him perhapsthat he should be dead he can do no more wickedness he can bring misery into no more households he is dead  iris made no reply betterbetter farthat he was dead but how she had been delivered from the man to what new dangers she had been exposed she knew not and will never know  she has one secretand only onewhich she keeps from her husband in her desk she preserves a lock of lord harrys hair why i know not blind love doth never wholly die    the end
