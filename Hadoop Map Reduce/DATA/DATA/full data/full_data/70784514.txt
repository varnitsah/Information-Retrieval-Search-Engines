royal family sate down to breakfast  this is valoroso xxiv king of paflagonia seated with his queen and only child at their royal breakfasttable and receiving the letter which announces to his majesty a proposed visit from prince bulbo heir of padella reigning king of crim tartary remark the delight upon the monarchs royal features he is so absorbed in the perusal of the king of crim tartarys letter that he allows his eggs to get cold and leaves his august muffins untasted  what that wicked brave delightful prince bulbo cries princess angelica so handsome so accomplished so wittythe conqueror of rimbombamento where he slew ten thousand giants  who told you of him my dear asks his majesty  a little bird says angelica  poor giglio says mamma pouring out the tea  bother giglio cries angelica tossing up her head which rustled with a thousand curlpapers  i wish growls the kingi wish giglio was    was better yes dear he is better says the queen angelicas little maid betsinda told me so when she came to my room this morning with my early tea  you are always drinking tea said the monarch with a scowl  it is better than drinking port or brandy and water replies her majesty  well well my dear i only said you were fond of drinking tea said the king of paflagonia with an effort as if to command his temper angelica i hope you have plenty of new dresses your milliners bills are long enough my dear queen you must see and have some parties i prefer dinners but of course you will be for balls your everlasting blue velvet quite tires me and my love i should like you to have a new necklace order one not more than a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand pounds  and giglio dear says the queen  giglio may go to the  oh sir screams her majesty your own nephew our late kings only son  giglio may go to the tailors and order the bills to be sent in to glumboso to pay confound him i mean bless his dear heart he need want for nothing give him a couple of guineas for pocketmoney my dear and you may as well order yourself bracelets while you are about the necklace mrs v  her majesty or mrs v as the monarch facetiously called her for even royalty will have its sport and this august family were very much attached embraced her husband and twining her arm round her daughters waist they quitted the breakfastroom in order to make all things ready for the princely stranger  when they were gone the smile that had lighted up the eyes of the husband and father fledthe pride of the king fledthe man was alone had i the pen of a g p r james i would describe valorosos torments in the choicest language in which i would also depict his flashing eye his distended nostrilhis dressinggown pockethandkerchief and boots but i need not say i have not the pen of that novelist suffice it to say valoroso was alone  he rushed to the cupboard seizing from the table one of the many eggcups with which his princely board was served for the matin meal drew out a bottle of right nantz or cognac filled and emptied the cup several times and laid it down with a hoarse ha ha ha now valoroso is a man again  but oh he went on still sipping i am sorry to say ere i was a king i needed not this intoxicating draught once i detested the hot brandy wine and quaffed no other fount but natures rill it dashes not more quickly oer the rocks than i did as with blunderbuss in hand i brushed away the early morning dew and shot the partridge snipe or antlered deer ah well may englands dramatist remark uneasy lies the head that wears a crown why did i steal my nephews my young giglios steal said i no no no not steal not steal let me withdraw that odious expression i took and on my manly head i set the royal crown of paflagonia i took and with my royal arm i wield the sceptral rod of paflagonia i took and in my outstretched hand i hold the royal orb of paflagonia could a poor boy a snivelling drivelling boywas in his nurses arms but yesterday and cried for sugarplums and puled for papbear up the awful weight of crown orb sceptre gird on the sword my royal fathers wore and meet in fight the tough crimean foe  and then the monarch went on to argue in his own mind though we need not say that blank verse is not argument that what he had got it was his duty to keep and that if at one time he had entertained ideas of a certain restitution which shall be nameless the prospect by a certain marriage of uniting two crowns and two nations which had been engaged in bloody and expensive wars as the paflagonians and the crimeans had been put the idea of giglios restoration to the throne out of the question nay were his own brother king savio alive he would certainly will the crown from his own son in order to bring about such a desirable union  thus easily do we deceive ourselves thus do we fancy what we wish is right the king took courage read the papers finished his muffins and eggs and rang the bell for his prime minister the queen after thinking whether she should go up and see giglio who had been sick thought not now business first pleasure afterwards i will go and see dear giglio this afternoon and now i will drive to the jewellers to look for the necklace and bracelets the princess went up into her own room and made betsinda her maid bring out all her dresses and as for giglio they forgot him as much as i forget what i had for dinner last tuesday twelvemonth     ii how king valoroso got the crown and prince giglio went without  paflagonia ten or twenty thousand years ago appears to have been one of those kingdoms where the laws of succession were not settled for when king savio died leaving his brother regent of the kingdom and guardian of savios orphan infant this unfaithful regent took no sort of regard of the late monarchs will had himself proclaimed sovereign of paflagonia under the title of king valoroso xxiv had a most splendid coronation and ordered all the nobles of the kingdom to pay him homage so long as valoroso gave them plenty of balls at court plenty of money and lucrative places the paflagonian nobility did not care who was king and as for the people in those early times they were equally indifferent the prince giglio by reason of his tender age at his royal fathers death did not feel the loss of his crown and empire as long as he had plenty of toys and sweetmeats a holiday five times a week and a horse and gun to go out shooting when he grew a little older and above all the company of his darling cousin the kings only child poor giglio was perfectly contented nor did he envy his uncle the royal robes and sceptre the great hot uncomfortable throne of state and the enormous cumbersome crown in which that monarch appeared from morning till night king valorosos portrait has been left to us and i think you will agree with me that he must have been sometimes rather tired of his velvet and his diamonds and his ermine and his grandeur i shouldnt like to sit in that stifling robe with such a thing as that on my head  no doubt the queen must have been lovely in her youth for though she grew rather stout in after life yet her features as shown in her portrait are certainly pleasing if she was fond of flattery scandal cards and fine clothes let us deal gently with her infirmities which after all may be no greater than our own she was kind to her nephew and if she had any scruples of conscience about her husbands taking the young princes crown consoled herself by thinking that the king though a usurper was a most respectable man and that at his death prince giglio would be restored to his throne and share it with his cousin whom he loved so fondly  the prime minister was glumboso an old statesman who most cheerfully swore fidelity to king valoroso and in whose hands the monarch left all the affairs of his kingdom all valoroso wanted was plenty of money plenty of hunting plenty of flattery and as little trouble as possible as long as he had his sport this monarch cared little how his people paid for it he engaged in some wars and of course the paflagonian newspapers announced that he had gained prodigious victories he had statues erected to himself in every city of the empire and of course his pictures placed everywhere and in all the printshops he was valoroso the magnanimous valoroso the victorious valoroso the great and so forthfor even in these early times courtiers and people knew how to flatter  this royal pair had one only child the princess angelica who you may be sure was a paragon in the courtiers eyes in her parents and in her own it was said she had the longest hair the largest eyes the slimmest waist the smallest foot and the most lovely complexion of any young lady in the paflagonian dominions her accomplishments were announced to be even superior to her beauty and governesses used to shame their idle pupils by telling them what princess angelica could do she could play the most difficult pieces of music at sight she could answer any one of mangnalls questions she knew every date in the history of paflagonia and every other country she knew french english italian german spanish hebrew greek latin cappadocian samothracian aegean and crim tartar in a word she was a most accomplished young creature and her governess and ladyinwaiting was the severe countess gruffanuff   would you not fancy from this picture that gruffanuff must have been a person of highest birth she looks so haughty that i should have thought her a princess at the very least with a pedigree reaching as far back as the deluge but this lady was no better born than many other ladies who give themselves airs and all sensible people laughed at her absurd pretensions the fact is she had been maidservant to the queen when her majesty was only princess and her husband had been head footman but after his death or disappearance of which you shall hear presently this mrs gruffanuff by flattering toadying and wheedling her royal mistress became a favourite with the queen who was rather a weak woman and her majesty gave her a title and made her nursery governess to the princess  and now i must tell you about the princesss learning and accomplishments for which she had such a wonderful character clever angelica certainly was but as idle as possible play at sight indeed she could play one or two pieces and pretend that she had never seen them before she could answer half a dozen mangnalls questions but then you must take care to ask the right ones as for her languages she had masters in plenty but i doubt whether she knew more than a few phrases in each for all her presence and as for her embroidery and her drawing she showed beautiful specimens it is true but who did them  this obliges me to tell the truth and to do so i must go back ever so far and tell you about the fairy blackstick     iii tells who the fairy blackstick was and who were ever so many grand personages besides  between the kingdoms of paflagonia and crim tartary there lived a mysterious personage who was known in those countries as the fairy blackstick from the ebony wand or crutch which she carried on which she rode to the moon sometimes or upon other excursions of business or pleasure and with which she performed her wonders  when she was young and had been first taught the art of conjuring by the necromancer her father she was always practicing her skill whizzing about from one kingdom to another upon her black stick and conferring her fairy favours upon this prince or that she had scores of royal godchildren turned numberless wicked people into beasts birds millstones clocks pumps boot jacks umbrellas or other absurd shapes and in a word was one of the most active and officious of the whole college of fairies  but after two or three thousand years of this sport i suppose blackstick grew tired of it or perhaps she thought what good am i doing by sending this princess to sleep for a hundred years by fixing a black pudding on to that boobys nose by causing diamonds and pearls to drop from one little girls mouth and vipers and toads from anothers i begin to think i do as much harm as good by my performances i might as well shut my incantations up and allow things to take their natural course  there were my two young goddaughters king savios wife and duke padellas wife i gave them each a present which was to render them charming in the eyes of their husbands and secure the affection of those gentlemen as long as they lived what good did my rose and my ring do these two women none on earth from having all their whims indulged by their husbands they became capricious lazy illhumoured absurdly vain and leered and languished and fancied themselves irresistibly beautiful when they were really quite old and hideous the ridiculous creatures they used actually to patronise me when i went to pay them a visitme the fairy blackstick who knows all the wisdom of the necromancers and could have turned them into baboons and all their diamonds into strings of onions by a single wave of my rod so she locked up her books in her cupboard declined further magical performances and scarcely used her wand at all except as a cane to walk about with  so when duke padellas lady had a little son the duke was at that time only one of the principal noblemen in crim tartary blackstick although invited to the christening would not so much as attend but merely sent her compliments and a silver papboat for the baby which was really not worth a couple of guineas about the same time the queen of paflagonia presented his majesty with a son and heir and guns were fired the capital illuminated and no end of feasts ordained to celebrate the young princes birth it was thought the fairy who was asked to be his godmother would at least have presented him with an invisible jacket a flying horse a fortunatuss purse or some other valuable token of her favour but instead blackstick went up to the cradle of the child giglio when everybody was admiring him and complimenting his royal papa and mamma and said my poor child the best thing i can send you is a little misfortune and this was all she would utter to the disgust of giglios parents who died very soon after when giglios uncle took the throne as we read in chapter i  in like manner when cavolfiore king of crim tartary had a christening of his only child rosalba the fairy blackstick who had been invited was not more gracious than in prince giglios case whilst everybody was expatiating over the beauty of the darling child and congratulating its parents the fairy blackstick looked very sadly at the baby and its mother and said my good woman for the fairy was very familiar and no more minded a queen than a washerwomanmy good woman these people who are following you will be the first to turn against you and as for this little lady the best thing i can wish her is a little misfortune so she touched rosalba with her black wand looked severely at the courtiers motioned the queen an adieu with her hand and sailed slowly up into the air out of the window  when she was gone the court people who had been awed and silent in her presence began to speak what an odious fairy she is they saida pretty fairy indeed why she went to the king of paflagonias christening and pretended to do all sorts of things for that family and what has happenedthe prince her godson has been turned off his throne by his uncle would we allow our sweet princess to be deprived of her rights by any enemy never never never never  and they all shouted in a chorus never never never never  now i should like to know and how did these fine courtiers show their fidelity one of king cavolfiores vassals the duke padella just mentioned rebelled against the king who went out to chastise his rebellious subject any one rebel against our beloved and august monarch cried the courtiers any one resist him pooh he is invincible irresistible he will bring home padella a prisoner and tie him to a donkeys tail and drive him round the town saying this is the way the great cavolfiore treats rebels  the king went forth to vanquish padella and the poor queen who was a very timid anxious creature grew so frightened and ill that i am sorry to say she died leaving injunctions with her ladies to take care of the dear little rosalbaof course they said they would of course they vowed they would die rather than any harm should happen to the princess at first the crim tartar court journal stated that the king was obtaining great victories over the audacious rebel then it was announced that the troops of the infamous padella were in flight then it was said that the royal army would soon come up with the enemy and thenthen the news came that king cavolfiore was vanquished and slain by his majesty king padella the first  at this news half the courtiers ran off to pay their duty to the conquering chief and the other half ran away laying hands on all the best articles in the palace and poor little rosalba was left there quite alonequite alone and she toddled from one room to another crying countess duchess only she said tountess duttess not being able to speak plain bring me my mutton sop my royal highness hungy tountess duttess and she went from the private apartments into the throneroom and nobody was thereand thence into the ballroom and nobody was thereand thence into the pages room and nobody was thereand she toddled down the great staircase into the hall and nobody was thereand the door was open and she went into the court and into the garden and thence into the wilderness and thence into the forest where the wild beasts live and was never heard of any more  a piece of her torn mantle and one of her shoes were found in the wood in the mouths of two lionesses cubs whom king padella and a royal hunting party shotfor he was king now and reigned over crim tartary so the poor little princess is done for said he well whats done cant be helped gentlemen let us go to luncheon and one of the courtiers took up the shoe and put it in his pocket and there was an end of rosalba     iv how blackstick was not asked to the princess angelicas christening  when the princess angelica was born her parents not only did not ask the fairy blackstick to the christening party but gave orders to their porter absolutely to refuse her if she called this porters name was gruffanuff and he had been selected for the post by their royal highnesses because he was a very tall fierce man who could say not at home to a tradesman or an unwelcome visitor with a rudeness which frightened most such persons away he was the husband of that countess whose picture we have just seen and as long as they were together they quarrelled from morning till night now this fellow tried his rudeness once too often as you shall hear for the fairy blackstick coming to call upon the prince and princess who were actually sitting at the open drawingroom window gruffanuff not only denied them but made the most odious vulgar sign as he was going to slam the door in the fairys face git away hold blackstick said he i tell you master and missis aint at home to you and he was as we have said going to slam the door  but the fairy with her wand prevented the door being shut and gruffanuff came out again in a fury swearing in the most abominable way and asking the fairy whether she thought he was a going to stay at that there door hall day  you are going to stay at that door all day and all night and for many a long year the fairy said very majestically and gruffanuff coming out of the door straddling before it with his great calves burst out laughing and cried ha ha ha this is a good un haahwhats this let me downoohm and then he was dumb  for as the fairy waved her wand over him he felt himself rising off the ground and fluttering up against the door and then as if a screw ran into his stomach he felt a dreadful pain there and was pinned to the door and then his arms flew up over his head and his legs after writhing about wildly twisted under his body and he felt cold cold growing over him as if he was turning into metal and he said oohm and could say no more because he was dumb  he was turned into metal he was from being brazen brass he was neither more nor less than a knocker and there he was nailed to the door in the blazing summer day till he burned almost redhot and there he was nailed to the door all the bitter winter nights till his brass nose was dropping with icicles and the postman came and rapped at him and the vulgarest boy with a letter came and hit him up against the door and the king and queen princess and prince they were then coming home from a walk that evening the king said hullo my dear you have had a new knocker put on the door why its rather like our porter in the face what has become of that boozy vagabond and the housemaid came and scrubbed his nose with sandpaper and once when the princess angelicas little sister was born he was tied up in an old kid glove and another night some larking young men tried to wrench him off and put him to the most excruciating agony with a turn screw and then the queen had a fancy to have the colour of the door altered and the painters dabbed him over the mouth and eyes and nearly choked him as they painted him peagreen i warrant he had leisure to repent of having been rude to the fairy blackstick  as for his wife she did not miss him and as he was always guzzling beer at the publichouse and notoriously quarrelling with his wife and in debt to the tradesmen it was supposed he had run away from all these evils and emigrated to australia or america and when the prince and princess chose to become king and queen they left their old house and nobody thought of the porter any more     v how princess angelica took a little maid  one day when the princess angelica was quite a little girl she was walking in the garden of the palace with mrs gruffanuff the governess holding a parasol over her head to keep her sweet complexion from the freckles and angelica was carrying a bun to feed the swans and ducks in the royal pond  they had not reached the duckpond when there came toddling up to them such a funny little girl she had a great quantity of hair blowing about her chubby little cheeks and looked as if she had not been washed or combed for ever so long she wore a ragged bit of a cloak and had only one shoe on  you little wretch who let you in here asked mrs gruffanuff  div me dat bun said the little girl me vely hungy  hungry what is that asked princess angelica and gave the child the bun  oh princess says mrs gruffanuff how good how kind how truly angelical you are see your majesties she said to the king and queen who now came up along with their nephew prince giglio how kind the princess is she met this little dirty wretch in the gardeni cant tell how she came in here or why the guards did not shoot her dead at the gateand the dear darling of a princess has given her the whole of her bun  i didnt want it said angelical  but you are a darling little angel all the same says the governess  yes i know i am said angelical dirty little girl dont you think i am very pretty indeed she had on the finest of little dresses and hats and as her hair was carefully curled she really looked very well  oh pooty pooty says the little girl capering about laughing and dancing and munching her bun and as she ate it she began to sing oh what fun to have a plum bun how i wis it never was done at which and her funny accent angelica giglio and the king and queen began to laugh very merrily  i can dance as well as sing says the little girl i can dance and i can sing and i can do all sorts of ting and she ran to a flowerbed and pulling a few polyanthuses rhododendrons and other flowers made herself a little wreath and danced before the king and queen so drolly and prettily that everybody was delighted  who was your motherwho were your relations little girl said the queen  the little girl said little lion was my brudder great big lioness my mudder neber heard of any udder and she capered away on her one shoe and everybody was exceedingly diverted  so angelica said to the queen mamma my parrot flew away yesterday out of its cage and i dont care any more for any of my toys and i think this funny little dirty child will amuse me i will take her home and give her some of my old frocks  oh the generous darling says mrs gruffanuff  which i have worn ever so many times and am quite tired of angelica went on and she shall be my little maid will you come home with me little dirty girl  the child clapped her hands and said go home with youyes you pooty princesshave a nice dinner and wear a new dress  and they all laughed again and took home the child to the palace where when she was washed and combed and had one of the princesss frocks given to her she looked as handsome as angelica almost not that angelica ever thought so for this little lady never imagined that anybody in the world could be as pretty as good or as clever as herself in order that the little girl should not become too proud and conceited mrs gruffanuff took her old ragged mantle and one shoe and put them into a glass box with a card laid upon them upon which was written these were the old clothes in which little betsinda was found when the great goodness and admirable kindness of her royal highness the princess angelica received this little outcast and the date was added and the box locked up  for a while little betsinda was a great favourite with the princess and she danced and sang and made her little rhymes to amuse her mistress but then the princess got a monkey and afterwards a little dog and afterwards a doll and did not care for betsinda any more who became very melancholy and quiet and sang no more funny songs because nobody cared to hear her and then as she grew older she was made a little ladysmaid to the princess and though she had no wages she worked and mended and put angelicas hair in papers and was never cross when scolded and was always eager to please her mistress and was always up early and to bed late and at hand when wanted and in fact became a perfect little maid so the two girls grew up and when the princess came out betsinda was never tired of waiting on her and made her dresses better than the best milliner and was useful in a hundred ways whilst the princess was having her masters betsinda would sit and watch them and in this way she picked up a great deal of learn ing for she was always awake though her mistress was not and listened to the wise professors when angelica was yawning or thinking of the next ball and when the dancingmaster came betsinda learned along with angelica and when the musicmaster came she watched him and practiced the princesss pieces when angelica was away at balls and parties and when the drawingmaster came she took note of all he said and did and the same with french italian and all other languagesshe learned them from the teacher who came to angelica when the princess was going out of an evening she would say my good betsinda you may as well finish what i have begun yes miss betsinda would say and sit down very cheerful not to finish what angelica began but to do it  for instance the princess would begin a head of a warrior let us say and when it was begun it was something like this  but when it was done the warrior was like this  only handsomer still if possible and the princess put her name to the drawing and the court and king and queen and above all poor giglio admired the picture of all things and said was there ever a genius like angelica so i am sorry to say was it with the princesss embroidery and other accomplishments and angelica actually believed that she did these things herself and received all the flattery of the court as if every word of it was true thus she began to think that there was no young woman in all the world equal to herself and that no young man was good enough for her as for betsinda as she heard none of these praises she was not puffed up by them and being a most grateful goodnatured girl she was only too anxious to do everything which might give her mistress pleasure now you begin to perceive that angelica had faults of her own and was by no means such a wonder of wonders as people represented her royal highness to be     vi how prince giglio behaved himself  and now let us speak about prince giglio the nephew of the reigning monarch of paflagonia it has already been stated in page seven that as long as he had a smart coat to wear a good horse to ride and money in his pocket or rather to take out of his pocket for he was very goodnatured my young prince did not care for the loss of his crown and sceptre being a thoughtless youth not much inclined to politics or any kind of learning so his tutor had a sinecure giglio would not learn classics or mathematics and the lord chancellor of paflagonia squaretoso pulled a very long face because the prince could not be got to study the paflagonian laws and constitution but on the other hand the kings gamekeepers and huntsmen found the prince an apt pupil the dancingmaster pronounced that he was a most elegant and assiduous scholar the first lord of the billiard table gave the most flattering reports of the princes skill so did the groom of the tennis court and as for the captain of the guard and fencing master the valiant and veteran count kutasoff hedzoff he avowed that since he ran the general of crim tartary the dreadful grumbuskin through the body he never had encountered so expert a swordsman as prince giglio  i hope you do not imagine that there was any impropriety in the prince and princess walking together in the palace garden and because giglio kissed angelicas hand in a polite manner in the first place they are cousins next the queen is walking in the garden too you cannot see her for she happens to be behind that tree and her majesty always wished that angelica and giglio should marry so did giglio so did angelica sometimes for she thought her cousin very handsome brave and goodnatured but then you know she was so clever and knew so many things and poor giglio knew nothing and had no conversation when they looked at the stars what did giglio know of the heavenly bodies once when on a sweet night in a balcony where they were standing angelica said there is the bear where says giglio dont be afraid angelica if a dozen bears come i will kill them rather than they shall hurt you oh you silly creature says she you are very good but you are not very wise when they looked at the flowers giglio was utterly unacquainted with botany and had never heard of linnaeus when the butterflies passed giglio knew nothing about them being as ignorant of entomology as i am of algebra so you see angelica though she liked giglio pretty well despised him on account of his ignorance i think she probably valued her own learning rather too much but to think too well of ones self is the fault of people of all ages and both sexes finally when nobody else was there angelica liked her cousin well enough  king valoroso was very delicate in health and withal so fond of good dinners which were prepared for him by his french cook marmitonio that it was supposed he could not live long now the idea of anything happening to the king struck the artful prime minister and the designing old ladyinwaiting with terror for thought glumboso and the countess when prince giglio marries his cousin and comes to the throne what a pretty position we shall be in whom he dislikes and who have always been unkind to him we shall lose our places in a trice mrs gruffanuff will have to give up all the jewels laces snuffboxes rings and watches which belonged to the queen giglios mother and glumboso will be forced to refund two hundred and seventeen thousand millions nine hundred and eightyseven thousand four hundred and thirtynine pounds thirteen shillings and sixpence halfpenny money left to prince giglio by his poor dear father  so the lady of honour and the prime minister hated giglio because they had done him a wrong and these unprincipled people invented a hundred cruel stories about poor giglio in order to influence the king queen and princess against him how he was so ignorant that he could not spell the commonest words and actually wrote valoroso valloroso and spelt angelica with two ls how he drank a great deal too much wine at dinner and was always idling in the stables with the grooms how he owed ever so much money at the pastrycooks and the haberdashers how he used to go to sleep at church how he was fond of playing cards with the pages so did the queen like playing cards so did the king go to sleep at church and eat and drink too much and if giglio owed a trifle for tarts who owed him two hundred and seventeen thousand millions nine hundred and eightyseven thousand four hundred and thirtynine pounds thirteen shillings and sixpence halfpenny i should like to know detractors and talebearers in my humble opinion had much better look at home all this backbiting and slandering had effect upon princess angelica who began to look coldly on her cousin then to laugh at him and scorn him for being so stupid then to sneer at him for having vulgar associates and at court balls dinners and so forth to treat him so unkindly that poor giglio became quite ill took to his bed and sent for the doctor  his majesty king valoroso as we have seen had his own reasons for disliking his nephew and as for those innocent readers who ask whyi beg with the permission of their dear parents to refer them to shakespeares pages where they will read why king john disliked prince arthur with the queen his royal but weakminded aunt when giglio was out of sight he was out of mind while she had her whist and her evening parties she cared for little else  i dare say two villains who shall be nameless wished doctor pildrafto the court physician had killed giglio right out but he only bled and physicked him so severely that the prince was kept to his room for several months and grew as thin as a post  whilst he was lying sick in this way there came to the court of paflagonia a famous painter whose name was tomaso lorenzo and who was painter in ordinary to the king of crim tartary paflagonias neighbour tomaso lorenzo painted all the court who were delighted with his works for even countess gruffanuff looked young and glumboso goodhumoured in his pictures he flatters very much some people said nay says princess angelica i am above flattery and i think he did not make my picture handsome enough i cant bear to hear a man of genius unjustly cried down and i hope my dear papa will make lorenzo a knight of his order of the cucumber  the princess angelica although the courtiers vowed her royal highness could draw so beautifully that the idea of her taking lessons was absurd yet chose to have lorenzo for a teacher and it was wonderful as long as she painted in his studio what beautiful pictures she made some of the performances were engraved for the book of beauty others were sold for enormous sums at charity bazaars she wrote the signatures under the drawings no doubt but i think i know whodid the picturesthis artful painter who had come with other designs on angelica than merely to teach her to draw  one day lorenzo showed the princess a portrait of a young man in armour with fair hair and the loveliest blue eyes and an expression at once melancholy and interesting  dear signor lorenzo who is this asked the princess  i never saw anyone so handsome says countess gruffanuff the old humbug  that said the painter that madam is the portrait of my august young master his royal highness bulbo crown prince of crim tartary duke of acroceraunia marquis of poluphloisboio and knight grand cross of the order of the pumpkin that is the order of the pumpkin glittering on his manly breast and received by his royal highness from his august father his majesty king padella i for his gallantry at the battle of rimbombamento when he slew with his own princely hand the king of ograria and two hundred and eleven giants of the two hundred and eighteen who formed the kings bodyguard the remainder were destroyed by the brave crim tartar army after an obstinate combat in which the crim tartars suffered severely  what a prince thought angelica so braveso calmlookingso youngwhat a hero  he is as accomplished as he is brave continued the court painter he knows all languages perfectly sings deliciously plays every instrument composes operas which have been acted a thousand nights running at the imperial theatre of crim tartary and danced in a ballet there before the king and queen in which he looked so beautiful that his cousin the lovely daughter of the king of circassia died for love of him  why did he not marry the poor princess asked angelica with a sigh  because they were first cousins madam and the clergy forbid these unions said the painter and besides the young prince had given his royal heart elsewhere  and to whom asked her royal highness  i am not at liberty to mention the princesss name answered the painter  but you may tell me the first letter of it gasped out the princess  that your royal highness is at liberty to guess said lorenzo  does it begin with a z asked angelica  the painter said it wasnt a z then she tried a y then an x then a w and went so backwards through almost the whole alphabet  when she came to d and it wasnt d she grew very excited when she came to c and it wasnt c she was still more nervous when she came to b and it wasnt b o dearest gruffanuff she said lend me your smellingbottle and hiding her head in the countesss shoulder she faintly whispered ah signor can it be a  it was a and though i may not by my royal masters orders tell your royal highness the princesss name whom he fondly madly devotedly rapturously loves i may show you her portrait says this slyboots and leading the princess up to a gilt frame he drew a curtain which was before it  o goodness the frame contained a lookingglass and angelica saw her own face     vii how giglio and angelica had a quarrel  the court painter of his majesty the king of crim tartary returned to that monarchs dominions carrying away a number of sketches which he had made in the paflagonian capital you know of course my dears that the name of that capital is blombodinga but the most charming of all his pieces was a portrait of the princess angelica which all the crim tartar nobles came to see with this work the king was so delighted that he decorated the painter with his order of the pumpkin sixth class and the artist became sir tomaso lorenzo kp thenceforth  king valoroso also sent sir tomaso his order of the cucumber besides a handsome order for money for he painted the king queen and principal nobility while at blombodinga and became all the fashion to the perfect rage of all the artists in paflagonia where the king used to point to the portrait of prince bulbo which sir tomaso had left behind him and say which among you can paint a picture like that  it hung in the royal parlour over the royal sideboard and princess angelica could always look at it as she sat making the tea each day it seemed to grow handsomer and handsomer and the princess grew so fond of looking at it that she would often spill the tea over the cloth at which her father and mother would wink and wag their heads and say to each other aha we see how things are going  in the meantime poor giglio lay upstairs very sick in his chamber though he took all the doctors horrible medicines like a good young lad as i hope you do my dears when you are ill and mamma sends for the medical man and the only person who visited giglio besides his friend the captain of the guard who was almost always busy or on parade was little betsinda the housemaid who used to do his bedroom and sittingroom out bring him his gruel and warm his bed  when the little housemaid came to him in the morning and evening prince giglio used to say betsinda betsinda how is the princess angelica  and betsinda used to answer the princess is very well thank you my lord and giglio would heave a sigh and think if angelica were sick i am sure i should not be very well  then giglio would say betsinda has the princess angelica asked for me today and betsinda would answer no my lord not today or she was very busy practicing the piano when i saw her or she was writing invitations for an evening party and did not speak to me or make some excuse or other not strictly consonant with truth for betsinda was such a goodnatured creature that she strove to do everything to prevent annoyance to prince giglio and even brought him up roast chicken and jellies from the kitchen when the doctor allowed them and giglio was getting better saying that the princess had made the jelly or the breadsauce with her own hands on purpose for giglio  when giglio heard this he took heart and began to mend immediately and gobbled up all the jelly and picked the last bone of the chickendrumsticks merrythought sidesbones back popes nose and allthanking his dear angelica and he felt so much better the next day that he dressed and went downstairs where whom should he meet but angelica going into the drawingroom all the covers were off the chairs the chandeliers taken out of the bags the damask curtains uncovered the work and things carried away and the handsomest albums on the tables angelica had her hair in papers in a word it was evident there was going to be a party  heavens giglio cries angelica you here in such a dress what a figure you are  yes dear angelica i am come downstairs and feel so well today thanks to the fowl and the jelly  what do i know about fowls and jellies that you allude to them in that rude way says angelica  why didntdidnt you send them angelica dear says giglio  i send them indeed angelica dear no giglio dear says she mocking him i was engaged in getting the rooms ready for his royal highness the prince of crim tartary who is coming to pay my papas court a visit  theprinceofcrimtartary giglio said aghast  yes the prince of crim tartary says angelica mocking him i dare say you never heard of such a country what did you ever hear of you dont know whether crim tartary is on the red sea or on the black sea i dare say  yes i do its on the red sea says giglio at which the princess burst out laughing at him and said oh you ninny you are so ignorant you are really not fit for society you know nothing but about horses and dogs and are only fit to dine in a messroom with my royal fathers heaviest dragoons dont look so surprised at me sir go and put your best clothes on to receive the prince and let me get the drawingroom ready  giglio said oh angelica angelica i didnt think this of you this wasnt your language to me when you gave me this ring and i gave you mine in the garden and you gave me that k  but what k was we never shall know for angelica in a rage cried get out you saucy rude creature how dare you to remind me of your rudeness as for your little trumpery twopenny ring there sir there and she flung it out of the window  it was my mothers marriagering cried giglio  i dont care whose marriagering it was cries angelica marry the person who picks it up if shes a woman you shant marry me and give me back my ring ive no patience with people who boast about the things they give away i know wholl give me much finer things than you ever gave me a beggarly ring indeed not worth five shillings  now angelica little knew that the ring which giglio had given her was a fairy ring if a man wore it it made all the women in love with him if a woman all the gentlemen the queen giglios mother quite an ordinarylooking person was admired immensely whilst she wore this ring and her husband was frantic when she was ill but when she called her little giglio to her and put the ring on his finger king savio did not seem to care for his wife so much any more but transferred all his love to little giglio so did everybody love him as long as he had the ring but when as quite a child he gave it to angelica people began to love and admire her and giglio as the saying is played only second fiddle  yes says angelica going on in her foolish ungrateful way i know wholl give me much finer things than your beggarly little pearl nonsense  very good miss you may take back your ring too says giglio his eyes flashing fire at her and then as his eyes had been suddenly opened he cried out ha what does this mean is this the woman i have been in love with all my life have i been such a ninny as to throw away my regard upon you whyactuallyyesyou are a little crooked  oh you wretch cries angelica  and upon my conscience youyou squint a little  eh cries angelica  and your hair is redand you are marked with the smallpoxand what you have three false teethand one leg shorter than the other  you brute you brute you angelica screamed out and as she seized the ring with one hand she dealt giglio one two three smacks on the face and would have pulled the hair off his head had he not started laughing and crying  oh dear me angelica dont pull out my hair it hurts you might remove a great deal of your own as i perceive without scissors or pulling at all oh ho ho ha ha ha ho he he  and he nearly choked himself with laughing and she with rage when with a low bow and dressed in his court habit count gambabella the first lordinwaiting entered and said royal highnesses their majesties expect you in the pink throneroom where they await the arrival of the prince of crim tartary     viii how gruffanuff picked the fairy ring up and prince bulbo came to court  prince bulbos arrival had set all the court in a flutter everybody was ordered to put his or her best clothes on the footmen had their gala liveries the lord chancellor his new wig the guards their last new tunics and countess gruffanuff you may be sure was glad of an opportunity of decorating her old person with her finest things she was walking through the court of the palace on her way to wait upon their majesties when she espied something glittering on the pavement and bade the boy in buttons who was holding up her train to go and pick up the article shining yonder he was an ugly little wretch in some of the late groomporters old clothes cut down and much too tight for him and yet when he had taken up the ring as it turned out to be and was carrying it to his mistress she thought he looked like a little cupid he gave the ring to her it was a trumpery little thing enough but too small for any of her old knuckles so she put it into her pocket  oh mum says the boy looking at her howhow beyoutiful you do look mum today mum  and you too jacky she was going to say but looking down at himno he was no longer goodlooking at allbut only the carrotyhaired little jacky of the morning however praise is welcome from the ugliest of men or boys and gruffanuff bidding the boy hold up her train walked on in high goodhumour the guards saluted her with peculiar respect captain hedzoff in the anteroom said my dear madam you look like an angel today and so bowing and smirking gruffanuff went in and took her place behind her royal master and mistress who were in the throneroom awaiting the prince of crim tartary princess angelica sat at their feet and behind the kings chair stood prince giglio looking very savage  the prince of crim tartary made his appearance attended by baron sleibootz his chamberlain and followed by a black page carrying the most beautiful crown you ever saw he was dressed in his travelling costume and his hair as you see was a little in disorder i have ridden three hundred miles since breakfast said he so eager was i to behold the printhe court and august family of paflagonia and i could not wait one minute before appearing in your majesties presences  giglio from behind the throne burst out into a roar of contemptuous laughter but all the royal party in fact were so flurried that they did not hear this little outbreak your r h is welcome in any dress says the king glumboso a chair for his royal highness  any dress his royal highness wears is a court dress says princess angelica smiling graciously  ah but you should see my other clothes said the prince i should have had them on but that stupid carrier has not brought them whos that laughing  it was giglio laughing i was laughing he said because you said just now that you were in such a hurry to see the princess that you could not wait to change your dress and now you say you come in those clothes because you have no others  and who are you says prince bulbo very fiercely  my father was king of this country and i am his only son prince replies giglio with equal haughtiness  ha said the king and glumboso looking very flurried but the former collecting himself said dear prince bulbo i forgot to introduce to your royal highness my dear nephew his royal highness prince giglio know each other embrace each other giglio give his royal highness your hand and giglio giving his hand squeezed poor bulbos until the tears ran out of his eyes glumboso now brought a chair for the royal visitor and placed it on the platform on which the king queen and prince were seated but the chair was on the edge of the platform and as bulbo sat down it toppled over and he with it rolling over and over and bellowing like a bull giglio roared still louder at this disaster but it was with laughter so did all the court when prince bulbo got up for though when he entered the room he appeared not very ridiculous as he stood up from his fall for a moment he looked so exceedingly plain and foolish that nobody could help laughing at him when he had entered the room he was observed to carry a rose in his hand which fell out of it as he tumbled  my rose my rose cried bulbo and his chamberlain dashed forwards and picked it up and gave it to the prince who put it in his waistcoat then people wondered why they had laughed there was nothing particularly ridiculous in him he was rather short rather stout rather redhaired but in fine for a prince not so bad  so they sat and talked the royal personages together the crim tartar officers with those of paflagoniagiglio very comfortable with gruffanuff behind the throne he looked at her with such tender eyes that her heart was all in a flutter oh dear prince she said how could you speak so haughtily in presence of their majesties i protest i thought i should have fainted  i should have caught you in my arms said giglio looking raptures  why were you so cruel to prince bulbo dear prince says gruff   because i hate him says gil  you are jealous of him and still love poor angelica cries gruffanuff putting her handkerchief to her eyes  i did but i love her no more giglio cried i despise her were she heiress to twenty thousand thrones i would despise her and scorn her but why speak of thrones i have lost mine i am too weak to recover iti am alone and have no friend  oh say not so dear prince says gruffanuff  besides says he i am so happy here behind the throne that i would not change my place no not for the throne of the world  what are you two people chattering about there says the queen who was rather goodnatured though not overburthened with wisdom it is time to dress for dinner giglio show prince bulbo to his room prince if your clothes have not come we shall be very happy to see you as you are but when prince bulbo got to his bedroom his luggage was there and unpacked and the hairdresser coming in cut and curled him entirely to his own satisfaction and when the dinnerbell rang the royal company had not to wait above fiveandtwenty minutes until bulbo appeared during which time the king who could not bear to wait grew as sulky as possible as for giglio he never left madam gruffanuff all this time but stood with her in the embrasure of a window paying her compliments at length the groom of the chambers announced his royal highness the prince of crim tartary and the noble company went into the royal diningroom it was quite a small party only the king and queen the princess whom bulbo took out the two princes countess gruffanuff glumboso the prime minister and prince bulbos chamberlain you may be sure they had a very good dinnerlet every boy or girl think of what he or she likes best and fancy it on the table       here a very pretty game may be played by all the children      saying what they like best for dinner  the princess talked incessantly all dinnertime to the prince of crimea who ate an immense deal too much and never took his eyes off his plate except when giglio who was carving a goose sent a quantity of stuffing and onion sauce into one of them giglio only burst out alaughing as the crimean prince wiped his shirtfront and face with his scented pockethandkerchief he did not make prince bulbo any apology when the prince looked at him giglio would not look that way when prince bulbo said prince giglio may i have the honour of taking a glass of wine with you giglio wouldnt answer all his talk and his eyes were for countess gruffanuff who you may be sure was pleased with giglios attentionsthe vain old creature when he was not complimenting her he was making fun of prince bulbo so loud that gruffanuff was always tapping him with her fan and sayingoh you satirical prince oh fie the prince will hear well i dont mind says giglio louder still the king and queen luckily did not hear for her majesty was a little deaf and the king thought so much about his own dinner and besides made such a dreadful noise hobgobbling in eating it that he heard nothing else after dinner his majesty and the queen went to sleep in their armchairs  this was the time when giglio began his tricks with prince bulbo plying that young gentleman with port sherry madeira champagne marsala cherrybrandy and pale ale of all of which master bulbo drank without stint but in plying his guest giglio was obliged to drink himself and i am sorry to say took more than was good for him so that the young men were very noisy rude and foolish when they joined the ladies after dinner and dearly did they pay for that imprudence as now my darlings you shall hear  bulbo went and sat by the piano where angelica was playing and singing and he sang out of tune and he upset the coffee when the footman brought it and he laughed out of place and talked absurdly and fell asleep and snored horridly booh the nasty pig but as he lay there stretched on the pink satin sofa angelica still persisted in thinking him the most beautiful of human beings no doubt the magic rose which bulbo wore caused this infatuation on angelicas part but is she the first young woman who has thought a silly fellow charming  giglio must go and sit by gruffanuff whose old face he too every moment began to find more lovely he paid the most outrageous compliments to herthere never was such a darlingolder than he wasfiddlededee he would marry herhe would have nothing but her  to marry the heir to the throne here was a chance the artful hussy actually got a sheet of paper and wrote upon it this is to give notice that i giglio only son of savio king of paflagonia hereby promise to marry the charming and virtuous barbara griselda countess gruffanuff and widow of the late jenkins gruffanuff esq  what is it you are writing you charming gruffy says giglio who was lolling on the sofa by the writingtable  only an order for you to sign dear prince for giving coals and blankets to the poor this cold weather look the king and queen are both asleep and your royal highnesss order will do  so giglio who was very goodnatured as gruffy well knew signed the order immediately and when she had it in her pocket you may fancy what airs she gave herself she was ready to flounce out of the room before the queen herself as now she was the wife of the rightful king of paflagonia she would not speak to glumboso whom she thought a brute for depriving her dear husband of the crown and when candles came and she had helped to undress the queen and princess she went into her own room and actually practiced on a sheet of paper griselda paflagonia barbara regina griselda barbara paf reg and i dont know what signatures besides against the day when she should be queen forsooth     ix how betsinda got the warming pan  little betsinda came in to put gruffanuffs hair in papers and the countess was so pleased that for a wonder she complimented betsinda betsinda she said you dressed my hair very nicely today i promised you a little present here are five shno here is a pretty little ring that i pickedthat i have had some time and she gave betsinda the ring she had picked up in the court it fitted betsinda exactly  its like the ring the princess used to wear says the maid  no such thing says gruffanuff i have had it this ever so long there tuck me up quite comfortable and now as its a very cold night the snow was beating in at the window you may go and warm dear prince giglios bed like a good girl and then you may unrip my green silk and then you can just do me up a little cap for the morning and then you can mend that hole in my silk stocking and then you can go to bed betsinda mind i shall want my cup of tea at five oclock in the morning  i suppose i had best warm both the young gentlemens beds maam says betsinda  gruffanuff for reply said hauauhograuhawhoohonghrho in fact she was snoring sound asleep  her room you know is next to the king and queen and the princess is next to them so pretty betsinda went away for the coals to the kitchen and filled the royal warmingpan  now she was a very kind merry civil pretty girl but there must have been something very captivating about her this evening for all the women in the servants hall began to scold and abuse her the housekeeper said she was a pert stuckup thing the upperhousemaid asked how dare she wear such ringlets and ribbons it was quite improper the cook for there was a womancook as well as a mancook said to the kitchenmaid that she never could see anything in that creetur but as for the men every one of them coachman john buttons the page and monsieur the prince of crim tartarys valet started up and said       my eyes        o mussey  what a pretty girl betsinda is      o jemmany       o ciel    hands off none of your impertinence you vulgar low people says betsinda walking off with her pan of coals she heard the young gentlemen playing at billiards as she went upstairs first to prince giglios bed which she warmed and then to prince bulbos room  he came in just as she had done and as soon as he saw her o o o o o o what a beyouooootiful creature you are you angelyou periyou rosebud let me be thy bulbulthy bulbo too fly to the desert fly with me i never saw a young gazelle to glad me with its dark blue eye that had eyes like shine thou nymph of beauty take take this young heart a truer never did itself sustain within a soldiers waistcoat be mine be mine be princess of crim tartary my royal father will approve our union and as for that little carrotyhaired angelica i do not care a fig for her any more  go away your royal highness and go to bed please said betsinda with the warmingpan  but bulbo said no never till thou swearest to be mine thou lovely blushing chambermaid divine here at thy feet the royal bulbo lies the trembling captive of betsindas eyes  and he went on making himself so absurd and ridiculous that betsinda who was full of fun gave him a touch with the warmingpan which i promise you made him cry oooo in a very different manner  prince bulbo made such a noise that prince giglio who heard him from the next room came in to see what was the matter as soon as he saw what was taking place giglio in a fury rushed on bulbo kicked him in the rudest manner up to the ceiling and went on kicking him till his hair was quite out of curl  poor betsinda did not know whether to laugh or to cry the kicking certainly must hurt the prince but then he looked so droll when giglio had done knocking him up and down to the ground and whilst he went into a corner rubbing himself what do you think giglio does he goes down on his own knees to betsinda takes her hand begs her to accept his heart and offers to marry her that moment fancy betsindas condition who had been in love with the prince ever since she first saw him in the palace garden when she was quite a little child  oh divine betsinda says the prince how have i lived fifteen years in thy company without seeing thy perfections what woman in all europe asia africa and america nay in australia only it is not yet discovered can presume to be thy equal angelica pish gruffanuff phoo the queen ha ha thou art my queen thou art the real angelica because thou art really angelic  oh prince i am but a poor chambermaid says betsinda looking however very much pleased  didst thou not tend me in my sickness when all forsook me continues giglio did not thy gentle hand smooth my pillow and bring me jelly and roast chicken  yes dear prince i did says betsinda and i sewed your royal highnesss shirtbuttons on too if you please your royal highness cries this artless maiden  when poor prince bulbo who was now madly in love with betsinda heard this declaration when he saw the unmistakable glances which she flung upon giglio bulbo began to cry bitterly and tore quantities of hair out of his head till it all covered the room like so much tow  betsinda had left the warmingpan on the floor while the princes were going on with their conversation and as they began now to quarrel and be very fierce with one another she thought proper to run away  you great big blubbering booby tearing your hair in the corner there of course you will give me satisfaction for insulting betsinda you dare to kneel down at princess giglios knees and kiss her hand  shes not princess giglio roars out bulbo she shall be princess bulbo no other shall be princess bulbo  you are engaged to my cousin bellows out giglio i hate your cousin says bulbo  you shall give me satisfaction for insulting her cries giglio in a fury  ill have your life  ill run you through  ill cut your throat  ill blow your brains out  ill knock your head off  ill send a friend to you in the morning  ill send a bullet into you in the afternoon  well meet again says giglio shaking his fist in bulbos face and seizing up the warmingpan he kissed it because forsooth betsinda had carried it and rushed downstairs what should he see on the landing but his majesty talking to betsinda whom he called by all sorts of fond names his majesty had heard a row in the building so he stated and smelling something burning had come out to see what the matter was  its the young gentlemen smoking perhaps sir says betsinda  charming chambermaid says the king like all the rest of them never mind the young men turn thy eyes on a middleaged autocrat who has been considered not illlooking in his time  oh sir what will her majesty say cries betsinda  her majesty laughs the monarch her majesty be hanged am i not autocrat of paflagonia have i not blocks ropes axes hangmenha runs not a river by my palace wall have i not sacks to sew up wives withal say but the word that thou wilt be mine ownyour mistress straightway in a sack is sewn and thou the sharer of my heart and throne  when giglio heard these atrocious sentiments he forgot the respect usually paid to royalty lifted up the warmingpan and knocked down the king as flat as a pancake after which master giglio took to his heels and ran away and betsinda went off screaming and the queen gruffanuff and the princess all came out of their rooms fancy their feelings on beholding their husband father sovereign in this posture     x how king valoroso was in a dreadful passion  as soon as the coals began to burn him the king came to himself and stood up ho my captain of the guards his majesty exclaimed stamping his royal feet with rage o piteous spectacle the kings nose was bent quite crooked by the blow of prince giglio his majesty ground his teeth with rage hedzoff he said taking a deathwarrant out of his dressinggown pocket hedzoff good hedzoff seize upon the prince thoult find him in his chamber two pair up but now he dared with sacrilegious hand to strike the sacred nightcap of a kinghedzoff and floor me with a warmingpan away no more demur the villain dies see it be done or elsehmhahm mind shine own eyes and followed by the ladies and lifting up the tails of his dressinggown the king entered his own apartment  captain hedzoff was very much affected having a sincere love for giglio poor poor giglio he said the tears rolling over his manly face and dripping down his moustachios my noble young prince is it my hand must lead thee to death  lead him to fiddlestick hedzoff said a female voice it was gruffanuff who had come out in her dressinggown when she heard the noise the king said you were to hang the prince well hang the prince  i dont understand you says hedzoff who was not a very clever man  you gaby he didnt say which prince says gruffanuff  no he didnt say which certainly said hedzoff  well then take bulbo and hang him  when captain hedzoff heard this he began to dance about for joy obedience is a soldiers honour says he prince bulbos head will do capitally and he went to arrest the prince the very first thing next morning  he knocked at the door whos there says bulbo captain hedzoff step in pray my good captain im delighted to see you i have been expecting you  have you says hedzoff  sleibootz my chamberlain will act for me says the prince  i beg your royal highnesss pardon but you will have to act for yourself and its a pity to wake baron sleibootz  the prince bulbo still seemed to take the matter very coolly of course captain says he you are come about that affair with prince giglio  precisely says hedzoff that affair of prince giglio  is it to be pistols or swords captain asks bulbo im a pretty good hand with both and ill do for prince giglio as sure as my name is my royal highness prince bulbo  theres some mistake my lord says the captain the business is done with axes among us  axes thats sharp work says bulbo call my chamberlain hell be my second and in ten minutes i flatter myself youll see master giglios head off his impertinent shoulders im hungry for his blood hoooo aw and he looked as savage as an ogre  i beg your pardon sir but by this warrant i am to take you prisoner and hand you over toto the executioner  pooh pooh my good manstop i sayhohulloa was all that this luckless prince was enabled to say for hedzoffs guards seizing him tied a handkerchief over his mouth and face and carried him to the place of execution  the king who happened to be talking to glumboso saw him pass and took a pinch of snuff and said so much for giglio now lets go to breakfast  the captain of the guard handed over his prisoner to the sheriff with the fatal order  at sight cut off the bearers head valoroso xxiv  its a mistake says bulbo who did not seem to understand the business in the least  poopoopooh says the sheriff fetch jack ketch instantly jack ketch  and poor bulbo was led to the scaffold where an executioner with a block and a tremendous axe was always ready in case he should be wanted  but we must now revert to giglio and betsinda     xi what gruffanuff did to giglio and betsinda  gruffanuff who had seen what had happened with the king and knew that giglio must come to grief got up very early the next morning and went to devise some plans for rescuing her darling husband as the silly old thing insisted on calling him she found him walking up and down the garden thinking of a rhyme for betsinda tinder and winda were all he could find and indeed having forgotten all about the past evening except that betsinda was the most lovely of beings  well dear giglio says gruff  well dear gruffy says giglio only he was quite satirical  i have been thinking darling what you must do in this scrape you must fly the country for a while  what scrapefly the country never without her i love countess says giglio  no she will accompany you dear prince she says in her most coaxing accents first we must get the jewels belonging to our royal parents and those of her and his present majesty here is the key duck they are all yours you know by right for you are the rightful king of paflagonia and your wife will be the rightful queen  will she says giglio  yes and having got the jewels go to glumbosos apartment where under his bed you will find sacks containing money to the amount of l2i7000000987439 13s 6 12d all belonging to you for he took it out of your royal fathers room on the day of his death with this we will fly  we will fly says giglio  yes you and your brideyour affianced loveyour gruffy says the countess with a languishing leer  you my bride says giglio you you hideous old woman  oh youyou wretch didnt you give me this paper promising marriage cries gruff  get away you old goose i love betsinda and betsinda only and in a fit of terror he ran from her as quickly as he could  he he he shrieks out gruff a promise is a promise if there are laws in paflagonia and as for that monster that wretch that fiend that ugly little vixenas for that upstart that ingrate that beast betsinda master giglio will have no little difficulty in discovering her whereabouts he may look very long before finding her i warrant he little knows that miss betsinda is  iswhat now you shall hear poor betsinda got up at five in winters morning to bring her cruel mistress her tea and instead of finding her in a good humour found gruffy as cross as two sticks the countess boxed betsindas ears half a dozen times whilst she was dressing but as poor little betsinda was used to this kind of treatment she did not feel any special alarm and now says she when her majesty rings her bell twice ill trouble you miss to attend  so when the queens bell rang twice betsinda came to her majesty and made a pretty little curtsey the queen the princess and gruffanuff were all three in the room as soon as they saw her they began  you wretch says the queen  you little vulgar thing says the princess  you beast says gruffanuff  get out of my sight says the queen  go away with you do says the princess  quit the premises says gruffanuff  alas and woe is me very lamentable events had occurred to betsinda that morning and all in consequence of that fatal warmingpan business of the previous night the king had offered to marry her of course her majesty the queen was jealous bulbo had fallen in love with her of course angelica was furious giglio was in love with her and oh what a fury gruffy was in       take off that cap    i gave you      petticoat they said all      gown    at once      and began tearing the clothes off poor betsinda       how    the king    cried the queen      dare you  prince bulbo  the princess and      flirt with prince giglio countess  give her the rags she wore when she came into the house and turn her out of it cries the queen  mind she does not go with my shoes on which i lent her so kindly says the princess and indeed the princesss shoes were a great deal too big for betsinda  come with me you filthy hussy and taking up the queens poker the cruel gruffanuff drove betsinda into her room  the countess went to the glass box in which she had kept betsindas old cloak and shoe this ever so long and said take those rags you little beggar creature and strip off everything belonging to honest people and go about your business and she actually tore off the poor little delicate things back almost all her things and told her to be off out of the house  poor betsinda huddled the cloak round her back on which were embroidered the letters prin   rosal   and then came a great rent  as for the shoe what was she to do with one poor little tootsey sandal the string was still to it so she hung it round her neck  wont you give me a pair of shoes to go out in the snow mum if you please mum cried the poor child  no you wicked beast says gruffanuff driving her along with the pokerdriving her down the cold stairsdriving her through the cold hallflinging her out into the cold street so that the knocker itself shed tears to see her  but a kind fairy made the soft snow warm for her little feet and she wrapped herself up in the ermine of her mantle and was gone   and now let us think about breakfast says the greedy queen  what dress shall i put on mamma the pink or the peagreen says angelica which do you think the dear prince will like best  mrs v sings out the king from his dressingroom let us have sausages for breakfast remember we have prince bulbo staying with us  and they all went to get ready  nine oclock came and they were all in the breakfastroom and no prince bulbo as yet the urn was hissing and humming the muffins were smokingsuch a heap of muffins the eggs were done there was a pot of raspberry jam and coffee and a beautiful chicken and tongue on the sidetable marmitonio the cook brought in the sausages oh how nice they smelt  where is bulbo said the king john where is his royal highness john said he had a took hup his roilighnessesses shavingwater and his clothes and things and he wasnt in his room which he sposed his royliness was just stepped trout  stepped out before breakfast in the snow impossible says the king sticking his fork into a sausage my dear take one angelica wont you have a saveloy the princess took one being very fond of them and at this moment glumboso entered with captain hedzoff both looking very much disturbed  i am afraid your majesty cries glumboso  no business before breakfast glum says the king breakfast first business next mrs v some more sugar  sire i am afraid if we wait till after breakfast it will be too late says glumboso hehehell be hanged at halfpast nine  dont talk about hanging and spoil my breakfast you unkind

sulky  we shall have a war sire depend on it says the minister his father king padella    his father king who says the king king padella is not giglios father my brother king savio was giglios father  its prince bulbo they are hanging sire not prince giglio says the prime minister  you told me to hang the prince and i took the ugly one says hedzoff i didnt of course think your majesty intended to murder your own flesh and blood  the king for all reply flung the plate of sausages at hedzoffs head the princess cried out heekareekaree and fell down in a fainting fit  turn the cock of the urn upon her royal highness said the king and the boiling water gradually revived her his majesty looked at his watch compared it by the clock in the parlour and by that of the church in the square opposite then he wound it up then he looked at it again the great question is says he am i fast or am i slow if im slow we may as well go on with breakfast if im fast why there is just the possibility of saving prince bulbo its a doosid awkward mistake and upon my word hedzoff i have the greatest mind to have you hanged too  sire i did but my duty a soldier has but his orders i didnt expect after fortyseven years of faithful service that my sovereign would think of putting me to a felons death  a hundred thousand plagues upon you cant you see that while you are talking my bulbo is being hung screamed the princess  by jove shes always right that girl and im so absent says the king looking at his watch again ha there go the drums what a doosid awkward thing though  oh papa you goose write the reprieve and let me run with it cries the princessand she got a sheet of paper and pen and ink and laid them before the king  confound it where are my spectacles the monarch exclaimed angelica go up into my bedroom look under my pillow not your mammas there youll see my keys bring them down to me andwell well what impetuous things these girls are angelica was gone and had run up panting to the bedroom and found the keys and was back again before the king had finished a muffin now love says he you must go all the way back for my desk in which my spectacles are if you would but have heard me out   be hanged to her there she is off again angelica angelica when his majesty called in his loud voice she knew she must obey and came back  my dear when you go out of a room how often have i told you shut the door thats a darling thats all at last the keys and the desk and the spectacles were got and the king mended his pen and signed his name to a reprieve and angelica ran with it as swift as the wind youd better stay my love and finish the muffins theres no use going be sure its too late hand me over that raspberry jam please said the monarch bong bawong there goes the halfhour i knew it was  angelica ran and ran and ran and ran she ran up fore street and down high street and through the marketplace and down to the left and over the bridge and up the blind alley and back again and round by the castle and so along by the haberdashers on the right opposite the lamppost and round the square and she cameshe came to the execution place where she saw bulbo laying his head on the block the executioner raised his axe but at that moment the princess came panting up and cried reprieve reprieve screamed the princess reprieve shouted all the people up the scaffold stairs she sprang with the agility of a lighter of lamps and flinging herself in bulbos arms regardless of all ceremony she cried out oh my prince my lord my love my bulbo thine angelica has been in time to save thy precious existence sweet rosebud to prevent thy being nipped in thy young bloom had aught befallen thee angelica too had died and welcomed death that joined her to her bulbo  hm theres no accounting for tastes said bulbo looking so very much puzzled and uncomfortable that the princess in tones of tenderest strain asked the cause of his disquiet  i tell you what it is angelica said he since i came here yesterday there has been such a row and disturbance and quarrelling and fighting and chopping of heads off and the deuce to pay that i am inclined to go back to crim tartary  but with me as thy bride my bulbo though wherever thou art is crim tartary to me my bold my beautiful my bulbo  well well i suppose we must be married says bulbo doctor you came to read the funeral serviceread the marriage service will you what must be must that will satisfy angelica and then in the name of peace and quietness do let us go back to breakfast  bulbo had carried a rose in his mouth all the time of the dismal ceremony it was a fairy rose and he was told by his mother that he ought never to part with it so he had kept it between his teeth even when he laid his poor head upon the block hoping vaguely that some chance would turn up in his favour as he began to speak to angelica he forgot about the rose and of course it dropped out of his mouth the romantic princess instantly stooped and seized it sweet rose she exclaimed that bloomed upon my bulbos lip never never will i part from thee and she placed it in her bosom and you know bulbo couldnt ask her to give the rose back again and they went to breakfast and as they walked it appeared to bulbo that angelica became more exquisitely lovely every moment  he was frantic until they were married and now strange to say it was angelica who didnt care about him he knelt down he kissed her hand he prayed and begged he cried with admiration while she for her part said she really thought they might wait it seemed to her he was not handsome any moreno not at all quite the reverse and not clever no very stupid and not well bred like giglio no on the contrary dreadfully vul  what i cannot say for king valoroso roared out pooh stuff in a terrible voice we will have no more of this shillyshallying call the archbishop and let the prince and princess be married offhand  so married they were and i am sure for my part i trust they will be happy     xii how betsinda fled and what became of her  betsinda wandered on and on till she passed through the town gates and so on the great crim tartary road the very way on which giglio too was going ah thought she as the diligence passed her of which the conductor was blowing a delightful tune on his horn how i should like to be on that coach but the coach and the jingling horses were very soon gone she little knew who was in it though very likely she was thinking of him all the time  then came an empty cart returning from market and the driver being a kind man and seeing such a very pretty girl trudging along the road with bare feet most goodnaturedly gave her a seat he said he lived on the confines of the forest where his old father was a woodman and if she liked he would take her so far on her road all roads were the same to little betsinda so she very thankfully took this one  and the carter put a cloth round her bare feet and gave her some bread and cold bacon and was very kind to her for all that she was very cold and melancholy when after travelling on and on evening came and all the black pines were bending with snow and there at last was the comfortable light beaming in the woodmans windows and so they arrived and went into his cottage he was an old man and had a number of children who were just at supper with nice hot breadandmilk when their elder brother arrived with the cart and they jumped and clapped their hands for they were good children and he had brought them toys from the town and when they saw the pretty stranger they ran to her and brought her to the fire and rubbed her poor little feet and brought her bread and milk  look father they said to the old woodman look at this poor girl and see what pretty cold feet she has they are as white as our milk and look and see what an odd cloak she has just like the bit of velvet that hangs up in our cupboard and which you found that day the little cubs were killed by king padella in the forest and look why bless us all she has got round her neck just such another little shoe as that you brought home and have shown us so oftena little blue velvet shoe  what said the old woodman what is all this about a shoe and a cloak  and betsinda explained that she had been left when quite a little child at the town with this cloak and this shoe and the persons who had taken care of her hadhad been angry with her for no fault she hoped of her own and they had sent her away with her old clothesand here in fact she was she remembered having been in a forestand perhaps it was a dreamit was so very odd and strangehaving lived in a cave with lions there and before that having lived in a very very fine house as fine as the kings in the town  when the woodman heard this he was so astonished it was quite curious to see how astonished he was he went to his cupboard and took out of a stocking a fiveshilling piece of king cavolfiore and vowed it was exactly like the young woman and then he produced the shoe and piece of velvet which he had kept so long and compared them with the things which betsinda wore in betsindas little shoe was written hopkins maker to the royal family so in the other shoe was written hopkins maker to the royal family in the inside of betsindas piece of cloak was embroidered prin rosal in the other piece of cloak was embroidered cess ba no 246 so that when put together you read princess rosalba no 246  on seeing this the dear old woodman fell down on his knee saying o my princess o my gracious royal lady o my rightful queen of crim tartaryi hail theei acknowledge theei do thee homage and in token of his fealty he rubbed his venerable nose three times on the ground and put the princesss foot on his head  why said she my good woodman you must be a nobleman of my royal fathers court for in her lowly retreat and under the name of betsinda her majesty rosalba queen of crim tartary had read of the customs of all foreign courts and nations  marry indeed am i my gracious liegethe poor lord spinachi oncethe humble woodman these fifteen years syne ever since the tyrant padella may ruin overtake the treacherous knave dismissed me from my post of first lord  first lord of the toothpick and joint keeper of the snuffbox i mind me thou heldest these posts under our royal sire they are restored to thee lord spinachi i make thee knight of the second class of our order of the pumpkin the first class being reserved for crowned heads alone rise marquis of spinachi and with indescribable majesty the queen who had no sword handy waved the pewter spoon with which she had been taking her breadandmilk over the bald head of the old nobleman whose tears absolutely made a puddle on the ground and whose dear children went to bed that night lords and ladies bartolomeo ubaldo catarina and ottavia degli spinachi  the acquaintance her majesty showed with the history and noble families of her empire was wonderful the house of broccoli should remain faithful to us she said they were ever welcome at our court have the articiocchi as was their wont turned to the rising sun the family of sauerkraut must sure be with usthey were ever welcome in the halls of king cavolfiore and so she went on enumerating quite a list of the nobility and gentry of crim tartary so admirably had her majesty profited by her studies while in exile  the old marquis of spinachi said he could answer for them all that the whole country groaned under padellas tyranny and longed to return to its rightful sovereign and late as it was he sent his children who knew the forest well to summon this nobleman and that and when his eldest son who had been rubbing the horse down and giving him his supper came into the house for his own the marquis told him to put his boots on and a saddle on the mare and ride hither and thither to such and such people   when the young man heard who his companion in the cart had been he too knelt down and put her royal foot on his head he too bedewed the ground with his tears he was frantically in love with her as everybody now was who saw her so were the young lords bartolomeo and ubaldo who punched each others little heads out of jealousy and so when they came from east and west at the summons of the marquis degli spinachi were the crim tartar lords who still remained faithful to the house of cavolfiore they were such very old gentlemen for the most part that her majesty never suspected their absurd passion and went among them quite unaware of the havoc her beauty was causing until an old blind lord who had joined her party told her what the truth was after which for fear of making the people too much in love with her she always wore a veil she went about privately from one noblemans castle to another and they visited among themselves again and had meetings and composed proclamations and counterproclamations and distributed all the best places of the kingdom amongst one another and selected who of the opposition party should be executed when the queen came to her own and so in about a year they were ready to move  the party of fidelity was in truth composed of very feeble old fogies for the most part they went about the country waving their old swords and flags and calling god save the queen and king padella happening to be absent upon an invasion they had their own way for a little and to be sure the people were very enthusiastic whenever they saw the queen otherwise the vulgar took matters very quietly for they said as far as they could recollect they were pretty well as much taxed in cavolfiores time as now in padellas     xiii how queen rosalba came to the castle of the bold count hogginarmo  her majesty having indeed nothing else to give made all her followers knights of the pumpkin and marquises earls and baronets and they had a little court for her and made her a little crown of gilt paper and a robe of cotton velvet and they quarrelled about the places to be given away in her court and about rank and precedence and dignitiesyou cant think how they quarrelled the poor queen was very tired of her honours before she had had them a month and i dare say sighed sometimes even to be a ladysmaid again but we must all do our duty in our respective stations so the queen resigned herself to perform hers  we have said how it happened that none of the usurpers troops came out to oppose this army of fidelity it pottered along as nimbly as the gout of the principal commanders allowed it consisted of twice as many officers as soldiers and at length passed near the estates of one of the most powerful noblemen of the country who had not declared for the queen but of whom her party had hopes as he was always quarrelling with king padella  when they came close to his park gates this nobleman sent to say he would wait upon her majesty he was a most powerful warrior and his name was count hogginarmo whose helmet it took two strong negroes to carry he knelt down before her and said madam and liege lady it becomes the great nobles of the crimean realm to show every outward sign of respect to the wearer of the crown whoever that may be we testify to our own nobility in acknowledging yours the bold hogginarmo bends the knee to the first of the aristocracy of his country  rosalba said the bold count of hogginarmo was uncommonly kind but she felt afraid of him even while he was kneeling and his eyes scowled at her from between his whiskers which grew up to them  the first count of the empire madam he went on salutes the sovereign the prince addresses himself to the not more noble lady madam my hand is free and i offer it and my heart and my sword to your service my three wives lie buried in my ancestral vaults the third perished but a year since and this heart pines for a consort deign to be mine and i swear to bring to your bridal table the head of king padella the eyes and nose of his son prince bulbo the right hand and ears of the usurping sovereign of paflagonia which country shall thenceforth be an appanage to yourto our crown say yes hogginarmo is not accustomed to be denied indeed i cannot contemplate the possibility of a refusal for frightful will be the result dreadful the murders furious the devastations horrible the tyranny tremendous the tortures misery taxation which the people of this realm will endure if hogginarmos wrath be aroused i see consent in your majestys lovely eyestheir glances fill my soul with rapture  oh sir rosalba said withdrawing her hand in great fright your lordship is exceedingly kind but i am sorry to tell you that i have a prior attachment to a young gentleman by the name ofprince giglioand nevernever can marry any one but him  who can describe hogginarmos wrath at this remark rising up from the ground he ground his teeth so that fire flashed out of his mouth from which at the same time issued remarks and language so loud violent and improper that this pen shall never repeat them rrrrrrrejected fiends and perdition the bold hogginarmo rejected all the world shall hear of my rage and you madam you above all shall rue it and kicking the two negroes before him he rushed away his whiskers streaming in the wind  her majestys privy council was in a dreadful panic when they saw hogginarmo issue from the royal presence in such a towering rage making footballs of the poor negroesa panic which the events justified they marched off from hogginarmos park very crestfallen and in another halfhour they were met by that rapacious chieftain with a few of his followers who cut slashed charged whacked banged and pommelled amongst them took the queen prisoner and drove the army of fidelity to i dont know where  poor queen hogginarmo her conqueror would not condescend to see her get a horsevan he said to his grooms clap the hussy into it and send her with my compliments to his majesty king padella  along with his lovely prisoner hogginarmo sent a letter full of servile compliments and loathsome flatteries to king padella for whose life and that of his royal family the hypocritical humbug pretended to offer the most fulsome prayers and hogginarmo promised speedily to pay his humble homage at his august masters throne of which he begged leave to be counted the most loyal and constant defender such a wary old bird as king padella was not to be caught by master hogginarmos chaff and we shall hear presently how the tyrant treated his upstart vassal no no depend ons two such rogues do not trust one another  so this poor queen was laid in the straw like margery daw and driven along in the dark ever so many miles to the court where king padella had now arrived having vanquished all his enemies murdered most of them and brought some of the richest into captivity with him for the purpose of torturing them and finding out where they had hidden their money  rosalba heard their shrieks and groans in the dungeon in which she was thrust a most awful black hole full of bats rats mice toads frogs mosquitoes bugs fleas serpents and every kind of horror no light was let into it otherwise the gaolers might have seen her and fallen in love with her as an owl that lived up in the roof of the tower did and a cat you know who can see in the dark and having set its green eyes on rosalba never would be got to go back to the turnkeys wife to whom it belonged and the toads in the dungeon came and kissed her feet and the vipers wound round her neck and arms and never hurt her so charming was this poor princess in the midst of her misfortunes  at last after she had been kept in this place ever so long the door of the dungeon opened and the terrible king padella came in  but what he said and did must be reserved for another chapter as we must now back to prince giglio     xiv what became of giglio  the idea of marrying such an old creature as gruffanuff frightened prince giglio so that he ran up to his room packed his trunks fetched in a couple of porters and was off to the diligence office in a twinkling  it was well that he was so quick in his operations did not dawdle over his luggage and took the early coach for as soon as the mistake about prince bulbo was found out that cruel glumboso sent up a couple of policemen to prince giglios room with orders that he should be carried to newgate and his head taken off before twelve oclock but the coach was out of the paflagonian dominions before two oclock and i dare say the express that was sent after prince giglio did not ride very quick for many people in paflagonia had a regard for giglio as the son of their old sovereign a prince who with all his weaknesses was very much better than his brother the usurping lazy careless passionate tyrannical reigning monarch that prince busied himself with the balls fetes masquerades huntingparties and so forth which he thought proper to give on occasion of his daughters marriage to prince bulbo and let us trust was not sorry in his own heart that his brothers son had escaped the scaffold  it was very cold weather and the snow was on the ground and giglio who gave his name as simple mr giles was very glad to get a comfortable place in the coupe of the diligence where he sat with the conductor and another gentleman at the first stage from blombodinga as they stopped to change horses there came up to the diligence a very ordinary vulgarlooking woman with a bag under her arm who asked for a place all the inside places were taken and the young woman was informed that if she wished to travel she must go upon the roof and the passenger inside with giglio a rude person i should think put his head out of the window and said nice weather for travelling outside i wish you a pleasant journey my dear the poor woman coughed very much and giglio pitied her i will give up my place to her says he rather than she should travel in the cold air with that horrid cough on which the vulgar traveller said youd keep her warm i am sure if its a muff she wants on which giglio pulled his nose boxed his ears hit him in the eye and gave this vulgar person a warning never to call him muff again  then he sprang up gaily on to the roof of the diligence and made himself very comfortable in the straw  the vulgar traveller got down only at the next station and giglio took his place again and talked to the person next to him she appeared to be a most agreeable wellinformed and entertaining female they travelled together till night and she gave giglio all sorts of things out of the bag which she carried and which indeed seemed to contain the most wonderful collection of articles he was thirstyout there came a pint bottle of basss pale ale and a silver mug hungryshe took out a cold fowl some slices of ham bread salt and a most delicious piece of cold plumpudding and a little glass of brandy afterwards  as they travelled this plainlooking queer woman talked to giglio on a variety of subjects in which the poor prince showed his ignorance as much as she did her capacity he owned with many blushes how ignorant he was on which the lady said my dear giglmy good mr giles you are a young man and have plenty of time before you you have nothing to do but to improve yourself who knows but that you may find use for your knowledge some day whenwhen you may be wanted at home as some people may be  good heavens madam says he do you know me  i know a number of funny things says the lady i have been at some peoples christenings and turned away from other folks doors i have seen some people spoilt by good fortune and others as i hope improved by hardship i advise you to stay at the town where the coach stops for the night stay there and study and remember your old friend to whom you were kind  and who is my old friend asked giglio  when you want anything says the lady look in this bag which i leave to you as a present and be grateful to  to whom madam says he  to the fairy blackstick says the lady flying out of the window and then giglio asked the conductor if he knew where the lady was  what lady says the man there has been no lady in this coach except the old woman who got out at the last stage and giglio thought he had been dreaming but there was the bag which blackstick had given him lying on his lap and when he came to the town he took it in his hand and went into the inn  they gave him a very bad bedroom and giglio when he woke in the morning fancying himself in the royal palace at home called john charles thomas my chocolatemy dressinggownmy slippers but nobody came there was no bell so he went and bawled out for water on the top of the stairs  the landlady came up  what are you a hollering and a bellaring for here young man says she  theres no warm waterno servants my boots are not even cleaned  he he clean em yourself says the landlady you young students give yourselves pretty airs i never heard such impudence  ill quit the house this instant says giglio  the sooner the better young man pay your bill and be off all my rooms is wanted for gentlefolks and not for such as you  you may well keep the bear inn said giglio you should have yourself painted as the sign  the landlady of the bear went away growling and giglio returned to his room where the first thing he saw was the fairy bag lying on the table which seemed to give a little hop as he came in i hope it has some breakfast in it says giglio for i have only a very little money left but on opening the bag what do you think was there a blackingbrush and a pot of warrens jet and on the pot was written       poor young men their boots must black      use me and cork me and put me back  so giglio laughed and blacked his boots and put back the brush and the bottle into the bag  when he had done dressing himself the bag gave another little hop and he went to it and took out  1 a tablecloth and a napkin  2 a sugarbasin full of the best loafsugar  4 6 8 10 two forks two teaspoons two knives and a pair of sugartongs and a butterknife all marked g  11 12 13 a teacup saucer and slopbasin  14 a jug full of delicious cream  15 a canister with black tea and green  16 a large teaurn and boiling water  17 a saucepan containing three eggs nicely done  18 a quarter of a pound of best epping butter  19 a brown loaf  and if he hadnt enough now for a good breakfast i should like to know who ever had one  giglio having had his breakfast popped all the things back into the bag and went out looking for lodgings i forgot to say that this celebrated university town was called bosforo  he took a modest lodging opposite the schools paid his bill at the inn and went to his apartment with his trunk carpetbag and not forgetting we may be sure his other bag  when he opened his trunk which the day before he had filled with his best clothes he found it contained only books and in the first of them which he opened there was written  clothes for the back books for the head read and remember them when they are read  and in his bag when giglio looked in it he found a students cap and gown a writingbook full of paper an inkstand pens and a johnsons dictionary which was very useful to him as his spelling had been sadly neglected  so he sat down and worked away very very hard for a whole year during which mr giles was quite an example to all the students in the university of bosforo he never got into any riots or disturbances the professors all spoke well of him and the students liked him too so that when at examination he took all the prizes viz       the spelling prize  the french prize      the writing prize   the arithmetic prize      the history prize   the latin prize      the catechism prize  the good conduct prize  all his fellowstudents said hurrah hurray for giles giles is the boythe students joy hurray for giles and he brought quite a quantity of medals crowns books and tokens of distinction home to his lodgings  one day after the examinations as he was diverting himself at a coffeehouse with two friendsdid i tell you that in his bag every saturday night he found just enough to pay his bills with a guinea over for pocketmoney didnt i tell you well he did as sure as twice twenty makes fortyfivehe chanced to look in the bosforo chronicle and read off quite easily for he could spell read and write the longest words now the following  romantic circumstanceone of the most extraordinary adventures that we have ever heard has set the neighbouring country of crim tartary in a state of great excitement  it will be remembered that when the present revered sovereign of crim tartary his majesty king padella took possession of the throne after having vanquished in the terrific battle of blunderbusco the late king cavolfiore that princes only child the princess rosalba was not found in the royal palace of which king padella took possession and it was said had strayed into the forest being abandoned by all her attendants where she had been eaten up by those ferocious lions the last pair of which were captured some time since and brought to the tower after killing several hundred persons  his majesty king padella who has the kindest heart in the world was grieved at the accident which had occurred to the harmless little princess for whom his majestys known benevolence would certainly have provided a fitting establishment but her death seemed to be certain the mangled remains of a cloak and a little shoe were found in the forest during a huntingparty in which the intrepid sovereign of crim tartary slew two of the lions cubs with his own spear and these interesting relics of an innocent little creature were carried home and kept by their finder the baron spinachi formerly an officer in cavolfiores household the baron was disgraced in consequence of his known legitimist opinions and has lived for some time in the humble capacity of a woodcutter in a forest on the outskirts of the kingdom of crim tartary  last tuesday week baron spinachi and a number of gentlemen attached to the former dynasty appeared in arms crying god save rosalba the first queen of crim tartary and surrounding a lady whom report describes as beautiful exceedingly her history may be authentic is certainly most romantic  the personage calling herself rosalba states that she was brought out of the forest fifteen years since by a lady in a car drawn by dragons this account is certainly improbable that she was left in the palace garden of blombodinga where her royal highness the princess angelica now married to his royal highness bulbo crown prince of crim tartary found the child and with that elegant benevolence which has always distinguished the heiress of the throne of paflagonia gave the little outcast a shelter and a home her parentage not being known and her garb very humble the foundling was educated in the palace in a menial capacity under the name of betsinda  she did not give satisfaction and was dismissed carrying with her certainly part of a mantle and a shoe which she had on when first found according to her statement she quitted blombodinga about a year ago since which time she has been with the spinachi family on the very same morning the prince giglio nephew to the king of paflagonia a young prince whose character for talent and order were to say truth none of the highest also quitted blombodinga and has not been since heard of  what an extraordinary story said smith and jones two young students giglios especial friends  ha what is this giglio went on reading  second edition expresswe hear that the troop under baron spinachi has been surrounded and utterly routed by general count hogginarmo and the soidisant princess is sent a prisoner to the capital  university newsyesterday at the schools the distinguished young student mr giles read a latin oration and was complimented by the chancellor of bosforo dr prugnaro with the highest university honourthe wooden spoon  never mind that stuff says giles greatly disturbed come home with me my friends gallant smith intrepid jones friends of my studiespartakers of my academic toilsi have that to tell which shall astonish your honest minds  go it old boy cries the impetuous smith  talk away my buck says jones a lively fellow  with an air of indescribable dignity giglio checked their natural but no more seemly familiarity jones smith my good friends said the prince disguise is henceforth useless i am no more the humble student giles i am the descendant of a royal line  atavis edite regibus i know old co cried jones he was going to say old cock but a flash from the royal eye again awed him  friends continued the prince i am that giglio i am in fact paflagonia rise smith and kneel not in the public street jones thou true heart my faithless uncle when i was a baby filched from me that brave crown my father left me bred me all young and careless of my rights like unto hapless hamlet prince of denmark and had i any thoughts about my wrongs soothed me with promises of near redress i should espouse his daughter young angelica we two indeed should reign in paflagonia his words were falsefalse as angelicas heartfalse as angelicas hair colour front teeth she looked with her skew eyes upon young bulbo crim tartarys stupid heir and she preferred him twas then i turned my eyes upon betsindarosalba as she now is and i saw in her the blushing sum of all perfection the pink of maiden modesty the nymph that my fond heart had ever wood in dreams etc etc  i dont give this speech which was very fine but very long and though smith and jones knew nothing about the circumstances my dear reader does so i go on  the prince and his young friends hastened home to his apartment highly excited by the intelligence as no doubt by the royal narrators admirable manner of recounting it and they ran up to his room where he had worked so hard at his books  on his writingtable was his bag grown so long that the prince could not help remarking it he went to it opened it and what do you think he found in it  a splendid long goldhandled redvelvetscabbarded cutandthrust sword and on the sheath was embroidered rosalba for ever  he drew out the sword which flashed and illuminated the whole room and called out rosalba for ever smith and jones following him but quite respectfully this time and taking the time from his royal highness  and now his trunk opened with a sudden pony and out there came three ostrich feathers in a gold crown surrounding a beautiful shining steel helmet a cuirass a pair of spurs finally a complete suit of armour  the books on giglios shelves were all gone where there had been some great dictionaries giglios friends found two pairs of jackboots labelled lieutenant smith jones esq which fitted them to a nicety besides there were helmets back and breast plates swords etc just like in mr g p r jamess novels and that evening three cavaliers might have been seen issuing from the gates of bosforo in whom the porters proctors etc never thought of recognising the young prince and his friends  they got horses at a livery stablekeepers and never drew bridle until they reached the last town on the frontier before you come to crim tartary here as their animals were tired and the cavaliers hungry they stopped and refreshed at an hostel i could make a chapter of this if i were like some writers but i like to cram my measure tight down you see and give you a great deal for your money and in a word they had some bread and cheese and ale upstairs on the balcony of the inn as they were drinking drums and trumpets sounded nearer and nearer the marketplace was filled with soldiers and his royal highness looking forth recognised the paflagonian banners and the paflagonian national air which the bands were playing  the troops all made for the tavern at once and as they came up giglio exclaimed on beholding their leader whom do i see yes no it is it is phoo no it cant be yes it is my friend my gallant faithful veteran captain hedzoff ho hedzoff knowest thou not thy prince thy giglio good corporal methinks we once were friends ha sergeant an my memory serves me right we have had many a bout at singlestick  i faith we have a many good my lord says the sergeant  tell me what means this mighty armament continued his royal highness from the balcony and whither march my paflagonians  hedzoffs head fell my lord he said we march as the allies of great padella crim tartarys monarch  crim tartarys usurper gallant hedzoff crim tartarys grim tyrant honest hedzoff said the prince on the balcony quite sarcastically  a soldier prince must needs obey his orders mine are to help his majesty padella and also though alack that i should say it to seize wherever i should light upon him  first catch your hare ha hedzoff exclaimed his royal highness  on the body of giglio whilome prince of paflagonia hedzoff went on with indescribable emotion my prince give up your sword without ado look we are thirty thousand men to one  give up my sword giglio give up his sword cried the prince and stepping well forward on to the balcony the royal youth without preparation delivered a speech so magnificent that no report can do justice to it it was all in blank verse in which from this time he invariably spoke as more becoming his majestic station it lasted for three days and three nights during which not a single person who heard him was tired or remarked the difference between daylight and dark the soldiers only cheering tremendously when occasionally once in nine hours the prince paused to suck an orange which jones took out of the bag he explained in terms which we say we shall not attempt to convey the whole history of the previous transaction and his determination not only not to give up his sword but to assume his rightful crown and at the end of this extraordinary this truly gigantic effort captain hedzoff flung up his helmet and cried hurray hurray long live king giglio  such were the consequences of having employed his time well at college  when the excitement had ceased beer was ordered out for the army and their sovereign himself did not disdain a little and now it was with some alarm that captain hedzoff told him his division was only the advanced guard of the paflagonian contingent hastening to king padellas aid the main force being a days march in the rear under his royal highness prince bulbo  we will wait here good friend to beat the prince his majesty said and then will make his royal father wince     xv we return to rosalba  king padella made very similar proposals to rosalba to those which she had received from the various princes who as we have seen had fallen in love with her his majesty was a widower and offered to marry his fair captive that instant but she declined his invitation in her usual polite gentle manner stating that prince giglio was her love and that any other union was out of the question having tried tears and supplications in vain this violenttempered monarch menaced her with threats and tortures but she declared she would rather suffer all these than accept the hand of her fathers murderer who left her finally uttering the most awful imprecations and bidding her prepare for death on the following morning  all night long the king spent in advising how he should get rid of this obdurate young creature cutting off her head was much too easy a death for her hanging was so common in his majestys dominions that it no longer afforded him any sport finally he bethought himself of a pair of fierce lions which had lately been sent to him as presents and he determined with these ferocious brutes to hunt poor rosalba down adjoining his castle was an amphitheatre where the prince indulged in bullbaiting rathunting and other ferocious sports the two lions were kept in a cage under this place their roaring might be heard over the whole city the inhabitants of which i am sorry to say thronged in numbers to see a poor young lady gobbled up by two wild beasts  the king took his place in the royal box having the officers of his court around and the count hogginarmo by his side upon whom his majesty was observed to look very fiercely the fact is royal spies had told the monarch of hogginarmos behaviour his proposals to rosalba and his offer to fight for the crown black as thunder looked king padella at this proud noble as they sat in the front seats of the theatre waiting to see the tragedy whereof poor rosalba was to be the heroine  at length that princess was brought out in her nightgown with all her beautiful hair falling down her back and looking so pretty that even the beefeaters and keepers of the wild animals wept plentifully at seeing her and she walked with her poor little feet only luckily the arena was covered with sawdust and went and leaned up against a great stone in the centre of the amphitheatre round which the court and the people were seated in boxes with bars before them for fear of the great fierce redmaned blackthroated longtailed roaring bellowing rushing lions and now the gates were opened and with a wurrawarrurawarar two great lean hungry roaring lions rushed out of their den where they had been kept for three weeks on nothing but a little toastandwater and dashed straight up to the stone where poor rosalba was waiting commend her to your patron saints all you kind people for she is in a dreadful state  there was a hum and a buzz all through the circus and the fierce king padella even felt a little compassion but count hogginarmo seated by his majesty roared out hurray now for it soosoosoo that nobleman being uncommonly angry still at rosalbas refusal of him  but o strange event o remarkable circumstance o extraordinary coincidence which i am sure none of you could by any possibility have divined when the lions came to rosalba instead of devouring her with their great teeth it was with kisses they gobbled her up they licked her pretty feet they nuzzled their noses in her lap they mood they seemed to say dear dear sister dont you recollect your brothers in the forest and she put her pretty white arms round their tawny necks and kissed them  king padella was immensely astonished the count hogginarmo was extremely disgusted pooh the count cried gammon exclaimed his lordship these lions are tame beasts come from wombwells or astleys it is a shame to put people off in this way i believe they are little boys dressed up in doormats they are no lions at all  ha said the king you dare to say gammon to your sovereign do you these lions are no lions at all arent they ho my beefeaters ho my bodyguard take this count hogginarmo and fling him into the circus give him a sword and buckler let him keep his armour on and his weathereye out and fight these lions  the haughty hogginarmo laid down his operaglass and looked scowling round at the king and his attendants touch me not dogs he said or by st nicholas the elder i will gore you your majesty thinks hogginarmo is afraid no not of a hundred thousand lions follow me down into the circus king padella and match thyself against one of yon brutes thou darest not let them both come on then and opening a grating of the box he jumped lightly down into the circus                wurra wurra wurra wurawawaw                   in about two minutes                 the count hogginarmo was                      gobbled up                          by                      those lions                  bones boots and all                         and                     there was an                      end of him  at this the king said serve him right the rebellious ruffian and now as those lions wont eat that young woman  let her offlet her off cried the crowd  no roared the king let the beefeaters go down and chop her into small pieces if the lions defend her let the archers shoot them to death that hussy shall die in tortures  aaah cried the crowd shame shame  who dares cry out shame cried the furious potentate so little can tyrants command their passions fling any scoundrel who says a word down among the lions  i warrant you there was a dead silence then which was broken by a pang arang pang pangkarangpang and a knight and a herald rode in at the further end of the circus the knight in full armour with his vizor up and bearing a letter on the point of his lance  ha exclaimed the king by my fey tis elephant and castle pursuivant of my brother of paflagonia and the knight an my memory serves me is the gallant captain hedzoff what news from paflagonia gallant hedzoff elephant and castle beshrew me thy trumpeting must have made thee thirsty what will my trusty herald like to drink  bespeaking first safe conduct from your lordship said captain hedzoff before we take a drink of anything permit us to deliver our kings message  my lordship ha said crim tartary frowning terrifically that title soundeth strange in the anointed ears of a crowned king straightway speak out your message knight and herald  reining up his charger in a most elegant manner close under the kings balcony hedzoff turned to the herald and bade him begin  elephant and castle dropping his trumpet over his shoulder took a large sheet of paper out of his hat and began to read  o yes o yes o yes know all men by these presents that we giglio king of paflagonia grand duke of cappadocia sovereign prince of turkey and the sausage islands having assumed our rightful throne and title long time falsely borne by our usurping uncle styling himself king of paflagonia  ha growled padella  hereby summon the false traitor padella calling himself king of crim tartary  the kings curses were dreadful go on elephant and castle said the intrepid hedzoff  to release from cowardly imprisonment his liege lady and rightful sovereign rosalba queen of crim tartary and restore her to her royal throne in default of which i giglio proclaim the said padella sneak traitor humbug usurper and coward i challenge him to meet me with fists or with pistols with battleaxe or sword with blunderbuss or singlestick alone or at the head of his army on foot or on horseback and will prove my words upon his wicked ugly body  god save the king said captain hedzoff executing a demivolte two semilunes and three caracols  is that all said padella with the terrific calm of concentrated fury  that sir is all my royal masters message here is his majestys letter in autograph and here is his glove and if any gentleman of crim tartary chooses to find fault with his majestys expressions i tuffskin hedzoff captain of the guard am very much at his service and he waved his lance and looked at the assembly all round  and what says my good brother of paflagonia my dear sons fatherinlaw to this rubbish asked the king  the kings uncle hath been deprived of the crown he unjustly wore said hedzoff gravely he and his axminister glumboso are now in prison waiting the sentence of my royal master after the battle of bombardaro  of what asked the surprised padella  of bombardaro where my liege his present majesty would have performed prodigies of velour but that the whole of his uncles army came over to our side with the exception of prince bulbo  ah my boy my boy my bulbo was no traitor cried padella  prince bulbo far from coming over to us ran away sir but i caught him the prince is a prisoner in our army and the most terrific tortures await him if a hair of the princess rosalbas head is injured  do they exclaimed the furious padella who was now perfectly livid with rage do they indeed so much the worse for bulbo ive twenty sons as lovely each as bulbo not one but is as fit to reign as bulbo whip whack flog starve rack punish torture bulbobreak all his bonesroast him or flay him alivepull all his pretty teeth out one by one but justly dear as bulbo is to mejoy of my eyes fond treasure of my soulha ha ha ha revenge is dearer still ho tortures rackmen executionerslight up the fires and make the pincers hot get lots of boiling leadbring out rosalba     xvi how hedzoff rode back again to king giglio  captain hedzoff rode away when king padella uttered this cruel command having done his duty in delivering the message with which his royal master had entrusted him of course he was very sorry for rosalba but what could he do  so he returned to king giglios camp and found the young monarch in a disturbed state of mind smoking cigars in the royal tent his majestys agitation was not appeased by the news that was brought by his ambassador the brutal ruthless ruffian royal wretch giglio exclaimed as englands poesy has well remarked the man that lays his hand upon a woman save in the way of kindness is a villain ha hedzoff  that he is your majesty said the attendant  and didst thou see her flung into the oil and didnt the soothing oilthe emollient oil refuse to boil good hedzoffand to spoil the fairest lady ever eyes did look on  faith good my liege i had no heart to look and see a beauteous lady boiling down i took your royal message to padella and bore his back to you i told him you would hold prince bulbo answerable he only said that he had twenty sons as good as bulbo and forthwith he bade the ruthless executioners proceed  o cruel fathero unhappy son cried the king go some of you and bring prince bulbo hither  bulbo was brought in chains looking very uncomfortable though a prisoner he had been tolerably happy perhaps because his mind was at rest and all the fighting was over and he was playing at marbles with his guards when the king sent for him  oh my poor bulbo said his majesty with looks of infinite compassion hast thou heard the news for you see giglio wanted to break the thing gently to the prince thy brutal father has condemned rosalbappput her to death pppprince bulbo  what killed betsinda boohoohoo cried out bulbo betsinda pretty betsinda dear betsinda she was the dearest little girl in the world i love her better twenty thousand times even than angelica and he went on expressing his grief in so hearty and unaffected a manner that the king was quite touched by it and said shaking bulbos hand that he wished he had known bulbo sooner  bulbo quite unconsciously and meaning for the best offered to come and sit with his majesty and smoke a cigar with him and console him the royal kindness supplied bulbo with a cigar he had not had one he said since he was taken prisoner  and now think what must have been the feelings of the most merciful of monarchs when he informed his prisoner that in consequence of king padellas cruel and dastardly behaviour to rosalba prince bulbo must instantly be executed the noble giglio could not restrain his tears nor could the grenadiers nor the officers nor could bulbo himself when the matter was explained to him and he was brought to understand that his majestys promise of course was above every thing and bulbo must submit so poor bulbo was led out hedzoff trying to console him by pointing out that if he had won the battle of bombardaro he might have hanged prince giglio yes but that is no comfort to me now said poor bulbo nor indeed was it poor fellow  he was told the business would be done the next morning at eight and was taken back to his dungeon where every attention was paid to him the gaolers wife sent him tea and the turnkeys daughter begged him to write his name in her album where a many gentlemen had written it on like occasions bother your album says bulbo the undertaker came and measured him for the handsomest coffin which money could buyeven this didnt console bulbo the cook brought him dishes which he once used to like but he wouldnt touch them he sat down and began writing an adieu to angelica as the clock kept always ticking and the hands drawing nearer to next morning the barber came in at night and offered to shave him for the next day prince bulbo kicked him away and went on writing a few words to princess angelica as the clock kept always ticking and the hands hopping nearer and nearer to next morning he got up on the top of a hatbox on the top of a chair on the top of his bed on the top of his table and looked out to see whether he might escape as the clock kept always ticking and the hands drawing nearer and nearer and nearer  but looking out of the window was one thing and jumping another and the town clock struck seven so he got into bed for a little sleep but the gaoler came and woke him and said git up your royal ighness if you please its ten minutes to eight  so poor bulbo got up he had gone to bed in his clothes the lazy boy and he shook himself and said he didnt mind about dressing or having any breakfast thank you and he saw the soldiers who had come for him lead on he said and they led the way deeply affected and they came into the courtyard and out into the square and there was king giglio come to take leave of him and his majesty most kindly shook hands with him and the take off that marched onwhen hark  hawwurrawwurrawaworr  a roar of wild beasts was heard and who should come riding into the town frightening away the boys and even the beadle and policeman but rosalba  the fact is that when captain hedzoff entered into the court of snapdragon castle and was discoursing with king padella the lions made a dash at the open gate gobbled up the six beefeaters in a jiffy and away they went with rosalba on the back of one of them and they carried her turn and turn about till they came to the city where prince giglios army was encamped  when the king heard of the queens arrival you may think how he rushed out of his breakfastroom to hand her majesty off her lion the lions were grown as fat as pigs now having had hogginarmo and all those beefeaters and were so tame anybody might pat them  while giglio knelt most gracefully and helped the princess bulbo for his part rushed up and kissed the lion he flung his arms round the forest monarch he hugged him and laughed and cried for joy oh you darling old beast oh how glad i am to see you and the dear dear betsthat is rosalba  what is it you poor bulbo said the queen oh how glad i am to see you and she gave him her hand to kiss king giglio slapped him most kindly on the back and said bulbo my boy i am delighted for your sake that her majesty has arrived  so am i said bulbo and you know why captain hedzoff here came up sire it is halfpast eight shall we proceed with the execution  execution what for asked bulbo  an officer only knows his orders replied captain hedzoff showing his warrant on which his majesty king giglio smilingly said prince bulbo was reprieved this time and most graciously invited him to breakfast     xvii how a tremendous battle took place and who won it  as soon as king padella heard what we know already that his victim the lovely rosalba had escaped him his majestys fury knew no bounds and he pitched the lord chancellor lord chamberlain and every officer of the crown whom he could set eyes on into the cauldron of boiling oil prepared for the princess then he ordered out his whole army horse foot and artillery and set forth at the head of an innumerable host and i should think twenty thousand drummers trumpeters and fifers  king giglios advance guard you may be sure kept that monarch acquainted with the enemys dealings and he was in nowise disconcerted he was much too polite to alarm the princess his lovely guest with any unnecessary rumours of battles impending on the contrary he did everything to amuse and divert her gave her a most elegant breakfast dinner lunch and got up a ball for her that evening when he danced with her every single dance  poor bulbo was taken into favour again and allowed to go quite free now he had new clothes given him was called my good cousin by his majesty and was treated with the greatest distinction by everybody but it was easy to see he was very melancholy the fact is the sight of betsinda who looked perfectly lovely in an elegant new dress set poor bulbo frantic in love with her again and he never thought about angelica now princess bulbo whom he had left at home and who as we know did not care much about him  the king dancing the twentyfifth polka with rosalba remarked with wonder the ring she wore and then rosalba told him how she had got it from gruffanuff who no doubt had picked it up when angelica flung it away  yes says the fairy blackstick who had come to see the young people and who had very likely certain plans regarding them that ring i gave the queen giglios mother who was not saving your presence a very wise woman it is enchanted and whoever wears it looks beautiful in the eyes of the world i made poor prince bulbo when he was christened the present of a rose which made him look handsome while he had it but he gave it to angelica who instantly looked beautiful again whilst bulbo relapsed into his natural plainness  rosalba needs no ring i am sure says giglio with a low bow she is beautiful enough in my eyes without any enchanted aid  oh sir said rosalba  take off the ring and try said the king and resolutely drew the ring off her finger in his eyes she looked just as handsome as before  the king was thinking of throwing the ring away as it was so dangerous and made all the people so mad about rosalba but being a prince of great humour and good humour too he cast eyes upon a poor youth who happened to be looking on very disconsolately and said  bulbo my poor lad come and try on this ring the princess rosalba makes it a present to you  the magic properties of this ring were uncommonly strong for no sooner had bulbo put it on but lo and behold he appeared a personable agreeable young prince enoughwith a fine complexion fair hair rather stout and with bandy legs but these were encased in such a beautiful pair of yellow morocco boots that nobody remarked them and bulbos spirits rose up almost immediately after he had looked in the glass and he talked to their majesties in the most lively agreeable manner and danced opposite the queen with one of the prettiest maids of honour and after looking at her majesty could not help saying  how very odd she is very pretty but not so extraordinarily handsome  oh no by no means says the maid of honour  but what care i dear sir says the queen who overheard them if you think i am goodlooking enough  his majestys glance in reply to this affectionate speech was such that no painter could draw it and the fairy blackstick said bless you my darling children now you are united and happy and now you see what i said from the first that a little misfortune has done you both good you giglio had you been bred in prosperity would scarcely have learned to read or writeyou would have been idle and extravagant and could not have been a good king as now you will be you rosalba would have been so flattered that your little head might have been turned like angelicas who thought herself too good for giglio  as if anybody could be good enough for him cried rosalba  oh you you darling says giglio and so she was and he was just holding out his arms in order to give her a hug before the whole company when a messenger came rushing in and said my lord the enemy  to arms cries giglio  oh mercy says rosalba and fainted of course  he snatched one kiss from her lips and rushed forth to the field of battle  the fairy had provided king giglio with a suit of armour which was not only embroidered all over with jewels and blinding to your eyes to look at but was waterproof gunproof and swordproof so that in the midst of the very hottest battles his majesty rode about as calmly as if he had been a british grenadier at alma were i engaged in fighting for my country i should like such a suit of armour as prince giglio wore but you know he was a prince of a fairy tale and they always have these wonderful things  besides the fairy armour the prince had a fairy horse which would gallop at any pace you pleased and a fairy sword which would lengthen and run through a whole regiment of enemies at once with such a weapon at command i wonder for my part he thought of ordering his army out but forth they all came in magnificent new uniforms hedzoff and the princes two college friends each commanding a division and his majesty prancing in person at the head of them all  ah if i had the pen of a sir archibald alison my dear friends would i not now entertain you with the account of a most tremendous shindy should not fine blows be struck dreadful wounds be delivered arrows darken the air cannon balls crash through the battalions cavalry charge infantry infantry pitch into cavalry bugles blow drums beat horses neigh fifes sing soldiers roar swear hurray officers shout out forward my men this way lads give it em boys fight for king giglio and the cause of right king padella for ever would i not describe all this i say and in the very finest language too but this humble pen does not possess the skill necessary for the description of combats in a word the overthrow of king padellas army was so complete that if they had been russians you could not have wished them to be more utterly smashed and confounded  as for that usurping monarch having performed acts of velour much more considerable than could be expected of a royal ruffian and usurper who had such a bad cause and who was so cruel to womenas for king padella i say when his army ran away the king ran away too kicking his first general prince punchikoff from his saddle and galloping away on the princes horse having indeed had twentyfive or twentysix of his own shot under him hedzoff coming up and finding punchikoff down as you may imagine very speedily disposed of him meanwhile king padella was scampering off as hard as his horse could lay legs to ground fast as he scampered i promise you somebody else galloped faster and that individual as no doubt you are aware was the royal giglio who kept bawling out stay traitor turn miscreant and defend thyself stand tyrant coward ruffian royal wretch till i cut thy ugly head from thy usurping shoulders and with his fairy sword which elongated itself at will his majesty kept poking and prodding padella in the back until that wicked monarch roared with anguish  when he was fairly brought to bay padella turned and dealt prince giglio a prodigious crack over the sconce with his battleaxe a most enormous weapon which had cut down i dont know how many regiments in the course of the afternoon but law bless you though the blow fell right down on his majestys helmet it made no more impression than if padella had struck him with a pat of butter his battleaxe crumpled up in padellas hand and the royal giglio laughed for very scorn at the impotent efforts of that atrocious usurper  at the ill success of his blow the crim tartar monarch was justly irritated if says he to giglio you ride a fairy horse and wear fairy armour what on earth is the use of my hitting you i may as well give myself up a prisoner at once your majesty wont i suppose be so mean as to strike a poor fellow who cant strike again  the justice of padellas remark struck the magnanimous giglio do you yield yourself a prisoner padella says he  of course i do says padella  do you acknowledge rosalba as your rightful queen and give up the crown and all your treasures to your rightful mistress  if i must i must says padella who was naturally very sulky  by this time king giglios aidesdecamp had come up whom his majesty ordered to bind the prisoner and they tied his hands behind him and bound his legs tight under his horse having set him with his face to the tail and in this fashion he was led back to king giglios quarters and thrust into the very dungeon where young bulbo had been confined  padella who was a very different person in the depth of his distress to padella the proud wearer of the crim tartar crown now most affectionately and earnestly asked to see his sonhis dear eldest boyhis darling bulbo and that goodnatured young man never once reproached his haughty parent for his unkind conduct the day before when he would have left bulbo to be shot without any pity but came to see his father and spoke to him through the grating of the door beyond which he was not allowed to go and brought him some sandwiches from the grand supper which his majesty was giving above stairs in honour of the brilliant victory which had just been achieved  i cannot stay with you long sir says bulbo who was in his best ball dress as he handed his father in the prog i am engaged to dance the next quadrille with her majesty queen rosalba and i hear the fiddles playing at this very moment  so bulbo went back to the ballroom and the wretched padella ate his solitary supper in silence and tears  all was now joy in king giglios circle dancing feasting fun illuminations and jollifications of all sorts ensued the people through whose villages they passed were ordered to illuminate their cottages at night and scatter flowers on the roads during the day they were requested and i promise you they did not like to refuse to serve the troops liberally with eatables and wine besides the army was enriched by the immense quantity of plunder which was found in king padellas camp and taken from his soldiers who after they had given up everything were allowed to fraternise with the conquerors and the united forces marched back by easy stages towards king giglios capital his royal banner and that of queen rosalba being carried in front of the troops hedzoff was made a duke and a fieldmarshal smith and jones were promoted to be earls the crim tartar order of the pumpkin and the paflagonian decoration of the cucumber were freely distributed by their majesties to the army queen rosalba wore the paflagonian ribbon of the cucumber across her ridinghabit whilst king giglio never appeared without the grand cordon of the pumpkin how the people cheered them as they rode along side by side they were pronounced to be the handsomest couple ever seen that was a matter of course but they really were very handsome and had they been otherwise would have looked so they were so happy their majesties were never separated during the whole day but breakfasted dined and supped together always and rode side by side interchanging elegant compliments and indulging in the most delightful conversation at night her majestys ladies of honour who had all rallied round her the day after king padellas defeat came and conducted her to the apartments prepared for her whilst king giglio surrounded by his gentlemen withdrew to his own royal quarters it was agreed they should be married as soon as they reached the capital and orders were dispatched to the archbishop of blombodinga to hold himself in readiness to perform the interesting ceremony duke hedzoff carried the message and gave instructions to have the royal castle splendidly refurnished and painted afresh the duke seized glumboso the exprime minister and made him refund that considerable sum of money which the old scoundrel had secreted out of the late kings treasure he also clapped valoroso into prison who by the way had been dethroned for some considerable period past and when the exmonarch weakly remonstrated hedzoff said a soldier sir knows but his duty my orders are to lock you up along with the exking padella whom i have brought hither a prisoner under guard so these two exroyal personages were sent for a year to the house of correction and thereafter were obliged to become monks of the severest order of flagellants in which state by fasting by vigils by flogging which they administered to one another humbly but resolutely no doubt they exhibited a repentance for their past misdeeds usurpations and private and public crimes  as for glumboso that rogue was sent to the galleys and never had an opportunity to steal any more     xviii how they all journeyed back to the capital  the fairy blackstick by whose means this young king and queen had certainly won their respective crowns back would come not unfrequently to pay them a little visitas they were riding in their triumphal progress towards giglios capitalchange her wand into a pony and travel by their majesties side giving them the very best advice i am not sure that king giglio did not think the fairy and her advice rather a bore fancying it was his own velour and merits which had put him on his throne and conquered padella and in fine i fear he rather gave himself airs towards his best friend and patroness she exhorted him to deal justly by his subjects to draw mildly on the taxes never to break his promise when he had once given itand in all respects to be a good king  a good king my dear fairy cries rosalba of course he will break his promise can you fancy my giglio would ever do anything so improper so unlike him no never and she looked fondly towards giglio whom she thought a pattern of perfection  why is fairy blackstick always advising me and telling me how to manage my government and warning me to keep my word does she suppose that i am not a man of sense and a man of honour asks giglio testily methinks she rather presumes upon her position  hush dear giglio says rosalba you know blackstick has been very kind to us and we must not offend her but the fairy was not listening to giglios testy observations she had fallen back and was trotting on her pony now by master bulbos side who rode a donkey and made himself generally beloved in the army by his cheerfulness kindness and goodhumour to everybody he was eager to see his darling angelica he thought there never was such a charming being blackstick did not tell him it was the possession of the magic rose that made angelica so lovely in his eyes she brought him the very best accounts of his little wife whose misfortunes and humiliations had indeed very greatly improved her and you see she could whisk off on her wand a hundred miles in a minute and be back in no time and so carry polite messages from bulbo to angelica and from angelica to bulbo and comfort that young man upon his journey  when the royal party arrived at the last stage before you reach blombodinga who should be in waiting in her carriage there with her lady of honour by her side but the princess angelica she rushed into her husbands arms scarcely stopping to make a passing curtsey to the king and queen she had no eyes but for bulbo who appeared perfectly lovely to her on account of the fairy ring which he wore whilst she herself wearing the magic rose in her bonnet seemed entirely beautiful to the enraptured bulbo  a splendid luncheon was served to the royal party of which the archbishop the chancellor duke hedzoff countess gruffanuff and all our friends partook the fairy blackstick being seated on the left of king giglio with bulbo and angelica beside her you could hear the joybells ringing in the capital and the guns which the citizens were firing off in honour of their majesties  what can have induced that hideous old gruffanuff to dress herself up in such an absurd way did you ask her to be your bridesmaid my dear says giglio to rosalba what a figure of fun gruffy is  gruffy was seated opposite their majesties between the archbishop and the lord chancellor and a figure of fun she certainly was for she was dressed in a low white silk dress with lace over a wreath of white roses on her wig a splendid lace veil and her yellow old neck was covered with diamonds she ogled the king in such a manner that his majesty burst out laughing  eleven oclock cries giglio as the great cathedral bell of blombodinga tolled that hour gentlemen and ladies we must be starting archbishop you must be at church i think before twelve  we must be at church before twelve sighs out gruffanuff in a languishing voice hiding her old face behind her fan  and then i shall be the happiest man in my dominions cries giglio with an elegant bow to the blushing rosalba  oh my giglio oh my dear majesty exclaims gruffanuff and can it be that this happy moment at length has arrived  of course it has arrived says the king  and that i am about to become the enraptured bride of my adored giglio continues gruffanuff lend me a smellingbottle somebody i certainly shall faint with joy  you my bride roars out giglio  you marry my prince cried poor little rosalba  pooh nonsense the womans mad exclaims the king and all the courtiers exhibited by their countenances and expressions marks of surprise or ridicule or incredulity or wonder  i should like to know who else is going to be married if i am not shrieks out gruffanuff i should like to know if king giglio is a gentleman and if there is such a thing as justice in paflagonia lord chancellor my lord archbishop will your lordships sit by and see a poor fond confiding tender creature put upon has not prince giglio promised to marry his barbara is not this giglios signature does not this paper declare that he is mine and only mine and she handed to his grace the archbishop the document which the prince signed that evening when she wore the magic ring and giglio drank so much champagne and the old archbishop taking out his eyeglasses read  this is to give notice that i giglio only son of savio king of paflagonia hereby promise to marry the charming barbara griselda countess gruffanuff and widow of the late jenkins gruffanuff esq  hm says the archbishop the document is certainly aa document  phoo says the lord chancellor the signature is not in his majestys handwriting indeed since his studies at bosforo giglio had made an immense improvement in caligraphy  is it your handwriting giglio cries the fairy blackstick with an awful severity of countenance  yyyes poor giglio gasps out i had quite forgotten the confounded paper she cant mean to hold me by it you old wretch what will you take to let me off help the queen some oneher majesty has fainted  chop her head off exclaim the impetuous smother the old witch  hedzoff the ardent smith and pitch her into the river the faithful jones  but gruffanuff flung her arms round the archbishops neck and bellowed out justice justice my lord chancellor so loudly that her piercing shrieks caused everybody to pause as for rosalba she was borne away lifeless by her ladies and you may imagine the look of agony which giglio cast towards that lovely being as his hope his joy his darling his all in all was thus removed and in her place the horrid old gruffanuff rushed up to his side and once more shrieked out justice justice  wont you take that sum of money which glumboso hid says giglio two hundred and eighteen thousand millions or thereabouts its a handsome sum  i will have that and you too says gruffanuff  let us throw the crown jewels into the bargain gasps out giglio  i will wear them by my giglios side says gruffanuff  will half threequarters fivesixths nineteentwentieths of my kingdom do countess asks the trembling monarch  what were all europe to me without you my giglio cries gruff kissing his hand  i wont i cant i shantill resign the crown first shouts giglio tearing away his hand but gruff clung to it  i have a competency my love she says and with thee and a cottage thy barbara will be happy  giglio was half mad with rage by this time i will not marry her says he oh fairy fairy give me counsel and as he spoke he looked wildly round at the severe face of the fairy blackstick  why is fairy blackstick always advising me and warning me to keep my word does she suppose that i am not a man of honour said the fairy quoting giglios own haughty words he quailed under the brightness of her eyes he felt that there was no escape for him from that awful inquisition  well archbishop said he in a dreadful voice that made his grace start since this fairy has led me to the height of happiness but to dash me down into the depths of despair since i am to lose rosalba let me at least keep my honour get up countess and let us be married i can keep my word but i can die afterwards  oh dear giglio cries gruffanuff skipping up i knew i knew i could trust theei knew that my prince was the soul of honour jump into your carriages ladies and gentlemen and let us go to church at once and as for dying dear giglio no nothou wilt forget that insignificant little chambermaid of a queenthou wilt live to be consoled by thy barbara she wishes to be a queen and not a queen dowager my gracious lord and hanging upon poor giglios arm and leering and grinning in his face in the most disgusting manner this old wretch tripped off in her white satin shoes and jumped into the very carriage which had been got ready to convey giglio and rosalba to church the cannons roared again the bells pealed triplebobmajors the people came out flinging flowers upon the path of the royal bride and bridegroom and gruff looked out of the gilt coach window and bowed and grinned to them phoo the horrid old wretch     xix and now we come to the last scene in the pantomime  the many ups and downs of her life had given the princess rosalba prodigious strength of mind and that highly principled young woman presently recovered from her faintingfit out of which fairy blackstick by a precious essence which the fairy always carried in her pocket awakened her instead of tearing her hair crying and bemoaning herself and fainting again as many young women would have done rosalba remembered that she owed an example of firmness to her subjects and though she loved giglio more than her life was determined as she told the fairy not to interfere between him and justice or to cause him to break his royal word  i cannot marry him but i shall love him always says she to blackstick i will go and be present at his marriage with the countess and sign the book and wish them happy with all my heart i will see when i get home whether i cannot make the new queen some handsome presents the crim tartary crown diamonds are uncommonly fine and i shall never have any use for them i will live and die unmarried like queen elizabeth and of course i shall leave my crown to giglio when i quit this world let us go and see them married my dear fairy let me say one last farewell to him and then if you please i will return to my own dominions  so the fairy kissed rosalba with peculiar tenderness and at once changed her wand into a very comfortable coachandfour with a steady coachman and two respectable footmen behind and the fairy and rosalba got into the coach which angelica and bulbo entered after them as for honest bulbo he was blubbering in the most pathetic manner quite overcome by rosalbas misfortune she was touched by the honest fellows sympathy promised to restore to him the confiscated estates of duke padella his father and created him as he sat there in the coach prince highness and first grandee of the crim tartar empire the coach moved on and being a fairy coach soon came up with the bridal procession  before the ceremony at church it was the custom in paflagonia as it is in other countries for the bride and bridegroom to sign the contract of marriage which was to be witnessed by the chancellor minister lord mayor and principal officers of state now as the royal palace was being painted and furnished anew it was not ready for the reception of the king and his bride who proposed at first to take up their residence at the princes palace that one which valoroso occupied when angelica was born and before he usurped the throne  so the marriage party drove up to the palace the dignitaries got out of their carriages and stood aside poor rosalba stepped out of her coach supported by bulbo and stood almost fainting up against the railings so as to have a last look of her dear giglio as for blackstick she according to her custom had flown out of the coach window in some inscrutable manner and was now standing at the palace door  giglio came up the steps with his horrible bride on his arm looking as pale as if he was going to execution he only frowned at the fairy blackstickhe was angry with her and thought she came to insult his misery  get out of the way pray says gruffanuff haughtily i wonder why you are always poking your nose into other peoples affairs  are you determined to make this poor young man unhappy says blackstick  to marry him yes what business is it of yours pray madam dont say you to a queen cries gruffanuff  you wont take the money he offered you  no  you wont let him off his bargain though you know you cheated him when you made him sign the paper  impudence policemen remove this woman cries gruffanuff and the policemen were rushing forward but with a wave of her wand the fairy struck them all like so many statues in their places  you wont take anything in exchange for your bond mrs gruffanuff cries the fairy with awful severity i speak for the last time  no shrieks gruffanuff stamping with her foot ill have my husband my husband my husband  you shall have your husband the fairy blackstick cried and advancing a step laid her hand upon the nose of the knocker  as she touched it the brass nose seemed to elongate the open mouth opened still wider and uttered a roar which made everybody start the eyes rolled wildly the arms and legs uncurled themselves writhed about and seemed to lengthen with each twist the knocker expanded into a figure in yellow livery six feet high the screws by which it was fixed to the door unloosed themselves and jenkins gruffanuff once more trod the threshold off which he had been lifted more than twenty years ago  masters not at home says jenkins just in his old voice and mrs jenkins giving a dreadful youp fell down in a fit in which nobody minded her  for everybody was shouting huzzay huzzay hip hip hurray long live the king and queen were such things ever seen no never never never the fairy blackstick for ever  the bells were ringing double peals the guns roaring and banging most prodigiously bulbo was embracing everybody the lord chancellor was flinging up his wig and shouting like a madman hedzoff had got the archbishop round the waist and they were dancing a jig for joy and as for giglio i leave you to imagine what he was doing and if he kissed rosalba once twicetwenty thousand times im sure i dont think he was wrong  so gruffanuff opened the hall door with a low bow just as he had been accustomed to do and they all went in and signed the book and then they went to church and were married and the fairy blackstick sailed away on her cane and was never more heard of in paflagonia  and here ends the fireside pantomime
