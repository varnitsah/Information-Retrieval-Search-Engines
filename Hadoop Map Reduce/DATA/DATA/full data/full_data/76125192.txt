tastes and follies has its limit your conduct is a disgrace to the rancho you must go  sandy meditatively well i reckon perhaps id better  don jose aside his coolness is suspicious can it be that he expects the girl will follow him mother of god perhaps it has been already planned between them good thank heaven i can end it here aloud diego  sandy old man  don jose for my daughters sake you understandfor her sakei am willing to try you once more hark ye my daughter is young foolish and romantic i have reason to believe from her conduct lately that she has contracted an intimacy with some americano and that in her ignorance her foolishness she has allowed that man to believe that he might aspire to her hand good now listen to me you shall stay in her service you shall find outyou are in her confidenceyou shall find out this american this adventurer this lover if you please of the dona jovita my daughter and you will tell him thisyou will tell him that a union with him is impossible forbidden that the hour she attempts it without my consent she is penniless that this estate this rancho passes into the hands of the holy church where even your laws cannot reach it  sandy leaning familiarly over the table but suppose that he sees that little bluff and calls ye  don jose i do not comprehend you coldly  sandy suppose he loves that gal and will take her as she stands without a cent or hide or hair of yer old cattle  don jose scornfully supposea miracle hark ye diego it is now five years since i have known your countrymen these smart americanos i have yet to know

sandy soberly and seriously after a pause well i reckon i had better rising ive a few duds old man to put up it wont take me long goes to l and pauses  don jose aside ah he hesitates he is changing his mind sandy returns slowly to table pours out glass of liquor nods to don jose and drinks i looks towards ye ole man adios  exit sandy  don jose his coolness is perfect if these americans are cayotes in their advances they are lions in retreat bueno i begin to respect him but it will be just as well to set concho to track him to the mission and i will see that he leaves the rancho alone  exit jose  enter hurriedly jovita castro in riding habit with whip  so chiquita not yet saddled and that spy concho haunting the plains for the last halfhour what an air of mystery something awful something deliciously dreadful has happened either my amiable drunkard has forgotten to despatch concho on his usual fools errand or he is himself lying helpless in some ditch was there ever a girl so persecuted with a father wrapped in mystery a lover nameless and shrouded in the obscurity of some olympian height and her only confidant and messenger a bacchus instead of a mercury heigh ho and in another hour don juanhe told me i might call him johnwill be waiting for me outside the convent wall what if diego fails me to go there alone would be madness who else would be as charmingly unconscious and inattentive as this american vagabond goes to l ah my saddle and blanket hidden he has been interrupted some one has been watching this freak of my fathers means something and tonight of all nights the night that oakhurst was to disclose himself and tell me all what is to be done hark diego without singing       oh heres your aguardiente          drink it down   jovita it is diego and mother of god drunk again  enter sandy carrying pack intoxicated staggers to centre and observing jovita takes off his hat respectfully  jovita shaking him by the shoulders passionately diego how

selfpossessed ef ye hed a father miss ez instead o harkinin to your slightest wish and surroundin ye with luxury hed made your infancy a struggle for life among strangers and your childhood a disgrace and a temptation ef he had left ye with no company but want with no companions but guilt with no mother but suffering ef he had made your home this home so unhappy so vile so terrible so awful that the crowded streets and gutters of a great city was something to fly to for relief ef he had made his presence his very nameyour name miss allowin it was your fatheref he had made that presence so

house at four p m and at twelve oclock at night the young lady trying the gate secretly this may be spanish resignation and filial submission but it looks very like yankee disobedience and forwardness perhaps its well that the keys are in my pocket this fond confiding papist may find the heretic american father of some service conceals himself behind pillar of corridor  after a pause the head of john oakhurst appears over the wall of corridor he climbs up to roof of corridor and descends very quietly and deliberately to stage  oakhurst dusting his clothing with his handkerchief i never knew

up for a week or two the rancho wont suffer  jovita well  oakhurst well  jovita passionately there having scaled the wall at the risk of being discoveredthis is all you have to say turning away  oakhurst quietly perhaps jovita taking her hand with grave earnestness to a clandestine intimacy like ours there is but one end it is not merely elopement not merely marriage it is exposure sooner or later you and i must face the eyes we now shun what matters if tonight or later  jovita quickly i am ready it was you who  oakhurst it was i who first demanded secrecy but it was i who told you when we last met that i would tell you why tonight  jovita i am ready but hear me juan nothing can change my faith in you  oakhurst sadly you know not what you say listen my child i am a gambler not the man who lavishes his fortune at the gamingtable for excitements sake not the fanatic who stakes his own earningsperhaps the confided earnings of otherson a single coup no he is the man who loseswhom the world deplores pities and forgives i am the man who winswhom the world hates and despises  jovita i do not understand you juan  oakhurst so much the better perhaps but you must hear me i make a professionan occupation more exacting more wearying more laborious than that of your meanest herdsmanof that which others make a dissipation of the senses and yet jovita there is not the meanest vaquero in this ranch who playing against me winning or losing is not held to be my superior i have no friendsonly confederates even the woman who dares to pity me must do it in secret  jovita but you

share my fortunes my disgrace my losses who is willing to leave her old life of indulgence of luxury of respectability for mine you are frightened little dove compose yourself soothing her tenderly

red gulch well pshaw what is that to me the camp is made up of refugeesmen who perhaps have good reason to hide a name that may be infamous the name that would publish a crime nonsense crime and sandy no shame and guilt do not hide themselves in those honest but occasionally somewhat bloodshot eyes besides goodness knows the poor fellows weakness is palpable enough no that is not the reason it is no guilt that keeps his name hiddenat least not his seating herself and arranging flowers in her lap poor sandy he must have climbed the eastern summit to get this see the rosy sunrise still lingers in its very petals the dew is fresh upon it dear little mountain baby i really believe that fellow got up before daylight to climb that giddy height and secure its virgin freshness and to think in a moment of spite id have given it to that bombastic warrior pause that was a fine offer you refused just now miss mary think of it a home of luxury a position of assured respect and homage the life i once led with all its difficulties smoothed away its uncertainty dispelledthink of it my poor mothers dream fulfilledi her daughter the mistress of affluence the queen of social power what a temptation ah miss mary was it a temptation was there nothing in your free life here that stiffened your courage that steeled the adamant of your refusal or was it only the memory of your mothers wrongs luxury and wealth could you command a dwelling more charming than this position and respect is not the awful admiration of these lawless men more fascinating than the perilous flattery of gentlemen like col starbottle is not the devotion of these outcasts more complimentary than the lipservice of perfumed gallantry pause its very odd he doesnt come i wonder if that conceited old fool said anything to him rises and then seats herself smiling he has come he is dodging in and out of the manganita bushes below the spring i suppose he imagines my visitor still here the bashful fool if anybody should see him it would be enough to make a petty scandal ill give him a talkingto pause i wonder if the ridiculous fool has gone to sleep in those bushes rises well let him it will help him

for five hundred dollars more so putting down letter if we were given to pride and vainglory we might well be puffed up with the fame of our works and the contagion of our example yet i fear that with

letters with the others there is no answer has young mr alexander come in yet  jackson he only left here an hour ago it was steamer day yesterday he was up all night sir  old morton aside true and the

smoke in the room this morning when i entered and ashes on the carpet i know that young mr alexander has abandoned the pernicious habit see that it does not occur again  jackson yes sir aside i must warn mr alexander that his friends must be more careful and yet those ashes were good for a deposit of fifty thousand  old morton is any one waiting  jackson yes sirdon jose castro and mr capper  old

immaculately perfect well well at least her presence will make my home less lonely an attendant and child a child ah if he my boy my alexander were still a child i might warm this cold cold heart in his sunshine strange that i cannot reconstruct from this dutiful submissive obedient industrious alexanderthis redeemed outcast this son who shares my life my fortunes my heartthe foolish wilful

becoming grave and lugubrious no no these are the whisperings of the flesh why should i find fault with him for being all that a righteous conversion demandsall that i asked and prayed for no

gentleman who carried mr alexanders valise from the boat was the seven hundred and eightieth  old morton explain yourself sir  jackson he imparted to me while receiving his stipend the fact that he did not believe young mr alexander was your son an hour later sir he also imparted to me confidentially that he believed you were his father and requested the loan of five dollars to be repaid by you to enable him to purchase a clean shirt and appear before you in respectable condition he waited for you an hour and expressed some indignation that he had not an equal show with others to throw himself into your arms  don jose rising aside and uplifting his hands carramba these americanos are of the devil aloud enough don alexandro then you think this letter is only worth  old morton one moment i can perhaps tell you exactly its market value to jackson go on sir  jackson at halfpast ten sir then being slightly under the influence of liquor he accepted the price of a deck passage to stockton  old morton how much was that sir  jackson fifty cents  old morton exactly so there you have sir to don jose the market value of the information you have received i would advise you as a business matter not to pay more as a business matter you can at any time draw upon us for the amount to jackson admit mr capper exit jackson  don jose rising with dignity this is an insult don alexandro  old morton you are wrong mr castro it is business sought i believe by yourself now that it is transacted i beg you to dine with me tomorrow to meet my niece no offence sir no offence come

misfortune of a serious loss by robbery  old morton aside so our mishap is known everywhere aloud no serious misfortune mr castro even if we do not recover the money adios  exit don jose  old morton the stiffnecked papist that he should dare for the sake of his blackbrowed froward daughter toquestion the faith on which i have pinned my future well with gods blessing i gave him some wholesome discipline if it were not for my covenant with alexanderand nobly he has fulfilled his parti should forbid his alliance with the blood of this spying jesuit  enter mr jackson leading in capper

previous life  old morton stiffly i have already told you he is an appointee of my sons  capper yes aside like master like man aloud well to business we have worked up the robbery we have reached two conclusionsone that the work was not done by professionals the other consequent upon this that you cant recover the money  old morton excuse me sir but i do not see the last conclusion  capper then listen the professional thief has only one or two ways of disposing of his plunder and these ways are always well known to us good your stolen coin has not been disposed of in the regular way through the usual hands which we could at any time seize of this we are satisfied  old morton how do you know it  capper in this way the only clew we have to the identification of the missing money were two boxes of mexican doubloons  old morton aside mr castros special deposit he may have reason for his interest aloud go on  capper it is a coin rare in circulation in the interior the night after the robbery the dealer of a montetable in sacramento paid out five thousand dollars in doubloons he declared it was taken in at the table and could not identify the players of course of course so far you see you are helpless we have only established one fact that the robber isissignificantly a gambler  old morton quietly the regular trade of the thief seems to me to be of little importance if you cannot identify him or recover my money but go on sir go on or is this all  capper aside the old fool is blind that is natural aloud it is not all the crime will doubtless be repeated the man who has access to your vaults who has taken only thirty thousand dollars when he could have secured half a millionthis man who has already gambled that thirty thousand awaywill not stop there he will in a day or two perhaps today try to retrieve his losses out of your capital i am here to prevent it  old morton becoming interested how  capper give me for fortyeight hours free access to this building let me conceal myself somewhere anywhere within these walls let it be without the knowledge of your clerks even of your son  old morton proudly mr alexander morton is absent today there is no other reason why he should not be here to consent to the acts of his partner and father  capper quickly very good it is only to insure absolute secrecy  old morton aside another robbery might excite a suspicion worse for our credit than our actual loss there is a significant earnestness about this man that awakens my fears if alexander were only here aloud i accept capper has been trying doors r and l  capper what room is this at r  old morton my sons i would prefer  capper and this at l  old morton mine sir if you choose  capper locking door and putting key in his pocket this will do oblige me by making the necessary arrangements in your countingroom  old morton hesitating and aside he is right perhaps it is only prudence and i am saving alexander additional care and annoyance exit  enter mr

goodnight exit york  oakhurst follows him to door and then returns to desk throwing himself in chair and burying his face in his hands  oakhurst with deep feeling it needed but this to fill the measure of my degradation i have borne the suspicions of the old mans enemies the halfpitying halfcontemptuous sympathy of his friends even his own cold heartless fanatical fulfilment of his sense of duty but thisthis confidence from one who had most reason to scorn me this trust from one who knew me as i wasthis is the hardest burden and he too in time will know me to be an impostor he tooa reformed man but he has honorably retraced his steps and won the position i hold by a trick an imposture and what is all my labor beside his honest sincerity i have fought against the chances that might discover my deception against the enemies who would overthrow me against the fate that put me here and i have been successfulyes a successful impostor i have even fought against the human instinct that told this fierce foolish old man that i was an alien to his house to his blood i have even felt him scan my face eagerly for some reflection of his longlost boy for some realization of his dream and i have seen him turn away cold heartsick and despairing what matters that i have been to him devoted untiring submissive ay a better son to him than his own weak flesh and blood would have been he would tomorrow cast me forth to welcome the outcast sandy morton well what matters recklessly nothing in six days it will be over in six days the year of my probation will have passed in six days i will disclose to him the deceit i have practised and will face the world again as john oakhurst the gambler who staked and lost all on a single cast and jovita well wellthe game is made it

lock of the countinghouse door enter and turn the key on the clerks in this parlor and carry away a box of doubloons not yet placed in the vaults by the porter and all this done so cautiously that the clerks within knew nothing of it until notified of the open street door by the private watchman and so boldly that the watchman seeing them here believed them clerks of the bank and let them go

which as his relative i wont put up with  jovita passionately but hear me miss mary it is a year since we were betrothed and such a betrothal why i was signed sealed and delivered to him on conditions as if i were a part of the rancho and the very night too i had engaged to run away with him and during that year i have seen the gentleman twiceyes twice  miss mary but he has written  jovita mother of god yesletters delivered by my father sent to his care read by him first of course letters hoping that i was well and obeying my fathers commands letters assuring me of his unaltered devotion letters that compared with the ones he used to hide in the confessional of the ruined mission church were as ice to fire were as that snowflower you value so much mary to this mariposa blossom i wear in my hair and then to think that this manthis john oakhurst as i knew him this man who used to ride twenty miles for a smile from me on the church porch this don juan who leaped that garden wall fifteen feet mary if it is an inch and made old concho his steppingstone this man who daily perilled death for my sakeis changed into this formal methodical man of businessisisi tell you theres a woman at the bottom of it i know it sure  miss mary aside how can i tell her about the duchess i wont aloud but listen my dear jovita you know he is under probation for you jovita all this is for you his father is cold methodical unsympathetic he looks only to his bond with this sonthis son that he treats even in matters of the heart as a business partner remember on his complete reformation and subjection to his fathers will depends your hand remember the agreement  jovita the agreement yes it is the agreement always the agreement may the devil fly away with the agreement look you miss mary i dona jovita didnt fall in love with an agreement it was with a man why i might have married a dozen agreementsyes of a shorter limitation than this crossing  miss mary yes but what if your lover had failed to keep those promises by which he was to gain your hand what if he were a man incapable of selfcontrol what if he wereaa drunkard  jovita musing a drunkard aside there was diego he was a

anything rather than a cold calculating average of all the virtues  miss mary aside i who aspire to be her teacher am only her pupil aloud but what if in this very drunkenness this recklessness he had once loved and worshipped another woman what if you discovered all this afterafterhe had won your heart  jovita i should adore him ah miss mary love differs from all the other contagious diseases the last time a man is exposed to it he takes it most readily and has it the worst but you you cannot sympathize with me you have some lover the ideal of the virtues some man as correct as well regulated
