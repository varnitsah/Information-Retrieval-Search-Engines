60102009	sailors knots  by ww jacobs   1909    keeping up appearances   everybody is superstitious said the nightwatchman as he gave utterance to a series of chirruping endearments to a black cat with one eye that had just been using a leg of his trousers as a serviette if that cat ad stole some mens suppers theyd have acted foolish and suffered for it all the rest of their lives  he scratched the cat behind the ear and despite himself his face darkened  slung it over the side they would he said longingly and chucked bits o coke at it till it sank  as i said afore everybody is superstitious and those that aint ought to be nightwatchmen for a timethat ud cure em  i knew one man that killed a black cat and arter that for the rest of his life he could never get three sheets in the wind without seeing its ghost  spoilt his life for im it did  he scratched the cats other ear  i only left it a moment while i went round to the bulls head he said slowly filling his pipe and i thought id put it out o reach  some men  his fingers twined round the animals neck then with a sigh he rose and took a turn or two on the jetty  superstitiousness is right and proper to a certain extent he said resuming his seat but o course like everything else some people carry it too fartheyd believe anything  weakminded they are and if youre in no hurry i can tell you a tale of a pal o mine bill burtenshaw by name thatll prove my words  illustration superstitiousness is right and proper to a certain extent  his mother was superstitious afore im and always knew when er friends died by hearing three loud taps on the wall  the ony mistake she ever made was one night when arter losing no less than seven friends she found out it was the man next door hanging pictures at three oclock in the morning  she found it out by im hitting is thumbnail  for the first few years arter he grew up bill went to sea and that ony made im more superstitious than ever  him and a pal named silas winch went several vyges together and their talk used to be that creepy that some o the chaps was amost afraid to be left on deck alone of a night silas was a longfaced miserable sort o chap always looking on the black side o things and shaking his ead over it  he thought nothing o seeing ghosts and pore old ben huggins slept on the floor for a week by reason of a ghost with its throat cut that silas saw in his bunk  he gave silas arf a dollar and a necktie to change bunks with im  when bill burtenshaw left the sea and got married he lost sight of silas altogether and the ony thing he ad to remind him of im was a piece o paper which they ad both signed with their blood promising that the fust one that died would appear to the other  bill agreed to it one evenin when he didnt know wot he was doing and for years arterwards e used to get the cold creeps down is back when he thought of silas dying fust  and the idea of dying fust imself gave im cold creeps all over  bill was a very good husband when he was sober but is money was two pounds a week and when a man has all that and ony a wife to keep out of it its natural for im to drink  mrs burtenshaw tried all sorts o ways and means of curing im but it was no use  bill used to think o ways too knowing the arm the drink was doing im and his favrite plan was for is missis to empty a bucket o cold water over im every time he came ome the worse for licker  she did it once but as she ad to spend the rest o the night in the back yard it wasnt tried again  bill got worse as he got older and even made away with the furniture to get drink with  and then he used to tell is missis that he was drove to the pub because his ome was so uncomfortable  just at that time things was at their worst silas winch who appened to be ashore and ad got bills address from a pal called to see im  it was a saturday arternoon when he called and o course bill was out but is missis showed him in and arter fetching another chair from the kitchen asked im to sit down  silas was very perlite at fust but arter looking round the room and seeing ow bare it was he gave a little cough and he ses i thought bill was doing well he ses  illustration silas was very perlite at fust  so he is ses mrs burtenshaw  silas winch coughed again  i suppose he likes room to stretch imself about in he ses looking round  mrs burtenshaw wiped er eyes and then knowing ow silas had been an old friend o bills she drew er chair a bit closer and told him ow it was  a better usband when hes sober you couldnt wish to see she ses wiping her eyes agin  hed give me anythingif he ad it  silass face got longer than ever  as a matter o fact he ses im a bit down on my luck and i called round with the ope that bill could lend me a bit just till i can pull round  mrs burtenshaw shook her ead  well i spose i can stay and see im ses silas  me and im used to be great pals at one time and manys the good turn ive done him  wot timell he be ome  any time after twelve ses mrs burtenshaw but youd better not be here then  you see im being in that condition he might think you was your own ghost come according to promise and be frightened out of is life  hes often talked about it  silas winch scratched his head and looked at er thoughtfullike  why shouldnt he mistake me for a ghost he ses at last the shock might do im good  and if you come to that why shouldnt i pretend to be my own ghost and warn im off the drink  mrs burtenshaw got so excited at the idea she couldnt ardly speak but at last arter saying over and over agin she wouldnt do such a thing for worlds she and silas arranged that he should come in at about three oclock in the morning and give bill a solemn warning  she gave im her key and silas said hed come in with his air and cap all wet and pretend hed been drowned  its very kind of you to take all this trouble for nothing ses mrs burtenshaw as silas got up to go  dont mention it ses silas  it aint the fust time and i dont suppose itll be the last that ive put myself out to help my feller creeturs  we all ought to do wot we can for each other  mind if he finds it out ses mrs burtenshaw all of a tremble i dont know nothing about it  praps to make it more lifelike id better pretend not to see you  praps it would be better ses silas stopping at the street door all i ask is that youll ide the poker and anything else that might be laying about handy  and you ad better oil the lock so as the key wont make a noise  mrs burtenshaw shut the door arter im and then she went in and ad a quiet sitdown all by erself to think it over  the only thing that comforted et was that bill would be in licker and also that e would believe anything in the ghost line  it was past twelve when a couple o pals brought him ome and arter offering to fight all six of em one after the other bill hit the wall for getting in is way and tumbled upstairs to bed  in less than ten minutes e was fast asleep and pore mrs burtenshaw arter trying her best to keep awake fell asleep too  she was woke up suddenly by a noise that froze the marrer in er bones the most artrending groan she ad ever heard in er life and raising her ead she saw silas winch standing at the foot of the bed  he ad done his face and hands over with wot is called loominous paint his cap was pushed at the back of his ead and wet wisps of air was hanging over his eyes  for a moment mrs burtenshaws art stood still and then silas let off another groan that put her on edge all over  it was a groan that seemed to come from nothing amost until it spread into a roar that made the room tremble and rattled the jug in the washstand basin it shook everything in the room but bill and he went on sleeping like an infant  silas did two more groans and then e leaned over the foot o the bed and stared at bill as though e couldnt believe his eyesight  illustration she saw silas winch standing at the foot of the bed  try a squeaky one ses mrs burtenshaw  silas tried five squeaky ones and then he ad a fit o coughing that would ha woke the dead as they say but it didnt wake bill  now some more deep ones ses mrs burtenshaw in a wisper  silas licked his lipsforgetting the paintand tried the deep ones agin  now mix em a bit ses mrs burtenshaw  silas stared at her  look ere he ses very short do you think im a foghorn or wot  he stood there sulky for a moment and then e invented a noise that nothing living could miss hearing even bill couldnt  he moved in is sleep and arter silas ad done it twice more he turned and spoke to is missis about it  dye hear he ses stop it  stop it at once  mrs burtenshaw pretended to be asleep and bill was just going to turn over agin when silas let off another groan  it was ony a little one this time but bill sat up as though he ad been shot and he no sooner caught sight of silas standing there than e gave a dreadful owl and rolling over wropped imself up in all the bedclothes e could lay his ands on  then mrs burtenshaw gave a owl and tried to get some of em back but bill thinking it was the ghost only held on tighter than ever  bill ses silas winch in an awful voice  bill gave a kick and tried to bore a hole through the bed  bill ses silas agin why dont you answer me  ive come all the way from the bottom of the pacific ocean to see you and this is all i get for it  havent you got anything to say to me  goodby ses bill in a voice all smothered with the bedclothes  silas winch groaned agin and bill as the shock ad made amost sober trembled all over  the moment i died ses silas i thought of my promise towards you bills expecting me i ses and instead of staying in comfort at the bottom of the sea i kicked off the body of the cabinboy wot was clinging round my leg and ere i am  it was veryttthoughtfulof yousilas ses bill but you

bedclothes agin  oh well ave it your own way then ses his wife  if it pleases you to think there is a ghost there and to go on talking to it do so and welcome  she turned over and pretended to go to sleep agin and arter a minute or two silas spoke agin in the same hollow voice  bill he ses  yes ses bill with a groan of his own  she cant see me ses silas and she cant ear me but im ere all right

pudding  raise your right arm above your ead and swear by the ghost of pore silas winch as is laying at the bottom of the pacific ocean that you wont touch another drop  bill burtenshaw put is arm up and swore it  then e took is arm in agin and lay there wondering wot was going to appen next  if you ever break your oath by ony so much as a teaspoonful ses silas youll see me agin and the second

as you keep both your oaths i shall stay there  if you break one of em or go to see my pore wife i shall appear agin  farewell  farewell  farewell  bill said goodby and arter a long silence he ventured to put an eye over the edge of the clothes and discovered that the ghost ad gone  he lay awake for a couple o hours wondering and saying over the address to himself so that he shouldnt forget it and just afore it was time to get up he fell into a peaceful slumber  his wife didnt get a wink and she lay there trembling with passion to think ow shed been done and wondering ow she was to alter it  bill told er all about it in the morning and then with tears in his eyes e went downstairs and emptied a little barrel o beer down the sink  for the fust two or three days e went about with a thirst that hed ha given pounds for if ed been allowed to satisfy it but arter a time it went off and then like all teetotallers e began to run down drink and call it pison  illustration with tears in his eyes e emptied a little barrel o beer down the sink  the fust thing e did when e got his money on friday was to send off a postoffice order to shap street and mrs burtenshaw cried with rage and ad to put it down to the headache  she ad the headache every friday for a month and bill wot was feeling stronger and better than he ad done for years felt quite sorry for her  by the time bill ad sent off six orders she was worn to skin and bone amost aworrying over the way silas winch was spending her money  she dursnt undeceive bill for two reasons fust of all because she didnt want im to take to drink agin and secondly for fear of wot he might do to er if e found out ow shed been deceiving im  she was laying awake thinking it over one night while bill was sleeping peaceful by her side when all of a sudden she ad an idea  the more she thought of it the better it seemed but she laid awake for ever so long afore she dared to do more than think  three or four times she turned and looked at bill and listened to im breathing and then trembling all over with fear and excitement she began er little game  he did send it she ses with a piercing scream  he did send it  wwwots the matter  ses bill beginning to wake up  mrs burtenshaw didnt take any notice of im  he did send it she ses screaming agin  every friday night reglar oh dont let im see you agin  bill wot was just going to ask er whether she ad gone mad gave a awful owl and disappeared right down in the middle o the bed  theres some mistake ses mrs burtenshaw in a voice that could ha been eard through arfadozen beds easy  it must ha been lost in the post  it must ha been  she was silent for a few seconds then she ses all right she ses ill bring it myself then by hand every week  no bill shant come ill promise that for im  do go away he might put his ead up at any moment  she began to gasp and sob and bill began to think wot a good wife he ad got when he felt er put a couple of pillers over where she judged his ead to be and hold em down with her arm  thank you mr winch she ses very loud  thank you  goodby goodby  she began to quieten down a bit although little sobs like wimmen use when they pretend that they want to leave off crying but cant kept breaking out of er  then by and by she quieted down altogether and a husky voice from near the foot of the bed ses has it gorn  oh bill she ses with another sob ive seen the ghost  has it gorn ses bill agin  yes its gorn ses his wife shivering  oh bill it stood at the foot of the bed looking at me with its face and ands all shiny white and damp curls on its forehead  oh  bill came up very slow and careful but with is eyes still shut  his wife didnt get the money this week ses mrs burtenshaw but as he thought there might be a mistake somewhere he appeared to me instead of to you  ive got to take the money by hand  yes i heard ses bill and mind if you should lose it or be robbed of it let me know at once  dye hear  at once  yes bill ses is wife  they lay quiet for some time although mrs burtenshaw still kept trembling and shaking and then bill ses  next time a man tells you he as seen a ghost praps youll believe in im  mrs burtenshaw took out the end of the sheet wot she ad stuffed in er mouth when e began to speak  yes bill she ses  bill burtenshaw gave er the fifteen shillings next morning and every friday night arterwards and thats ow it is that while other wimmen as to be satisfied looking at new hats and clothes in the shopwinders mrs burtenshaw is able to wear em
