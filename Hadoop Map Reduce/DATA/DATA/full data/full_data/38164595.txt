38164595	george silvermans explanation     first chapter    it happened in this wise   but sitting with my pen in my hand looking at those words again without descrying any hint in them of the words that should follow it comes into my mind that they have an abrupt appearance  they may serve however if i let them remain to suggest how very difficult i find it to begin to explain my explanation  an uncouth phrase and yet i do not see my way to a better    second chapter    it happened in this wise   but looking at those words and comparing them with my former opening i find they are the selfsame words repeated  this is the more surprising to me because i employ them in quite a new connection  for indeed i declare that my intention was to discard the commencement i first had in my thoughts and to give the preference to another of an entirely different nature dating my explanation from an anterior period of my life  i will make a third trial without erasing this second failure protesting that it is not my design to conceal any of my infirmities whether they be of head or heart    third chapter    not as yet directly aiming at how it came to pass i will come upon it by degrees  the natural manner after all for god knows that is how it came upon me  my parents were in a miserable condition of life and my infant home was a cellar in preston  i recollect the sound of fathers lancashire clogs on the street pavement above as being different in my young hearing from the sound of all other clogs and i recollect that when mother came down the cellarsteps i used tremblingly to speculate on her feet having a good or an ill tempered look  on her knees  on her waist  until finally her face came into view and settled the question  from this it will be seen that i was timid and that the cellarsteps were steep and that the doorway was very low  mother had the gripe and clutch of poverty upon her face upon her figure and not least of all upon her voice  her sharp and high pitched words were squeezed out of her as by the compression of bony fingers on a leathern bag and she had a way of rolling her eyes about and about the cellar as she scolded that was gaunt and hungry  father with his shoulders rounded would sit quiet on a threelegged stool looking at the empty grate until she would pluck the stool from under him and bid him go bring some money home  then he would dismally ascend the steps and i holding my ragged shirt and trousers together with a hand my only braces would feint and dodge from mothers pursuing grasp at my hair  a worldly little devil was mothers usual name for me  whether i cried for that i was in the dark or for that it was cold or for that i was hungry or whether i squeezed myself into a warm corner when there was a fire or ate voraciously when there was food she would still say o you worldly little devil  and the sting of it was that i quite well knew myself to be a worldly little devil worldly as to wanting to be housed and warmed worldly as to wanting to be fed worldly as to the greed with which i inwardly compared how much i got of those good things with how much father and mother got when rarely those good things were going  sometimes they both went away seeking work and then i would be locked up in the cellar for a day or two at a time  i was at my worldliest then  left alone i yielded myself up to a worldly yearning for enough of anything except misery and for the death of mothers father who was a machinemaker at birmingham and on whose decease i had heard mother say she would come into a whole courtful of houses if she had her rights  worldly little devil i would stand about musingly fitting my cold bare feet into cracked bricks and crevices of the damp cellarfloor  walking over my grandfathers body so to speak into the courtful of houses and selling them for meat and drink and clothes to wear  at last a change came down into our cellar  the universal change came down even as low as that  so will it mount to any height on which a human creature can perch  and brought other changes with it  we had a heap of i dont know what foul litter in the darkest corner which we called the bed  for three days mother lay upon it without getting up and then began at times to laugh  if i had ever heard her laugh before it had been so seldom that the strange sound frightened me  it frightened father too and we took it by turns to give her water  then she began to move her head from side to side and sing  after that she getting no better father fell alaughing and asinging and then there was only i to give them both water and they both died    fourth chapter    when i was lifted out of the cellar by two men of whom one came peeping down alone first and ran away and brought the other i could hardly bear the light of the street  i was sitting in the roadway blinking at it and at a ring of people collected around me but not close to me when true to my character of worldly little devil i broke silence by saying i am hungry and thirsty  does he know they are dead asked one of another  do you know your father and mother are both dead of fever asked a third of me severely  i dont know what it is to be dead  i supposed it meant that when the cup rattled against their teeth and the water spilt over them  i am hungry and thirsty  that was all i had to say about it  the ring of people widened outward from the inner side as i looked around me and i smelt vinegar and what i know to be camphor thrown in towards where i sat  presently some one put a great vessel of smoking vinegar on the ground near me and then they all looked at me in silent horror as i ate and drank of what was brought for me  i knew at the time they had a horror of me but i couldnt help it  i was still eating and drinking and a murmur of discussion had begun to arise respecting what was to be done with me next when i heard a cracked voice somewhere in the ring say my name is hawkyard mr verity hawkyard of west bromwich  then the ring split in one place and a yellowfaced peaknosed gentleman clad all in irongray to his gaiters pressed forward with a policeman and another official of some sort  he came forward close to the vessel of smoking vinegar from which he sprinkled himself carefully and me copiously  he had a grandfather at birmingham this young boy who is just dead too said mr hawkyard  i turned my eyes upon the speaker and said in a ravening manner wheres his houses  hah  horrible worldliness on the edge of the grave said mr hawkyard casting more of the vinegar over me as if to get my devil out of me  i have undertaken a slight  a very slight  trust in behalf of this boy quite a voluntary trust a matter of mere honour if not of mere sentiment still i have taken it upon myself and it shall be o yes it shall be discharged  the bystanders seemed to form an opinion of this gentleman much more favourable than their opinion of me  he shall be taught said mr hawkyard o yes he shall be taught but what is to be done with him for the present  he may be infected  he may disseminate infection  the ring widened considerably  what is to be done with him  he held some talk with the two officials  i could distinguish no word save farmhouse  there was another sound several times repeated which was wholly meaningless in my ears then but which i knew afterwards to be hoghton towers  yes said mr hawkyard  i think that sounds promising i think that sounds hopeful  and he can be put by himself in a ward for a night or two you say  it seemed to be the policeofficer who had said so for it was he who replied yes  it was he too who finally took me by the arm and walked me before him through the streets into a whitewashed room in a bare building where i had a chair to sit in a table to sit at an iron bedstead and good mattress to lie upon and a rug and blanket to cover me  where i had enough to eat too and was shown how to clean the tin porringer in which it was conveyed to me until it was as good as a lookingglass  here likewise i was put in a bath and had new clothes brought to me and my old rags were burnt and i was camphored and vinegared and disinfected in a variety of ways  when all this was done  i dont know in how many days or how few but it matters not  mr hawkyard stepped in at the door remaining close to it and said go and stand against the opposite wall george silverman  as far off as you can  thatll do  how do you feel  i told him that i didnt feel cold and didnt feel hungry and didnt feel thirsty  that was the whole round of human feelings as far as i knew except the pain of being beaten  well said he you are going george to a healthy farmhouse to be purified  keep in the air there as much as you can  live an outofdoor life there until you are fetched away  you had better not say much  in fact you had better be very careful not to say anything  about what your parents died of or they might not like to take you in  behave well and ill put you to school o yes ill put you to school though im not obligated to do it  i am a servant of the lord george and i have been a good servant to him i have these fiveandthirty years  the lord has had a good servant in me and he knows it  what i then supposed him to mean by this i cannot imagine  as little do i know when i began to comprehend that he was a prominent member of some obscure denomination or congregation every member of which held forth to the rest when so inclined and among whom he was called brother hawkyard  it was enough for me to know on that day in the ward that the farmers cart was waiting for me at the street corner  i was not slow to get into it for it was the first ride i ever had in my life  it made me sleepy and i slept  first i stared at preston streets as long as they lasted and meanwhile i may have had some small dumb wondering within me whereabouts our cellar was but i doubt it  such a worldly little devil was i that i took no thought who would bury father and mother or where they would be buried or when  the question whether the eating and drinking by day and the covering by night would be as good at the farmhouse as at the ward superseded those questions  the jolting of the cart on a loose stony road awoke me and i found that we were mounting a steep hill where the road was a rutty by road through a field  and so by fragments of an ancient terrace and by some rugged outbuildings that had once been fortified and passing under a ruined gateway we came to the old farmhouse in the thick stone wall outside the old quadrangle of hoghton towers which i looked at like a stupid savage seeing no specially in seeing no antiquity in assuming all farmhouses to resemble it assigning the decay i noticed to the one potent cause of all ruin that i knew  poverty eyeing the pigeons in their flights the cattle in their stalls the ducks in the pond and the fowls pecking about the yard with a hungry hope that plenty of them might be killed for dinner while i stayed there wondering whether the scrubbed dairy vessels drying in the sunlight could be goodly porringers out of which the master ate his bellyfilling food and which he polished when he had done according to my ward experience shrinkingly doubtful whether the shadows passing over that airy height on the bright spring day were not something in the nature of frowns  sordid afraid unadmiring  a small brute to shudder at  to that time i had never had the faintest impression of duty  i had had no knowledge whatever that there was anything lovely in this life  when i had occasionally slunk up the cellarsteps into the street and glared in at shopwindows i had done so with no higher feelings than we may suppose to animate a mangy young dog or wolfcub  it is equally the fact that i had never been alone in the sense of holding unselfish converse with myself  i had been solitary often enough but nothing better  such was my condition when i sat down to my dinner that day in the kitchen of the old farmhouse  such was my condition when i lay on my bed in the old farmhouse that night stretched out opposite the narrow mullioned window in the cold light of the moon like a young vampire    fifth chapter    what do i know of hoghton towers  very little for i have been gratefully unwilling to disturb my first impressions  a house centuries old on high ground a mile or so removed from the road between preston and blackburn where the first james of england in his hurry to make money by making baronets perhaps made some of those remunerative dignitaries  a house centuries old deserted and falling to pieces its woods and gardens long since grassland or ploughed up the rivers ribble and darwen glancing below it and a vague haze of smoke against which not even the supernatural prescience of the first stuart could foresee a counterblast hinting at steampower powerful in two distances  what did i know then of hoghton towers  when i first peeped in at the gate of the lifeless quadrangle and started from the mouldering statue becoming visible to me like its guardian ghost when i stole round by the back of the farmhouse and got in among the ancient rooms many of them with their floors and ceilings falling the beams and rafters hanging dangerously down the plaster dropping as i trod the oaken panels stripped away the windows half walled up half broken when i discovered a gallery commanding the old kitchen and looked down between balustrades upon a massive old table and benches fearing to see i know not what deadalive creatures come in and seat themselves and look up with i know not what dreadful eyes or lack of eyes at me when all over the house i was awed by gaps and chinks where the sky stared sorrowfully at me where the birds passed and the ivy rustled and the stains of winter weather blotched the rotten floors when down at the bottom of dark pits of staircase into which the stairs had sunk green leaves trembled butterflies fluttered and bees hummed in and out through the broken doorways when encircling the whole ruin were sweet scents and sights of fresh green growth and everrenewing life that i had never dreamed of  i say when i passed into such clouded perception of these things as my dark soul could compass what did i know then of hoghton towers  i have written that the sky stared sorrowfully at me  therein have i anticipated the answer  i knew that all these things looked sorrowfully at me that they seemed to sigh or whisper not without pity for me alas poor worldly little devil  there were two or three rats at the bottom of one of the smaller pits of broken staircase when i craned over and looked in  they were scuffling for some prey that was there and when they started and hid themselves close together in the dark i thought of the old life it had grown old already in the cellar  how not to be this worldly little devil how not to have a repugnance towards myself as i had towards the rats  i hid in a corner of one of the smaller chambers frightened at myself and crying it was the first time i had ever cried for any cause not purely physical and i tried to think about it  one of the farm ploughs came into my range of view just then and it seemed to help me as it went on with its two horses up and down the field so peacefully and quietly  there was a girl of about my own age in the farmhouse family and she sat opposite to me at the narrow table at mealtimes  it had come into my mind at our first dinner that she might take the fever from me  the thought had not disquieted me then  i had only speculated how she would look under the altered circumstances and whether she would die  but it came into my mind now that i might try to prevent her taking the fever by keeping away from her  i knew i should have but scrambling board if i did so much the less worldly and less devilish the deed would be i thought  from that hour i withdrew myself at early morning into secret corners of the ruined house and remained hidden there until she went to bed  at first when meals were ready i used to hear them calling me and then my resolution weakened  but i strengthened it again by going farther off into the ruin and getting out of hearing  i often watched for her at the dim windows and when i saw that she was fresh and rosy felt much happier  out of this holding her in my thoughts to the humanising of myself i suppose some childish love arose within me  i felt in some sort dignified by the pride of protecting her  by the pride of making the sacrifice for her  as my heart swelled with that new feeling it insensibly softened about mother and father  it seemed to have been frozen before and now to be thawed  the old ruin and all the lovely things that haunted it were not sorrowful for me only but sorrowful for mother and father as well  therefore did i cry again and often too  the farmhouse family conceived me to be of a morose temper and were very short with me though they never stinted me in such broken fare as was to be got out of regular hours  one night when i lifted the kitchen latch at my usual time sylvia that was her pretty name had but just gone out of the room  seeing her ascending the opposite stairs i stood still at the door  she had heard the clink of the latch and looked round  george she called to me in a pleased voice tomorrow is my birthday and we are to have a fiddler and theres a party of boys and girls coming in a cart and we shall dance  i invite you  be sociable for once george  i am very sorry miss i answered but i  but no i cant come  you are a disagreeable illhumoured lad she returned disdainfully and i ought not to have asked you  i shall never speak to you again  as i stood with my eyes fixed on the fire after she was gone i felt that the farmer bent his brows upon me  eh lad said he sylvys right  youre as moody and broody a lad as never i set eyes on yet  i tried to assure him that i meant no harm but he only said coldly maybe not maybe not  there get thy supper get thy supper and then thou canst sulk to thy hearts content again  ah if they could have seen me next day in the ruin watching for the arrival of the cart full of merry young guests if they could have seen me at night gliding out from behind the ghostly statue listening to the music and the fall of dancing feet and watching the lighted farmhouse windows from the quadrangle when all the ruin was dark if they could have read my heart as i crept up to bed by the back way comforting myself with the reflection they will take no hurt from me  they would not have thought mine a morose or an unsocial nature  it was in these ways that i began to form a shy disposition to be of a timidly silent character under misconstruction to have an inexpressible perhaps a morbid dread of ever being sordid or worldly  it was in these ways that my nature came to shape itself to such a mould even before it was affected by the influences of the studious and retired life of a poor scholar    sixth chapter    brother hawkyard as he insisted on my calling him put me to school and told me to work my way  you are all right george he said  i have been the best servant the lord has had in his service for this fiveandthirty year o i have and he knows the value of such a servant as i have been to him o yes he does and hell prosper your schooling as a part of my reward thats what hell do george  hell do it for me  from the first i could not like this familiar knowledge of the ways of the sublime inscrutable almighty on brother hawkyards part as i grew a little wiser and still a little wiser i liked it less and less  his manner too of confirming himself in a parenthesis  as if knowing himself he doubted his own word  i found distasteful  i cannot tell how much these dislikes cost me for i had a dread that they were worldly  as time went on i became a foundationboy on a good foundation and i cost brother hawkyard nothing  when i had worked my way so far i worked yet harder in the hope of ultimately getting a presentation to college and a fellowship  my health has never been strong some vapour from the preston cellar cleaves to me i think and what with much work and some weakness i came again to be regarded  that is by my fellowstudents  as unsocial  all through my time as a foundationboy i was within a few miles of brother hawkyards congregation and whenever i was what we called a leaveboy on a sunday i went over there at his desire before the knowledge became forced upon me that outside their place of meeting these brothers and sisters were no better than the rest of the human family but on the whole were to put the case mildly as bad as most in respect of giving short weight in their shops and not speaking the truth  i say before this knowledge became forced upon me their prolix addresses their inordinate conceit their daring ignorance their investment of the supreme ruler of heaven and earth with their own miserable meannesses and littlenesses greatly shocked me  still as their term for the frame of mind that could not perceive them to be in an exalted state of grace was the worldly state i did for a time suffer tortures under my inquiries of myself whether that young worldly devilish spirit of mine could secretly be lingering at the bottom of my nonappreciation  brother hawkyard was the popular expounder in this assembly and generally occupied the platform there was a little platform with a table on it in lieu of a pulpit first on a sunday afternoon  he was by trade a drysalter  brother gimblet an elderly man with a crabbed face a large dogseared shirtcollar and a spotted blue neckerchief reaching up behind to the crown of his head was also a drysalter and an expounder  brother gimblet professed the greatest admiration for brother hawkyard but i had thought more than once bore him a jealous grudge  let whosoever may peruse these lines kindly take the pains here to read twice my solemn pledge that what i write of the language and customs of the congregation in question i write scrupulously literally exactly from the life and the truth  on the first sunday after i had won what i had so long tried for and when it was certain that i was going up to college brother hawkyard concluded a long exhortation thus  well my friends and fellowsinners now i told you when i began that i didnt know a word of what i was going to say to you and no i did not but that it was all one to me because i knew the lord would put into my mouth the words i wanted  thats it from brother gimblet  and he did put into my mouth the words i wanted  so he did from brother gimblet  and why  ah lets have that from brother gimblet  because i have been his faithful servant for fiveandthirty years and because he knows it  for fiveandthirty years  and he knows it mind you  i got those words that i wanted on account of my wages  i got em from the lord my fellowsinners  down i said heres a heap of wages due let us have something down on account  and i got it down and i paid it over to you and you wont wrap it up in a napkin nor yet in a towel nor yet pocketankercher but youll put it out at good interest  very well  now my brothers and sisters and fellowsinners i am going to conclude with a question and ill make it so plain with the help of the lord after fiveandthirty years i should rather hope as that the devil shall not be able to confuse it in your heads  which he would be overjoyed to do  just his way  crafty old blackguard from brother gimblet  and the question is this are the angels learned  not they  not a bit on it from brother gimblet with the greatest confidence  not they  and wheres the proof sent readymade by the hand of the lord  why theres one among us here now that has got all the learning that can be crammed into him  i got him all the learning that could be crammed into him  his grandfather this i had never heard before was a brother of ours  he was brother parksop thats what he was  parksop brother parksop  his worldly name was parksop and he was a brother of this brotherhood  then wasnt he brother parksop  must be  couldnt help hisself from brother gimblet  well he left that one now here present among us to the care of a brothersinner of his and that brothersinner mind you was a sinner of a bigger size in his time than any of you praise the lord brother hawkyard  me  i got him without fee or reward  without a morsel of myrrh or frankincense nor yet amber letting alone the honeycomb  all the learning that could be crammed into him  has it brought him into our temple in the spirit  no  have we had any ignorant brothers and sisters that didnt know round o from crooked s come in among us meanwhile  many  then the angels are not learned then they dont so much as know their alphabet and now my friends and fellowsinners having brought it to that perhaps some brother present  perhaps you brother gimblet  will pray a bit for us  brother gimblet undertook the sacred function after having drawn his sleeve across his mouth and muttered well  i dont know as i see my way to hitting any of you quite in the right place neither  he said this with a dark smile and then began to bellow  what we were specially to be preserved from according to his solicitations was despoilment of the orphan suppression of testamentary intentions on the part of a father or say grandfather appropriation of the orphans houseproperty feigning to give in charity to the wronged one from whom we withheld his due and that class of sins  he ended with the petition give us peace which speaking for myself was very much needed after twenty minutes of his bellowing  even though i had not seen him when he rose from his knees steaming with perspiration glance at brother hawkyard and even though i had not heard brother hawkyards tone of congratulating him on the vigour with which he had roared i should have detected a malicious application in this prayer  unformed suspicions to a similar effect had sometimes passed through my mind in my earlier schooldays and had always caused me great distress for they were worldly in their nature and wide very wide of the spirit that had drawn me from sylvia  they were sordid suspicions without a shadow of proof  they were worthy to have originated in the unwholesome cellar  they were not only without proof but against proof for was i not myself a living proof of what brother hawkyard had done and without him how should i ever have seen the sky look sorrowfully down upon that wretched boy at hoghton towers  although the dread of a relapse into a stage of savage selfishness was less strong upon me as i approached manhood and could act in an increased degree for myself yet i was always on my guard against any tendency to such relapse  after getting these suspicions under my feet i had been troubled by not being able to like brother hawkyards manner or his professed religion  so it came about that as i walked back that sunday evening i thought it would be an act of reparation for any such injury my struggling thoughts had unwillingly done him if i wrote and placed in his hands before going to college a full acknowledgment of his goodness to me and an ample tribute of thanks  it might serve as an implied vindication of him against any dark scandal from a rival brother and expounder or from any other quarter  accordingly i wrote the document with much care  i may add with much feeling too for it affected me as i went on  having no set studies to pursue in the brief interval between leaving the foundation and going to cambridge i determined to walk out to his place of business and give it into his own hands  it was a winter afternoon when i tapped at the door of his little countinghouse which was at the farther end of his long low shop as i did so having entered by the back yard where casks and boxes were taken in and where there was the inscription private way to the countinghouse a shopman called to me from the counter that he was engaged  brother gimblet said the shopman who was one of the brotherhood is with him  i thought this all the better for my purpose and made bold to tap again  they were talking in a low tone and money was passing for i heard it being counted out  who is it asked brother hawkyard sharply  george silverman i answered holding the door open  may i come in  both brothers seemed so astounded to see me that i felt shyer than usual  but they looked quite cadaverous in the early gaslight and perhaps that accidental circumstance exaggerated the expression of their faces  what is the matter asked brother hawkyard  ay what is the matter asked brother gimblet  nothing at all i said diffidently producing my document i am only the bearer of a letter from myself  from yourself george cried brother hawkyard  and to you said i  and to me george  he turned paler and opened it hurriedly but looking over it and seeing generally what it was became less hurried recovered his colour and said praise the lord  thats it cried brother gimblet  well put  amen  brother hawkyard then said in a livelier strain you must know george that brother gimblet and i are going to make our two businesses one  we are going into partnership  we are settling it now  brother gimblet is to take one clear half of the profits o yes he shall have it he shall have it to the last farthing  dv said brother gimblet with his right fist firmly clinched on his right leg  there is no objection pursued brother hawkyard to my reading this aloud george  as it was what i expressly desired should be done after yesterdays prayer i more than readily begged him to read it aloud  he did so and brother gimblet listened with a crabbed smile  it was in a good hour that i came here he said wrinkling up his eyes  it was in a good hour likewise that i was moved yesterday to depict for the terror of evildoers a character the direct opposite of brother hawkyards  but it was the lord that done it i felt him at it while i was perspiring  after that it was proposed by both of them that i should attend the congregation once more before my final departure  what my shy reserve would undergo from being expressly preached at and prayed at i knew beforehand  but i reflected that it would be for the last time and that it might add to the weight of my letter  it was well known to the brothers and sisters that there was no place taken for me in their paradise and if i showed this last token of deference to brother hawkyard notoriously in despite of my own sinful inclinations it might go some little way in aid of my statement that he had been good to me and that i was grateful to him  merely stipulating therefore that no express endeavour should be made for my conversion  which would involve the rolling of several brothers and sisters on the floor declaring that they felt all their sins in a heap on their left side weighing so many pounds avoirdupois as i knew from what i had seen of those repulsive mysteries  i promised  since the reading of my letter brother gimblet had been at intervals wiping one eye with an end of his spotted blue neckerchief and grinning to himself  it was however a habit that brother had to grin in an ugly manner even when expounding i call to mind a delighted snarl with which he used to detail from the platform the torments reserved for the wicked meaning all human creation except the brotherhood as being remarkably hideous  i left the two to settle their articles of partnership and count money and i never saw them again but on the following sunday brother hawkyard died within two or three years leaving all he possessed to brother gimblet in virtue of a will dated as i have been told that very day  now i was so far at rest with myself when sunday came knowing that i had conquered my own mistrust and righted brother hawkyard in the jaundiced vision of a rival that i went even to that coarse chapel in a less sensitive state than usual  how could i foresee that the delicate perhaps the diseased corner of my mind where i winced and shrunk when it was touched or was even approached would be handled as the theme of the whole proceedings  on this occasion it was assigned to brother hawkyard to pray and to brother gimblet to preach  the prayer was to open the ceremonies the discourse was to come next  brothers hawkyard and gimblet were both on the platform brother hawkyard on his knees at the table unmusically ready to pray brother gimblet sitting against the wall grinningly ready to preach  let us offer up the sacrifice of prayer my brothers and sisters and fellowsinners  yes but it was i who was the sacrifice  it was our poor sinful worldlyminded brother here present who was wrestled for  the nowopening career of this our unawakened brother might lead to his becoming a minister of what was called the church  that was what he looked to  the church  not the chapel lord  the church  no rectors no vicars no archdeacons no bishops no archbishops in the chapel but o lord many such in the church  protect our sinful brother from his love of lucre cleanse from our unawakened brothers breast his sin of worldly mindedness  the prayer said infinitely more in words but nothing more to any intelligible effect  then brother gimblet came forward and took as i knew he would the text my kingdom is not of this world  ah but whose was my fellowsinners  whose  why our brothers here present was  the only kingdom he had an idea of was of this world  thats it from several of the congregation  what did the woman do when she lost the piece of money  went and looked for it  what should our brother do when he lost his way  go and look for it from a sister  go and look for it true  but must he look for it in the right direction or in the wrong  in the right from a brother  there spake the prophets  he must look for it in the right direction or he couldnt find it  but he had turned his back upon the right direction and he wouldnt find it  now my fellowsinners to show you the difference betwixt worldly mindedness and unworldlymindedness betwixt kingdoms not of this world and kingdoms of this world here was a letter wrote by even our worldlyminded brother unto brother hawkyard  judge from hearing of it read whether brother hawkyard was the faithful steward that the lord had in his mind only tother day when in this very place he drew you the picter of the unfaithful one for it was him that done it not me  dont doubt that  brother gimblet then groaned and bellowed his way through my composition and subsequently through an hour  the service closed with a hymn in which the brothers unanimously roared and the sisters unanimously shrieked at me that i by wiles of worldly gain was mocked and they on waters of sweet love were rocked that i with mammon struggled in the dark while they were floating in a second ark  i went out from all this with an aching heart and a weary spirit not because i was quite so weak as to consider these narrow creatures interpreters of the divine majesty and wisdom but because i was weak enough to feel as though it were my hard fortune to be misrepresented and misunderstood when i most tried to subdue any risings of mere worldliness within me and when i most hoped that by dint of trying earnestly i had succeeded    seventh chapter    my timidity and my obscurity occasioned me to live a secluded life at college and to be little known  no relative ever came to visit me for i had no relative  no intimate friends broke in upon my studies for i made no intimate friends  i supported myself on my scholarship and read much  my college time was otherwise not so very different from my time at hoghton towers  knowing myself to be unfit for the noisier stir of social existence but believing myself qualified to do my duty in a moderate though earnest way if i could obtain some small preferment in the church i applied my mind to the clerical profession  in due sequence i took orders was ordained and began to look about me for employment  i must observe that i had taken a good degree that i had succeeded in winning a good fellowship and that my means were ample for my retired way of life  by this time i had read with several young men and the occupation increased my income while it was highly interesting to me  i once accidentally overheard our greatest don say to my boundless joy that he heard it reported of silverman that his gift of quiet explanation his patience his amiable temper and his conscientiousness made him the best of coaches  may my gift of quiet explanation come more seasonably and powerfully to my aid in this present explanation than i think it will  it may be in a certain degree owing to the situation of my college rooms in a corner where the daylight was sobered but it is in a much larger degree referable to the state of my own mind that i seem to myself on looking back to this time of my life to have been always in the peaceful shade  i can see others in the sunlight i can see our boats crews and our athletic young men on the glistening water or speckled with the moving lights of sunlit leaves but i myself am always in the shadow looking on  not unsympathetically  god forbid  but looking on alone much as i looked at sylvia from the shadows of the ruined house or looked at the red gleam shining through the farmers windows and listened to the fall of dancing feet when all the ruin was dark that night in the quadrangle  i now come to the reason of my quoting that laudation of myself above given  without such reason to repeat it would have been mere boastfulness  among those who had read with me was mr fareway second son of lady fareway widow of sir gaston fareway baronet  this young gentlemans abilities were much above the average but he came of a rich family and was idle and luxurious  he presented himself to me too late and afterwards came to me too irregularly to admit of my being of much service to him  in the end i considered it my duty to dissuade him from going up for an examination which he could never pass and he left college without a degree  after his departure lady fareway wrote to me representing the justice of my returning half my fee as i had been of so little use to her son within my knowledge a similar demand had not been made in any other case and i most freely admit that the justice of it had not occurred to me until it was pointed out  but i at once perceived it yielded to it and returned the money   mr fareway had been gone two years or more and i had forgotten him when he one day walked into my rooms as i was sitting at my books  said he after the usual salutations had passed mr silverman my mother is in town here at the hotel and wishes me to present you to her  i was not comfortable with strangers and i dare say i betrayed that i was a little nervous or unwilling  for said he without my having spoken i think the interview may tend to the advancement of your prospects  it put me to the blush to think that i should be tempted by a worldly reason and i rose immediately  said mr fareway as we went along are you a good hand at business  i think not said i  said mr fareway then my mother is  truly said i  yes my mother is what is usually called a managing woman doesnt make a bad thing for instance even out of the spendthrift habits of my eldest brother abroad  in short a managing woman this is in confidence  he had never spoken to me in confidence and i was surprised by his doing so  i said i should respect his confidence of course and said no more on the delicate subject  we had but a little way to walk and i was soon in his mothers company  he presented me shook hands with me and left us two as he said to business  i saw in my lady fareway a handsome wellpreserved lady of somewhat large stature with a steady glare in her great round dark eyes that embarrassed me  said my lady i have heard from my son mr silverman that you would be glad of some preferment in the church  i gave my lady to understand that was so  i dont know whether you are aware my lady proceeded that we have a presentation to a living  i say we have but in point of fact i have  i gave my lady to understand that i had not been aware of this  said my lady so it is indeed i have two presentations  one to two hundred a year one to six  both livings are in our county  north devonshire  as you probably know  the first is vacant would you like it  what with my ladys eyes and what with the suddenness of this proposed gift i was much confused  i am sorry it is not the larger presentation said my lady rather coldly though i will not mr silverman pay you the bad compliment of supposing that you are because that would be mercenary  and mercenary i am persuaded you are not  said i with my utmost earnestness thank you lady fareway thank you thank you  i should be deeply hurt if i thought i bore the character  naturally said my lady  always detestable but particularly in a clergyman  you have not said whether you will like the living  with apologies for my remissness or indistinctness i assured my lady that i accepted it most readily and gratefully  i added that i hoped she would not estimate my appreciation of the generosity of her choice by my flow of words for i was not a ready man in that respect when taken by surprise or touched at heart  the affair is concluded said my lady concluded  you will find the duties very light mr silverman  charming house charming little garden orchard and all that  you will be able to take pupils  by the bye  no i will return to the word afterwards what was i going to mention when it put me out  my lady stared at me as if i knew  and i didnt know  and that perplexed me afresh  said my lady after some consideration o of course how very dull of me  the last incumbent  least mercenary man i ever saw  in consideration of the duties being so light and the house so delicious couldnt rest he said unless i permitted him to help me with my correspondence accounts and various little things of that kind nothing in themselves but which it worries a lady to cope with  would mr silverman also like to   or shall i   i hastened to say that my poor help would be always at her ladyships service  i am absolutely blessed said my lady casting up her eyes and so taking them off me for one moment in having to do with gentlemen who cannot endure an approach to the idea of being mercenary  she shivered at the word  and now as to the pupil  the  i was quite at a loss  mr silverman you have no idea what she is  she is said my lady laying her touch upon my coatsleeve i do verily believe the most extraordinary girl in this world  already knows more greek and latin than lady jane grey  and taught herself  has not yet remember derived a moments advantage from mr silvermans classical acquirements  to say nothing of mathematics which she is bent upon becoming versed in and in which as i hear from my son and others mr silvermans reputation is so deservedly high  under my ladys eyes i must have lost the clue i felt persuaded and yet i did not know where i could have dropped it  adelina said my lady is my only daughter  if i did not feel quite convinced that i am not blinded by a mothers partiality unless i was absolutely sure that when you know her mr silverman you will esteem it a high and unusual privilege to direct her studies  i should introduce a mercenary element into this conversation and ask you on what terms    i entreated my lady to go no further  my lady saw that i was troubled and did me the honour to comply with my request    eighth chapter    everything in mental acquisition that her brother might have been if he would and everything in all gracious charms and admirable qualities that no one but herself could be  this was adelina  i will not expatiate upon her beauty i will not expatiate upon her intelligence her quickness of perception her powers of memory her sweet consideration from the first moment for the slowpaced tutor who ministered to her wonderful gifts  i was thirty then i am over sixty now she is ever present to me in these hours as she was in those bright and beautiful and young wise and fanciful and good  when i discovered that i loved her how can i say  in the first day in the first week in the first month  impossible to trace if i be as i am unable to represent to myself any previous period of my life as quite separable from her attracting power how can i answer for this one detail  whensoever i made the discovery it laid a heavy burden on me  and yet comparing it with the far heavier burden that i afterwards took up it does not seem to me now to have been very hard to bear in the knowledge that i did love her and that i should love her while my life lasted and that i was ever to hide my secret deep in my own breast and she was never to find it there was a kind of sustaining joy or pride or comfort mingled with my pain  but later on  say a year later on  when i made another discovery then indeed my suffering and my struggle were strong that other discovery was   these words will never see the light if ever until my heart is dust until her bright spirit has returned to the regions of which when imprisoned here it surely retained some unusual glimpse of remembrance until all the pulses that ever beat around us shall have long been quiet until all the fruits of all the tiny victories and defeats achieved in our little breasts shall have withered away  that discovery was that she loved me  she may have enhanced my knowledge and loved me for that she may have overvalued my discharge of duty to her and loved me for that she may have refined upon a playful compassion which she would sometimes show for what she called my want of wisdom according to the light of the worlds dark lanterns and loved me for that she may  she must  have confused the borrowed light of what i had only learned with its brightness in its pure original rays but she loved me at that time and she made me know it  pride of family and pride of wealth put me as far off from her in my ladys eyes as if i had been some domesticated creature of another kind  but they could not put me farther from her than i put myself when i set my merits against hers  more than that they could not put me by millions of fathoms half so low beneath her as i put myself when in imagination i took advantage of her noble trustfulness took the fortune that i knew she must possess in her own right and left her to find herself in the zenith of her beauty and genius bound to poor rusty plodding me  no  worldliness should not enter here at any cost  if i had tried to keep it out of other ground how much harder was i bound to try to keep it out from this sacred place  but there was something daring in her broad generous character that demanded at so delicate a crisis to be delicately and patiently addressed  and many and many a bitter night o i found i could cry for reasons not purely physical at this pass of my life i took my course  my lady had in our first interview unconsciously overstated the accommodation of my pretty house  there was room in it for only one pupil  he was a young gentleman near coming of age very well connected but what is called a poor relation  his parents were dead  the charges of his living and reading with me were defrayed by an uncle and he and i were to do our utmost together for three years towards qualifying him to make his way  at this time he had entered into his second year with me  he was welllooking clever energetic enthusiastic bold in the best sense of the term a thorough young anglosaxon  i resolved to bring these two together    ninth chapter    said i one night when i had conquered myself mr granville  mr granville wharton his name was  i doubt if you have ever yet so much as seen miss fareway  well sir returned he laughing you see her so much yourself that you hardly leave another fellow a chance of seeing her  i am her tutor you know said i  and there the subject dropped for that time  but i so contrived as that they should come together shortly afterwards  i had previously so contrived as to keep them asunder for while i loved her  i mean before i had determined on my sacrifice  a lurking jealousy of mr granville lay within my unworthy breast  it was quite an ordinary interview in the fareway park but they talked easily together for some time like takes to like and they had many points of resemblance  said mr granville to me when he and i sat at our supper that night miss fareway is remarkably beautiful sir remarkably engaging  dont you think so  i think so said i  and i stole a glance at him and saw that he had reddened and was thoughtful  i remember it most vividly because the mixed feeling of grave pleasure and acute pain that the slight circumstance caused me was the first of a long long series of such mixed impressions under which my hair turned slowly gray  i had not much need to feign to be subdued but i counterfeited to be older than i was in all respects heaven knows my heart being all too young the while and feigned to be more of a recluse and bookworm than i had really become and gradually set up more and more of a fatherly manner towards adelina  likewise i made my tuition less imaginative than before separated myself from my poets and philosophers was careful to present them in their own light and me their lowly servant in my own shade  moreover in the matter of apparel i was equally mindful not that i had ever been dapper that way but that i was slovenly now  as i depressed myself with one hand so did i labour to raise mr granville with the other directing his attention to such subjects as i too well knew interested her and fashioning him do not deride or misconstrue the expression unknown reader of this writing for i have suffered into a greater resemblance to myself in my solitary one strong aspect  and gradually gradually as i saw him take more and more to these thrownout lures of mine then did i come to know better and better that love was drawing him on and was drawing her from me  so passed more than another year every day a year in its number of my mixed impressions of grave pleasure and acute pain and then these two being of age and free to act legally for themselves came before me hand in hand my hair being now quite white and entreated me that i would unite them together  and indeed dear tutor said adelina it is but consistent in you that you should do this thing for us seeing that we should never have spoken together that first time but for you and that but for you we could never have met so often afterwards  the whole of which was literally true for i had availed myself of my many business attendances on and conferences with my lady to take mr granville to the house and leave him in the outer room with adelina  i knew that my lady would object to such a marriage for her daughter or to any marriage that was other than an exchange of her for stipulated lands goods and moneys  but looking on the two and seeing with full eyes that they were both young and beautiful and knowing that they were alike in the tastes and acquirements that will outlive youth and beauty and considering that adelina had a fortune now in her own keeping and considering further that mr granville though for the present poor was of a good family that had never lived in a cellar in preston and believing that their love would endure neither having any great discrepancy to find out in the other  i told them of my readiness to do this thing which adelina asked of her dear tutor and to send them forth husband and wife into the shining world with golden gates that awaited them  it was on a summer morning that i rose before the sun to compose myself for the crowning of my work with this end and my dwelling being near to the sea i walked down to the rocks on the shore in order that i might behold the sun in his majesty  the tranquillity upon the deep and on the firmament the orderly withdrawal of the stars the calm promise of coming day the rosy suffusion of the sky and waters the ineffable splendour that then burst forth attuned my mind afresh after the discords of the night  methought that all i looked on said to me and that all i heard in the sea and in the air said to me be comforted mortal that thy life is so short  our preparation for what is to follow has endured and shall endure for unimaginable ages  i married them  i knew that my hand was cold when i placed it on their hands clasped together but the words with which i had to accompany the action i could say without faltering and i was at peace  they being well away from my house and from the place after our simple breakfast the time was come when i must do what i had pledged myself to them that i would do  break the intelligence to my lady  i went up to the house and found my lady in her ordinary business room  she happened to have an unusual amount of commissions to intrust to me that day and she had filled my hands with papers before i could originate a word  my lady i then began as i stood beside her table  why whats the matter she said quickly looking up  not much i would fain hope after you shall have prepared yourself and considered a little  prepared myself and considered a little  you appear to have prepared yourself but indifferently anyhow mr silverman  this mighty scornfully as i experienced my usual embarrassment under her stare  said i in selfextenuation once for all lady fareway i have but to say for myself that i have tried to do my duty  for yourself repeated my lady  then there are others concerned i see  who are they  i was about to answer when she made towards the bell with a dart that stopped me and said why where is adelina  forbear be calm my lady  i married her this morning to mr granville wharton  she set her lips looked more intently at me than ever raised her right hand and smote me hard upon the cheek  give me back those papers give me back those papers  she tore them out of my hands and tossed them on her table  then seating herself defiantly in her great chair and folding her arms she stabbed me to the heart with the unlookedfor reproach you worldly wretch  worldly i cried  worldly  this if you please  she went on with supreme scorn pointing me out as if there were some one there to see  this if you please is the disinterested scholar with not a design beyond his books  this if you please is the simple creature whom any one could overreach in a bargain  this if you please is mr silverman  not of this world not he  he has too much simplicity for this worlds cunning  he has too much singleness of purpose to be a match for this worlds doubledealing  what did he give you for it  for what  and who  how much she asked bending forward in her great chair and insultingly tapping the fingers of her right hand on the palm of her left  how much does mr granville wharton pay you for getting him adelinas money  what is the amount of your percentage upon adelinas fortune  what were the terms of the agreement that you proposed to this boy when you the rev george silverman licensed to marry engaged to put him in possession of this girl you made good terms for yourself whatever they were  he would stand a poor chance against your keenness  bewildered horrified stunned by this cruel perversion i could not speak  but i trust that i looked innocent being so  listen to me shrewd hypocrite said my lady whose anger increased as she gave it utterance attend to my words you cunning schemer who have carried this plot through with such a practised double face that i have never suspected you  i had my projects for my daughter projects for family connection projects for fortune  you have thwarted them and overreached me but i am not one to be thwarted and overreached without retaliation  do you mean to hold this living another month  do you deem it possible lady fareway that i can hold it another hour under your injurious words  is it resigned then  it was mentally resigned my lady some minutes ago  dont equivocate sir  is it resigned  unconditionally and entirely and i would that i had never never come near it  a cordial response from me to that wish mr silverman  but take this with you sir  if you had not resigned it i would have had you deprived of it  and though you have resigned it you will not get quit of me as easily as you think for  i will pursue you with this story  i will make this nefarious conspiracy of yours for money known  you have made money by it but you have at the same time made an enemy by it  you will take good care that the money sticks to you i will take good care that the enemy sticks to you  then said i finally lady fareway i think my heart is broken until i came into this room just now the possibility of such mean wickedness as you have imputed to me never dawned upon my thoughts your suspicions    suspicions  pah said she indignantly  certainties  your certainties my lady as you call them your suspicions as i call them are cruel unjust wholly devoid of foundation in fact i can declare no more except that i have not acted for my own profit or my own pleasure  i have not in this proceeding considered myself  once again i think my heart is broken  if i have unwittingly done any wrong with a righteous motive that is some penalty to pay  she received this with another and more indignant pah and i made my way out of her room i think i felt my way out with my hands although my eyes were open almost suspecting that my voice had a repulsive sound and that i was a repulsive object  there was a great stir made the bishop was appealed to i received a severe reprimand and narrowly escaped suspension  for years a cloud hung over me and my name was tarnished  but my heart did not break if a broken heart involves death for i lived through it  they stood by me adelina and her husband through it all  those who had known me at college and even most of those who had only known me there by reputation stood by me too  little by little the belief widened that i was not capable of what was laid to my charge  at length i was presented to a collegeliving in a sequestered place and there i now pen my explanation  i pen it at my open window in the summertime before me lying in the churchyard equal restingplace for sound hearts wounded hearts and broken hearts  i pen it for the relief of my own mind not foreseeing whether or no it will ever have a reader
