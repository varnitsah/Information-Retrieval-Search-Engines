34906402	cetywayo and his white neighbours  or remarks on recent events in zululand natal and the transvaal   by h rider haggard   first published 1882         preparers note       this text was prepared from an 1882 edition published by      trubner  co ludgate hill london    i am told that these men the boers are told to keep on agitating in this way for a change of government in england may give them again the old order of things nothing can show greater ignorance of english politics than such an idea i tell you there is no governmentwhig or tory liberal conservative or radicalwho would dare under any circumstances to give back this country the transvaal they would not dare because the english people would not allow themextract from speech of sir garnet wolseley delivered at a public banquet in pretoria on the 17th december 1879  there was a still stronger reason than that for not receding from the transvaal it was impossible to say what calamities such a step as receding might not cause    for such a risk he could not make himself responsible    difficulties with the zulu and the frontier tribes would again arise and looking as they must to south africa as a whole the government after a careful consideration of the question came to the conclusion that we could not relinquish the transvaalextract from speech of lord kimberley in the house of lords 24th may 1880 h p d vol cclii p 208      introduction  the writer on colonial affairs is naturally to some extent discouraged by the knowledge that the subject is an unattractive one to a large proportion of the reading public it is difficult to get up anything beyond a transient interest in the affairs of our colonial dependencies indeed i believe that the mind of the british public was more profoundly moved by the exodus of jumbo than it would be were one of them to become the scene of some startling catastrophe this is the more curious inasmuch as putting aside all sentimental considerations which indeed seem to be out of harmony with the age we live in the trade done even with such comparatively insignificant colonies as our south african possessions amounts to a value of many millions of pounds sterling per annum now as the preachers of the new gospel that hails from birmingham and northampton have frequently told us trade is the lifeblood of england and must be fostered at any price it is therefore surprising that looking on them in the light of a commercial speculation in which aspect saith the preacher they are alone worthy of notice a keener interest is not taken in the wellbeing and development of the colonies we have only to reflect to see how great are the advantages that the mother country derives from the possession of her colonial empire including as they do a home for her surplus children a vast and varied market for her productions and a wealth of oldfashioned loyalty and deep attachment to the old countryhome as it is always calledwhich even if it is out of date might prove useful on emergency it seems therefore almost a pity that some right honourable gentlemen and their followers should adopt the tone they do with reference to the colonies after all there is an odd shuffling of the cards going on now in england and great as she is her future looks by no means sunny events in these latter days develop themselves very quickly and though the idea may at the present moment seem absurd surely it is possible that what between the rapid spread of radical ideas the enmity of ireland the importation of foreign produce and the competition of foreign trade to say nothing of all the unforeseen accidents and risks of the future the englishmen of say two generations hence may not find their country in her present proud position perhaps and stranger things have happened in the history of the world she may by that time be under the protection of those very colonies for which their forefathers had such small affection  the position of south africa with reference to the mother country is somewhat different to that of her sister colonies in that she is regarded not so much with apathy tinged with dislike as with downright disgust this feeling has its foundation in the many troubles and expenses in which this country has been recently involved through local complications in the cape zululand and the transvaal and indeed is little to be wondered at but whilst a large portion of the press has united with a powerful party of politicians in directing a continuous stream of abuse on to the heads of the white inhabitants of south africa whom they do not scruple to accuse of having created the recent disturbances in order to reap a money profit from them it does not appear to have struck anybody that the real root of this crop of troubles might after all be growing nearer home the truth of the matter is that native and other problems in south africa have till quite lately been left to take their chance and solve themselves as best they might except when they have in a casual manner been made the corpus vile of some political experiment it was during this long period of inaction when each difficultysuch as the native question in natalwas staved off to be dealt with by the next government that the seed was sown of which we are at present reaping the fruit in addition to this matters have recently been complicated by the elevation of south african affairs to the dignity of an english party question thus the transvaal annexation was made use of as a warcry in the last general election a boer rebellion was thereby encouraged which resulted in a complete reversal of our previous policy  now if there is any country dependent on england that requires the application to the conduct of its affairs of a firm considered and consistent policy that country is south africa boers and natives are quite incapable of realising the political necessities of any of our parties or of understanding why their true interests should be sacrificed in order to minister to those necessities it is our wavering and uncertain policy as applied to peoples who look upon every hesitating step as a sign of fear and failing dominion that in conjunction with previous postponement and neglect has really caused our troubles in south africa for so long as the affairs of that country are influenced by amateurs and sentimentalists who have no real interest in it and whose knowledge of its circumstances and conditions of life is gleaned from a few bluebooks superficially got up to enable the reader to indite theoretical articles to the nineteenth century or deliver inaccurate speeches in the house of commonsfor so long will those troubles continue  if i may venture to make a suggestion the affairs of south africa should be controlled by a board or council like that which formerly governed india composed of moderate members of both parties with an admixture of men possessing practical knowledge of the country i do not know if any such arrangement would be possible under our constitution but the present system of government by which the control of savage races fluctuates in obedience of every variation of english party politics is most mischievous in its results  the public however is somewhat tired of south africa and the reader may perhaps wonder why he should be troubled with more literature on the subject i can assure him that these pages are not written in order to give me an opportunity of airing my individual experiences or ideas their object is shortly1 to give a true history of the events attendant on the annexation of the transvaal which act has so frequently been assigned to the most unworthy motives and has never yet been fairly described by any one who was in a position to know the facts 2 to throw as much publicity as possible on the present disgraceful state of zululand resulting from our recent settlement in that country 3 to show all interested in the kafir races what has been the character of our recent surrender in the transvaal and what its effect will be on our abandoned native subjects living in that country  it may perhaps seem an odd statement considering that i have lived in various parts of south africa for about six years and have perhaps enjoyed exceptional advantage in forming my opinions when i say that my chief fear in publishing the present volume is lest my knowledge of my subject in all its bearings should not be really equal to the task it is i know the fashion to treat south african difficulties as being simple of solution thus it only took sir garnet wolseley a few weeks to understand the whole position of zulu affairs and to execute his memorable settlement of that country whilst eminent writers appear to be able in scampering from durban via kimberley to cape town in a postcart to form decided opinions upon every important question in south africa the power of thus rapidly assimilating intricate knowledge and of seeing straight through a wall whilst ordinary individuals are still criticising the bricks is no doubt one of the peculiar privileges of geniuswhich is perhaps fortunately for south africarare to the common run of mind however the difficulty of forming a sound and accurate judgment on the interlacing problems that disclose themselves to the student of the politics of southeastern africa is exceedingly great and the work of years  but although it is by no means perfect i think that my knowledge of these problems and of their imminent issues is sufficiently intimate to justify me in making a prophecynamely that unless the native and other questions of southeastern africa are treated with more honest intelligence and on a more settled plan than it has hitherto been thought necessary to apply to them the british taxpayer will find that he has by no means heard the last of that country and its wars  there is one more point to which although it hardly comes within the scope of this volume i have made some allusion and which i venture to suggest deserves the consideration of thinking englishmen i refer to the question of the desirability of allowing the dutch in south africa who are already numerically the strongest to continue to advance with such rapid strides towards political supremacy that the object of this party is to reduce englishmen and english ideas to a subordinate position in the state if not actually to rid itself of our rule and establish a republic there is no manner of doubt indeed there exists a powerful organisation the africander bond which has its headquarters in the cape and openly devotes its energies to forwarding these ends by offering a sturdy opposition to the introduction of english emigrants and the use of the english language whilst striving in every way to excite class prejudices and embitter the already strained relations between englishman and boer in considering this question it is as well not to lose sight of the fact that the dutch are as a body at heart hostile to our rule chiefly because they cannot tolerate our lenient behaviour to the native races should they by any chance cease to be the subjects of england they will i believe become her open enemies this of itself would be comparatively unimportant were it not for the fact that in the event of the blocking of the suez canal it would be to say the least inconvenient that the cape should be in the hands of a hostile population  in conclusion i wish to state that this book is not written for any party purpose i have tried to describe a state of affairs which has for the most part come under my own observation and events in which i have been interested and at times engaged that the naked truths of such a business as the transvaal surrender or of the present condition of zululand are unpleasant reading for an englishman there is no doubt but so far as these pages are concerned they owe none of their ugliness to undue colouring or political bias  windham club st

home public partly because those responsible for the conduct of affairs are not quite at ease about it and partly because of the agitation in this country for the restoration of cetywayo  there is no doubt that the present state of affairs in zululand is a subject worthy of close consideration not only by those officially connected with them but by the public at large nobody either at home or in the colonies wishes to see another zulu war or anything approaching to it unless however the affairs of zululand receive a little more attention and are superintended with a little more humanity and intelligence than they are at present the public will sooner or later be startled by some fresh catastrophe then will follow the usual outcry and the disturbance will be attributed to every cause under the sun except the right onewant of common precautions  the zulu question is a very large one and i only propose discussing so much of it as necessary to the proper consideration of the proposed restoration of cetywayo to his throne  the king is now coming to england where he will doubtless make a very good impression since his appearance is dignified and his manners as is common among zulus of high rank are those of a gentleman it is probable that his visit will lead to a popular agitation in his favour and very possibly to an attempt on the part of the english government to reinstate him in his kingdom already lady florence dixie waves his banner and informs the public through the columns of the newspapers how good how big and how beautiful he is and f w g x describes in enthusiastic terms his pearllike teeth but as there are interests involved in the question of his reinstatement which are i think more important than cetywayos personal proportions of mind or body and as the results of such a step would necessarily be very marked and farreaching it is as well to try and understand the matter in all its bearing before anything is done        since the above was written the government have at the      last moment decided to postpone cetywayos visit to this      country chiefly on account of the political capital which      was being made out of the event by agitators in zululand      the project of bringing the king to england does not      however appear to have been abandoned  there has been a great deal of special pleading about cetywayo some writers swayed by sentiment and that spirit of partisanship that the sight of royalty in distress always excites whitewash him in such a persistent manner that their readers are left under the impression that the exking is a model of injured innocence and virtue others again for political reasons paint him very black and predict that his restoration would result in the destruction or at the least disorganisation of our south african empire the truth in this as in the majority of political controversies lies somewhere between these two extremes though it is difficult to say exactly where  to understand the position of cetywayo both with reference to his subjects and the english government it will be necessary to touch though briefly on the history of zululand since it became a nation and also on the principal events of the exkings reign  chaka cetywayos great uncle was the first zulu king and doubtless one of the most remarkable men that has ever filled a throne since the days of the pharaohs when he came to his chieftainship about 1813 the zulu people consisted of a single small tribe when his throne became vacant in 1828 their name had become a living terror and they were the greatest black power in south africa the invincible armies of this african attila had swept north and south east and west had slaughtered more than a million human beings and added vast tracts of country to his dominions wherever his warriors went the blood of men women and children was poured out without stay or stint indeed he reigned like a visible death the presiding genius of a saturnalia of slaughter  his methods of government and warfare were peculiar and somewhat drastic but most effective as he conquered a tribe he enrolled its remnants in his army so that they might in their turn help to conquer others he armed his regiments with the short stabbing assegai instead of the throwing assegai which they had been accustomed to use and kept them subject to an iron discipline if a man was observed to show the slightest hesitation about coming to close quarters with the enemy he was executed as soon as the fight was over if a regiment had the misfortune to be defeated whether by its own fault or not it would on its return to headquarters find that a goodly proportion of the wives and children belonging to it had been beaten to death by chakas orders and that he was waiting their arrival to complete his vengeance by dashing out their brains the result was that though chakas armies were occasionally annihilated they were rarely defeated and they never ran away i will not enter in the history of his numerous cruelties and indeed they are not edifying amongst other things like nero he killed his own mother and then caused several persons to be executed because they did not show sufficient sorrow at her death  at length in 1828 he too suffered the fate he had meted out to so many and was killed by his brothers dingaan and umhlangan by the hands of one umbopa he was murdered in his hut and as his life passed out of him he is reported to have addressed these words to his brothers who were watching his end what do you stab me my brothers dogs of mine own house whom i have fed you hope to be kings but though you do kill me think not that your line shall reign for long i tell you that i hear the sound of the feet of the great white people and that this land shall be trodden by them he then expired but his last words have always been looked upon as a prophecy by the zulus and indeed they have been partly fulfilled  having in his turn killed umhlangan his brother by blood and in crime dingaan took possession of the throne he was less pronounced than chaka in his foreign policy though he seems to have kept up the family reputation as regards domestic affairs it was he who influenced perhaps by chakas dying prophecy about white men massacred retief the boer leader and his fifty followers in the most treacherous manner and then falling on the emigrant boers in natal murdered men women and children to the number of nearly six hundred there seems however to have been but little love lost between any of the sons of usengangacona the father of chaka dingaan umhlangan and panda for in due course panda his brother conspired with the boers against dingaan and overthrew him with their assistance dingaan fled and was shortly afterwards murdered in swaziland and panda ascended the throne in 1840  panda was a man of different character to the remainder of his race and seems to have been well content to reign in peace only killing enough people to keep up his authority two of his sons umbelazi and cetywayo of whom umbelazi was the elder and pandas favourite began as their father grew old to quarrel about the succession to the crown on the question being referred to panda he is reported to have remarked that when two young cocks quarrelled the best thing they could do was to fight it out acting on this hint each prince collected his forces panda sending down one of his favourite regiments to help umbelazi the fight took place in 1856 on the banks of the tugela a friend of the writer happening to be on the natal side of the river the day before the battle and knowing it was going to take place swam his horse across in the darkness taking his chance of the alligators and hid in some bush on a hillock commanding the battlefield it was a hazardous proceeding but the sight repaid the risk though he describes it as very awful more especially when the regiment of veterans sent by panda joined in the fray it came up at the charge between two and three thousand strong and was met near his hidingplace by one of cetywayos young regiments the noise of the clash of their shields was like the roar of the sea but the old regiment after a struggle in which men fell thick and fast annihilated the other and passed on with thinned ranks another of cetywayos regiments took the place of the one that had been destroyed and this time the combat was fierce and long till victory again declared for the veterans spears but they had brought it dear and were in no position to continue their charge so the leaders of that brave battalion formed its remnants into a ring and like the scotch at flodden       the stubborn spearmen still made good      the dark impenetrable wood      each stepping where his comrade stood          the instant that he fell  till there were none left to fall the ground around them was piled with dead  but this gallant charge availed umbelazi but little and by degrees cetywayos forces pressed his men back to the banks of the tugela and finally into it thousands fell upon the field and thousands perished in the river when my friend swam back that night he had nothing to fear from the alligators they were too well fed umbelazi died on the battlefield of a broken heart at least it is said that no wound could be found on his person he probably expired in a fit brought on by anxiety of mind and fatigue a curious story is told of cetywayo with reference to his brothers death after the battle was over a zulu from one of his own regiments presented himself before him with many salutations saying o prince now canst thou sleep in peace for umbelazi is dead how knowest thou that he is dead said cetywayo because i slew him with my own hand replied the zulu thou dog said the prince thou hast dared to lift thy hand against the blood royal and now thou makest it a matter of boasting wast thou not afraid by chakas head thou shalt have thy reward lead him away and the zulu who was but lying after all having possessed himself of the bracelets off the dead princes body was instantly executed the probability is that cetywayo acted thus more from motives of policy than from affection to his brother whom indeed he hoped to destroy it did not do to make too light of the death of an important prince umbelazis fate today might be cetywayos fate tomorrow this story bears a really remarkable resemblance to that of the young man who slew saul the lords anointed and suffered death on account thereof at the hands of david  this battle is also memorable as being the occasion of the first public appearance of mr john dunn now the most important chief in zululand and be it understood the unknown quantity in all future transactions in that country at that time dunn was a retainer of umbelazis and fought on his side in the tugela battle after the fight however he went over to cetywayo and became his man from that time till the outbreak of the zulu war he remained in zululand as adviser to cetywayo agent for the natal government and purveyor of firearms to the nation at large as soon as cetywayo got into trouble with the imperial government dunn like a prudent man deserted him and came over to us in reward sir garnet wolseley advanced him to the most important chieftainship in zululand which he hopes to make a steppingstone to the vacant throne his advice was largely followed by sir garnet in the bestowal of the other chieftainships and was naturally not quite disinterested he has already publicly announced his intention of resisting the return of the king his old master by force of arms should the government attempt to reinstate him  a period of sixteen years elapsed before cetywayo reaped the fruits of the battle of the tugela by succeeding to the throne on the death of his father panda the only zulu monarch who has as yet come to his end by natural causes  in 1861 however cetywayo was at the instance of the natal government formally nominated heir to the throne by mr shepstone it being thought better that a fixed succession should be established with the concurrence of the natal government than that matters should be left to take their chance on pandas death mr shepstone accomplished his mission successfully though at great personal risk for some unknown reason cetywayo who was blown up with pride was at first adverse to being thus nominated and came down to the royal kraal with three thousand armed followers meaning it would see to kill mr shepstone whom he had never before met panda the old king had an inkling of what was to happen but was powerless to control his son so he confined himself to addressing the assembled multitude in what i have heard sir theophilus shepstone say was the most eloquent and touching speech he ever listened to the subject being the duties of hospitality he did not at the time know how nearly the speech concerned him or that its object was to preserve his life this however soon became manifest when exception being taken to some breech of etiquette by one of his servants he was surrounded by a mob of shouting savages whose evident object was to put an end to him and those with him for two hours he remained sitting there expecting that every moment would be his last but showing not the slightest emotion till at length he got an opportunity of speaking when he rose and said i know that you mean to kill me it is an easy thing to do but i tell you zulus that for every drop of my blood that falls to the ground a hundred men will come out of the sea yonder from the country of which natal is one of the cattlekraals and will bitterly avenge me as he spoke he turned and pointed towards the ocean and so intense was the excitement that animated it that the whole great multitude turned with him and stared towards the horizon as though they expected to see the long lines of avengers creeping across the plains silence followed his speech his imperturbability and his welltimed address had saved his life from that day his name was a power in the land        a very good description of this scene was published in      the london quarterly review in 1878 the following is an      extract       in the centre of those infuriated savages he mr      shepstone sat for more than two hours outwardly calm      giving confidence to his solitary european companion by his      own quietness only once saying why jem youre afraid      and imposing restraint on his native attendants then when      they had shouted as cetywayo himself said in our hearing      till their throats were so sore that they could shout no      more they departed but sompseu mr shepstone had      conquered cetywayo in describing the scene to us and our      companion on a visit to him a short time afterwards said      sompseu is a great man no man but he could have come      through that day alive similar testimony we have had from      some of the zulu assailants from the native attendants and      the companion above mentioned next morning cetywayo humbly      begged an interview which was not granted but on terms of      unqualified submission from that day cetywayo has submitted      to british control in the measure in which it has been      exercised and has been profuse in his expressions of      respect and submission to mr t shepstone but in his      heart as occasional acts and speeches show he writhes      under the restraint and bitterly hates the man who imposed      it  it was on this occasion that a curious incident occurred which afterwards became of importance among the zulus there exists a certain salute bayete which it is the peculiar and exclusive privilege of zulu royalty to receive the word means or is supposed to mean let us bring tribute on mr shepstones visit the point was raised by the zulu lawyers as to what salute he should receive it was not consistent with their ideas that the nominator of their future king should be greeted with any salute inferior to the bayete and this as plain mr shepstone it was impossible to give him the difficulty was obvious but the zulu mind proved equal to it he was solemnly announced to be a zulu king and to stand in the place of the great founder of their nation chaka who was so fit to proclaim the successor to the throne as the great predecessor of the prince proclaimed to us this seems a strange not to say ludicrous way of settling a difficulty but there was nothing in it repugnant to zulu ideas odd as it was it invested mr shepstone with all the attributes of a zulu king such as the power to make laws order executions c and those attributes in the eyes of zulus he still retains  in 1873 messengers came down from zululand to the natal government bringing with them the kings head that is a complimentary present of oxen announcing the death of panda the nation they said was wandering it wanders and wanders and wanders again the spirit of the king had departed from them his words had ceased and none but children were left the message ended with a request that mr shepstone as cetywayos father should come and instal him on the throne a month or two afterwards there came another message again requesting his attendance and on the request being refused by the lieutenantgovernor of natal there came a third message to which the natal government returned a favourable answer  accordingly mr shepstone proceeded to zululand and on the 3rd september 1873 proclaimed cetywayo king with all due pomp and ceremony it was on this occasion that in the presence of and with the enthusiastic assent of both king and people mr shepstone standing in the place of cetywayos father and so representing the nation enunciated the four following articles with a view to putting an end to the continual slaughter that darkens the history of zululand  1 that the indiscriminate shedding of blood shall cease in the land  2 that no zulu shall be condemned without open trial and the public examination of witnesses for and against and that he shall have a right to appeal to the king  3 that no zulus life shall be taken without the previous knowledge and consent of the king after such trial has taken place and the right of appeal has been allowed to be exercised  4 that for minor crimes the loss of property all or a portion shall be substituted for the punishment of death  nobody will deny that these were admirable regulations and that they were received as such at the time by the zulu king and people but there is no doubt that their ready acceptance by the king was a sacrifice to his desire to please his father sompseu mr shepstone and the natal government with both of which he was particularly anxious to be on good terms he has never adhered to these coronation regulations or promises as they have been called and the probability is that he never intended to adhere to them however this may be i must say that personally i have been unable to share the views of those who see in the breach of these socalled promises a justification of the zulu war after all what do they amount to and what guarantee was there for their fulfilment they merely represent a very laudable attempt on the part of the natal government to keep a restraining hand on zulu cruelty and to draw the bonds of friendship as tight as the idiosyncrasies of a savage state would allow the government of natal had no right to dictate the terms to a zulu king on which he was to hold his throne the zulu nation was an independent nation and had never been conquered or annexed by natal if the government of that colony was able by friendly negotiation to put a stop to zulu slaughter it was a matter for congratulation on humanitarian grounds but it is difficult to follow the argument that because it was not able or was only partially able to do so therefore england was justified in making war on the zulus on the other hand it is perfectly ludicrous to observe the way in which cetywayos advocates overshoot the mark in arguing this and similar points especially his lady advocates whose writings upon these subjects bear about the same resemblance to the truth that the speech to the jury by the counsel for the defence in a hopeless murder case does to the summing up of the judge having demonstrated that the engagements entered into by cetywayo meant nothing they will proceed to show that even if they did coldblooded murder when perpetrated by a black paragon like cetywayo does not amount to a great offence in the mouths of these gentle apologists for slaughter massacre masquerades under the name of executions and is excused on the plea of being after all only the enforcement of an old custom again the employment of such phrases in a solemn answer to a remonstrance from the lieutenantgovernor of natal as i do kill but do not consider that i have done anything yet in the way of killing    i have not yet begun i have yet to kill are shown to mean nothing at all and to be nothing more than the mere irritation of the moment perhaps those of cetywayos subjects who suffered on account of this mere momentary irritation took a more serious view of it it is but fair to the particular authority from whom i quote miss colensos history of the zulu war pp 230231 to state that she considers this reply from the usually courteous and respectful king as no doubt petulant and wanting in due respect considering that the message in question which can be read in the footnote was a pointblank defiance of sir henry bulwer admitting that there had been slaughter but that it was nothing compared to what was coming most people will not think miss colensos description of it too strong        the following is the text of the message       did i ever tell mr shepstone i would not kill did he tell      the white people that i made such an arrangement because if      he did he has deceived them i do kill but do not consider      that i have done anything yet in the way of killing why do      the white people start at nothing i have not yet begun i      have yet to kill it is the custom of our nation and i      shall not depart from it why does the governor of natal      speak to me about my laws do i go to natal and dictate to      him about his laws i shall not agree to any laws or rules      from natal and by doing so throw the large kraal which i      govern into the water my people will not listen unless they      are killed and while wishing to be friends with the      english i do not agree to give my people over to be      governed by laws sent to me by them have i not asked the      english to allow me to wash my spears since the death of my      father umpandi and they have kept playing with me all      this time treating me like a child go back and tell the      english that i shall now act on my own account and if they      wish me to agree to their laws i shall leave and become a      wanderer but before i go it will be seen as i shall not go      without having acted go back and tell the white men this      and let them hear it well the governor of natal and i are      equal he is governor of natal and i am governor here  to admit that the zulu king has the right to kill as many of his subjects as he chooses so long as they will tolerate being killed is one thing but it is certainly surprising to find educated europeans adopting a line of defence of these proceedings on his behalf that amounts to a virtual expression of approval or at least of easy toleration has philanthropy a deadening effect on the moral sense that the people who constitute themselves champions for the unfortunate zulu king and the oppressed boers cannot get on to their hobbies without becoming blind to the difference between right and wrong really an examination of the utterances of these champions of oppressed innocence would almost lead one to that conclusion on the one hand they suppress and explain away facts and on the other supply their want of argument by reckless accusations and vicious attacks on the probity of such of their fellowenglishmen especially if in office as have had the misfortune to pursue a course of action or to express opinions not pleasing to them or their proteges for instance an innocent and unenlightened reader of the very interesting work from which i have just quoted probably lays it down with the conviction that both sir bartle frere and sir theophilus shepstone are very wicked men and full of bad motives and will wonder how a civilised government could employ such monsters of bloodthirsty duplicity as he proceeds he will also find that there is not much to be said for the characters of either sir garnet wolseley or lord chelmsford whilst as regards such small fry as mr john shepstone the present secretary of native affairs in natal after passing through miss colensos mill their reputations come out literally in rags and tatters he will be shocked to find that not only did one and all of these gentlemen make gross errors of judgment but trusted and distinguished servants of their country as they are they were one and all actuated by dark personal motives that will not bear examination  heaven help the members of the shepstone family when they fall into the hands of the gentler but more enthusiastic sex for miss colenso is not their only foe in a recent publication called a defence of zululand and its kings lady florence dixie gibbets mr henrique shepstone and points him out to be execrated by a cetywayoworshipping public because the exking is to be sent to england in his charge when according to lady dixie he will certainly be scoundrel enough to misinterpret all that cetywayo says for his own ends and will thereby inflict a cruel wrong upon him and render his visit to england perfectly meaningless perhaps it has never occurred to lady dixie that this is a very serious charge to bring against an honourable man whose reputation is probably as dear to him as the advancement of cetywayos cause is to her it is all very well to be enthusiastic but ladies should remember that there are other people in the world to be considered beside cetywayo  as regards the question of cetywayos bloodthirstiness which is so strenuously denied by his apologists i cannot say that a careful study of the blue books bearing on the subject brings me to the same conclusion it is true that there is not much information on the point for the obvious reason that the history of slaughters in zululand in the vast majority of cases only reached natal in the form of rumours which nobody thought it worth while to report there were no newspaper correspondents in zululand there is not however any doubt that cetywayo was in the habit of killing large numbers of people indeed it was a matter of the commonest notoriety nor as will be seen from the message i have transcribed did he himself deny it when being angry he spoke the truth at the same time that this message was sent we find mr osborn then resident magistrate at newcastle in natal who is certainly not given to exaggeration writing to the secretary for native affairs thusfrom all i have been able to learn cetywayos conduct has been and continues to be disgraceful he is putting people to death in a shameful manner especially girls the dead bodies are placed by his order in the principal paths especially where the paths intersect each other cross roads a few of the parents of the young people so killed buried the bodies and thus brought cetywayos wrath on themselves resulting not only on their own death but destruction of the whole family    it is really terrible that such horrible savagery could take place on our own borders    uhamu reproved cetywayo the other day reminded him of his promises to mr shepstone and begged him to spare the people this advice as could be expected was not relished  again mr fynney in his report of his visit to zululand in 1877 states that though the king and his indunas councillors denied that men were killed without trial the people told a very different tale thus he says in every instance where i had so far gained the confidence of the zulus as to cause them to speak freely was i assured of the truthfulness of the statement that the king cetywayo caused his people to be put to death in great numbers and when i remarked that of course he did so after a fair and proper trial in some cases my remark was greeted with a suppressed laugh or a smile some remarked yes a trial of bullets others yes we get a trial but that means surrounding the kraal at daybreak and shooting us down like cattle one asked me what the government in natal intended doing or what was thought in natal about the killing saying it was not in the night that sompseu spoke but in the sunshine the king was not alone but his people were around him and the ears of all zululand heard these words and the hearts of all zulus were joyful and in gladness they lifted up their hands saying the mouth of our white father has spoken good words he has cautioned his child in the presence of his people and a good sun has risen this day over zululand how is it now has the king listened does he hold fast those words no not one the promises he made are all broken what does sompseu say to this you should dine at my kraal yonder for a few days and see the izizi cattle and other property of people who have been killed pass and you would then see with your own eyes how a case is tried farther on mr fynney says when a charge is made against a zulu the question is generally asked has he any cattle and if answered in the affirmative there is little chance of escape instances of killing occurred while i was in zululand and to my knowledge no trial was allowed an armed party was despatched on the morning i left ondine and as i was informed to kill  there is no reason to suppose that mr fynney was in any way prejudiced in making these remarks on the contrary he was simply carrying out an official mission and reporting for the general information of the governments of natal and the transvaal it is however noticeable that neither these nor similar passages are ever alluded to by cetywayos advocates whose object seems to be rather to suppress the truth than to put it fairly before the public if by such suppression they think they can advance the cause of the exking  the whole matter of cetywayos private policy however appears to me to be very much beside the question whether or no he slaughtered his oppressed subjects in bygone years which there is no doubt he did is not our affair since we were not then as we are now responsible for the good government of zululand and seeing the amount of slaughter that goes on under our protectorate it ill becomes us to rake up these things against cetywayo what we have to consider is his foreign policy not the domestic details of his government        a gentleman who has recently returned from travelling      in zululand relates the following story as nearly as      possible in the words in which it was told to him by a well      known hunter in zululand piet hogg by name now residing      near dundee on the zulu border the story is a curious one      as illustrative of zulu character and scarcely represents      cetywayo in as amiable a light as one might wish piet hogg      and my informant were one day talking about the king when      the former said i was hunting and trading in zululand and      was at a military kraal occupied by cetywayo where i saw a      basuto who had been engaged by the king to instruct his      people in building houses that were to be square instead      of circular as are all zulu buildings for which his pay      was to be thirty head of cattle the basuto came to cetywayo      in my presence and said that the square buildings were      made he now wished to have his thirty head of cattle and to      depart cetywayo having obtained what he required began to      think the man overpaid so said i have observed that you      like  a zulu woman belonging to the kraal suppose you      take her instead of the thirty head of cattle now this was      a very bad bargain for the basuto as the woman was not      worth more in zulu estimation than ten head of cattle but      the basuto knowing with whom he had to deal thought it      might be better to comply with the suggestion rather than      insist upon his rights and asked to be allowed till the      next morning to consider the proposal after he had been      dismissed on this understanding cetywayo sent for the      woman and accused her of misconduct with the basuto the      punishment of which if proved would be death she denied      this vehemently with protestations and tears he insisted      but looking up at a tree almost denuded of leaves which      grew close by said significantly take care that not a      leaf remains on that tree by the morning the woman      understood the metaphor and in an hour or two aided by      other strapping zulu females attacked the unfortunate      basuto and killed him with clubs but cetywayo having thus      like the monkey in the fable employed a cats paw to do his      dirty work began to think the basutos untimely death might      have an ugly appearance in my eyes so gave orders in my      presence that as a punishment six of the women who had      killed the basuto should also be put to death this was too      much for me knowing as i did all that had passed i      reproached cetywayo for his cruelty and declared i would      leave zululand without trading there and without making him      the present he expected i also said i should take care the      great english inkose the governor of natal should hear      of his conduct and the reason of my return cetywayo was      then on friendly terms with the english and being impressed      by my threats he reconsidered his orders and spared the      lives of the women  i do not propose to follow out all the details of the boundary dispute between cetywayo and the transvaal or to comment on the different opinions held on the point by the various authorities english and zulu the question has been for the moment settled by the transvaal convention and is besides a most uninteresting one to the general reader  nor shall i enter into a discussion concerning the outrages on which sir bartle frere based his ultimatum previous to the zulu war they were after all insignificant although sufficient to serve as a casus belli to a statesman determined to fight the zulu war was in the opinion of sir b frere necessary in selfdefence which is the first principle of existence if it admits of justification it is on the ground that the zulu army was a menace to the white population of south africa and that it was therefore necessary to destroy it lest at some future time it should destroy the whites it is ridiculous to say that the capture of two zulu women in natal and their subsequent murder or the expulsion on political grounds of a few missionaries justified us in breaking up a kingdom and slaughtering ten thousand men sir bartle frere declared war upon the zulus because he was afraid and had good reason to be afraid that if he did not cetywayo would before long sweep either the transvaal or natal whilst on the other hand the zulus fought us because our policy was too philanthropic to allow them to fight anybody else this statement may appear strange but a little examination into zulu character and circumstances will i think show it to be correct  it must be remembered that for some years before pandas death the zulus had not been engaged in any foreign war when cetywayo ascended the throne it was the general hope and expectation of the army and therefore of the nation that this period of inaction would come to an end and that the new king would inaugurate an active foreign policy they did not greatly care in what direction the activity developed itself provided it did develop it must also be borne in mind that every ablebodied man in the zulu country was a member of a regiment even the lads being attached to regiments as carriers and the women being similarly enrolled though they did not fight the zulu military system was the universalservice system of germany brought to an absolute perfection obtained by subordinating all the ties and duties of civil life to military ends thus for instance marriage could not be contracted at will but only by the permission of the king which was generally delayed until a regiment was well advanced in years when a number of girls were handed over to it to take to wife this regulation came into force because it was found that men without home ties were more ferocious and made better soldiers and the result of these harsh rules was that the zulu warrior living as he did under the shadow of a savage discipline for any breach of which there was but one punishment death can hardly be said to have led a life of domestic comfort such as men of all times and nations have thought their common right but even a zulu must have some object in life some shrine at which to worship some mistress of his affections home he had none religion he had none mistress he had none but in their stead he had his career as a warrior and his hope of honour and riches to be gained by the assegai his home was on the wartrack with his regiment his religion the fierce denunciation of the isanusi and his affections were fixed on the sudden rush of battle the red slaughter and the spoils of the slain war says sir t shepstone in a very remarkable despatch written about a year before the outbreak of the zulu war is the universal cry among the soldiers who are anxious to live up to their traditions     and the idea is gaining ground among the people that their nation has outlived the object of its existence again he says the engine the zulu military organisation has not ceased to exist or to generate its forces although the reason or excuse for its existence has died away these forces have continued to accumulate and are daily accumulating without safetyvalve or outlet        witchdoctor these persons are largely employed in      zululand to smell out witches who are supposed to have      bewitched others and are of course very useful as political      agents any person denounced by them is at once executed a      friend of the writers was once present at a political      smellingout on a large scale and describes it as a very      curious and unpleasant scene the men of whom there were      some thousands were seated in a circle as pale with terror      as zulus can be within the circle were several witch      doctors one of whom amidst his or her incantations would      now and again step forward and touch some unfortunate man      with a forked stick the victim was instantly led away a few      paces and his neck twisted the circle awaited each      denunciation in breathless expectation for not a man among      them knew whose turn it might be next on another occasion      an unfortunate wretch who had been similarly condemned by an      isanusi rushed up to the same gentlemans waggon and      besought shelter he was hidden under some blankets but      presently his pursuers arrived and insisted upon his being      handed over all possible resistance was made until the      executioners announced that they would search the waggon and      kill him there it was then covenanted that he should have a      start in the race for life he was however overtaken and      killed these instances will show how dark and terrible is      the zulu superstition connected with witchcraft and what a      formidable weapon it becomes in the hands of the king or      chief  desirable as such a state of feeling may be in an army just leaving for the battlefield it is obvious that for some fifty thousand men comprising the whole manhood of the nation to be continually on the boil with sanguinary animosity against the human race in general is an awkward element to fit into the peaceable government of a state  yet this was doubtless the state of affairs with which cetywayo had to contend during the latter years of his reign he found himself surrounded by a great army in a high state of efficiency and warlike preparation proclaiming itself wearied with camp life and clamouring to be led against an enemy that it might justify its traditions and find employment for its spears often and often he must have been sorely puzzled to find excuses wherewithal to put it off indeed his position was both awkward and dangerous on the one hand was scylla in the shape of the english government and on the other the stormy and uncertain charybdis of his clamouring regiments slowly the idea must have began to dawn upon him that unless he found employment for the army which besides being disgusted with his inactivity was somewhat wearied with his cruelties for domestic slaughter had ceased to divert and had begun to irritate the army or some enterprising members of it might put it beyond his power ever to find employment for it at all and bring one of his brothers to rule in his stead  and yet who was he to fight if fight he must there were three possible enemies1 the swazis 2 the transvaal boers 3 the english  although the english may have held a place on cetywayos list as possible foes there is no ground for supposing that until shortly before the war he had any wish to fight with us indeed whereas their hatred of the boers was pronounced and openly expressed both the zulu king and people always professed great respect for englishmen and even a certain amount of liking and regard  therefore when cetywayo had to settle on an enemy to attack it was not the english that he chose but the swazis whose territory adjoined his own lying along the borders of the transvaal towards delagoa bay the swazis are themselves zulus and cetywayo claimed certain sovereign rights over them which however they refused to recognise they are a powerful tribe and can turn out about 10000 fighting men quite enough for cetywayos young warriors to try their mettle on still the king does not appear to have wished to undertake the war without first obtaining the approval of the natal government to whom he applied several times for permission to wash his spears saying that he was but half a king until he had done so the natal government however invariably replied that he was on no account to do anything of the sort this shows the inconveniences of possessing a complimentary feudal hold over a savage potentate the shadow of power without the reality the governor of natal could not in decency sanction such a proceeding as a war of extermination against the swazis but if it had occurred without his sanction the swazis would have suffered no doubt but the zulu spears would have been satisfactorily washed and there would have been no zulu war as it is englishmen have been killed instead of swazis  thwarted in his designs on the swazis cetywayo next turned his attention to the transvaal boers the zulus and the boers had never been good friends since the days of the massacre of retief and of late years their mutual animosity had been greatly increased owing to their quarrels about the boundary question previously alluded to this animosity reached bloodheat when the boer government acting with the arrogance it always displayed towards natives began to lay its commands upon cetywayo about his relations with the amaswazi the alleged trespassing on boer territory and other matters the arrogance was all the more offensive because it was impotent the boers were not in a position to undertake the chastisement of the zulus but the king and council of zululand now determined to try conclusions with the transvaal on the first convenient opportunity and this time without consulting the government of natal the opportunity soon occurred secocoeni the powerful chief of the bapedi one of the tribes whose territories border on the transvaal came to a difference with the boers over another border question there is good ground for supposing that cetywayo incited him to withstand the boer demands it is certain that during the course of the war that followed he assisted him with advice and more substantially still with zulu volunteers  to be brief the secocoeni war resulted in the discomfiture of the transvaal forces another result of this struggle was to throw the whole state into the most utter confusion of which the dutch burghers always glad of an opportunity to defy the law took advantage to refuse to pay taxes national bankruptcy ensued and confusion grew worse confounded  cetywayo took note of all this and saw that now was his opportunity to attack the boers had suffered both in morale and prestige from their defeat by secocoeni who was still in arms against them whilst the natives were proportionately elated by their success over the dreaded white men there was he knew well but little chance of a rapid concentration to resist a sudden raid especially when made by such a powerful army or rather chain of armies as he could set in motion everything favoured the undertaking indeed humanly speaking it is difficult to see what could have saved the greater part of the population of the transvaal from sudden extinction if a kind providence had not just then put it into the head of lord carnarvon to send out sir t shepstone as special commissioner to their country when cetywayo heard that his father sompseu sir t shepstone was going up to the transvaal he held his hand sent out spies and awaited the course of events the following incident will show with what interest he was watching what took place at the vaal river a party of boers met the special commissioner and fired salutes to welcome him it was immediately reported to cetywayo by his spies that the boers had fired over sir t shepstones waggon shortly afterwards a message arrived at pretoria from cetywayo to inquire into the truth of the story coolly announcing his intention of sweeping the transvaal if it were true that his father had been fired at in a conversation with mr fynney after the annexation cetywayo alludes to his intentions in these words  i heard that the boers were not treating him sompseu properly and that they intended to put him in a corner if they had done so i should not have waited for anything more had but one shot been fired i should have said what more do i wait for they have touched my father i should have poured my men over the land and i can tell you son of mr fynney the land would have burned with fire this will show how eagerly cetywayo was searching for an excuse to commence his attack on the transvaal when the hope of finding a pretext in the supposed firing at sir t shepstone or any incident of a similar nature faded away he appears to have determined to carry out his plans without any immediate pretext and to make a casus belli of his previous differences with the government of the republic accordingly he massed his impis army corps at different points along the transvaal border where they awaited the signal to advance and sweep the country information of cetywayos doings and of his secret plans reached pretoria shortly before the annexation and confirmed the mind of the special commissioner as to the absolute necessity of that measure to save the citizens of the republic from coming to a violent end and south africa from being plunged into a native war of unexampled magnitude the day before the annexation took place when it was quite certain that it would take place a message was sent to cetywayo by sir t shepstone telling him of what was about to happen and telling him too in the sternest and most straightforward language that the transvaal had become the queens land like natal and that he must no more think of attacking it than he would of attacking natal cetywayo on receiving the message at once disbanded his armies and sent them to their kraals kabuna he said to the messenger my impis were gathered now at my fathers sir t shepstones bidding i send them back to their homes  this fact namely that at the bidding of his old mentor sir t shepstone cetywayo abandoned his longcherished plans and his undoubted opportunity of paying off old scores with the boers in a most effectual manner and gave up a policy that had so many charms for him must be held by every unprejudiced man to speak volumes in his favour it must be remembered that it was not merely to oblige his father sompseu that he did this but to meet the wishes of the english government and the act shows how anxious he was to retain the friendship and fall in with the views of that government evidently cetywayo had no animosity against us in april 1877  in his interview with mr fynney cetywayo speaks out quite frankly as to what his intentions had been he says i know all about the soldiers being on their way up but i would have asked sompseu to allow the soldiers to stand on one side for just a little while only a little and see what my men could do it would have been unnecessary for the queens people to trouble my men were all ready and how big must that stone have been with my father sompseu digging at one side and myself at the other that would not have toppled over even though the size of that mountain pointing to a mountain range we could put it on its back again i say i am glad to know the transvaal is english ground perhaps now there may be rest  this and other passages show beyond all doubt from what an awful catastrophe the transvaal was saved by the annexation that cetywayo personally detested the boers is made clear by his words to mr fynney the boers he says are a nation of liars they are a bad people bad altogether i do not want them near my people they lie and claim what is not theirs and illuse my people where is thomas president burgers i informed him that mr burgers had left the transvaal then let them pack up and follow thomas said he let them go the queen does not want such people as those about her land what can the queen make of them or do with them their evil ways puzzled both thomas and rudolph landdrost of utrecht they will not be quiet  it is very clear that if cetywayo had been left to work his will a great many of the boers would have found it necessary to pack up and follow thomas whilst many more would have never needed to pack again  i am aware that attempts have been made to put another explanation on cetywayos warlike preparations against the boers it has been said that the zulu army was called up by sir t shepstone to coerce the transvaal it is satisfactory to be able from intimate personal knowledge to give unqualified denial to that statement which is a pure invention as indeed is easily proved by clear evidence which i have entered into in another part of this book cetywayo played for his own hand all along and received neither commands nor hints from the special commissioner to get his army together indeed when sir t shepstone discovered what was going on he suffered great anxiety lest some catastrophe should occur before he was in a position to prevent it nothing short of the annexation could have saved the transvaal at that moment and the conduct of the boers after the danger had been taken on to the shoulders of the imperial government is a startling instance of national ingratitude  here again the zulu king was brought face to face with the ubiquitous british government and that too at a particularly aggravating moment he was about to commence his attack when he was met with a polite hands off this is british territory no wonder that we find him in despair renewing his prayer that sompseu will allow him to make one little raid only one small swoop and saying that it is the custom of our country when a new king is placed over the nation to wash their spears and it has been done in the case of all former kings of zululand i am no king but sit in a heap i cannot be a king till i have washed my assegais all of which is doubtless very savage and very wrong but such is the depravity of human nature that there is something taking about it for all that  it was at this period of the history of south africa that many people think we made our crowning mistake we annexed the transvaal say they six months too soon as things have turned out it would have been wiser to have left zulus and transvaal boers to try conclusions and done our best to guard our own frontiers there is no doubt that such a consummation of affairs would have cleared the political atmosphere wonderfully the zulus would have got enough fighting to last them some time and the remainder of the boers would have entreated our protection and become contented british subjects there would have been no isandhlwana and no majuba hill but to these i say who could foresee the future and who in the then state of kindly feeling towards the boers could wish to leave them and all the english mixed up with them to undergo unprepared as they were the terrible experience of a zulu invasion besides what guarantee was there that the slaughter would stop in the transvaal or that the combat would not have developed into a war of races throughout south africa even looking at the matter in the light of after events it is difficult to regret that humanity was on this occasion allowed to take precedence of a more coldblooded policy if the opponents of the annexation or even the members of the transvaal independence committee knew what a zulu invasion meant they would scarcely have been so bitter about that act  from the time of the annexation it was a mere matter of opinion as to which direction the zulu explosion would take the safetyvalves were loaded whilst the pressure daily increased and all acquainted with the people knew that it must come sooner or later  shortly after the transvaal became british territory the old zulu boundary question came to the fore again and was made more complicated than ever by sir t shepstone who had hitherto favoured the zulu claims taking the boer side of the controversy after examination of the locality and of persons acquainted with the details of the matter there was nothing wonderful in this change of opinion though of course it was attributed to various motives by advocates of the zulu claims and there is no doubt that cetywayo himself did not at all like it and excited thereto by vexation and the outcry of his regiments adopted a very different and aggressive tone in his communications with the english authorities indeed his irritation against the boers and everybody connected with them was very great probably if he had been left alone he would in time have carried out his old programme and attacked the transvaal but fortunately for the transvaal which like sailors and drunken men always seems to have had a special providence taking care of it at this juncture sir bartle frere appeared upon the scene and after a few preliminaries and the presentation of a strong ultimatum which was quite impracticable so far as cetywayo was concerned since it demanded what it was almost impossible for him to concedethe disbandment of his armyinvaded zululand  it is generally supposed that the natal colonists had a great deal to do with making the zulu war but this is not the case it is quite true that they were rejoiced at the prospect of the breakup of cetywayos power because they were very much afraid of him and of his celibate manslaying machine which under all the circumstances is not wonderful but the war was a distinctly imperial war made by an imperial officer without consultation with colonial authorities on imperial grounds viz because cetywayo menaced her majestys power in south africa of course if there had been no colonies there would have been no war but in that way only are they responsible for it natal however has not grudged to pay 250000 pounds towards its expenses which is a great deal more than it can afford and considering that the foolish settlement made by sir garnet wolseley is almost sure to involve the colony in trouble quite as much as should be asked  the fact of the matter was that sir bartle frere was a statesman who had the courage of his convictions he saw that a zulu disturbance of one kind or another was inevitable so he boldly took the initiative if things had gone right with him as he supposed they would praise would have been lavished on him by the home authorities and he would have been made a peer and perhaps governorgeneral of india to boot but he reckoned without his lord chelmsford and the element of success which was necessary to gild his policy in the eyes of the home public was conspicuous by its absence as it was no language was considered to be too bad to apply to this imperious proconsul who had taken upon himself to declare a war if it is any consolation to him he has at any rate the gratitude of the south african colonies not so much for what he has done for that is being carefully nullified by the subsequent action of the home government but because believing his policy to be right he had the boldness to carry it out at the risk of his official reputation sir bartle frere took a larger view of the duties of the governor of a great dependency than to constitute himself the flickering shadow of the secretary of state in downing street who knowing little of the real interests of the colony is himself only the reflection of those that hold the balance of power to whom the subject is one of entire indifference provided that there is nothing to pay  the details of the zulu war are matters of melancholy history which it is useless to recapitulate here with the exception of the affair at rorkes drift there is nothing to be proud of in connection with it and a great deal to be ashamed of more especially its final settlement there is however one point that i wish to submit to the consideration of my readers and that is that cetywayo was never thoroughly in earnest about the war if he had been in earnest if he had been determined to put out his full strength he would certainly have swept natal from end to end after his victory at isandhlwana there was no force to prevent his doing so on the contrary it is probable that if he had advanced a strong army over the border a great number of the natal natives would have declared in his favour through fear of his vengeance or at the least would have remained neutral he had ample time at his disposal to have executed the manoeuvre twice over before the arrival of the reinforcements of which the results must have been very dreadful and yet he never destroyed a single family the reason he has himself given for this conduct is that he did not wish to irritate the white man that he had not made the war and was only anxious to defend his country  when the fighting came to an end after the battle of ulundi there were two apparent courses open to us to take one was to take over the country and rule it for the benefit of the zulus and the other to enforce the demands in sir bartle freres ultimatum and taking such guarantees as circumstances would admit of leave cetywayo on the throne instead of acting on either of these plans however sir garnet wolseley proceeded in the face of an extraordinary consensus of adverse opinion which he treated with calm contempt to execute what has proved to be a very cruel settlement sir garnet wolseley has the reputation of being an extremely able man and it is only fair to him to suppose that he was not the sole parent of this political monster by which all the blood and treasure expended on the zulu war were made of no account but that it was partially dictated to him by authorities at home who were anxious to gratify english opinion and partly ignorant partly careless of the consequences at the same time it is clear that he is responsible for the details of the scheme since immediately after the capture of cetywayo he writes a despatch about them which was considered so important that a member of his staff was sent to england in charge of it in this document he informs the secretary of state that cetywayos rule was resolutely built up without any of the ordinary and lawful foundations of authority and by the mere vigour and vitality of an individual character it is difficult to understand what sir garnet means in this passage if the fact of being the rightful and generally accepted occupant of the throne is not an ordinary and lawful foundation of authority what is as regards cetywayo having built up his rule by the mere vigour and vitality of an individual character he is surely in error cetywayos position was not different to that of his immediate predecessors if sir garnet had applied the remark to chaka the first king to the vigour and vitality of whose individual character zululand owes its existence as a nation it would have been more appropriate the despatch goes on to announce that he has made up his mind to divide the country into thirteen portions in order to prevent the possibility of any reunion of its inhabitants under one rule and ends in these words i have laboured with the great aim of establishing for her majestys subjects in south africa both white and coloured as well as for this spirited people against whom unhappily we have been involved in war the enduring foundations of peace happiness and prosperity the spirited people were no doubt vastly thankful but the white man reading such a passage as this and knowing the facts of the case will only recognise sir garnet wolseleys admirable talent for ironical writing  sir garnet entered into an agreement with each of his kinglets who amongst other things promised that they would not make war without the sanction of the british government he also issued a paper of instructions to the gentleman who was first appointed british resident who by the way very soon threw up his post in despair from this document we learn that all the exkings brothers are to be under the eye of the chief john dunn but it is chiefly remarkable for the hostility it evinces to all missionary enterprise the resident is instructed to be careful to hold yourself entirely aloof from all missionary or proselytising enterprises and that grants of land by former kings to missionaries cannot be recognised by the british government although sir garnet will allow missionaries to live in the country if the chief of the district does not object these instructions created some adverse comment in england with the result that in the supplementary instructions issued on the occasion of mr osborns appointment as resident they were somewhat modified in the despatch to the secretary of state in which he announces the new appointment sir garnet says that mr osborn is to be the councillor guide and friend of the native chiefs and that to his moral influence we should look i think for the spread of civilisation and the propagation of the gospel what a conglomeration of dutiesat once prophet priest and king poor mr osborn  of the chiefs appointed under this unfortunate settlement some were so carelessly chosen that they have no authority whatsoever over the districts to which they were appointed their nominal subjects preferring to remain under the leadership of their hereditary chief several of sir garnets little kings cannot turn out an hundred men whilst the hereditary chief who has no official authority can bring up three or four thousand thus for instance a territory was given to a chief called infaneulela the retainers of this gentleman live in a kraal of five or six huts on the battlefield of ulundi a chief called dilligane to whom the district should have been given is practically head man of the district and takes every possible opportunity of defying the nominee chief infaneulela who is not acknowledged by the people another case is that of umgitchwa to whom a territory was given in this instance there are two brothers umgitchwa and somhlolo born of different mothers umgitchwa is the elder but somhlolo is the son of a daughter of the king and therefore according to zulu custom entitled to succeed to the chieftainship somhlolo was disinherited by sir garnet on account of his youth he is about twentyfive and has many wives but an ancient custom is not to be thus abrogated by a stroke of the pen and somhlolo is practically chief of the district fighting is imminent between the two brothers  a third case is that of hlubi who though being a good wellmeaning man is a basuto and being a foreigner has no influence over the zulus under him  a fourth instance is that of umlandela an old and infirm zulu who was made chief over a large proportion of the umtetwa tribe on the coast of zululand his appointment was a fatal mistake and has already led to much bloodshed under the following curious circumstances which are not without interest as showing the intricacy of zulu plots  the umtetwas were in the days of chaka a very powerful tribe but suffered the same fate at his hands as did every other that ventured to cross spears with him they were partially annihilated and whilst some of the survivors of whom the umtetwas in zululand are the descendants were embodied in the zulu regiments others were scattered far and wide branches of this important tribe exist as far off as the cape colony dingiswayo who was the chief of the umtetwas when chaka conquered the tribe fled after his defeat into basutoland and is supposed to have died there after the zulu war sir g wolseley divided the umtetwa into two districts appointing an umtetwa chief named somkeli ruler over one and umlandela over the other  umlandela being a zulu and worn with age has never had any authority over his nominal subjects and has been anxious to rid himself of the danger and responsibility of his chieftainship by transferring it on to the shoulders of mr john dunn whose territory adjoins his own and who would be needless to say nothing loth to avail himself of the opportunity of increasing his taxable area whilst this intrigue was in progress all zululand was convulsed with the news of our defeat by the boers and the consequent surrender of the transvaal it was commonly rumoured that our forces were utterly destroyed and that the boers were now the dominant power following on the heels of this intelligence was a rumour to the effect that cetywayo was coming back these two reports both of which had a foundation of truth had a very bad effect on the vulgar mind in zululand and resulted in the setting in motion of a variety of plots of which the following was the most important  the umtetwa tribe is among those who are not anxious for the return of cetywayo but see in the present state of affairs an opportunity of regaining the power they possessed before the days of chaka if they were to have a king over zululand they determined that it should be an umtetwa king and somkeli one of the chiefs appointed by sir garnet was the man who aimed at the throne he was not however anxious to put out his hand at first further than he could draw it back so he adopted a very ingenious expedient it will be remembered that the old chief dingiswayo fled to basutoland where he is reported to have married it occurred to somkeli that if he could produce a descendant or a pseudodescendant of dingiswayo he would have no difficulty in beginning operations by dispossessing umlandela of his territory in favour of the supposed lawful heir in fact he wanted a cat to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him who could easily be got rid of afterwards accordingly one sitimela was produced who is supposed to be an escaped convict from natal who gave out that he was a grandson of dingiswayo by a basuto woman and a great medicineman able to kill everybody by a glance of his eye  to this impostor adherents flocked from all parts of zululand and umlandela flying for his life into john dunns territory sitimela seized upon the chieftainship the resident thereupon ordered him to appear before him but he as might be expected refused to come as it was positively necessary to put an end to the plot by some means since its further development would have endangered and perhaps destroyed the weakkneed zulu settlement mr osborn determined to proceed to the scene of action mahomet would not go to the mountain so the mountain had to go to mahomet on arrival he pitched his tents half way between the camps of sitimela and john dunn who had umlandela under his charge and summoned somkeli the author of the plot to appear before him ten days elapsed before the summons was obeyed during this time and indeed until they finally escaped the resident and his companion could not even venture to the spring which was close at hand to wash for fear of being assassinated all day long they could see lines of armed men swarming over the hills round them and hear them yelling their warsongs at length somkeli appeared accompanied by over a thousand armed warriors he was ordered to withdraw his forces from sitimelas army and go home he went home but did not withdraw his forces the next day sitimela himself appeared before the resident he was ordered to come with ten men he came with two thousand all armed wild with excitement and moutied medicined to make this medicine they had killed and pounded up a little cripple boy and several of umlandelas wives it afterwards transpired that the only reason sitimela did not then and there kill the resident was that he mr osborn had with him several chiefs who were secretly favourable to sitimelas cause and if he had killed him he would according to zulu custom have had to kill them too mr osborn ordered sitimela to disperse his forces or take the consequences and waited a few days for him to do so but seeing no signs of his compliance he then ordered the neighbouring chiefs to fall on him and at length withdrew from his encampmentnone too soon that very night a party of sitimelas men came down to kill him and finding the tent in which he and his companions had slept standing stabbed at its supposed occupants through the canvas  sitimela was defeated by the forces ordered out by the resident with a loss of about 500 men it is however worthy of note and shows how widespread was the conspiracy that out of all the thousands promised mr osborn was only able to call out two thousand men  the appointment however that has occasioned the most criticism is that of john dunn who got the benjamin share of zululand in preference to his brother chiefs the converting of an englishman into a zulu chief is such a very odd proceeding that it is difficult to know what to think of it john dunn is an ambitious man and most probably has designs on the throne he is also a man who understands the value of money of which he makes a great deal out of his chieftainship at the same time it is clear that so far as it goes his rule is better than that of the other chiefs he has a uniform tax fixed and has even done something in the way of starting schools and making roads from all that i have been able to gather his popularity and influence with the zulus are overrated though he has lived amongst them so many years and taken so many of their women to wife his appointment was a hazardous experiment and in the long run is likely to prove a mischievous one since any attempted amendment of the settlement will be violently resisted by him on the ground of vested interests also if white men are set over zulus at all they should be gentlemen in the position of government officers not successful adventurers  perhaps the only wise thing done in connection with the settlement was the appointment of mr osborn cmg as british resident it is not easy to find a man fitted for that difficult and dangerous position for the proper filling of which many qualifications are required possessed of an intimate knowledge of the zulus their language and their mode of thought and life and being besides a very able and energetic officer mr osborn would have saved the settlement from breaking down if anybody could have saved it as it is by the exercise of ceaseless energy and at great personal risk he has preserved it from total collapse of the dangers and anxieties to which he is exposed the account i have given of the sitimela incident is a sufficient example he is in fact nothing but a shadow for he has no force at his command to ensure obedience to his decisions or to prevent civil war and in zululand oddly enough force is a remedy should one chief threaten the peace of the country he can only deal with him by calling on another chief for aid a position that is neither dignified nor right what is worst of all is that the zulus are beginning to discover what a shadow he is and with this weakened position he has to pit his single brains against all the thousand and one plots which are being woven throughout zululand the whole country teems with plots mnyamane the late prime minister and one of the ablest and perhaps the most influential man in zululand is plotting for the return of cetywayo bishop colenso again is as usual working his own wires and creating agitations to forward his ends whatever they may be at the moment john dunn on the other hand is plotting to succeed cetywayo and so on ad infinitum such is the state of affairs with which our unfortunate resident has to contend invested with large imaginary powers he has in reality nothing but his personal influence and his own wits to help him he has no white man to assist him but living alone in a brokendown tent and some mud huts built by his sons hands for the government have never kept their promise to put him up a house in the midst of thousands of restless and scheming savages amidst plots against the peace and against his authority he has to do the best he can to carry out an impracticable settlement and to maintain the character of english justice and the honour of the english name were mr osborn to throw up his post or to be assassinated the authorities would find it difficult to keep the whole settlement from collapsing like a card castle  nobody who understood zulu character and aspirations could ever have executed such a settlement as sir garnet wolseleys unless he did it in obedience to some motive or instructions that it was not advisable to publish it is true that sir garnets experience of the zulus was extremely small and that he put aside the advice of those who did know them with that contempt with which he is wont to treat colonists and their opinions sir garnet wolseley does not like colonial people possibly because they have signally failed to appreciate heavenborn genius in his person or his slapdash drumhead sort of way of settling the fate of countries and are indeed so rude as to openly say that in their opinion he did more mischief in africa in a few months than it would take an ordinary official a lifetime to accomplish  however this may be stop his ears as much as he might sir garnet cannot have been entirely blind to the import of what he was doing and the only explanation of his action is that he entered on it more with the idea of flattering and gratifying english public opinion than of doing his best for the zulus or the white colonists on their borders a great outcry had been raised at home where in common with most south african affairs the matter was not thoroughly understood against the supposed intended annexation of zululand for the benefit of greedy colonists it was argued that colonists were anxious for the annexation in order that they might get the land to speculate with and doubtless this was in individual instances true i fully agree with those who think that it would be unwise to throw open zululand to the european settler not on account of the zulus who would benefit by the change but because the result would be a state of affairs similar to that in natal where there are a few white men surrounded by an evergrowing mass of kafirs but there is a vast difference between annexation proper and the protectorate it was our duty to establish over the natives such an arrangement would have presented few difficulties and have brought with it many advantages white men could have been forbidden to settle in the country a small huttax such as the zulus would have cheerfully paid would have brought in forty or fifty thousand a year an ample sum to defray the expenses of the resident and subresidents the maintenance of an adequate native force to keep order and even the execution of necessary public works it is impossible to overrate the advantages that must have resulted both to the zulus and their white neighbours from the adoption of this obvious plan among them being lasting peace and security to life and property or to understand the folly and cruelty that dictated the present arrangement or rather want of arrangement not for many years has england missed such an opportunity of doing good not only at no cost but with positive advantage to herself did we owe nothing to this people whose kingdom we had broken up and whom we had been shooting down by thousands they may well ask as they do continually what they have done that we should treat them as we have and are doing  it cannot be too clearly understood that when the zulus laid down their arms they did so hoping and believing that they would be taken over by the english government which having been fairly beaten by it they now looked on as their head or king and be ruled like their brethren in natal they expected to have to pay taxes and to have white magistrates placed over them and they or the bulk of them looked forward to the change with pleasure it must be remembered that when once they have found their master there exists no more lawabiding people in the world than the zulus provided they are ruled firmly and above all justly believing that such a rule would fall to their lot they surrendered when they did how great then must their surprise have been when they found that without their wishes being consulted in the matter their own hereditary king was to be sent away and thirteen little kings set up in his place with strangest of all a white man as chief little king whilst the british government contented itself with placing a resident in the country to watch the troubles that must ensue  such a settlement as this could only have one object and one result neither of which is at all creditable to the english people the zulus were parcelled out among thirteen chiefs in order that their strength might be kept down by internecine war and mutual distrust and jealousy and as though it were intended to render this result more certain territories were chucked about in the careless way i have described whilst central authority was abolished and the vacant throne is dangled before all eyes labelled the prize of the strongest of course sir garnets paper agreements with the chiefs were for the most part disregarded from the first for instance every chief has his army and uses it too in zululand bloodshed is now a thing of everyday occurrence and the whole country is torn by fear uncertainly and consequent want the settlement is bearing its legitimate fruit some thousands of zulus have already been killed in direct consequence of it and more will doubtless follow and this is the outcome of all the blood and treasure spent over the zulu war well we have settled zululand on the most approved principles and thank heaven british influence has not been extended        a severe famine is said to be imminent in zululand  to show that i am not singular in my opinion as to the present state of zululand i may be allowed to quote a few short extracts taken at random from halfadozen numbers of the natal mercury talking of the zulu settlement terms as dictated by sir g wolseley the leading article of the issue 21st november 1881 saysit will at once be apparent that these terms have in several cases been flagrantly violated especially as regards clauses of 2 3 4 and 6 this last will assuredly be broken again and yet again so long as the british resident occupies the position of an official mollusc the chiefs themselves perceive and admit the evils that must arise out of the absence of any effective central authority these evils are so obvious they were so generally recognised at the outset as being inherent in the scheme that we might almost suppose their occurrence had been deliberately anticipated as a desired outcome of the settlement the morality of such a line of policy would be precisely on a par with that which is involved in the proposal to reinstate cetywayo as a means of dealing with the boers the creation of thirteen kinglets in order that they might destroy each other is as humane and highminded an effort of statesmanship as would be the restoration of a banished king in order that he might eat up a people to whom the same power has just given back their independence to the simple colonial mind such deep designs of machiavellian statecraft are as hateful as they are inhuman and dishonest  a correspondent of the mercury in zululand writes under date of 13th october  i send a line at the last moment to say that things are going from bad to worse at railway speed up to the arrival of sir evelyn wood the chiefs did not fully realise that they were really independent at all now they do and if i mistake not like a beggar on horseback will ride to the devil sharp oham has begun by killing a large number of the amagalusi people my information is derived from native sources and may be somewhat exaggerated it is that the killed at isandhlwana were few compared with those killed by uhamu a few days ago usibebu also and undabuka are i am told on the point of coming to blows and if they do that it will be worse still for undabuka will find supporters throughout the length and breadth of zululand undabuka the full brother of the exking is the protege of the bishop of natal the bishop i find has again sent one of his agents amajuba by name calling for another deputation the deputation is now on its way to natal and that i understand against the express refusal of the resident to allow it in the issue of 14th november is published a letter from mr nunn a gentleman well known in zululand from which as it is too long to quote in its entirety i give a few extractsohams camp oct15the zulus cannot comprehend the transvaal affair and it has been industriously circulated among them that the english have been beaten and forced to give back the transvaal they do not understand gracious acts of restoration after we have been beaten four times this year has umnyamana called his army together and menaced oham who has several times had to have parties of his followers sleeping around his kraal in the hills adjacent so as to give him timely notice to fly when oham left his kraal for the purpose of attending the meeting at inslasatye the same day the whole of the maquilisini tribe came on to the hills adjacent to ohams kraal the injamin and threatened that district this has been the case on two or three former occasions and simultaneously umnyamanas tribe and undabukas followers always flew to arms thus threatening on all sides    trading is and has been for months entirely suspended in this district the fields are unplanted no ploughs or kafirpicks at workall are in a state of excitement not knowing the moment a collision may take place hunger will stare many in the face next year and all the men yelling to their chiefs to be let loose and put an end to this state of uncertainty  mr nunn encloses an account by an eyewitness of a battle which took place on the 2d october 1881 between ohams army and the maquilisini tribe the following is an extracton the 2nd there was a heavy mist and on moving forward the mounted party found themselves in the midst of the enemy the maquilisini and on hearing a cry to stab the horses they rode through them with no casualty except one horse slightly wounded with a bullet the army moving in a half circle now became generally engaged in a handtohand fight and our men were checked and annoyed by a number of the enemy armed with guns who were in a stonekraal and kept up a constant fire amatonga now at the head of the mounted party charged and drove the enemy out of the kraal from which they three several times charged the enemy on the flank assisted by a small infantry party and cut paths through their ranks the fight which had now lasted nearly an hour commenced to flag and ohams army making a sudden rush entirely routed the enemy and the carnage lasted to the bevan river the boundary of the transvaal no women or children were killed but out of an army of about 1500 of the enemy but few escaped sic     the men as they were being killed repeatedly exclaimed we are dying through umnyamana and umlabaku  in the natal mercury of the 13th march occurs the following  zulu countryas to the state of the country it is something we cannot describe everything is upside down and the chiefs appointed by the government are mere nobodies and have not any power over their own people even the resident is in a false position and seems perfectly powerless to act either way we had one row just arriving at a kraal in time to save it from being eaten up witchcraft and killing one of the pretences on which the english made war are of everyday occurrence and fifty times worse than they were before the war oham and tibysio  keep their men continually in the field consequently those districts are at present in a state of famine  sir garnet wolseley executed the zulu settlement on the 1st september 1879 the above extracts will suffice to show the state of the country after it has been working for little more than two years they will also i believe suffice to convince any just and impartial mind that i do not exaggerate when i say that it is an abomination and a disgrace to england the language may be strong but when one hears of 1500 unfortunates nearly twice as many as we lost at isandhlwana being slaughtered in a single intertribal broil it is time to use strong language it is not as though this were an unexpected or an unavoidable development of events every man who knew the zulus predicted the misery that must result from such a settlement but those who directed their destinies turned a deaf ear to all warnings they did not wish to hear  and now we are told that civil war is imminent between the cetywayo or antisettlement party and what i must for want of a better name call the john dunn party or those who have acquired interests under the settlement and who for various reasons wish to see cetywayos face no more if this occurs and it will occur unless the government makes up its mind to do something before long the slaughter not only of men but also of women and children will be enormous fugitives will pour into natal followed perhaps by their pursuers and for aught we know the war may spread into our own dominions we are a philanthropic people very when bulgarians are concerned or when the subject is one that piques the morbid curiosity or is the rage of the moment and the subject of addresses from great and eloquent speakers but we can sit still and let such massacres as these take place when we have but to hold up our hand to stop them when occasionally the veil is lifted a little and the public hears of fresh fighting in zululand a question is asked in the house mr courtney as usual has no information but generally discredits the report and it is put aside as probably not true i am well aware that of the few who read these words many will discredit them or say that they are written for some object or for party purposes but it is not the case they are written in the interest of the truth and in the somewhat faint hope that they may awaken a portion of the public however small to a knowledge of our responsibilities to the unfortunate zulus for try to get rid of it as we may those responsibilities rest upon our shoulders when we conquered the zulu nation and sent away the zulu king we undertook morally at any rate to provide for the future good government of the country otherwise the zulu war was unjust indeed if we continue to fail as we have hitherto to carry out our responsibilities as a humane and christian nation ought to do our lapse from what is right will certainly recoil upon our own heads and in the stern lessons of future troubles and disasters we shall learn that providence with the nation as with the individual makes a neglected duty its own avenger we have sown the wind let us be careful lest we reap the whirlwind  it is very clear that things cannot remain in their present condition if they do it is probable that the resident will sooner or later be assassinated not from any personal motives but as a political necessity and some second chaka will rise up and found a new zulu dynasty sweeping away our artificial chiefs and divisions like cobwebs this idea seems to have penetrated into lord kimberleys official mind since in his despatch of instructions to sir h bulwer written in february last he says probably if the chiefs are left to themselves after a period more or less prolonged of war and anarchy some man will raise himself to the position of supreme chief the prospect of war and anarchy in zululand does not however trouble lord kimberley at all in fact the whole despatch is typical to a degree of the liberal colonial policy lord kimberley admits that what little quiet the country has enjoyed under the settlement was due to a mistaken belief on the part of the zulus that the british government was ruling them or would rule them through the resident he evidently clearly sees all the evils and bloodshed that are resulting and that must result from the present state of affairs indeed he recapitulates them and then ends up by even refusing to allow such slight measures of relief as the appointment of subresidents to be carried out although begged for by the chiefs on the ground that it might extend british influence of the interests of the zulus himself he is quite careless the whole despatch can be summed up thus if you can find any method to improve the state of affairs which will not subject us to the smallest cost risk or responsibility you can employ it if not let them fight it out perhaps lord kimberley may live officially long enough to find out that meanness and selfishness do not always pay and that it is not always desirable thus to sacrifice the respect and crush the legitimate aspirations of a generous people  unless something is done before long it is possible that john dunn may succeed after a bloody war in securing the throne but this would not prove a permanent arrangement since he is now getting on in life and has no son to carry on the dynasty another possibility and one that is not generally known at any rate in this country though it is perhaps the most probable of all is this cetywayo has left a son in zululand who is being carefully educated under the care of mnyamane the late kings prime minister the boy is now about 16 years of age and is reported to possess very good abilities and is the trump card that mnyamane will play as soon as the time is ripe this young man is the hereditary heir to the zulu crown and it is more than probable that if he is proclaimed king the vast majority of the nation will rally round him and establish him firmly on his throne there is little use in keeping cetywayo confined whilst his son is at large the lad should have been brought to england and educated so that he might at some future time have assisted in the civilisation of his country as it is he is growing up in a bad school  and now i come to the root of the whole matter the question whether or no under all these circumstances it is right or desirable to reestablish cetywayo on the throne of zululand in considering this question i think that cetywayos individuality ought to be out on one side however much we may sympathise with his position as i confess i do to some extent myself after all cetywayo is only one man whereas the happiness security and perhaps the lives of many thousands are involved in the issue of the question in coming to any conclusion in the matter it is necessary to keep in view the intentions of the government as regards our future connection with zululand if the government intends to do its duty and rule zululand as it ought to be ruled by the appointment of proper magistrates the establishment of an adequate force and the imposition of the necessary taxes then it would be the height of folly to permit cetywayo to return since his presence would defeat the scheme it must be remembered that there is as yet nothing whatsoever to prevent this plan being carried out it would be welcomed with joy by the large majority of both zulus and colonists it would also solve the problem of the increase of the native population of natal which is assuming the most alarming proportions since zululand being very much underpopulated it would be easy were that country once quietly settled to draft the majority of the natal zulus back into it this is undoubtedly the best course and indeed the only right course but it does not at all follow that it will be taken since governments are unfortunately more concerned at the prospect of losing votes than with the genuine interests of their dependencies the proper settlement of zululand would not be popular amongst a large class in this country and therefore it is not likely to be carried out however right and necessary it may be  if nothing is going to be done then it becomes a question whether or no cetywayo should be sent back  the large majority of the natalians consider that his restoration would be an act of suicidal folly and their opinion is certainly entitled to great weight since they are after all the people principally concerned the issue of the experiment would be a matter of comparative indifference to people living 7000 miles away but is naturally regarded with some anxiety by those who have their homes on the borders of zululand it is very well to sympathise with savage royalty in distress but it must be borne in mind that there are others to be considered besides the captive king many of the zulus for instance are by no means anxious to see him again since they look forward with just apprehension to the line of action he may take with those who have not shown sufficient anxiety for his return or have in other ways incurred his resentment one thing is clear to send the king back to zululand is to restore the status in quo as it was before the war there can be no half measures about it no more worthless paper stipulations a zulu king must either be allowed to rule in his own fashion or not at all the war would go for nothing and would doubtless have to be fought over again with one of cetywayos successors  also it must be remembered that it is one thing to talk of restoring cetywayo and another to carry his restoration into effect it would not simply be a question of turning him down on the borders of zululand and letting him find his own way back to his throne for such a proceeding would be the signal for the outbreak of civil war it is not to be supposed that john dunn and those whose interests are identical with dunns would allow the exking to reseat himself on the throne without a struggle indeed the former has openly declared his intention of resisting the attempt by force of arms if necessary he is by no means anxious to give up the 15000 pounds a year his huttax brings in and all the contingent profits and advantages of his chieftainship if we wish to restore cetywayo we must first depose dunn in fact we must be ready to support his restoration by force of arms  as regards cetywayo himself i cannot share the opinion of those who think that he would be personally dangerous he has learnt his lesson and would not be anxious to try conclusions with the english again indeed i believe he would prove a staunch ally but supposing him reestablished on the throne how long would it be before a revolution or the hand of the assassin to say nothing of the ordinary chances of nature put an end to him and how do we know that his successor in power would share his views  cetywayos rule bad as it was was perhaps preferable to the reign of terror that we have established under the name of a settlement but that we can still remedy if we choose to do so whereas if we once restore cetywayo all power over the zulus passes out of our hands  we have many interests to consider in south africa all of which will be more or less affected by our action in this matter on the whole i am of opinion that the government that replaces cetywayo on the throne of his fathers will undertake a very grave responsibility and must be prepared to deal with many resulting complications not the least of which will be the utter exasperation of the white inhabitants of natal     natal and responsible

bulweruncertain future of natalits available forceexterior dangersthe defence question shirked by the party of progress the confederation questionthe difficulty of obtaining desirable immigrantsthe only real key to the natal native questionfolly of accepting selfgovernment till it is solved  natal has an area of about 18000 square miles and its present population is roughly 25000 whites and 400000 natives of the zulu race when in 1843 it first became a british colony the number of natives living within its borders was very small and they were for the most part wanderers fragmentary remnants of the tribes that chaka had destroyed i shall probably be under rather than over the mark if i say that the zulu population of the colony has multiplied itself by ten during the last thirty years two causes have combined to bring about this extraordinary increase firstly wholesale immigration from the surrounding territories and secondly the practice of polygamy  this immigration has been due to a great want of foresight or want of knowledge on the part of the home authorities who have allowed it to go on without check or hindrance till it has in conjunction with its twin evil polygamy produced the state of affairs it is my object to describe ever since its first establishment as a colony natal has been turned into a city of refuge for the native inhabitants of zululand the transvaal swaziland and elsewhere if news came to a zulu chief that his king purposed to eat him up he at once fled across the tugela with his wives and followers and settled in natal if the boers or swazis destroyed a tribe the remnant found its way to natal  that country indeed is to the south african native a modern isles of the blest once across the border line and whatever his crime he is in a position to defy his worst enemy and can rest secure in the protection of the home and local governments and of the enactments specially passed to protect him and his privileges the government allots him land or if it does not he squats on private land bringing with him his own peculiar and barbarous customs in all the world i do not know a race more favoured by circumstances than the natal zulus they live on the produce of the fields that their wives cultivate or rather scratch doing little or no work and having no occasion to do any they are very rich and their taxes are a mere trifle fifteen shillings per annum for each hut they bear no share of the curse that comes to all other men as a birthright they need not labour protected by a powerful government they do not fear attack from without or internal disorder what all men desire riches and women are theirs in abundance and even their children the objects of so much expense and sore perplexity to civilised parents are to them a source of wealth their needs are few a straw hut corn for food and the bright sun they are not even troubled with the thought of a future life but like the animals live through their healthy happy days and at last in extreme old age meet a death which for them has no terrors because it simply means extinction when compared to that of civilised races or even of their own brethren in the interior their lot is indeed a happy one  but the stream of immigration continuous though it has been would not by itself have sufficed to bring up the native population to its present enormous total without the assistance of the polygamous customs of the immigrants  i believe that inquirers have ascertained that as a general rule the practice of polygamy has not the effect of bringing about an abnormal growth of population however this may be elsewhere in natal owing in great measure to the healthy customs of the zulu race the rate of increase is unprecedented many writers and other authorities consider polygamy as an institution to be at once wicked and disgusting as to its morality it is a point upon which it is difficult to express any opinion nor indeed does the question enter into the scope of what i have to say but it must be remembered that in the case of the zulu his whole law and existence is mixed up with the institution and that it is necessary to him to repair the gaps made in his ranks by war violent antipolygamists in this country always make a strong point of the cruelty it is supposed to involve to the women and talk about the violation of their holiest feelings as a matter of fact sad as it may appear the zulu women are much attached to the custom nor would they as a general rule consent to marry a man who only purposed taking one wife there are various reasons for this for instance the first wife is a person of importance and takes precedence of all the others a fact as much appreciated by the zulu woman as by the london lady again the more wives there are the more wealth it brings into the family since in the ordinary course of nature more wives mean more female children who when they come to a marriageable age mean in their turn at least ten cows each the government price for a wife the amount thus obtained is placed to the credit of the estate of the mother of the girl married and for this reason all zulu women are extremely anxious to have children especially female children finally the liking of zulu women for the custom is bred in them it has been going on for countless generations and it is probable that it will go on for so long as the race endures nations do not change such habits unless the change is forced on them with the alternative of extermination        as soon as a zulu woman is discovered to be pregnant      her husband ceases to cohabit with her nor does he live      with her again until the child is weaned eighteen months      and sometimes two years after its birth  polygamy will never be eradicated by moral persuasion because even if a native could be brought to think it wrong which is in itself impossible its abolition would affect his interests irredeemably a zulus wives are also his servants they plough his land and husband his grain in addition to bearing his children had he but one wife most of her time would be taken up with the latter occupation and then the mealieplanting and gathering would necessarily fall to the lot of the husband a state of affairs he would never consent to again if monogamy were established girls would lose their value and a great source of wealth would be destroyed it must however be understood that zulu girls are not exactly sold the cows received by the parents are by a legal fiction supposed to be a gift presented not a price paid should the wife subsequently run away they are i believe returnable  on these subjects as is not to be wondered at when so many interests are concerned the zulu law is a little intricate the cleverest counsel in the temple could not give an opinion on such a case as the following  a has four wives and children by nos 1 and 3 on his death his brother b a rich man takes over his wives and property and has children by each of the four women he has also children by other wives on his death in extreme old age how should the property be divided amongst the descendants of the various marriages  it is clear that if such a case as this is to be dealt with at all it must be under native law and this is one of the great dangers of polygamy once rooted in a state it necessitates a double system of laws since civilised law is quite unable to cope with the cases daily arising from its practice it is sometimes argued that the law employed is a matter of indifference provided that substantial justice is done according to the ideas of people concerned and this is doubtless very true if it is accepted as a fact that the zulu population of natal is always to remain in its present condition of barbarism to continue to administer their law is to give it the sanction of the white mans authority and every day that it is so administered makes it more impossible to do away with it i say more impossible advisedly because i believe its abrogation is already impossible there is no satisfactory way out of the difficulty because it has its roots in and draws its existence from the principle of polygamy which i believe will last while the people last  some rely on the missionary to effect this stupendous change and turn a polygamous people into monogamists but it is a wellknown fact that the missionaries produce no more permanent effect on the zulu mind than a child does on the granite rock which he chips at with a chisel how many real christians are there in zululand and natal and of that select and saintly band how many practise monogamy but very few and among those few there is a large proportion of bad characters men who have adopted christianity as a last resource i mean no disrespect to the missionaries many of whom are good men doing their best under the most unpromising conditions though some are simply traders and political agitators but the fact remains the same christianity makes no appreciable progress amongst the zulu natives whilst on the other hand no one having any experience in the country will if he can avoid it have a socalled christian kafir in his house because the term is but too frequently synonymous with that of drunkard and thief i do not wish it to be understood that it is the fact of his christianity that so degrades the zulu because i do not think it has anything to do with it it is only that the novice standing on the threshold of civilisation as a rule finds the vices of the white man more congenial than his virtues  the zulus are as difficult to convince of the truths of christianity as were the jews whom they so much resemble in their customs they have a natural disinclination to believe that which they cannot see and being constitutionally very clever and casuistical are prepared to argue each individual point with an ability very trying to missionaries it was one of these zulus known as the intelligent zulu but in reality no more intelligent than his fellows whose shrewd remarks first caused doubts to arise in the mind of bishop colenso and through him in those of thousands of others  another difficulty in the way of the missionary is that he is obliged to insist on the putting away of surplus wives and thus to place himself out of court at the outset it is quite conceivable that in the opinion of wild and savage men it is preferable to let the new teaching alone rather than to adopt it at the cost of such a radical change in their domestic arrangements as a case in point i may quote that of hlubi the basutu appointed chief of one of the divisions of zululand by sir g wolseley hlubi is at heart a christian and a good man and anxious to be baptized the missionaries however refuse to baptize him because he has two wives hlubi therefore remains a heathen saying not unnaturally that he feels it would be impossible for him to put away a woman with whom he has lived for so many years  whilst polygamy endures christianity will advance with but small strides it seems to me that we are beginning at the wrong end we must civilise first and christianise afterwards as well try to sow corn among rocks and look to gather a full crop as expect the words of grace and divine love to bear fruit in the hearts of a people whose forefathers have for countless generations been men of blood whose prized traditions are one long story of slaughter and who if they are now at peace are as it were only gathering strength for a surer spring first the soil must be prepared before the seed is sown  to do this there is but one way abolish native customs and laws especially polygamy and bring our zulu subjects within the pale of our own law deprive them of their troops of servants in the shape of wives and thus force them to betake themselves to honest labour like the rest of mankind  there is only one objection in the way of the realisation of this scheme which would doubtless bring about in the course of a generation a much better state of things and gather many thousand converts into the fold of the church and that is the opportunity has so far as natal is concerned been missedthe time has gone by when it could have been carried out to young countries as to young men there come sometimes opportunities of controlling their future destinies which if not seized at the moment pass away for ever or only to return after long and troubled years natal has had her chance and it has gone away from her though through no fault of her own if when the colony was first settled the few natives who then lived there had been forced to conform to the usages of civilised life or to quit its borders if refugees had been refused admission save on the same terms it would not occupy the very serious position it does at the present moment  to understand the situation into which natal has drifted with reference to its native inhabitants it is necessary to premise that that country has hitherto had practically no control over its own affairs more especially as regards native legislation  in its early days it was a happy quiet place a favoured clime where the traveller or settler could find good shooting cheap labour and cheap living no enemy threatened its rest and the natives were respectful and peaceful in their behaviour but it was in those days that the native difficulty that upas tree that now overshadows and poisons the whole land took root for slowly from all parts all through that quiet time by ones by tens by hundreds refugees were flowing in and asking and receiving land to settle on from the government  it is not however to be supposed that the local officials did not perceive the gathering danger since it has again and again been pointed out to different secretaries of state and again and again been ignored by them or put off for the consideration of their successors handtomouth legislation has always been the characteristic of our rule in south africa on one occasion sir theophilus then mr shepstone went so far as to offer to personally draw off a large portion of the native population and settle them on some vacant territory bordering on the cape colony but the suggestion was not acceded to for fear lest the execution of the scheme should excite disturbances amongst the natives of the cape thus year after year has passed awayplan after plan has been put asideand nothing has been done  in the colony a great deal of abuse is poured out on the head of sir t shepstone to whom the present native situation is unjustly attributed by a certain party of politicians sir t shepstone was for very many years secretary for native affairs in natal but until he came to england shortly before the termination of his official career he was personally unknown to the colonial office and had no influence there it was totally out of his power to control the policy of the home government with reference to the natal natives he could only take things as he found them and make the best of such materials as came to his hand as he could not keep the natives out of the colony or prevent polygamy he did what he could towards making them loyal and contented subjects how well he succeeded and with what consummate tact and knowledge he must have exercised his authority is shown by the fact that in all these years there has been but one native disturbance namely that of langalibalele and by the further fact that the loyalty of the natal zulus stood the strain of the zulu war also there never has been and probably never will be another white man so universally beloved and reverenced by the natives throughout the length and breadth of south africa  but sir t shepstones influence for good will pass away as all purely personal influence must and meanwhile what is the situation on the one hand there is a very slowly increasing scattered and mixed population of about 25000 whites capable at the outside of putting a force of 4000 men in the field on the other there is a warlike native population united by the ties of race and common interests numbering at the present moment between 400000 and 500000 and increasing by leaps and bounds capable of putting quite 80000 warriors into the field and possessing besides numerous strongholds called locations at present these two rival populations live side by side in peace and amity though at heart neither loves the other the two races are so totally distinct that it is quite impossible for them to have much community of feeling they can never mingle their ideas are different their objects are different and in natal their very law is different kafirs respect and like individual englishmen but i doubt whether they are particularly fond of us as a race though they much prefer us to any other white men and are devoted to our rule so long as it is necessary to them the average white man on the other hand detests the kafir and looks on him as a lazy goodfornothing who ought to work for him and will not work for him whilst he is quite incapable of appreciating his many good points it is an odd trait about zulus that only gentlemen in the true sense of the word can win their regard or get anything out of them  it is obvious that sooner or later these two races must come into contact the question being how long the present calm will last to this question i will venture to suggest an answeri believe the right one it will last until the native gets so cramped for room that he has no place left to settle on except the white mans lands the white man will then try to turn him off whereupon the native will fall back on the primary resource of killing him and possessing himself of the land by force this plan simultaneously carried out on a large scale would place the colony at the mercy of its native inhabitants  nor is the time so very far distant when englishmen and zulus will stand face to face over this land question in the early days of the colony locations were established in the mountainous districts because they were comparatively worthless and the natives were settled in them by tribes of what goes on in these locations very little is known except that they are crowded and that the inhabitants are as entirely wedded to their savage customs as their forefathers were before them as there is no more room in the locations many thousands of kafirs have settled upon private lands sometimes with and sometimes without the leave of the owners but for many reasons this is a state of affairs that cannot go on for ever in a few years the private lands will be filled up as well as the locations and what then  zulus are a people who require a very large quantity of land since they possess great numbers of cattle which must have grazing room also their cultivation being of the most primitive order and consisting as it does of picking out the very richest patches of land and cropping them till they are exhausted all ordinary land being rejected as too much trouble to work the possession or the right of usor of several hundred acres is necessary to the support of a single family nor if we may judge from precedent and its wellmarked characteristics is it to be supposed that this race will at the pinch suit itself to circumstances take up less land and work harder zulus would rather fight to the last than discard a cherished and an ancient custom savages they are and savages they will remain and in the struggle between them and civilisation it is possible that they may be conquered but i do not believe that they will be converted the zulu kafir is incompatible with civilisation  it will be seen from what i have said that natal might more properly be called a black settlement than an english colony looking at it from the former point of view it is a very interesting experiment for the first time probably since their race came into existence zulu natives have got a chance given them of increasing and multiplying without being periodically decimated by the accidents of war whilst at the same time enjoying the protection of a strong and a just government it remains to be seen what use they will make of their opportunity that they will avail themselves of it for the purposes of civilising themselves i do not believe but it seems to me possible that they will learn from the white man the advantages of combination and aim at developing themselves into a powerful and united black nation  it is in the face of this state of things that lord kimberley now proposes to grant responsible government to the white inhabitants of natal should they be willing to accept it providing that it is to carry with it the responsibility of ruling the natives and further of defending the colony from the attacks of its neighbours whether white or coloured  natal has hitherto been ruled under a hybrid constitution which whilst allowing the legislative assembly of the colony to pass laws c reserves all real authority to the crown there has however been for some years past a growing agitation amongst a proportion of its inhabitants instituted with the object of inducing the home government to concede practical independence to the colony her majesty having on several occasions been petitioned on the subject by the legislative council on the 13th february 1880 sir g wolseley who was at the time governor of natal wrote what i can only call a very intemperate despatch to the secretary of state commenting on the prayer for responsible government which he strongly condemned he also took the opportunity to make a series of somewhat vicious attacks on the colonists in general whose object in asking for independence was he implied to bring the black man in relations of appropriate servitude to his white superior it would appear however from words used by him towards the end of his despatch that the real reason of his violence was that he feared that one of the first acts of the natal parliament would be to put an end to his settlement in zululand which was and is the laughingstock of the colony he was probably right in this supposition the various charges he brings against the colonists are admirably and conclusively refuted in a minute adopted by the legislative council of natal dated 20th december 1880  in a despatch dated 15th march 1881 lord kimberley refuses to accede to the request for the grant of responsible government  on the 28th of december the legislative council again petitioned the crown on the subject and forward to lord kimberley a report of a select committee appointed to consider the matter in which the following words occur  your committee hold that while the colony may well be held responsible for its defence from such aggression as may be caused by the acts or policy of a responsible government it cannot justly be saddled with the obligation to meet acts of aggression from bordering territories that have arisen out of the circumstances or measures over which such government have had no control although as a matter of fact the brunt of defence must be borne in the first instance by the colonists the council therefore neither exercises nor desires to exercise any control over territories adjacent to or bordering on the colony for the preservation of its own internal peace and order the colony is prepared to provide the duty of protecting the colony from external foes whether by sea or land devolves on the empire as a whole otherwise to be a section of that empire constitutes no real privilege  to this report somewhat to the surprise of the natalians lord kimberley returned in a despatch addressed to sir h bulwer on the occasion of his departure to take up the governorship of natal and dated 2d february 1882 a most favourable reply in fact he is so obliging as to far exceed the wishes of the natalians as expressed in the passage just quoted and to tell them that her majestys government is not only ready to give them responsible government but that it will expect them to defend their own frontiers independently of any assistance from the imperial government he further informs them that the imperial troops will be withdrawn and that the only responsibility her majestys government will retain with reference to the colony will be that of its defence against aggression by foreign powers  this sudden change of face on the part of the imperial government which had up till now flatly refused to grant any measure of selfgovernment to natal may at first seem rather odd but on examination it will be found to be quite in accordance with the recently developed south african policy of mr gladstones government there is little doubt that it is an article of faith among the liberal party that the less the mothercountry has to do with her colonies and more especially her south african colonies the better a grand step was made in the direction of the abandonment of our south african empire when we surrendered the transvaal to the boers and it is clear that if our troops can be withdrawn from natal and all responsibility for the safety of that colony put an end to the triumph of selfeffacement will be still more complete but there is another and more immediate reason for lord kimberleys generous offer he knows no one better that the policy pursued in south africa both as regards the transvaal and zululand must produce its legitimate fruitbloodshedbefore very long he or rather his government is consequently anxious to cut the connection before anything of the sort occurs when they will be able to attribute the trouble whatever it is to the illadvised action of the colonial legislature  what is still more strange however is that the colonists having regard to the position they occupy with reference to the kafirs that surround them to whom they bear the same relative proportion that the oases do in the desert or the islands of an archipelago to the ocean that washes their shores should wish for such a dangerous boon as that of selfgovernment if indeed they really do wish it when i lived in natal i often heard the subject discussed and watched the legislative council pass its periodical resolutions about it but i confess i always looked on the matter as being more or less of a farce there exists however in natal a knot of politicians who are doubtless desirous of the change partly because they think that it would be really beneficial and partly because they are possessed by a laudable ambition to fill the high positions of prime minister treasurer c in the future parliament but these gentlemen for the most part live in towns where they are comparatively safe should a native rising occur i have not noticed the same enthusiasm for responsible government among those natalians who live up country in the neighbourhood of the locations  still there does exist a considerable party who are in favour of the change a party that has recently sprung into existence many things have occurred within the last few years to irritate and even exasperate people in natal with the imperial government and generally with the treatment that they have received at our hands for instance colonists are proverbially sensitive and it is therefore rather hard that every newspaper correspondent or itinerant bookmaker who comes to their shores should at once proceed to print endless letters and books abusing them without mercy the fact of the matter is that these gentlemen come and put up at the hotels and potshops where they meet all the loafers and bad characters in the country whom they take to be specimens of the best class of colonists whom they describe accordingly as the riddlings of society into the quiet respectable and happy homes that really give the tone to the colony they do not enter  it is also a favourite accusation to bring against the people of natal that they make the south african wars in order to make money out of them for instance in a leading article of one of the principal english journals it was stated not long ago that the murmurs of the colonists at being forced to eat the bread of humiliation in the transvaal matter arose from no patriotic feeling but from sorrow at the early termination of a war out of which they hoped to suck no small advantage this statement is quite untrue  no doubt a great deal of money has been made out of the wars by a few colonial speculators some of it maybe dishonestly but this is not an unusual occurrence in a foreign war was no money made dishonestly by english speculators and contractors in the crimean war cannot manchester boast manufacturers ready to supply our enemiesfor cash paymentswith guns to shoot us with or any other material of war  it is not to be supposed that because a few speculators made fortunes out of the commissariat that the whole colony participated in the spoils of the various wars on the contrary the marjority of its inhabitants have suffered very largely not only have they run considerable personal risk but since and owing to the zulu and boer wars the cost of living has almost if not quite doubled which needless to say has not been the case with their incomes it is therefore particularly cruel that natal should be gibbeted as the abode of scoundrels of the worst sort men prepared to bring about bloodshed in order to profit by it sir garnet wolseley however found in this report of colonial dishonesty a convenient point of vantage from which to attack the colonists generally and in his despatch about responsible government we may be sure he did not spare them the legislative council thus comments on his remarks to colonists a war means the spreading among them of distress alarm and confusion peril to life and property in outlying districts the arrest of progress and general disorganisation    the council regard with pain and indignation the uncalledfor and cruel stigma thus cast upon the colonists by sir garnet wolseley  at first sight these accusations may not appear to have much to do with the question of whether or no the colonists should accept responsible government but in reality they have inasmuch as they create a feeling of soreness that inclines the natalians to get rid of imperial interference and the attendant criticism at any price  more substantial grievances against the english government are the present condition of the native problem which the colonists justly attribute to imperial mismanagement and that triumph of genius sir garnet wolseleys settlement in zululand they see these evils which they know were preventable growing more formidable day by day and they imagine or some of them do that if they had free institutions it would still be in their power to stop that growth  the whole question has now been referred to the colony which is to elect a fresh legislative assembly on the issue of responsible government the struggle between the party of progress ie the responsible government section and the reactionists or those who are prepared to dispense with freedom provided they can be sure of safety is being carried on keenly and at present it is doubtful which side will have a majority i do not however believe that the majority of any council returned will consent to accept lord kimberleys proposal as it stands to walk into a parlour in which the spider is so very obvious and to deliberately undertake the guardianship of all the imperial interests in southeastern africa if they do they will in my opinion deserve all they will get        since this chapter was written the natal constituencies      have as i thought probable declared against the acceptance      of lord kimberleys offer in its present form by returning      a majority of antiresponsible government men it is      however probable that the new legislative council will try      to reopen negotiations on a different or at any rate a      modified basis  the natalians are fortunate at the present crisis in having by dint of vigorous agitation against the appointment of mr sendall a gentleman selected by lord kimberley to govern them obtained the reappointment of their former governor sir henry bulwer sir henry during his first tenure of office lost credit with the south african colonists on account of his lukewarmness with reference to the zulu war but the course of events has gone far towards justifying his views he is one of the most hardworking and careful governors that natal has ever had and perhaps the most judicious of a temperate and a cautious mind he may be more safely trusted to pilot a country so surrounded with difficulties and dangers as natal is than most men and it is to be hoped that the application to the questions of the day of the strong common sense that he possesses in such an eminent degree may have a cooling effect on the hot heads and excited imaginations of the party of progress  in considering the pros and cons of the responsible government question it must be steadily kept in sight that natal is not likely to be a country with a peaceful future to begin with she has her native inhabitants to deal with today they number say 450000 fifteen or twenty years hence they will number a million or perhaps more these men are no longer the docile overgrown children they were twenty years ago the lessons of our performances in the zulu and boer wars more especially the latter have not been lost upon them and they are beginning to think that the white man instead of being the unconquerable demigod they thought him is somewhat of a humbug pharaoh we know grew afraid of the israelites natal with a much weaker power at command than that of pharaoh has got to cope with a still more dangerous element and one that cannot be induced to depart into the wilderness  and after all what does the power of natal amount to let us be liberal and say six thousand men it is the outside in the event of a native rising or any other serious war i believe that of this number at least two thousand would make themselves scarce there exists in all colonies a floating element of individuals who have drifted there for the purpose of making money but who have no real affection for the temporary country of their adoption their capital is as a rule small and easily realised and the very last thing that they would think of doing would be to engage in a deadly life or death struggle on behalf of a land that they only look on as a milch cow out of which their object is to draw as much as possible on the contrary they would promptly seek another cow leaving the old one to the tender mercies of the butcher  their defection would leave some 4000 men to cope with the difficulty whatever it was of which number at least 1000 would be ineffective from age and various other causes whilst of the remainder quite 1000 would be obliged to remain where they were to protect women and children in outlying districts this would leave a total effective force of 2000 men or deducting 500 for garrison purposes of 1500 ready to take the field but it would take some time to collect arm and equip even this number and in the meanwhile in the case of a sudden and preconcerted native rising half the inhabitants of the colony would be murdered in detail  but natalians have got other dangers to fear besides those arising from the presence of this vast mass of barbarism in their midst after a period of anarchy a new king may possess himself of the throne of zululand and it is even possible that he might under circumstances that will arise hereafter lead his armies into natal and create a difficulty with which the 1500 available white men would find it difficult to cope or the boers of the orange free state and transvaal may get tired of paying customs dues at durban and march 5000 men down to take possession of the port perhaps natal might provide herself with an effective force by enrolling an army of 10000 or 20000 kafirs but it seems to me that the proceeding would be both uncertain and expensive and should the army take it into its head to mutiny very dangerous to boot  it is a noticeable fact that those who so ardently advocate the acceptance of lord kimberleys offer in all their speeches addresses and articles almost entirely shirk this question of defence which is after all the root of the matter i have formed my estimate of the number of men forthcoming in time of danger on the supposition that a burgher law was in force in natal that is that every man remaining in the country should be obliged to take a part in its defence but they do not even hint at a burgher lawin fact they repudiate the idea because they know that it would not be tolerated the universal service system is not the natalians idea of happiness they simply avoid the question calling it the defence bugbear and assume that it will all be arranged in some unforeseen way  the only suggestion that i have yet seen as regards the arrangements for the future defence of the colony should it become independent is a somewhat ominous one namelythat natal should enter into a close alliance offensive and defensive with the transvaal and the orange free state but as the advocates of freedom would soon find the orange free state for even if willing to help them the transvaal will for some years have enough to do with its own affairs will not come forward for nothing there would first have to be a few business formalities with reference to the customs dues collected in durban on goods passing through to the interior which yield the bulk of the natal revenue and possibly some concessions to boer public opinion as regards the english mode of dealing with the natal natives i incline to the opinion that in relying on the assistance of the boers in time of trouble the inhabitants of natal would be leaning on a broken reed they are more likely to find them in arms against them than fighting on their side  the party of progress also talks much about the prospects of confederation with the cape if once they get responsible government most people however will think that the fact of their being independent and therefore responsible for their own defence will hardly prove an inducement to the cape to offer to share those responsibilities the only confederation possible to natal as a selfgoverning community will be a boer confederation to which it may be admittedon certain terms another cry is that the moment responsible government is established immigrants will flow into the country and thus restore the balance of races i take the liberty to doubt the truth of this supposition the intending emigrant from europe does not it is true understand the ins and outs of the natal native question but he does now that it is a place where there are wars and rumours of wars and where he might possibly be killed and the result is that he wisely goes to some other colony that has equal advantages to offer and no kafirs to suppose that the emigrant would go to natal when he came to understand that it was an independent settlement of a few white men living in the midst of a mass of warlike kafirs when australia new zealand canada and the united states are all holding out their arms to him is to suppose him a bigger fool than he is at the best of times natal is not likely to attract many desirable emigrants under a responsible government i do not believe that it will attract any  it seems to me that there is only one condition of affairs under which it would be at all possible for the natalians to assume the responsibilities of selfgovernment with any safety and that is when the great bulk of the native population has been removed back to whence it camezululand causes of a diametrically opposite nature to those that have been at work among the natives of natal have been in operation amongst their brethren in zululand in natal peace polygamy plenty and immigration have bred up an enormous native population in zululand war private slaughter by the kings order and the severe restrictions put upon marriage have kept down the increase of the race also an enormous number of individuals have fled from the one country into the other i do not suppose that the population of zululand amounts at the present moment to much more than half that of natal  in this state of affairs lies the only real key to the natal native difficulty let zululand be converted into a black colony under english control and its present inhabitants be established in suitable locations then let all the natives of natal with the exception of those who choose to become monogamists and be subject to civilised law be moved into zululand and also established in locations there would be plenty of room for them all of course there would be difficulties in the way of the realisation of this scheme but i do not think that they would prove insuperable it is probable however that it would require a show of force before the natal natives would consent to budge indeed it is absurd to suppose that anything would induce them to leave peaceful natal and plunge into the seething cauldron of bloodshed extortion and political plots that we have cooked up in zululand under the name of a settlement proper provisions must first be made for the government of the country and security to life and property made certain till this is done no natives in their senses will return to zululand  till this is done too or till some other plan is discovered by means of which the native difficulty can be effectively dealt with the natalians will indeed be foolish if they discard the protection of england and accept the fatal boon of selfgovernment if they do their future career may be brilliant but i believe that it will be brief  it is no answer to urge that at present the natives seem quite quiet and that there is no indication of disturbance  history tells us that before the destruction of doomed pompeii vesuvius was very still only day by day the dark cloud hanging over the mountains summit grew denser and blacker we know what happened to pompeii  i do not wish to suggest anything unpleasant far from it but sometimes i cannot help thinking that it is perhaps a matter worth the consideration of the natalians whether it might not be as well instead of talking about responsible government to improve upon the example of the inhabitants of pompeii and take to their ships before the volcano begins to work  it seems to me that there is an ugly cloud gathering on the political horizon in natal     the transvaal    chapter i  its inhabitants laws and customs  invasion by mosilikatzearrival of the emigrant boersestablishment of the south african republicthe sand river

transvaal is a country without a history its very existence was hardly known of until about fifty years ago of its past we know nothing the generations who peopled its great plains have passed utterly out of the memory and even the traditions of man leaving no monument to mark that they have existed not even a tomb  during the reign of chaka 18131828 whose history has been sketched in a previous chapter one of his most famous generals mosilikatze surnamed the lion seceded from him with a large number of his soldiers and striking up in a northwesterly direction settled in or about what is now the morico district of the transvaal the country through which mosilikatze passed was at that time thickly populated with natives of the basutu or macatee race whom the zulus look upon with great contempt mosilikatze expressed the feelings of his tribe in a practical manner by massacring every living soul of them that came within his reach that the numbers slaughtered were very great the numerous ruins of basutu kraals all over the country testify  it was chakas intention to follow up mosilikatze and destroy him but he was himself assassinated before he could do so dingaan his successor however carried out his brothers design and despatched a large force to punish him this army after marching over 300 miles burst upon mosilikatze drove him back with slaughter and returned home triumphant the invasion is important because the zulus claim the greater part of the transvaal territory by virtue of it  about the time that mosilikatze was conquered 18351840 the discontented boers were leaving the cape colony exasperated at the emancipation of the slaves by the imperial authorities first they made their way to natal but being followed thither by the english flag they travelled further inland over the vaal river and founded the town of mooi river dorp or potchefstroom here they were joined by other malcontents from the orange sovereignty which although afterwards abandoned was at that time a british possession acting upon       the good old rule the simple plan      of let him take who has the power      and let him keep who can  the boers now proceeded to possess themselves of as much territory as they wanted nor was this a difficult task the country was as i have said peopled by macatees who are a poorspirited race as compared to the zulus and had had what little courage they possessed crushed out of them by the rough handling they had received at the hands of mosilikatze and dingaan the boers they argued could not treat them worse than the zulus had done occasionally a chief bolder than the rest would hold out and then such an example was made of him and his people that few cared to follow in his footsteps  as soon as the boers were fairly settled in their new home they began to think about setting up a government first they tried a system of commandants with a commandantgeneral but this does not seem to have answered next those of their number who lived in lydenburg district where the gold fields now are set up a republic with a president and volksraad or popular assembly this example was followed by the other white inhabitants of the country who formed another republic and elected another president with pretoria for their capital the two republics were subsequently incorporated  in 1852 the imperial authorities having regard to the expense of maintaining an effective government over an unwilling people in an undeveloped and halfconquered country concluded a convention with the emigrant boers beyond the vaal river the following were the principal stipulations of this convention drawn up between major hogg and mr owen her majestys assistantcommissioners for the settling and adjusting of the affairs of the eastern and northeastern boundaries of the colony of the cape of good hope on the one part and a deputation representative of the emigrant farmers north of the vaal river on the other it was guaranteed in the fullest manner on the part of the british government to the emigrant farmers beyond the vaal river the right to manage their own affairs and to govern themselves according to their own laws without any interference on the part of the british government and that no encroachment shall be made by the said government on the territory beyond to the north of the vaal river with the further assurance that the warmest wish of the british government is to promote peace free trade and friendly intercourse with the emigrant farmers now inhabiting or who hereafter may inhabit that country it being understood that this system of noninterference is binding on both parties  next were disclaimed on behalf of the british government all alliances whatever and with whomsoever of the coloured nations to the north of the vaal river  it was also agreed that no slavery is or shall be permitted or practised in the country to the north of the vaal river by the emigrant farmers  it was further agreed that no objection shall be made by any british authority against the emigrant boers purchasing their supplies of ammunition in any of the british colonies and possessions of south africa it being mutually understood that all trade in ammunition with the native tribes is prohibited both by the british government and the emigrant farmers on both sides of the vaal river  these were the terms of this famous convention which is as slipshod in its diction as it is vague in its meaning what for instance is meant by the territory to the north of the vaal river according to the letter of the agreement messrs hogg and owen ceded all the territory between the vaal and egypt this historical document was the charta of the newborn south african republic under its provisions the boers now safe from interference on the part of the british established their own government and promulgated their grond wet or constitution  the history of the republic between 1852 and 1876 is not very interesting and is besides too wearisome to enter into here it consists of an ofttold tale of civil broils attacks on native tribes and encroachment on native territories until shortly before the annexation every burgher was on coming of age entitled to receive from the government 6000 acres of land as these rights were in the early days of the republic frequently sold to speculators for such trifles as a bottle of brandy or half a dozen of beer and as the seller still required his 6000 acres for a boer considers it beneath his dignity to settle on less it is obvious that it required a very large country to satisfy all demands to meet these demands the territories of the republic had to be stretched like an elastic band and they were stretched accordinglyat the expense of the natives the stretching process was an ingenious one and is very well described in a minute written by mr osborn the late magistrate at newcastle dated 22d september 1876 in these words  the boers as they have done in other cases and are still doing encroached by degrees on native territory commencing by obtaining permission to graze stock upon portions of it at certain seasons of the year followed by individual graziers obtaining from native headmen a sort of right or license to squat upon certain defined portions ostensibly in order to keep other boer squatters away from the same land these licenses temporarily intended as friendly or neighbourly acts by unauthorised headmen after a few seasons of occupation by the boer are construed by him as title and his permanent occupation ensues damage for trespass is levied by him from the very man from whom he obtained the right to squat to which the natives submit out of fear of the matter reaching the ears of the paramount chief who would in all probability severely punish them for opening the door to encroachment by the boer after a while however the matter comes to a crisis in consequence of the incessant disputes between the boers and the natives one or other of the disputants lays the case before the paramount chief who when hearing both parties is literally frightened with violence and threats by the boer into granting him the land upon this the usual plan followed by the boer is at once to collect a few neighbouring boers including a field cornet or even an acting provisional field cornet appointed by the field cornet or provisional cornet the latter to represent the government although without instructions authorising him to act in the matter a few cattle are collected among themselves which the party takes to the chief and his signature is obtained to a written document alienating to the republican boers a large slice of all his territory the contents of this document are as far as i can make out never clearly or intelligibly explained to the chief who signs and accepts of the cattle under the impression that it is all in settlement of hire for the grazing licenses granted by his headmen this i have no hesitation in saying is the usual method by which the boers obtain what they call cessions to them of territories by native chiefs in secocoenis case they allege that his father sequati cedes to them the whole of his territory hundreds of square miles for a hundred head of cattle  so rapidly did this progress go on that the little republic to the north of the vaal river had at the time of the annexation grown into a country of the size of france its boundaries had only been clearly defined where they abutted on neighbouring white communities or on the territories of great native powers on which the government had not dared to infringe to any marked degree such as those of lo bengulas people in the north but wheresoever on the states borders there had been no white power to limit its advances or where the native tribes had found themselves too isolated or too weak to resist aggressions there the republic had by degrees encroached and extended the shadow if not the substance of its authority  the transvaal has a boundary line of over 1600 miles in circumference and of this a large portion is disputed by different native tribes speaking generally the territory lies between the 22 and 28 degrees of south latitude and the 25 and 32 degrees of east longitude or between the orange free state natal and griqualand west on the south and the limpopo river on the north and between the lebombo mountains on the east and the kalihari desert on the west on the north of its territory live three great tribes the makalaka the matabele descendants of the zulus who deserted chaka under mosilikatze and the matyana these tribes are all warlike on the west following the line down to the diamond field territory are the sicheli the bangoaketsi the baralong and the koranna tribes passing round by griqualand west the free state and natal we reach zululand on the southeast corner then come the lebombo mountains on the east separating the transvaal from amatonga land and from the socalled portuguese possessions which are entirely in the hands of native tribes most of them subject to the great zulu chief umzeila who has his stronghold in the northeast  it will be observed that the country is almost surrounded by native tribes besides these there are about one million native inhabitants living within its borders in one district alone zoutpansberg it is computed that there are 364250 natives as compared to about 750 whites  if a beautiful and fertile country were alone necessary to make a state and its inhabitants happy and prosperous happiness and prosperity would rain upon the transvaal and the dutch boers the capabilities of this favoured land are vast and various within its borders are to be found highlands and lowlands vast stretches of rolling veldt like gigantic sheep downs hundreds of miles of swelling bushland huge tracts of mountainous country and even little glades spotted with timber that remind one of an english park there is every possible variety of soil and scenery some districts will grow all tropical produce whilst others are well suited for breeding sheep cattle and horses most of the districts will produce wheat and all other cereals in greater perfection and abundance than any of the other south african colonies two crops of cereals may be obtained from the soil every year and both the vine and tobacco are cultivated with great success coffee sugarcane and cotton have been grown with profit in the northern parts of the state also the undeveloped mineral wealth of the country is very great its known minerals are gold copper lead cobalt iron coal tin and plumbago copper and iron having long been worked by the natives altogether there is little doubt that the transvaal is the richest of all the south african states and had it remained under english rule it would with the aid of english enterprise and capital have become a very wealthy and prosperous country however there is little chance of that now  perhaps the greatest charm of the transvaal lies in its climate which is among the best in the world and in all the southern districts very healthy during the winter months that is from april to october little or no rain falls and the climate is cold and bracing in summer it is rather warm but not overpoweringly hot the thermometer at pretoria averaging from 65 to 73 degrees and in the winter from 59 to 56 degrees the population of the transvaal is estimated at about 40000 whites mostly of dutch origin consisting of about thirty vast families and one million natives there are several towns the largest of which are pretoria and potchefstroom  such is the country that we annexed in 1877 and were drummed out of in 1881 now let us turn to its inhabitants it has been the fashion to talk of the transvaal as though nobody but boers lived in it in reality the inhabitants were divided into three classes 1 natives 2 boers 3 english i say were divided because the english class can now hardly be said to exist the country having been made too hot to hold it since the war the natives stand in the proportion of nearly twenty to one to the whites the boers were in their turn much more numerous than the english but the latter owned nearly all the trading establishments in the country and also a very large amount of property  the transvaal boers have been very much praised up by members of the government in england and others who are anxious to advance their interests as against english interests mr gladstone indeed can hardly find words strong enough to express his admiration of their leaders those able men since they inflicted a national humiliation on us and doubtless they are a people with many good points that they are not devoid of sagacity can be seen by the way they have dealt with the english government  the boers are certainly a peculiar people though they can hardly be said to be zealous of good works they are very religious but their religion takes it colour from the darkest portions of the old testament lessons of mercy and gentleness are not at all to their liking and they seldom care to read the gospels what they delight in are the stories of wholesale butchery by the israelites of old and in their own position they find a reproduction of that of the first settlers in the holy land like them they think they are entrusted by the almighty with the task of exterminating the heathen native tribes around them and are always ready with a scriptural precedent for slaughter and robbery the name of the divinity is continually on their lips sometimes in connection with very doubtful statements they are divided into three sects none of which care much for the other two these are the doppers who number about half the population the orthodox reform and the liberal reform which is the least numerous of these three sects the doppers are by far the most uncompromising and difficult to deal with they much resemble the puritans of charles the firsts time of the extreme hewagaginpieces stamp  it is difficult to agree with those who call the boers cowards an accusation which the whole of their history belies a boer does not like fighting if he can avoid it because he sets a high value on his own life but if he is cornered he will fight as well as anybody else the boers fought well enough in the late war though that it is true is no great criterion of courage since they were throughout flushed with victory and owing to the poor shooting of the british troop in but little personal danger one very unpleasant characteristic they have and that is an absence of regard for the truth especially where land is concerned indeed the national characteristic is crystallised into a proverb i am no slave to my word it has several times happened to me to see one set of highly respectable witnesses in a land case go into the box and swear distinctly that they saw a beacon placed on a certain spot whilst an equal number on the other side will swear that they saw it placed a mile away filled as they are with a land hunger to which that of the irish peasant is a weak and colourless sentiment there is little that they will not do to gratify their taste it is the subject of constant litigation amongst them and it is by no means uncommon for a boer to spend several thousand pounds in lawsuits over a piece of land not worth as many hundreds  personally boers are fine men but as a rule ugly their womenfolk are goodlooking in early life but get very stout as they grow older they in common with most of their sex understand how to use their tongues indeed it is said that it was the women who caused the rising against the english government none of the refinements of civilisation enter into the life of an ordinary boer he lives in a way that would shock an english labourer at twentyfive shillings the week although he is very probably worthy fifteen or twenty thousand pounds his home is but too frequently squalid and filthy to an extraordinary degree he himself has no education and does not care that his children should receive any he lives by himself in the middle of a great plot of land his nearest neighbour being perhaps ten or twelve miles away caring but little for the news of the outside world and nothing for its opinions doing very little work but growing daily richer through the increase of his flocks and herds his expenses are almost nothing and as he gets older wealth increases upon him the events in his life consist of an occasional trip on commando against some native tribe attending a few political meetings and the journeys he makes with his family to the nearest town some four times a year in order to be present at nachtmaal or communion foreigners especially englishmen he detests but he is kindly and hospitable to his own people living isolated as he does the lord of a little kingdom he naturally comes to have a great idea of himself and a corresponding contempt for all the rest of mankind laws and taxes are things distasteful to him and he looks upon it as an impertinence that any court should venture to call him to account for his doings he is rich and prosperous and the cares of poverty and all the other troubles that fall to the lot of civilised men do not affect him he has no romance in him nor any of the higher feelings and aspirations that are found in almost every other race in short unlike the zulu he despises there is little of the gentleman in his composition though he is at times capable of acts of kindness and even generosity his happiness is to live alone in the great wilderness with his children his menservants and his maidservants his flocks and his herds the monarch of all he surveys if civilisation presses him too closely his remedy is a simple one he sells his farm packs up his goods and cash in his waggon and starts for regions more congenially wild such are some of the leading characteristics of that remarkable product of south africa the transvaal boer who resembles no other white man in the world  perhaps however the most striking of all his oddities is his abhorrence of all government more especially if that government be carried out according to english principles the boers have always been more or less in rebellion they rebelled against the rule of the company when the cape belonged to holland they rebelled against the english government in the cape they were always in a state of semirebellion against their own government in the transvaal and now they have for the second time with the most complete success rebelled against the english government the fact of the matter is that the bulk of their number hate all governments because governments enforce law and order and they hate the english government worst of all because it enforces law and order most of all it is not liberty they long for but license the sturdy independence of the boer resolves itself into a determination not to have his affairs interfered with by any superior power whatsoever and not to pay taxes if he can possibly avoid it but he has also a specific cause of complaint against the english government which would alone cause him to do his utmost to get rid of it and that is its mode of dealing with natives which is radically opposite to his own this is the secret of boer patriotism to understand it it must be remembered that the englishman and the boer look at natives from a different point of view the englishman though he may not be very fond of him at any rate regards the kafir as a fellow human being with feelings like his own the average boer does not he looks upon the black creature as having been delivered into his hand by the lord for his own purposes that is to shoot and enslave he must not be blamed too harshly for this for besides being naturally of a somewhat hard disposition hatred of the native is hereditary and is partly induced by the history of many a bloody struggle also the native hates the boer fully as much as the boer hates the native though with better reason now native labour is a necessity to the boer because he will not as a rule do hard manual labour himself and there must be some one to plant and garner the crops and herd the cattle on the other hand the natives are not anxious to serve the boers which means little or no pay and plenty of thick stick and sometimes worse the result of this state of affairs is that the boer often has to rely on forced labour to a very great extent but this is a thing that an english government will not tolerate and the consequence is that under its rule he cannot get the labour that is necessary to him  then there is the tax question if he lives under the english flag the money has to be paid regularly but under his own government he pays or not as he likes it was this habit of his of refusing payment of taxes that brought the republic into difficulties in 1877 and that will ere long bring it into trouble again he cannot understand that cash is necessary to carry on a government and looks upon a tax as though it were so much money stolen from him these things are the real springs of the sturdy independence and the patriotism of the ordinary transvaal farmer doubtless there are some who are really patriotic for instance one of their leaders paul kruger but with the majority patriotism is only another word for unbounded license and forced labour  these remarks must not be taken to apply to the cape boers who are a superior class of men since they living under a settled and civilised government have been steadily improving whilst their cousins living every man for his own hand have been deteriorating the old voortrekkers the fathers and grandfathers of the transvaal boer of today were without doubt a very fine set of men and occasionally you may in the transvaal meet individuals of the same stamp whom it is a pleasure to know but these are generally men of a certain age with some experience of the world the younger men are very objectionable in their manners  the real dutch patriotic party is not to be found in the transvaal but in the cape colony their object which as affairs now are is well within the bounds of possibility is by fair means or foul to swamp the english element in south africa and to establish a great dutch republic it was this party which consists of clever and well educated men who raised the outcry against the transvaal annexation because it meant an enormous extension of english influence and who had the wit by means of their emissaries and newspapers to work upon the feeling of the ignorant transvaal farmers until they persuaded them to rebel and finally to avail themselves of the yearnings of english radicalism for the disruption of the empire and the minimisation of british authority to get the annexation cancelled all through this business the boers have more or less danced in obedience to strings pulled at cape town and it is now said that one of the chief wirepullers mr hofmeyer is to be asked to become president of the republic these men are the real patriots of south africa and very clever ones too not the transvaal boers who vapour about their blood and their country and the accursed englishman to order and are in reality influenced by very small motives such as the desire to avoid payment of taxes or to hunt away a neighbouring englishman whose civilisation and refinement are as offensive as his farm is desirable such are the dutch inhabitants of the transvaal i will now give a short sketch of their institutions as they were before the annexation and to which the community has reverted since its recision with i believe but few alterations  the form of government is republican and to all intents and purposes manhood suffrage prevails supreme power resting in the people the executive power of the state centres in a president elected by the people to hold office for a term of five years every voter having a voice in his election he is assisted in the execution of his duties by an executive council consisting of the state secretary and such other three members as are selected for that purpose by the legislative body the volksraad the state secretary holds office for four years and is elected by the volksraad the members of the executive all have seats in the volksraad but have no votes the volksraad is the legislative body of the state and consists of fortytwo members the country is divided into twelve electoral districts each of which has the right to return three members the gold fields have also the right of electing two members and the four principal towns one member each there is no power in the state competent to either prorogue or dissolve the volksraad except that body itself so that an appeal to the country on a given subject or policy is impossible without its concurrence members are elected for four years but half retire by rotation every two years the vacancies being filled by reelections members must have been voters for three years and be not less than thirty years of age must belong to a protestant church be resident in the country and owners of immovable property therein a father and son cannot sit in the same raad neither can seats be occupied by coloured persons bastards or officials  for each electoral district there is a magistrate or landdrost whose duties are similar to those of a civil commissioner these districts are again subdivided into wards presided over by field cornets who exercise judicial powers in minor matters and in times of war have considerable authority the roman dutch law is the common law of the country as it is of the colonies of the cape of good hope and natal and of the orange free state  prior to the annexation justice was administered in a very primitive fashion first there was the landdrosts court from which an appeal lay to a court consisting of the landdrost and six councillors elected by the public this was a court of first instance as well as a court of appeal then there was a supreme court consisting of three landdrosts from three different districts and a jury of twelve selected from the burghers of the state there was no appeal from this court but cases have sometimes been brought under the consideration of the volksraad as the supreme power it is easy to imagine what the administration of justice was like when the presidents of all the law courts in the country were elected by the mob not on account of their knowledge of the law but because they were popular suitors before the old transvaal courts found the law surprisingly uncertain a high court of justice was however established after the annexation and has been continued by the volksraad but an agitation is being got up against it and it will possibly be abolished in favour of the old system  in such a community as that of the transvaal boers the question of public defence was evidently of the first importance this is provided for under what is known as the commando system the president with the concurrence of the executive council has the right of declaring war and of calling up a commando in which the burghers are placed under the field cornets and commandants these last are chosen by the field cornets for each district and a commandantgeneral is chosen by the whole laager or force but the president is the commanderinchief of the army all the inhabitants of the state between sixteen and sixty with a few exceptions are liable for service young men under eighteen and men over fifty are only called out under circumstances of emergency members of the volksraad officials clergymen and schoolteachers are exempt from personal service unless martial law is proclaimed but must contribute an amount not exceeding 15 pounds towards the expense of the war all legal proceedings in civil cases are suspended against persons on commando no summonses can be made out and as soon as martial law is proclaimed no legal execution can be prosecuted the pounds are closed and transfer dues payments are suspended until after thirty days from the recall of the proclamation of martial law owners of land residing beyond the borders of the republic are also liable in addition to the ordinary war tax to place a fit and proper substitute at the disposal of the government or otherwise to pay a fine of 15 pounds the first levy of the burghers is of men from eighteen to thirtyfour years of age the second thirtyfour to fifty and the third from sixteen to eighteen and from fifty to sixty years every man is bound to provide himself with clothing a gun and ammunition and there must be enough waggons and oxen found between them to suffice for their joint use of the booty taken one quarter goes to government and the rest to the burghers the most disagreeable part of the commandeering system is however yet to come personal service is not all that the resident in the transvaal republic has to endure the right is vested in field cornets to commandeer articles as well as individuals and to call upon inhabitants to furnish requisites for the commando as may be imagined it goes very hard on these occasions with the property of any individual whom the field cornet may not happen to like  each ward is expected to turn out its contingent ready and equipped for war and this can only be done by seizing goods right and left one unfortunate will have to find a waggon another to deliver his favourite span of trek oxen another his ridinghorse or some slaughter cattle and so on even when the officer making the levy is desirous of doing his duty as fairly as he can it is obvious that very great hardships must be inflicted under such a system requisitions are made more with regard to what is wanted than with a view to an equitable distribution of demands and like the jews in the time of the crusades he who has got most must pay most or take the consequences which may be unpleasant articles which are not perishable such as waggons are supposed to be returned but if they come back at all they are generally worthless  in case of war the native tribes living within the borders of the state are also expected to furnish contingents and it is on them that most of the hard work of the campaign generally falls they are put in the front of the battle and have to do the handtohand fighting which however if of the zulu race they do not object to  the revenue of the state is so arranged that the burden of it should fall as much as possible on the trading community and as little as possible on the farmer it is chiefly derived from licenses on trades professions and callings 30s per annum quitrent on farms transfer dues and stamps auction dues court fees and contributions from such native tribes as can be made to pay them since we have given up the country the volksraad has put a very heavy tax on all imported goods hoping thereby to beguile the boers into paying taxes without knowing it and at the same time strike a blow at the trading community which is english in its proclivities the result has been to paralyse what little trade there was left in the country and to cause great dissatisfaction amongst the farmers who cannot understand why now that the english are gone they should have to pay twice as much for their sugar and coffee as they have been accustomed to do   i will conclude this chapter with a few words about the natives who swarm in and around the transvaal they can be roughly divided into two great races the amazulu and their offshoots and the macatee or basutu tribes all those of zulu blood including the swazies mapocks kafirs the matabele the knobnodes and others are very warlike in disposition and men of fine physique the basutus who must not be confounded with the cape basutus however differ from these tribes in every respect including their language which is called sisutu the only mutual feeling between the two races being their common detestation of the boers they do not love war in fact they are timid and cowardly by nature and only fight when they are obliged to unlike the zulus they are much addicted to the arts of peace show considerable capacities for civilisation and are even willing to become christians there would have been a far better field for the missionary in the transvaal than in zululand and natal indeed the most successful mission station i have seen in africa is near middelburg under the control of mr merensky in person the basutus are thin and weakly when compared to the stalwart zulu and it is their consciousness of inferiority both to the white men and their black brethren that together with their natural timidity makes them submit as easily as they do to the yoke of the boer    chapter ii

country  in or about the year 1872 the burghers of the republic elected mr burgers their president this remarkable man was a native of the cape colony and passed the first sixteen or seventeen years of his life he once informed me on a farm herding sheep he afterwards became a clergyman noted for the eloquence of his preaching but his ideas proving too broad for his congregation he resigned his cure and in an evil moment for himself took to politics  president burgers was a man of striking presence and striking talents especially as regards his oratory which was really of a very high class and would have commanded attention in our own house of commons he possessed however a mind of that peculiarly volatile order that is sometimes met with in conjunction with great talents and which seems to be entirely without ballast his intellect was of a balloonlike nature and as incapable of being steered he was always soaring in the clouds and as is natural to one in that elevated position taking a very different and more sanguine view of affairs to that which men of a more lowly and perhaps a more practical turn of mind would do  but notwithstanding his flyaway ideas president burgers was undoubtedly a true patriot labouring night and day for the welfare of the state of which he had to undertake the guidance but his patriotism was too exalted for his surroundings he wished to elevate to the rank of a nation a people who had not got the desire to be elevated with this view he contracted railway loans made wars minted gold c and then suddenly discovered that the country refused to support him in short he was made of a very different clay to that of the people he had to do with he dreamt of a great dutch republic with eight millions of inhabitants doing a vast trade with the interior through the delagoa bay railway they on the other hand cared nothing about republics or railways but fixed their affections on forced labour and getting rid of the necessity of paying taxesand so between them the republic came to grief but it must be borne in mind that president burgers was throughout actuated by good motives he did his best by a stubborn and stiffnecked people and if he failed as fail he did it was more their fault than his as regards the pension he received from the english government which has so often been brought up against him it was after all no more than his due after five years of arduous work if the republic had continued to exist it is to be presumed that they would have made some provision for their old president more especially as he seems to have exhausted his private means in paying the debts of the country whatever may be said of some of the other officials of the republic its president was i believe an honest man  in 1875 mr burgers proceeded to europe having he says in a posthumous document recently published been empowered by the volksraad to carry out my plans for the development of the country by opening up a direct communication for it free from the trammels of british ports and influence according to this document during his absence two powerful parties viz the faction of unprincipled fortunehunters rascals and runaways on the one hand and the faction of the extreme orthodox party in a certain branch of the dutch reform church on the other began to cooperate against the government of the republic and me personally      ill as i was and contrary to the advice of my medical men i proceeded to europe in the beginning of 1875 to carry out my project and no sooner was my back turned on the transvaal than the conspiring elements began to act the new coat of arms and flag adopted in the raad by an almost unanimous vote were abolished the laws for a free and secular education were tampered with and my resistance to a reckless inspection and disposal of government lands still occupied by natives was openly defied the raad filled up to a large extent with men of ill repute who under the cloak of progress and favour to the government view obtained their seats was too weak to cope with the skill of the conspirators and granted leave to the acting president to carry out measures diametrically opposed to my policy native lands were inspected and given out to a few speculators who held large numbers of claims to lands which were destined for citizens and so a war was prepared for me on my return from europe which i could not avert this extract is interesting as showing the state of feeling existing between the president and his officers previous to the outbreak of the secocoeni war it also shows how entirely he was out of sympathy with the citizens seeing that as soon as his back was turned they with mr joubert and paul kruger at their head at once undid all the little good he had done  when mr burgers got to england he found that city capitalists would have nothing whatever to say to his railway scheme in holland however he succeeded in getting 90000 pounds of the 300000 pounds he wished to borrow at a high rate of interest and by passing a bond on five hundred government farms this money was immediately invested in a railway plant which when it arrived at delagoa bay had to be mortgaged to pay the freight on it and that was the end of the delagoa bay railway scheme except that the 90000 pounds is i believe still owing to the confiding shareholders in holland  on his return to the transvaal the president was well received and for a month or so all went smoothly but the relations of the republic with the surrounding native tribes had by this time become so bad that an explosion was imminent somewhere in the year 1874 the volksraad raised the price of passes under the iniquitous pass law by which every native travelling through the territory was made to pay from 1 pound to five pounds in case of nonpayment the native was made subject to a fine of from 1 pound to 10 pounds and to a beating of from ten to twentyfive lashes he was also to go into service for three months and have a certificate thereof for which he must pay five shillings the avowed object of the law being to obtain a supply of kafir labour this was done in spite of the earnest protest of the president who gave the raad distinctly to understand that by accepting this law they would in point of fact annul treaties concluded with the chiefs on the southwestern borders it was not clear however if this amended pass law ever came into force it is to be hoped it did not for even under the old law natives were shamefully treated by the boers who would pretend that they were authorised by the government to collect the tax the result being that the unfortunate kafir was frequently obliged to pay twice over natives had such a horror of the pass laws of the country that when travelling to the diamond fields to work they would frequently go round some hundreds of miles rather than pass through the transvaal  that the volksraad should have thought it necessary to enact such a law in order that the farmers should obtain a supply of kafir labour in a territory that had nearly a million of native inhabitants who unlike the zulus are willing to work if only they meet with decent treatment is in itself an instructive commentary on the feelings existing between the boer master and kafir servant  but besides the general quarrel with the kafir race in its entirety which the boers always have on hand they had just then several individual differences in each of which there lurked the possibilities of disturbance  to begin with their relations with cetywayo were by no means amicable during mr burgers absence the boer government then under the leadership of p j joubert sent cetywayo a very stern messagea message that gives the reader the idea that mr joubert was ready to enforce it with ten thousand men after making various statements and demands with reference to the amaswazi tribe the disputed boundary line c it ends thus  although the government of the south african republic has never wished and does not now desire that serious disaffection and animosities should exist between you and them yet it is not the less of the greatest consequence and importance for you earnestly to weigh these matters and risks and to satisfy them the more so if you on your side also wish that peace and friendship shall be maintained between you and us  the secretary for native affairs for natal comments on this message in these words the tone of this message to cetywayo is not very friendly it has the look of an ultimatum and if the government of the transvaal were in circumstances different to what it is the message would suggest an intention to coerce if the demands it conveys are not at once complied with but i am inclined to the opinion that no such intention exists and that the transmission of a copy of the message to the natal government is intended as a notification that the transvaal government has proclaimed the territory hitherto in dispute between it and the zulus to be republican territory and that the republic intends to occupy it  in the territories marked out by a decision known as the keate award in which lieutenantgovernor keate of natal at the request of both parties laid down the boundary line between the boers and certain native tribes the boer government carried it with a yet higher hand insomuch as the natives of those districts being comparatively unwarlike were less likely to resist  on the 18th august 1875 acting president joubert issued a proclamation by which a line was laid down far to the southward of that marked out by mr keate and consequently included more territory within the elastic boundaries of the republic a government notice of the same date invites all claiming lands now declared to belong to the republic to send in their claims to be settled by a land commission  on the 6th march 1876 another chief in the same neighbourhood montsoia writes to the lieutenantgovernor of griqualand west in these terms  my friendi wish to acquaint you with the doings of some people connected with the boers a manservant of mine has been severely injured in the head by one of the boers servants which has proved fatal another of my people has been cruelly treated by a boer tying a rein about his neck and then mounting his horse and dragging him about the place my brother molema who is the bearer of this will give you full particulars  molema explains the assaults thus the assaulted man is not dead his skull was fractured the assault was committed by a boer named wessels badenhorst who shamefully illtreated the man beat him till he fainted and on his revival fastened a rim around his neck and made him run to the homestead by the side of his badenhorsts horse cantering at the homestead he tied him to the waggonwheel and flogged him again till mrs badenhorst stopped her husband  though it will be seen that the boers were on good terms neither with the zulus nor the keate award natives they still had one kafir ally namely umbandeni the amaswazi king this alliance was concluded under circumstances so peculiar that they are worthy of a brief recapitulation it appears that in the winter of the year 1875 mr rudolph the landdrost of utrecht went to swazieland and imitating the example of the natal government with cetywayo crowned umbandeni king on behalf of the boer government he further made a treaty of alliance with him and promised him a commando to help him in case of his being attacked by the zulus now comes the curious part of the story on the 18th may 1876 a message came from this same umbandeni to sir h bulwer of which the following is an extractwe are sent by our king to thank the government of natal for the information sent to him last winter by that government and conveyed by mr rudolph of the intended attack on his people by the zulus we are further instructed by the king to thank the natal government for the influence it used to stop the intended raid and for instructing a boer commando to go to his country to render him assistance in case of need and further for appointing mr randolph at the head of the commando to place him umbandeni as king over the amaswazi and to make a treaty with him and his people on behalf of the natal government      the transvaal government has asked umbandeni to acknowledge himself a subject of the republic but he has distinctly refused to do so in a minute written on this subject the secretary for native affairs for natal says no explanation or assurance was sufficient to convince them umbandenis messengers that they had on that occasion made themselves subjects of the south african republic they declared it was not their wish or intention to do so and that they would refuse to acknowledge a position into which they had been unwittingly betrayed i must conclude this episode by quoting the last paragraph of sir h bulwers covering despatch because it concerns larger issues than the supposed treaty it will not be necessary that i should at present add any remarks to those contained in the minute for the secretary for native affairs but i would observe that the situation arising out of the relations of the government of the south african republic with the neighbouring states is so complicated and presents so many elements of confusion and of danger to the peace of this portion of south africa that i trust some way may be found to an early settlement of questions that ought not in my opinion to be left alone as so many have been left to take the chance of the future  and now i come to the last and most imminent native difficulty that at the time faced the republic on the borders of lydenburg district there lived a powerful chief named secocoeni between this chief and the transvaal government difficulties arose in the beginning of 1876 on the usual subjectland the boers declared that they had bought the land from the swazies who had conquered portions of the country and that the swazies offered to make it clean from brambles ie kill everybody living on it but that they the boers said that they were to let them be that they might be their servants the basutus on the other hand said that no such sale ever took place and even if it did take place it was invalid because the swazies were not in occupation of the land and therefore could not sell it it was a christian kafir called johannes a brother of secocoeni who was the immediate cause of the war this johannes used to live at a place called botsobelo the missionstation of mr merensky but moved to a stronghold on the spekboom river in the disputed territory the boers sent to him to come back but he refused and warned the boers off his land secocoeni was then appealed to but declared that the land belonged to his tribe and would be occupied by johannes he also told the boers that he did not wish to fight but that he was quite ready to do so if they preferred it thereupon the transvaal government declared war although it does not appear that the natives committed any outrage or acts of hostility before the declaration as regards the boers right to secocoenis country sir h barkly sums up the question thus in a despatch addressed to president burgers dated 28th nov 1876on the whole it seems perfectly clear and i feel bound to repeat it that sikukuni was neither de jure or de facto a subject of the republic when your honour declared war against him in june last as soon as war had been declared the clumsy commando system was set working and about 2500 white men collected the swazies also were applied to to send a contingent which they did being only too glad of the opportunity of slaughter  at first all went well and the president who accompanied the commando in person succeeded in reducing a mountain stronghold which in his highflown way he called a glorious victory over a kafir gibraltar  on the 14th july another engagement took place when the boers and swazies attacked johannes stronghold the place was taken with circumstances of great barbarity by the swazies for when the signal was given to advance the boers did not move nearly all the women were killed and the brains of the children were dashed out against the stones in one instance before the captive mothers face johannes was badly wounded and died two days afterwards when he was dying he said to his brother i am going to die i am thankful i do not die by the hands of these cowardly boers but by the hand of a black and courageous nation like myself    he then took leave of his people told his brother to read the bible and expired the swazies were so infuriated at the cowardice displayed by the boers on this occasion that they returned home in great dudgeon  on the 2nd of august secocoenis mountain which is a very strong fortification was attacked in two columns or rather an attempt was made to attack it for when it came to the pinch only about forty men mostly english and germans would advance thereupon the whole commando retreated with great haste the greater part of it going straight home in vain the president entreated them to shoot him rather than desert him they had had enough of secocoeni and his stronghold and home they went the president then retreated with what few men he had left to steelport where he built a fort and from thence returned to pretoria the news of the collapse of the commando was received throughout the transvaal and indeed the whole of south africa with the greatest dismay for the first time in the history of that country the white man had been completely worsted by a native tribe and that tribe wretched basutus people whom the zulus call their dogs it was glad tidings to every native from the zambesi to the cape who learnt thereby that the white man was not so invincible as he used to be meanwhile the inhabitants of lydenburg were filled with alarm and again and again petitioned the governors of the cape and natal for assistance their fears were however to a great extent groundless for with the exception of occasional cattlelifting secocoeni did not follow up his victory  on the 4th september the president opened the special sitting of the volksraad and presented to that body a scheme for the establishment of a border force to take the place of the commando system announcing that he had appointed a certain captain von schlickmann to command it he also requested the raad to make some provision for the expenses of the expedition which they had omitted to do in their former sitting  captain von schlickmann determined to carry on the war upon a different system he got together a band of very rough characters on the diamond fields and occupied the fort built by the president from whence he would sally out from time to time and destroy kraals he seems if we may believe the reports in the blue books and the stories of eyewitnesses to have carried on his proceedings in a somewhat savage way the following is an extract from a private letter written by one of his volunteers  about daylight we came across four kafirs saw them first and charged in front of them to cut off their retreat saw they were women and called out not to fire in spite of that one of the poor things got her head blown off a dd shame    afterwards two women and a baby were brought to the camp prisoners the same night they were taken out by our kafirs and murdered in cold blood by the order of  mr  and myself strongly protested against it but without avail i never heard such a cowardly piece of business in my life no good will come of it you may depend     says he would cut all the women and childrens throats he catches told him distinctly he was a dd coward  schlickmann was however a mildmannered man when compared to a certain abel erasmus afterwards denounced at a public dinner by sir garnet wolseley as a fiend in human form this gentleman in the month of october attacked a friendly kraal of kafirs the incident is described thus in a correspondents letter  the people of the kraals taken quite by surprise fled when they saw their foes and most of them took shelter in the neighbouring bush two or three men were distinctly seen in their flight from the kraal and one of them is known to have been wounded according to my informant the remainder were women and children who were pursued into the bush and there all shivering and shrieking were put to death by the boers kafirs some being shot but the majority stabbed with assegais after the massacre he counted thirteen women and three children but he says he did not see the body of a single man another kafir said pointing to a place in the road where the stones were thickly strewn the bodies of the women and children lay like these stones the boer before mentioned who has been stationed outside has told one of his own friends whom he thought would not mention it that the shrieks were fearful to hear  several accounts of or allusion to this atrocity can be found in the blue books and i may add that it in common with others of the same stamp was the talk of the country at the time  i do not relate these horrors out of any wish to rake up old stories to the prejudice of the boers but because i am describing the state of the country before the annexation in which they form an interesting and important item also it is as well that people in england should know into what hands they have delivered over the native tribes who trusted in their protection what happened in 1876 is probably happening again now and will certainly happen again and again the character of the transvaal boer and his sentiments towards the native races have not modified during the last five years but on the contrary a large amount of energy which has been accumulating during the period of british protection will now be expended on their devoted heads  as regards the truth of these atrocities the majority of them are beyond the possibility of doubt indeed to the best of my knowledge no serious attempt has ever been made to refute such of them as have come into public notice except in a general way for party purposes as however they may be doubted i will quote the following extract from a despatch written by sir h barkly to lord carnarvon dated 18th december 1876  as von schlickmann has since fallen fighting bravely it is not without reluctance that i join in affixing this dark stain on his memory but truth compels me to add the following extract from a letter which i have since received from one whose name which i communicate to your lordship privately forbids disbelief there is no longer the slightest doubt as to the murder of the two women and the child at steelport by the direct order of schlickmann and in the attack on the kraal near which these women were captured or some attack about that period he ordered his men to cut the throats of all the wounded this is no mere report it is positively true he concludes by expressing a hope that the course of events will enable her majestys government to take such steps as will terminate this wanton and useless bloodshed and prevent the recurrence of the scenes of injustice cruelty and rapine which abundant evidence is every day forthcoming to prove have rarely ceased to disgrace the republics beyond the vaal ever since they first sprang into existence        the italics are my ownauthor  these are strong words but none too strong for the facts of the case injustice cruelty and rapine have always been the watchwords of the transvaal boers the stories of wholesale slaughter in the earlier days of the republic are very numerous one of the best known of those shocking occurrences took place in the zoutpansberg war in 1865 on this occasion a large number of kafirs took refuge in caves where the boers smoked them to death some years afterwards dr wangeman whose account is i believe thoroughly reliable describes the scene of their operations in these words  the roof of the first cave was black with smoke the remains of the logs which were burnt lay at the entrance the floor was strewn with hundreds of skulls and skeletons in confused heaps lay karosses kerries assegais pots spoons snuffboxes and the bones of men giving one the impression that this was the grave of a whole people some estimate the number of those who perished here from twenty to thirty thousand this is i believe too high in the one chamber there were from two hundred to three hundred skeletons the other chambers i did not visit  in 1868 a public meeting was held at potchefstroom to consider the war then going on with the zoutpansberg natives according to the report of the proceedings the rev mr ludorf said that on a particular occasion a number of native children who were too young to be removed had been collected in a heap covered with long grass and burned alive other atrocities had also been committed but these were too horrible to relate when called upon to produce his authority for this statement mr ludorf named his authority in a solemn declaration to the state attorney at this same meeting mr j g steyn who had been landdrost of potchefstroom said there now was innocent blood on our hands which had not yet been avenged and the curse of god rested on the land in consequence mr rosalt remarked that it was a singular circumstance that in the different colonial kafir wars as also in the basutu wars one did not hear of destitute children being found by the commandoes and asked how it was that every petty commando that took the field in this republic invariably found numbers of destitute children he gave it as his opinion that the present system of apprenticeship was an essential cause of our frequent hostilities with the natives mr jan talyard said children were forcibly taken from their parents and were then called destitute and apprenticed mr daniel van nooren was heard to say if they had to clear the country and could not have the children they found he would shoot them mr fieldcornet furstenburg stated that when he was at zoutpansberg with his burghers the chief katsekats was told to come down from the mountains that he sent one of his subordinates as a proof of amity that whilst a delay of five days was guaranteed by commandant paul kruger who was then in command orders were given at the same time to attack the natives at break of day which was accordingly done but which resulted in total failure truly this must have been an interesting meeting  before leaving these unsavoury subjects i must touch on the question of slavery it has been again and again denied on behalf of the transvaal boers that slavery existed in the republic now this is strictly speaking true slavery did not exist but apprenticeship didthe rose was called by another name that is all the poor destitute children who were picked up by kindhearted boers after the extermination of their parents were apprenticed to farmers till they came of age it is a remarkable fact that these children never attained their majority you might meet oldish men in the transvaal who were not according to their masters reckoning twentyone years of age the assertion that slavery did not exist in the transvaal is only made to hoodwink the english public i have known men who have owned slaves and who have seen whole waggonloads of black ivory as they were called sold for about 15 pounds apiece i have at this moment a tenant carolus by name on some land i own in natal now a welltodo man who was for many yearsabout twenty if i remember righta boer slave during those years he told me he worked from morning till night and the only reward he received was two calves he finally escaped into natal  if other evidence is needed it is not difficult to find so i will quote a little on the 22d august 1876 we find khama king of the bamangwato one of the most worthy chiefs in south africa sending a message to victoria the great queen of the english people in these words  i write to you sir henry in order that your queen may preserve for me my country it being in her hands the boers are coming into it and i do not like them their actions are cruel among us black people we are like money they sell us and our children i ask her majesty to pity me and to hear that which i write quickly i wish to hear upon what conditions her majesty will receive me and my country and my people under her protection i am weary with fighting i do not like war and i ask her majesty to give me peace i am very much distressed that my people are being destroyed by war and i wish them to obtain peace i ask her majesty to defend me as she defends all her people there are three things which distress me very muchwar selling people and drink all these things i shall find in the boers and it is these things which destroy people to make an end of them in the country the custom of the boers has always been to cause people to be sold and today they are still selling people last year i saw them pass with two waggons full of people whom they had bought at the river at tanane lake ngate  the special correspondence of the cape argus a highly respectable journal writes thus on the 28th november 1876the boer from whom this information was gleaned has furnished besides some facts which may not be uninteresting as a commentary on the repeated denials by mr burgers of the existence of slavery during the last week slaves have been offered for sale on his farm the captives have been taken from secocoenis country by mapochs people and are being exchanged at the rate of a child for a heifer he also assures us that the whole of the highveld is bring replenished with kafir children whom the boers have been lately purchasing from the swazies at the rate of a horse for a child i should like to see this man and his father as witnesses before an imperial commission he let fall one or two incidents of the past which were brought to mind by the occurrences of the present in 1864 he says the swazies accompanied the boers against males the boers did nothing but stand by and witness the fearful massacre the men and women were also murdered one poor woman sat clutching her baby of eight days old the swazies stabbed her through the body and when she found that she could not live she wrung the babys neck with her own hands to save it from future misery on the return of that commando the children who became too weary to continue the journey were killed on the road the survivors were sold as slaves to the farmers  the same gentleman writes in the issue of the 12th december as followsthe whole world may know it for it is true and investigation will only bring out the horrible details that through the whole course of this republics existence it has acted in contravention of the sand river treaty and slavery has occurred not only here and there in isolated cases but as an unbroken practice and has been one of the peculiar institutions of the country mixed up with all its social and political life it has been at the root of most of its wars it has been carried on regularly even in times of peace it has been characterised by all those circumstances which have so often roused the british nation to an indignant protest and to repeated efforts to banish the slave trade from the world the boers have not only fallen on unsuspecting kraals simply for the purpose of obtaining the women and children and cattle but they have carried on a traffic through natives who have kidnapped the children of their weaker neighbours and sold them to the white man again the boers have sold and exchanged their victims among themselves waggonloads of slaves have been conveyed from one end of the country to the other for sale and that with the cognisance of and for the direct advantage of the highest officials of the land the writer has himself seen in a town situated in the south of the republic the children who had been brought down from a remote northern district one fine morning in walking through the streets he was struck with the number of little black strangers standing about certain houses and wondered where they could have come from he learnt a few hours later that they were part of loads which were disposed of on the outskirts of the town the day before the circumstances connected with some of these kidnapping excursions are appalling and the barbarities practised by cruel masters upon some of these defenceless creatures during the course of their servitude are scarcely less horrible than those reported from turkey it is no disgrace in this country for an official to ride a fine horse which was got for two kafir children to procure whom the father and mother were shot no reproach is inherited by the mistress who day after day tied up her female servant in an agonising posture and had her beaten until there was no sound part in her body securing her in the stocks during the intervals of torture that man did not lose caste who tied up another woman and had her thrashed until she brought forth at the whippingpost these are merely examples of thousands of cases which could be proved were an imperial commission to sit and could the wretched victims of a prolonged oppression recover sufficiently from the dread of their old tyrants to give a truthful report  to come to some evidence more recently adduced on the 9th may 1881 an affidavit was sworn to by the rev john thorne curate of st john the evangelist lydenburg transvaal and presented to the royal commission appointed to settle transvaal affairs in which he statesthat i was appointed to the charge of a congregation in potchefstroom about thirteen years ago when the republic was under the presidency of mr pretorius i remember noticing one morning as i walked through the streets a number of young natives whom i knew to be strangers i inquired where they came from i was told that they had just been brought from zoutpansberg this was the locality from which slaves were chiefly brought at that time and were traded for under the name of black ivory one of these natives belonged to mr munich the state attorney it was a matter of common remark at that time that the president of the republic was himself one of the greatest dealers in slaves in the fourth paragraph of the same affidavit mr thorne says that the rev doctor nachtigal of the berlin missionary society was the interpreter for shatanes people in the private office of mr roth and at the close of the interview told me what had occurred on my expressing surprise he went on to relate that he had information on native matters which would surprise me more he then produced the copy of a register kept in the landdrosts office of men women and children to the number of four hundred and eighty 480 who had been disposed of by one boer to another for a consideration in one case an ox was given in exchange in another goats in a third a blanket and so forth many of these natives he mr nachtigal knew personally the copy was certified as true and correct by an official of the republic and i would mention his name now only that i am persuaded that it would cost the man his life if his act became known to the boers        one of the famous triumvirate  on the 16th may 1881 a native named frederick molepo was examined by the royal commission the following are extracts from his examination  sir e wood are you a christianyes  sir h de villiers how long were you a slavehalf a year  how do you know that you were a slave might you not have been an apprenticeno i was not apprenticed  how do you knowthey got me from my parents and illtreated me  sir e wood how many times did you get the stickevery day  sir h de villiers what did the boers do with you when they caught youthey sold me  how much did they sell you forone cow and a big pot  on the 28th may 1881 amongst the other documents handed in for the consideration of the royal commission is the statement of a headman whose name it has been considered advisable to omit in the blue book for fear the boers should take vengeance on him he says i say that if the english government dies i shall die too i would rather die than be under the boer government i am the man who helped to make bricks for the church you see now standing in the square here pretoria as a slave without payment as a representative of my people i am still obedient to the english government and willing to obey all commands from them even to die for their cause in this country rather than submit to the boers  i was under shambok my chief who fought the boers formerly but he left us and we were put up to auction and sold among the boers i want to state this myself to the royal commission in newcastle i was bought by fritz botha and sold by frederick botha who was then veld cornet justice of the peace of the boers        i have taken the liberty to quote all these extracts      exactly as they stand in the original instead of weaving      their substance into my narrative in order that i may not      be accused as so often happens to authors who write upon      this subject of having presented a garbled version of the      truth the original of every extract is to be found in blue      books presented to parliament i have thought it best to      confine myself to these and avoid repeating stories of      cruelties and slavery however well authenticated that have      come to my knowledge privately such stories being always      more or less open to suspicion  it would be easy to find more reports of the slavetrading practices of the boers but as the above are fair samples it will not be necessary to do so my readers will be able from them to form some opinion as to whether or not slavery or apprenticeship existed in the transvaal if they come to the conclusion that it did it must be borne in mind that what existed in the past will certainly exist again in the future natives are not now any fonder of working for boers than they were a few years back and boers must get labour somehow if on the other hand it did not exist then the boers are a grossly slandered people and all writers on the subject from livingstone down have combined to take away their character  leaving native questions for the present we must now return to the general affairs of the country when president burgers opened the special sitting of the volksraad on the 4th september he appealed it will be remembered to that body for pecuniary aid to liquidate the expenses of the war this appeal was responded to by the passing of a war tax under which every owner of a farm was to pay 10 pounds the owner of half a farm 5 pounds and so on the tax was not a very just one since it fell with equal weight on the rich man who held twenty farms and the poor man who held but one its justice or injustice was however to a great extent immaterial since the free and independent burghers including some of the members of the volksraad who had imposed it promptly refused to pay it or indeed whilst they were about it any other tax as the treasury was already empty and creditors were pressing this refusal was most illtimed and things began to look very black indeed meanwhile in addition to the ordinary expenditure and the interest payable on debts money had to be found to pay von schlickmanns volunteers as there was no cash in the country this was done by issuing government promissory notes known as goodfors or vulgarly as good for nothings and by promising them all booty and to each man a farm of two thousand acres lying east and northeast of the loolu mountains in other words in secocoenis territory which did not belong to the government to give away the officials were the next to suffer and for six months before the annexation these unfortunate individuals lived as best they could for they certainly got no salary except in the case of a postmaster who was told to help himself to his pay in stamps the government issued large numbers of bills but the banks refused to discount them and in some cases the neighbouring colonies had to advance money to the transvaal postcart contractors who were carrying the mails as a matter of charity the government even mortgaged the great saltpan near pretoria for the paltry sum of 400 pounds whilst the leading officials of the government were driven to pledging their own private credit in order to obtain the smallest article necessary to its continuance in fact to such a pass did things come that when the country was annexed a single threepenny bit which had doubtless been overlooked was found in the treasury chest together with acknowledgments of debts to the extent of nearly 300000 pounds  nor was the refusal to pay taxes which they were powerless to enforce the only difficulty with which the government had to contend want of money is as bad and painful a thing to a state as to an individual but there are perhaps worse things than want of money one of which is to be deserted by your own friends and household this was the position of the government of the republic no sooner was it involved in overwhelming difficulties than its own subjects commenced to bait it more especially the english portion of its subjects they complained to the english authorities about the commandeering of members of their family or goods they petitioned the british government to interfere and generally made themselves as unpleasant as possible to the local authorities such a course of action was perhaps natural but it can hardly be said to be either quite logical or just the transvaal government had never asked them to come and live in the country and if they did so it must be remembered that many of the agitators had accumulated property to leave which would mean ruin and they saw that unless something was done its value would be destroyed  under the pressure of all these troubles the boers themselves split up into factions as they are always ready to do the dopper party declared that they had had enough progress and proposed the extremely conservative paul kruger as president burgers time having nearly expired paul kruger accepted the candidature although he had previously promised his support to burgers and distrust of each other was added to the other difficulties of the executive the transvaal becoming a house very much divided against itself natives doppers progressionists officials english were all pulling different ways and each striving for his own advantage anything more hopeless than the position of the country on the 1st january 1877 it is impossible to conceive enemies surrounded it on every border there was the prospect of a serious war in the exchequer there was nothing but piles of overdue bills the president was helpless and mistrustful of his officers and the officers were caballing against the president all the ordinary functions of government had ceased and trade was paralysed now and then wild proposals were made to relieve the state of its burdens some of which partook of the nature of repudiation but these were the exception the majority of the inhabitants who would neither fight nor pay taxes sat still and awaited the catastrophe utterly careless of all consequences    chapter iii  the annexation  anxiety

carnarvon evidently had the permanent welfare of south africa much at heart and he saw with apprehension that the troubles that were brewing in the transvaal were of a nature likely to involve the cape and natal in a native war though there is a broad line of demarcation between dutch and english it is not so broad but that a victorious nation like the zulus might cross it and beginning by fighting the boer might end by fighting the white man irrespective of race when the reader reflects how terrible would be the consequences of a combination of native tribes against the whites and how easily such a combination might at that time have been brought about in the first flush of native successes he will understand the anxiety with which all thinking men watched the course of events in the transvaal in 1876  at last they took such a serious turn that the home government saw that some action must be taken if the catastrophe was to be averted and determined to despatch sir theophilus shepstone as special commissioner to the transvaal with powers should it be necessary to annex the country to her majestys dominions in order to secure the peace and safety of our said colonies and of our subjects elsewhere  the terms of his commission were unusually large leaving a great deal to his discretionary power in choosing that officer for the execution of a most difficult and delicate mission the government doubtless made a very wise selection sir theophilus shepstone is a man of remarkable tact and ability combined with great openness and simplicity of mind and one whose name will always have a leading place in south african history during a long official lifetime he has had to do with most of the native races in south africa and certainly knows them and their ways better than any living man whilst he is by them all regarded with a peculiar and affectionate reverence he is par excellence their great white chief and father and a word from him even now that he has retired from active life still carries more weight than the formal remonstrances of any governor in south africa  with the boers he is almost equally well acquainted having known many of them personally for years he possesses moreover the rare power of winning the regard and affection as well as the respect of those about him in such a marked degree that those who have served him once would go far to serve him again sir t shepstone however has enemies like other people and is commonly reported among them to be a disciple of machiavelli and to have his mind steeped in all the darker wiles of kafir policy the annexation of the transvaal is by them attributed to a successful and vigorous use of those arts that distinguished the diplomacy of two centuries ago falsehood and bribery are supposed to have been the great levers used to effect the change together with threats of extinction at the hands of a savage and unfriendly nation  that the annexation was a triumph of mind over matter is quite true but whether or not that triumph was unworthily obtained i will leave those who read this short chronicle of the events connected with it to judge i saw it somewhat darkly remarked in a newspaper the other day that the history of the annexation had evidently yet to be written and i fear that the remark represents the feeling of most people about the event implying as it did that it was carried out by means certainly mysterious and presumably doubtful i am afraid that those who think thus will be disappointed in what i have to say about the matter since i know that the means employed to bring the boers  fracti bello fatisque repulsi  under her majestys authority were throughout as fair and honest as the annexation itself was in my opinion right and necessary  to return to sir t shepstone he undoubtedly had faults as a ruler one of the most prominent of which was that his natural mildness of character would never allow him to act with severity even when severity was necessary the very criminals condemned to death ran a good chance of reprieve when he had to sign their deathwarrants he had also that worst of faults so called in one fitted by nature to become greatwant of ambition a failing that in such a man marks him the possessor of an even and a philosophic mind it was no seeking of his own that raised him out of obscurity and when his work was done to comparative obscurity he elected to return though whether a man of his ability and experience in south african affairs should at the present crisis be allowed to remain there is another question  on the 20th december 1876 sir t shepstone wrote to president burgers informing him of his approaching visit to the transvaal to secure if possible the adjustment of the existing troubles and the adoption of such measures as might be best calculated to prevent their recurrence in the future  on his road to pretoria sir theophilus received a hearty welcome from the boer as well as the english inhabitants of the country one of these addresses to him says be assured high honourable sir that we burghers now assembled together entertain the most friendly feeling towards your government and that we shall agree with anything you may do in conjunction with our government for the progress of our state the strengthening against our native enemies and for the general welfare of all the inhabitants of the whole of south africa welcome in heidelberg and welcome in the transvaal  at pretoria the reception of the special commissioner was positively enthusiastic the whole town came out to meet him and the horses having been taken out of the carriage he was dragged in triumph through the streets in his reply to the address presented to him sir theophilus shadowed forth the objects of his mission in these words recent events in this country have shown to all thinking men the absolute necessity for closer union and more oneness of purpose among the christian governments of the southern portion of this continent the best interests of the native races no less than the peace and prosperity of the white imperatively demand it and i rely upon you and upon your government to cooperate with me in endeavouring to achieve the great and glorious end of inscribing on a general south african banner the appropriate mottoeendragt maakt magt unity makes strength  a few days after his arrival a commission was appointed consisting of messrs henderson and osborn on behalf of the special commissioner and messrs kruger and jorissen on behalf of the transvaal government to discuss the state of the country this commission came to nothing and was on both sides nothing more than a bit of byplay  the arrival of the mission was necessarily regarded with mixed feelings by the inhabitants of the transvaal by one party it was eagerly greeted viz the english section of the population who devoutly hoped that it had come to annex the country with the exception of the hollander element the officials also were glad of its arrival and secretly hoped that the country would be taken over when there would be more chance of their getting their arrear pay the better educated boers also were for the most part satisfied that there was no hope for the country unless england helped it in some way though they did not like having to accept the help but the more bigoted and narrowminded among them were undoubtedly opposed to english interference and under their leader paul kruger who was at the time running for the presidents chair did their best to be rid of it they found ready allies in the hollander clientele with which mr burgers had surrounded himself headed by the famous dr jorissen who was like most of the rulers of this singular state an exclergyman but now an attorneygeneral not learned in the law these men were for the most part entirely unfit for the positions they held and feared that in the event of the country changing hands they might be ejected from them and also they did all englishmen the favour to regard them with that particularly virulent and general hatred which is a part of the secret creed of many foreigners more especially of such as are under our protection as may easily be imagined what between all these different parties and the presence of the special commissioner there were certainly plenty of intrigues going on in pretoria during the first few months of 1877 and the political excitement was very great nobody knew how far sir t shepstone was prepared to go and everybody was afraid of putting out his hand further than he could pull it back and trying to make himself comfortable on two stools at once members of the volksraad and other prominent individuals in the country who had during the day been denouncing the commissioner in no measured terms and even proposing that he and his staff should be shot as a warning to the english government might be seen arriving at his house under cover of the shades of evening to have a little talk with him and express the earnest hope that it was his intention to annex the country as soon as possible it is necessary to assist at a peaceable annexation to learn the depth of meanness human nature is capable of  in pretoria at any rate the ladies were of great service to the cause of the mission since they were nearly all in favour of a change of government and that being the case they naturally soon brought their husbands brothers and lovers to look at things from the same point of view it was a wise man who said that in any matter where it is necessary to obtain the goodwill of a population you should win over the women that done you need not trouble yourself about the men  though the country was thus overflowing with political intrigues nothing of the kind went on in the commissioners camp it was not he who made the plots to catch the transvaalers on the contrary they made the plots to catch him for several months all that he did was to sit still and let the rival passions work their way fighting what the zulus afterwards called the fight of sit down when anybody came to see him he was very glad to meet them pointed out the desperate condition of the country and asked them if they could suggest a remedy and that was about all he did do beyond informing himself very carefully as to all that was going on in the country and the movements of the natives within and outside its borders there was no money spent on bribery as has been stated though it is impossible to imagine a state of affairs in which it would have been more easy to bribe or in which it could have been done with greater effect unless indeed the promise that some pension should be paid to president burgers can be called a bribe which it was certainly never intended to be but simply a guarantee that after having spent all his private means on behalf of the state he should not be left destitute the statement that the annexation was effected under a threat that if the government did not give its consent sir t shepstone would let loose the zulus on the country is also a wicked and malicious invention but with this i shall deal more at length further on  it must not however be understood that the annexation was a foregone conclusion or that sir t shepstone came up to the transvaal with the fixed intention of annexing the country without reference to its position merely with a view of extending british influence or as has been absurdly stated in order to benefit natal he had no fixed purpose whether it were necessary or no of exercising the full powers given to him by his commission on the contrary he was all along most anxious to find some internal resources within the state by means of which annexation could be averted and of this fact his various letters and despatches give full proof thus in his letter to president burgers of the 9th april 1877 in which he announces his intention of annexing the country he says i have more than once assured your honour that if i could think of any plan by which the independence of the state could be maintained by its own internal resources i would most certainly not conceal that plan from you it is also incidentally remarkably confirmed by a passage in mr burgers posthumous defence in which he says hence i met shepstone alone in my house and opened up the subject of his mission with a candour that astonished me he avowed that his purpose was to annex the country as he had sufficient grounds for it unless i could so alter as to satisfy his government my plan of a new constitution modelled after that of america of a standing police force of two hundred mounted men was then proposed he promised to give me time to call the volksraad together and to abandon his design if the volksraad would adopt these measures and the country be willing to submit to them and to carry them out further on he says in justice to shepstone i must say that i would not consider an officer of my government to have acted faithfully if he had not done what shepstone did  it has also been frequently alleged in england and always seems to be taken as the groundwork of argument in the matter of the annexation that the special commissioner represented that the majority of the inhabitants wished for the annexation and that it was sanctioned on that ground this statement shows the great ignorance that exists in this country of south african affairs an ignorance which in this case has been carefully fostered by mr gladstones government for party purposes they having found it necessary to assume in order to make their position in the matter tenable that sir t shepstone and other officials had been guilty of misrepresentation unfortunately the government and its supporters have been more intent upon making out their case than upon ascertaining the truth of their statements if they had taken the trouble to refer to sir t shepstones despatches they would have found that the ground on which the transvaal was annexed was not because the majority of the inhabitants wished for it but because the state was drifting into anarchy was bankrupt and was about to be destroyed by native tribes they would further have found that sir t shepstone never represented that the majority of the boers were in favour of annexation what he did say was that most thinking men in the country saw no other way out of the difficulty but what proportion of the boers can be called thinking men he also said in the fifteenth paragraph of his despatch to lord carnarvon of 6th march 1877 that petitions signed by 2500 people representing every class of the community out of a total adult population of 8000 had been presented to the government of the republic setting forth its difficulties and dangers and praying it to treat with me for their amelioration or removal he also stated and with perfect truth that many more would have signed had it not been for the terrorism that was exercised and that all the towns and villages in the country desired the change which was a patent fact  this is the foundation on which the charge of misrepresentation is builta charge which has been manipulated so skilfully and with such a charming disregard for the truth that the british public has been duped into believing it when it is examined into it vanishes into thin air  but a darker charge has been brought against the special commissionera charge affecting his honour as a gentleman and his character as a christian and strange to say has gained a considerable credence especially amongst a certain party in england i allude to the statement that he called up the zulu army with the intention of sweeping the transvaal if the annexation was objected to i may state from my own personal knowledge that the report is a complete falsehood and that no such threat was ever made either by sir t shepstone or by anybody connected with him and i will briefly prove what i say  when the mission first arrived at pretoria a message came from cetywayo to the effect that he had heard that the boers had fired at sompseu sir t shepstone and announcing his intention of attacking the transvaal if his father was touched about the middle of march alarming rumours began to spread as to the intended action of cetywayo with reference to the transvaal but as sir t shepstone did not think that the king would be likely to make any hostile movement whilst he was in the country he took no steps in the matter neither did the transvaal government ask his advice and assistance indeed a remarkable trait in the boers is their supreme selfconceit which makes them believe that they are capable of subduing all the natives in africa and of thrashing the whole british army if necessary unfortunately the recent course of events has tended to confirm them in their opinion as regards their white enemies to return towards the second week in april or the week before the proclamation of annexation was issued things began to look very serious indeed rumours that could hardly be discredited reached the special commissioner that the whole of the zulu army was collected in a chain of impis or battalions with the intention of bursting into the transvaal and sweeping the country knowing how terrible would be the catastrophe if this were to happen sir t shepstone was much alarmed about the matter and at a meeting with the executive council of the transvaal government he pointed out to them the great danger in which the country was placed this was done in the presence of several officers of his staff and it was on this friendly exposition of the state of affairs that the charge that he had threatened the country with invasion by the zulus was based on the 11th of april or the day before the annexation a message was despatched to cetywayo telling him of the reports that had reached pretoria and stating that if they were true he must forthwith give up all such intentions as the transvaal would at once be placed under the sovereignty of her majesty and that if he had assembled any armies for purposes of aggression they must be disbanded at once sir t shepstones message reached zululand not a day too soon had the annexation of the transvaal been delayed by a few weeks evenand this is a point which i earnestly beg englishmen to remember in connection with that actcetywayos armies would have entered the transvaal carrying death before them and leaving a wilderness behind them  cetywayos answer to the special commissioners message will sufficiently show to use sir theophilus own words in his despatch on the subject the pinnacle of peril which the republic and south africa generally had reached at the moment when the annexation took place he says i thank my father sompseu sir t shepstone for his message i am glad that he has sent it because the dutch have tired me out and i intended to fight them once and once only and to drive them over the vaal kabana name of messenger you see my impis armies are gathered it was to fight the dutch i called them together now i will send them back to their homes is it well that two men amadodaamabili should be made iziula fools in the reign of my father umpanda the boers were constantly moving their boundary further into my country since his death the same thing has been done i had therefore determined to end it once for all the message then goes on to other matters and ends with a request to be allowed to fight the amaswazi because they fight together and kill one another this says cetywayo naively is wrong and i want to chastise them for it  this quotation will suffice to convince all reasonable men putting aside all other matters from what imminent danger the transvaal was delivered by the muchabused annexation  some months after that event however it occurred to the ingenious mind of some malicious individual in natal that properly used much political capital might be made out of this zulu incident and the story that cetywayos army had been called up by sir theophilus himself to overawe and if necessary subdue the transvaal was accordingly invented and industriously circulated although sir t shepstone at once caused it to be authoritatively contradicted such an astonishing slander naturally took firm root and on the 12th april 1879 we have mr m w pretorius one of the boer leaders publicly stating at a meeting of the farmers that previous to the annexation sir t shepstone had threatened the transvaal with an attack from the zulus as an argument for advancing the annexation under such an imputation the government could no longer keep silence and accordingly sir owen lanyon who was then administrator of the transvaal caused the matter to be officially investigated with these results which are summed up by him in a letter to mr pretorius dated 1st may 1879  1 the records of the republican executive council contained no allusion to any such statement  2 two members of that council filed statements in which they unreservedly denied that sir t shepstone used the words or threats imputed to him  3 two officers of sir t shepstones staff who were always present with him at interviews with the executive council filed statements to the same effect  i have no doubt adds sir owen lanyon that the report has been originated and circulated by some evildisposed persons  in addition to this evidence we have a letter written to the colonial office by sir t shepstone dated london august 12 1879 in which he points out that mr pretorius was not even present at any of the interviews with the executive council on which occasion he accuses him of having made use of the threats he further shows that the use of such a threat on his part would have been the depth of folly and knowingly to court the instant and ignominious failure of my mission because the boers were so persuaded of their own prowess that they could not be convinced that they stood in any danger from native sources and also because such play with such keenedged tools as the excited passions of savages are and especially such savages as i knew the zulus to be is not what an experience of fortytwo years in managing them inclined me to and yet in the face of all this accumulated evidence this report continues to be believed that is by those who wished to believe it  such are the accusations that have been brought against the manner of the annexation and the officer who carried it out and never were accusations more groundless indeed both for party purposes and from personal animus every means fair or foul has been used to discredit it and all connected with it to take a single instance one author miss colenso p 134 history of the zulu war actually goes the length of putting a portion of a speech made by president burgers into the mouth of sir t shepstone and then abusing him for his incredible profanity surely this exceeds the limits of fair criticism  before i go on to the actual history of the annexation there is one point i wish to submit to my reader in england the change of government has always been talked of as though it only affected the forty thousand white inhabitants of the country whilst everybody seems to forget that this same land had about a million human beings living on it its original owners and only unfortunately for themselves possessing a black skin and therefore entitled to little considerationeven at the hands of the most philanthropic government in the world it never seems to have occurred to those who have raised so much outcry on behalf of the forty thousand boers to inquire what was thought of the matter by the million natives if they were to be allowed a voice in their own disposal the country was certainly annexed by the wish of a very large majority of its inhabitants it is true that secocoeni instigated thereto by the boers afterwards continued the war against us but with the exception of this one chief the advent of our rule was hailed with joy by every native in the transvaal and even he was glad of it at the time during our period of rule in the transvaal the natives have had as they foresaw more peace than at any time since the white man set foot in the land they have paid their taxes gladly and there has been no fighting among themselves but since we have given up the country we hear a very different tale it is this million of men women and children who notwithstanding their black skins live and feel and have intelligence as much as ourselves who are the principal because the most numerous sufferers from mr gladstones conjuring tricks that can turn a sovereign into a suzerain as airily as the professor of magic brings a litter of guineapigs out of a top hat it is our falsehood and treachery to them whom we took over for ever as we told them and whom we have now handed back to their natural enemies to be paid off for their loyalty to the englishman that is the blackest stain in all this black business and that has destroyed our prestige and caused us to be looked on amongst them for they do not hide their opinion as cowards and liars  but very little attention however seems to have been paid to native views or claims at any time in the transvaal indeed they have all along been treated as serfs of the soil to be sold with it if necessary to a new master it is true that the government acting under pressure from the aborigines protection society made on the occasion of the surrender a feeble effort to secure the independence of some of the native tribes but when the boer leaders told them shortly that they would have nothing of the sort and that if they were not careful they would reoccupy laings nek the proposal was at once dropped with many assurances that no offence was intended the worst of the matter is that this treatment of our native subjects and allies will assuredly recoil on the heads of future innocent governments  shortly after the appointment of the jointcommission alluded to at the beginning of this chapter president burgers who was now in possession of the special commissioners intentions should he be unable to carry out reforms sufficiently drastic to satisfy the english government thought it best to call together the volksraad in the meantime it had been announced that the rebel secocoeni had sued for peace and signed a treaty declaring himself a subject of the republic i shall have to enter into the question of this treaty a little further on so i will at present only say that it was the first business laid before the raad and after some discussion ratified next in order to the secocoeni peace came the question of confederation as laid down in lord carnarvons permissive bill this proposal was laid before them in an earnest and eloquent speech by their president who entreated them to consider the dangerous position of the republic and to face their difficulties like men the question was referred to a committee and an adverse report being brought up was rejected without further consideration it is just possible that intimidation had something to do with the summary treatment of so important a matter seeing that whilst it was being argued a large mob of boers looking very formidable with their seacow hide whips watched every move of their representatives through the windows of the volksraad hall it was mr chamberlains caucus system in practical and visible operation  a few days after the rejection of the confederation bill president burgers who had frequently alluded to the desperate condition of the republic and stated that either some radical reform must be effected or the country must come under the british flag laid before the raad a brand new constitution of a very remarkable nature asserting that they must either accept it or lose their independence  the first part of this strange document dealt with the people and their rights which remained much as they were before with the exception that the secrecy of all letters entrusted to the post was to be inviolable the recognition of this right is an amusing incident in the history of a free republic under following articles the volksraad was entrusted with the charge of the native inhabitants of the state the provision for the administration of justice the conduct of education the regulation of moneybills c it is in the fourth chapter however that we come to the real gist of the bill which was the endowment of the state president with the authority of a dictator mr burgers thought to save the state by making himself an absolute monarch he was to be elected for a period of seven years instead of five years and to be eligible for reelection in him was vested the power of making all appointments without reference to the legislature all laws were to be drawn up by him and he was to have the right of veto on volksraad resolutions which body he could summon and dissolve at will finally his executive council was to consist of heads of departments appointed by himself and of one member of the volksraad the volksraad treated this bill in much the same way as they had dealt with the permissive confederation bill gave it a casual consideration and threw it out  the president meanwhile was doing his best to convince the raad of the danger of the country that the treasury was empty whilst duns were pressing that enemies were threatening on every side and finally that her majestys special commissioner was encamped within a thousand yards of them watching their deliberations with some interest he showed them that it was impossible at once to scorn reform and reject friendly offers that it was doubtful if anything could save them but that if they took no steps they were certainly lost as a nation the fathers of the land however declined to dance to the presidents piping then he took a bolder line he told them that a guilty nation never can evade the judgment that follows its steps he asked them conscientiously to advise the people not obstinately to refuse a union with a powerful government he could not advise them to refuse such a union    he did not believe that a new constitution would save them for as little as the old constitution had brought them to ruin so little would a new constitution bring salvation    if the citizens of england had behaved towards the crown as the burghers of this state had behaved to their government england would never have stood so long as she had he pointed out to them their hopeless financial position today he said a bill for 1100 pounds was laid before me for signature but i would sooner have cut off my right hand than sign that papercheersfor i have not the slightest ground to expect that when that bill becomes due there will be a penny to pay it with and finally he exhorted them thus let them make the best of the situation and get the best terms they possibly could let them agree to join their hands to those of their brethren in the south and then from the cape to the zambesi there would be one great people yes there was something grand in that grander even than their idea of a republic something which ministered to their national feelingcheersand would this be so miserable yes this would be miserable for those who would not be under the law for the rebel and the revolutionist but welfare and prosperity for the men of law and order  these powerful words form a strong indictment against the republic and from them there can be little doubt that president burgers was thoroughly convinced of the necessity and wisdom of the annexation it is interesting to compare them and many other utterances of his made at this period with the opinions he expresses in the posthumous document recently published in which he speaks somewhat jubilantly of the lessons taught us on laings nek and majuba by such an inherently weak people as the boers and points to them as striking instances of retribution in this document he attributes the annexation to the desire to advance english supremacy in south africa and to lay hold of the way to central south africa it is however noticeable that he does not in any way indicate how it could have been averted and the state continue to exist and he seems all along to feel that his case is a weak one for in explaining or attempting to explain why he had never defended himself from the charges brought against him in connection with the annexation he says had i not endured in silence had i not borne patiently all the accusations but out of selfishness or fear told the plain truth of the case the transvaal would never have had the consideration it has now received from great britain however unjust the annexation was my selfjustification would have exposed the boers to such an extent and the state of the country in such a way that it would have deprived them both of the sympathy of the world and the consideration of the english politicians in other words if i had told the truth about things as i should have been obliged to do to justify myself there would have been no more outcry about the annexation because the whole world even the english radicals would have recognised how necessary it was and what a fearful state the country was in  but to let that pass it is evident that president burgers did not take the same view of the annexation in 1877 as he did in 1881 and indeed his speeches to the volksraad would read rather oddly printed in parallel columns with his posthumous statement the reader would be forced to one of two conclusions either on one of the two occasions he is saying what he does not mean or he must have changed his mind as i believe him to have been an honest man i incline to the latter supposition nor do i consider it so very hard to account for taking into consideration his natural dutch proclivities in 1877 burgers is the despairing head of a state driving rapidly to ruin if not to actual extinction when the strong hand of the english government is held out to him what wonder that he accepts it gladly on behalf of his country which is by its help brought into a state of greater prosperity than it has ever before known in 1881 the wheel has gone round and great events have come about whilst he lies dying the enemies of the boers have been destroyed the powers of the zulus and secocoeni are no more the country has prospered under a healthy rule and its finances have been restored moreglad tidings have come from midlothian to the rebel and the revolutionist whose hopes were flagging and eloquent words have been spoken by the new english dictator that have aroused a great rebellion and to crown all english troops have suffered one massacre and three defeats and england sues for peace from the south african peasant heedless of honour or her broken word so that the prayer be granted with such events before him that dying man may well have found cause to change his opinion doubtless the annexation was wrong since england disowns her acts and may not that dream about the great south african republic come true after all has not the preeminence of the englishman received a blow from which it can never recover and is not his control over boers and natives irredeemably weakened and must heburgersgo down to posterity as a dutchman who tried to forward the interests of the english party no doubtless the annexation was wrong but it has done good for it has brought about the downfall of the english and we will end the argument in the very words of his last public utterance with which he ends his statement south africa gained more from this and has made a larger step forward in the march of freedom than most people can conceive  who shall say that he is wrong the words of dying men are sometimes prophetic south africa has made a great advance towards the freedom of a dutch republic  this has been a digression but i hope not an uninteresting one to returnon the 1st march sir t shepstone met the executive council and told them that in his opinion there was now but one remedy to be adopted and that was that the transvaal should be united with english colonies of south africa under one head namely the queen saying at the same time that the only thing now left to the republic was to make the best arrangements it could for the future benefit of its inhabitants and to submit to that which he saw to be and every thinking man saw to be inevitable so soon as this information was officially communicated to the raad for a good proportion of its members were already acquainted with it unofficially it flew from a state of listless indifference into vigorous and hasty action the president was censured and a committee was appointed to consider and report upon the situation which reported in favour of the adoption of burgers new constitution accordingly the greatest part of this measure which had been contemptuously rejected a few days before was adopted almost without question and mr paul kruger was appointed vicepresident on the following day a very drastic treason law was passed borrowed from the statute book of the orange free state which made all public expression of opinion if adverse to the government or in any way supporting the annexation party high treason this done the assembly prorogued itself untiloctober 1881  during and after the sitting of the raad rumours arose that the chief secocoenis signature to the treaty of peace ratified by that body had been obtained by misrepresentation as ratified this treaty consisted of three articles according to which secocoeni consented first to become a subject of the republic and obey the laws of the country secondly to agree to a certain restricted boundary line and thirdly to pay 2000 head of cattle which considering he had captured quite 5000 head was not exorbitant  towards the end of february a written message was received from secocoeni by sir t shepstone dated after the signing of the supposed treaty the original which was written in sisutu was a great curiosity the following is a correct translation   for myn heer sheepstonei beg you chief come help me the boers are killing me and i dont know the reasons why they should be angry with me chief i beg you come with myn heer merenskyi am sikukuni   this message was accompanied by a letter from mr merensky a wellknown and successful missionary who had been for many years resident in secocoenis country in which he stated that he heard on very good authority that secocoeni had distinctly refused to agree to that article of the treaty by which he became a subject of the state he adds that he cannot remain silent while such tricks are played  upon this information sir t shepstone wrote to president burgers stating that if the officer in whom you have placed confidence has withheld any portion of the truth from you especially so serious a portion of it he is guilty of a wrong towards you personally as well as towards the government because he has caused you to assume an untenable position and suggesting that a joint commission should be despatched to secocoeni to thoroughly sift the question in the interest of all concerned this suggestion was after some delay agreed to and a commission was appointed consisting of mr van gorkom a hollander and mr holtshausen a member of the executive council on behalf of the transvaal government and mr osborn rm and captain clarke ra on behalf of the commissioner whom i accompanied as secretary  at middelburg the native gideon who acted as interpreter between commandant ferreira cmg the officer who negotiated the treaty on behalf of the boer government and secocoeni was examined and also two natives petros and jeremiah who were with him but did not actually interpret all these men persisted that secocoeni had positively refused to become a subject of the republic and only consented to sign the treaty on the representations of commandant ferreira that it would only be binding as regards to the two articles about the cattle and the boundary line  the commission then proceeded to secocoenis town accompanied by a fresh set of interpreters and had a long interview with secocoeni the chiefs prime minister or mouth makurupiji speaking in his presence and on his behalf and making use of the pronoun i before all the assembled headmen of the tribe gave an account of the interview between commandant ferreira in the presence of that gentleman who accompanied the commission and secocoeni in almost the same words as had been used by the interpreters at middelburg he distinctly denied having consented to become a subject of the republic or to stand under the law and added that he feared he had touched the feather to signed things that he did not know of in the treaty commandant ferreira then put some questions but entirely failed to shake the evidence on the contrary he admitted by his questions that secocoeni had not consented to become a subject of the republic secocoeni had evidently signed the piece of paper under the impression that he was acknowledging his liability to pay 2000 head of cattle and fixing a certain portion of his boundary line and on the distinct understanding that he was not to become a subject of the state  now it was the secocoeni war that had brought the english mission into the country and if it could be shown that the secocoeni war had come to a successful termination it would go far towards helping the mission out again to this end it was necessary that the chief should declare himself a subject of the state and thereby by implication acknowledge himself to have been a rebel and admit his defeat all that was required was a signature and that once obtained the treaty was published and submitted to the raad for confirmation without a whisper being heard of the conditions under which this ignorant basutu was induced to sign had no commission visited secocoeni this treaty would afterwards have been produced against him in its entirety altogether the history of the secocoeni peace treaty does not reassure one as to the genuineness of the treaties which the boers are continually producing purporting to have been signed by native chiefs and as a general rule presenting the state with great tracts of country in exchange for a horse or a few oxen however fond the natives may be of their boer neighbours such liberality can scarcely be genuine on the other hand it is so easy to induce a savage to sign a paper or even if he is reticent to make a cross for him and once made as we all know litera scripa manet and becomes title to the lands  during the secocoeni investigation affairs in the transvaal were steadily drifting towards anarchy the air was filled with rumours now it was reported that an outbreak was imminent amongst the english population at the gold fields who had never forgotten von schlickmanns kind suggestion that they should be subdued now it was said that cetywayo had crossed the border and might shortly be expected at pretoria now that a large body of boers were on their road to shoot the special commissioner his twentyfive policemen and englishmen generally and so on  meanwhile paul kruger and his party were not letting the grass grow under their feet but worked public feeling with great vigour with the double object of getting paul made president and ridding themselves of the english articles in his support were printed in the wellknown dutch paper die patriot published in the cape colony which are so typical of the boers and of the only literature that has the slightest influence over them that i will quote a few extracts from one of them  after drawing a very vivid picture of the wretched condition of the country as compared to what it was when the kafirs had a proper respect for the boers before burgers came into power the article proceeds to give the cause of this state of affairs gods word it says gives us the solution look at israel while the people have a godly king everything is prosperous but under a godless prince the land retrogrades and the whole of the people must suffer read leviticus chapter 26 with attention c in the day of the voortrekkers pioneers a handful of men chased a thousand kafirs and made them run so also in the free state war deut xxxii 30 jos xxiii 10 lev xxvi 8 but mark now when burgers became president he knows no sabbath he rides through the land in and out of town on sunday he knows not the church and gods service lev xxvi 23 to the scandal of pious people and he formerly was a priest too and what is the consequence no harvest lev xxvi 16 an army of 6000 men runs because one man falls lev xxvi 17 c what is now the remedy the remedy proves to be paul kruger because there is no other candidate because our lord clearly points him out to be the man for why is there no other candidate who arranged it this way then follows a rather odd argument in favour of pauls election because he himself p kruger acknowledges in his own reply that he is incompetent but that all his ability is from our lord because he is a warrior because he is a boer then paul kruger the warrior and the boer is compared to joan of arc a simple boer girl who came from behind the sheep the burghers of transvaal are exhorted to acknowledge the hand of the lord and elect paul kruger or look for still heavier punishment lev xxvi 18 et seq next the patriot proceeds to give a bit of advice to our candidate paul kruger he is to deliver the land from the kafirs the lord has given you the heart of a warrior arise and drive them a bit of advice quite suited to his wellknown character but this chosen vessel was not to get all the loaves and fishes on the contrary as soon as he had fulfilled his mission of driving the kafirs he was to hand over his office to a good president the article ends thus if the lord wills to use you now to deliver this land from its enemies and a day of peace and prosperity arises again and you see that you are not exactly the statesman to further govern the republic then it will be your greatest honour to say citizens i have delivered you from the enemy i am no statesman but now you have peace and time to choose and elect a good president  an article such as the above is instructive reading as showing the low calibre of the minds that are influenced by it yet such writings and sermons have more power among the boers than any other arguments appealing as they do to the fanaticism and vanity of their nature which causes them to believe that the divinity is continually interfering on their behalf at the cost of other people it will be noticed that the references given are all to the old testament and nearly all refer to acts of blood  these doctrines were not however at all acceptable to burgers party or the more enlightened members of the community and so bitter did the struggle of rival opinions become that there is very little doubt that had the country not been annexed civil war would have been added to its other calamities meanwhile the natives were from day to day becoming more restless and messengers were constantly arriving at the special commissioners camp begging that their tribe might be put under the queen and stating that they would fight rather than submit any longer to the boers  at length on the 9th april sir t shepstone informed the government of the republic that he was about to declare the transvaal british territory he told them that he had considered and reconsidered his determination but that he could see no possible means within the state by which it could free itself from the burdens that were sinking it to destruction adding that if he could have found such means he would certainly not have hidden them from the government this intimation was received in silence though all the later proceedings with reference to the annexation were in reality carried out in concert with the authorities of the republic thus on the 13th march the government submitted a paper of ten questions to sir t shepstone as regards the future condition of the transvaal under english rule whether the debts of the state would be guaranteed c to these questions replies were given which were on the whole satisfactory to the government as these replies formed the basis of the proclamation guarantees it is not necessary to enter into them  it was further arranged by the republican government that a formal protest should be entered against the annexation which was accordingly prepared and privately shown to the special commissioner the annexation proclamation was also shown to president burgers and a paragraph eliminated at his suggestion in fact the special commissioner and the president together with most of his executive were quite at one as regards the necessity of the proclamation being issued their joint endeavours being directed to the prevention of any disturbance and to secure a good reception for the change  at length after three months of inquiry and negotiation the proclamation of annexation was on the 12th of april 1877 read by mr osborn accompanied by some other gentlemen of sir t shepstones staff it was an anxious moment for all concerned to use the words of the special commissioner in his despatch home on the subject every effort had been made during the previous fortnight by it is said educated hollanders and who had but lately arrived in the country to rouse the fanaticism of the boers and induce them to offer bloody resistance to what it was known i intended to do the boers were appealed to in the most inflammatory language by printed manifestoes and memorials    it was urged that i had but a small escort which could easily be overpowered in a country so full of desperadoes and fanatical haters of anything english it was more than possible than though such an act would have been condemned by the general sense of the country a number of men could easily be found who would think they were doing a righteous act in greeting the annexationists with an ovation of bullets i do not mean that the anxiety was personal because i do not think the members of that small party set any higher value on their lives than other people but it was absolutely necessary for the success of the act itself and for the safety of the country that not a single shot should be fired had that happened it is probable that the whole country would have been involved in confusion and bloodshed the zulus would have broken in and the kafirs would have risen in fact to use cetywayos words the land would have burned with fire  it will therefore be easily understood what an anxious hour that was both for the special commissioner sitting up at government house and for his staff down on the market square and how thankful they were when the proclamation was received with hearty cheers by the crowd mr burgers protest which was read immediately afterwards was received in respectful silence  and thus the transvaal territory passed for a while into the great family of the english colonies i believe that the greatest political opponent of the act will bear tribute to the very remarkable ability with which it was carried out when the variety and number of the various interests that had to be conciliated the obstinate nature of the individuals who had to be convinced as well as the innate hatred of the english name and ways which had to be overcome to carry out this act successfully are taken into consideration together with a thousand other matters the neglect of any one of which would have sufficed to make failure certain it will be seen what tact and skill and knowledge of human nature were required to execute so difficult a task it must be remembered that no force was used and that there never was any threat of force the few troops that were to enter the transvaal were four weeks march from pretoria at the time there was nothing whatsoever to prevent the boers putting a summary stop to the proceedings of the commissioner if they had thought fit  that sir theophilus played a bold and hazardous game nobody will deny but like most players who combine boldness with coolness of head and justice of cause he won and without shedding a single drop of blood or even confiscating an acre of land and at no cost annexed a great country and averted a very serious war that same country four years later cost us a million of money the loss of nearly a thousand men killed and wounded and the ruin of many more confiding thousands to surrender it is true however that nobody can accuse the retrocession of having been conducted with judgment or abilityvery much the contrary  there can be no more ample justification of the necessity of the issue of the annexation proclamation than the proclamation itself  first it touches on the sand river convention of 1852 by which independence was granted to the state and shows that the evident objects and inciting motives in granting such guarantee were to promote peace freetrade and friendly intercourse in the hope and belief that the republic would become a flourishing and selfsustaining state a source of strength and security to neighbouring european communities and a point from which christianity and civilisation might rapidly spread toward central africa it goes on to show how these hopes have been disappointed and how that increasing weakness in the state itself on the one side and more than corresponding growth of real strength and confidence among the native tribes on the other have produced their natural and inevitable consequence    that after more or less of irritating conflict with aboriginal tribes to the north there commenced about the year 1867 gradual abandonment to the natives in that direction of territory settled by burghers of the transvaal in wellbuilt towns and villages and on granted farms  it goes on to show that this decay of power and ebb of authority in the north is being followed by similar processes in the south under yet more dangerous circumstances people of this state residing in that direction have been compelled within the last three months at the bidding of native chiefs and at a moments notice to leave their farms and homes their standing crops    all to be taken possession of by natives but that the government is more powerless than ever to vindicate its assumed rights or to resist the declension that is threatening its existence it then recites how all the other colonies and communities of south africa have lost confidence in the state how it is in a condition of hopeless bankruptcy and its commerce annihilated whilst the inhabitants are divided into factions and the government has fallen into helpless paralysis how also the prospect of the election of a new president instead of being looked forward to with hope would in the opinion of all parties be the signal for civil war anarchy and bloodshed how that this state of things affords the very strongest temptation to the great neighbouring native powers to attack the country a temptation that they were only too ready and anxious to yield to and that the state was in far too feeble a condition to repel such attacks from which it had hitherto only been saved by the repeated representations of the government of natal the next paragraphs i will quote as they stand for they sum up the reasons for the annexation  that the secocoeni war which would have produced but little effect on a healthy constitution has not only proved suddenly fatal to the resources and reputation of the republic but has shown itself to be a culminating point in the history of south africa in that a makatee or basutu tribe unwarlike and of no account in zulu estimation successfully withstood the strength of the state and disclosed for the first time to the native powers outside the republic from the zambesi to the cape the great change that had taken place in the relative strength of the white and black races that this disclosure at once shook the prestige of the white man in south africa and placed every european community in peril that this common danger has caused universal anxiety has given to all concerned the right to investigate its cause and to protect themselves from its consequences and has imposed the duty upon those who have the power to shield enfeebled civilisation from the encroachments of barbarism and inhumanity it proceeds to point out that the transvaal will be the first to suffer from the results of its own policy and that it is for every reason perfectly impossible for her majestys government to stand by and see a friendly white state ravaged knowing that its own possessions will be the next to suffer that h m government being persuaded that the only means to prevent such a catastrophe would be by the annexation of the country and knowing that this was the wish of a large proportion of the inhabitants of the transvaal the step must be taken next follows the formal annexation  together with the proclamation an address was issued by sir t shepstone to the burghers of the state laying the facts before them in a friendly manner more suited to their mode of thought than it was possible to do in a formal proclamation this document the issue of which was one of those touches that ensured the success of the annexation was a powerful summing up in colloquial language of the arguments used in the proclamation strengthened by quotations from the speeches of the president it ends with these words it remains only for me to beg of you to consider and weigh what i have said calmly and without undue prejudice let not mere feeling or sentiment prevail over your judgment accept what her majestys government intends shall be and what you will soon find from experience is a blessing not only to you and your children but to the whole of south africa through you and i believe that i speak these words to you as a friend from my heart  two other proclamations were also issued one notifying the assumption of the office of administrator of the government by sir t shepstone and the other repealing the wartax which was doubtless an unequal and oppressive impost  i have in the preceding pages stated all the principal grounds of the annexation and briefly sketched the history of that event in the next chapter i propose to follow the fortunes of the transvaal under british rule    chapter iv  the transvaal under british rule  reception of the annexationmajor clarke and the

englishmen and cessation of agitationfinancial position of the country after three years of british ruleletter of the boer leaders to mr courtney  the news of the annexation was received all over the country with a sigh of relief and in many parts of it with great rejoicings at the gold fields for instance special thanksgiving services were held and god save the queen was sung in church nowhere was there the slightest disturbance but on the contrary addresses of congratulation and thanks literally poured in by every mail many of them signed by boers who have since been conspicuous for their bitter opposition to english rule at first there was some doubt as to what would be the course taken under the circumstances by the volunteers enlisted by the late republic major clarke ra was sent to convey the news and to take command of them unaccompanied save by his kafir servant on arrival at the principal fort he at once ordered the republican flag to be hauled down and the union jack run up and his orders were promptly obeyed a few days afterwards some members of the force thought better of it and having made up their minds to kill him came to the tent where he was sitting to carry out their purpose on learning their kind intentions major clarke fixed his eyeglass in his eye and after steadily glaring at them through it for some time said you are all drunk go back to your tents the volunteers quite overcome by his coolness and the fixity of his gaze at once slipped off and there was no further trouble about three weeks after the annexation the 113th regiment arrived at pretoria having been very well received all along the road by the boers who came from miles round to hear the band play its entry into pretoria was quite a sight the whole population turned out to meet it indeed the feeling of rejoicing and relief was so profound that when the band began to play god save the queen some of the women burst into tears  meanwhile the effect of the annexation on the country was perfectly magical credit and commerce were at once restored the railway bonds that were down to nothing in holland rose with one bound to par and the value of landed property nearly doubled indeed it would have been possible for any one knowing what was going to happen to have realised large sums of money by buying land in the beginning of 1877 and selling it shortly after the annexation  on the 24th may being her majestys birthday all the native chiefs who were anywhere within reach were summoned to attend the first formal hoisting of the english flag the day was a general festival and the ceremony was attended by a large number of boers and natives in addition to all the english at midday amidst the cheers of the crowd the salute of artillery and the strains of god save the queen the union jack was run up a lofty flagstaff and the transvaal was formally announced to be british soil the flag was hoisted by colonel brooke re and the present writer speaking for myself i may say that it was one of the proudest moments of my life could i have foreseen that i should live to see that same flag then hoisted with so much joyous ceremony within a few years shamefully and dishonourably hauled down and buried i think it would have been the most miserable        the english flag was during the signing of the      convention at pretoria formally buried by a large crowd of      englishmen and loyal natives  the annexation was as well received in england as it was in the transvaal lord carnarvon wrote to sir t shepstone to convey the queens entire approval of your conduct since you received her majestys commission with a renewal of my own thanks on behalf of the government for the admirable prudence and discretion with which you have discharged a great and unwonted responsibility it was also accepted by parliament with very few dissentient voices since it was not till afterwards when the subject became useful as an electioneering howl that the liberal party headed by our powerful popular minister discovered the deep iniquity that had been perpetrated in south africa so satisfied were the transvaal boers with the change that messrs kruger jorissen and bok who formed the deputation to proceed to england and present president burgers formal protest against the annexation found great difficulty in raising onehalf of the necessary expensessomething under one thousand poundstowards the cost of the undertaking the thirst for independence cannot have been very great when all the wealthy burghers in the transvaal put together would not subscribe a thousand pounds towards retaining it indeed at this time the members of the deputation themselves seem to have looked upon their undertaking as being both doubtful and undesirable since they informed sir t shepstone that they were going to europe to discharge an obligation which had been imposed upon them and if the mission failed they would have done their duty mr kruger said that if they did fail he would be found to be as faithful a subject under the new form of government as he had been under the old and dr jorissen admitted with equal frankness that the change was inevitable and expressed his belief that the cancellation of it would be calamitous  whilst the annexation was thus well received in the country immediately interested a lively agitation was commenced in the western province of the cape colony a thousand miles away with a view of inducing the home government to repudiate sir t shepstones act the reason of this movement was that the cape dutch party caring little or nothing for the real interests of the transvaal did care a great deal about their scheme to turn all the white communities of south africa into a great dutch republic to which they thought the annexation would be a deathblow as i have said elsewhere it must be borne in mind that the strings of the antiannexation agitation have all along been pulled in the western province whilst the transvaal boers have played the parts of puppets the instruments used by the leaders of the movement in the cape were for the most part the discontented and unprincipled hollander element a newspaper of an extremely abusive nature called the volkstem and another in natal known as the natal witness lately edited by the notorious aylward which has an almost equally unenviable reputation  on the arrival of messrs jorissen and kruger in england they were received with great civility by lord carnarvon who was however careful to explain to them that the annexation was irrevocable in this decision they cheerfully acquiesced assuring his lordship of their determination to do all they could to induce the boers to accept the new state of things and expressing their desire to be allowed to serve under the new government  whilst these gentlemen were thus satisfactorily arranging matters with lord carnarvon sir t shepstone was making a tour round the country which resembled a triumphal progress more than anything else he was everywhere greeted with enthusiasm by all classes of the community boers english and natives and numerous addresses were presented to him couched in the warmest language not only by englishmen but also by boers  it is very difficult to reconcile the enthusiasm of a great number of the inhabitants of the transvaal for english rule and the quite acquiescence of the remainder at this time with the decidedly antagonistic attitude assumed later on it appears to me however that there are several reasons that go far towards accounting for it the transvaal when we annexed it was in the position of a man with a knife at his throat who is suddenly rescued by some one stronger than he on certain conditions which at the time he gladly accepts but afterwards when the danger is passed wishes to repudiate in the same way the inhabitants of the south african republic were in the time of need very thankful for our aid but after a while when the recollection of their difficulties had grown faint when their debts had been paid and their enemies defeated they began to think that they would like to get rid of us again and start fresh on their own account with a clean sheet what fostered agitation more than anything else however was the perfect impunity in which it was allowed to be carried on had only a little firmness and decision been shown in the first instance there would have been no further trouble we might have been obliged to confiscate halfadozen farms and perhaps imprison as many free burghers for a few months and there it would have ended neither boers or natives understand our nambypamby way of playing at government they put it down to fear what they want and what they expect is to be governed with a just but a firm hand thus when the boers found that they could agitate with impunity they naturally enough continued to agitate anybody who knows them will understand that it was very pleasant to them to find themselves in possession of that delightful thing a grievance and instead of stopping quietly at home on their farms to feel obliged to proceed full of importance and long words to a distant meeting there to spout and listen to the spouting of others it is so much easier to talk politics than to sow mealies some attribute the discontent among the boers to the postponement of the carrying out of the annexation proclamation promises with reference to the free institutions to be granted to the country but in my opinion it had little or nothing to do with it the boers never understood the question of responsible government and never wanted that institution what they did want was to be free of all english control and this they said twenty times in the most outspoken language i think there is little doubt the causes i have indicated are the real sources of the agitation though there must be added to them their detestation of our mode of dealing with natives and of being forced to pay taxes regularly and also the ceaseless agitation of the cape wirepullers through their agents the hollanders and their organs in the press  on the return of messrs kruger and jorissen to the transvaal the latter gentleman resumed his duties as attorneygeneral on which occasion if i remember aright i myself had the honour of administering to him the oath of allegiance to her majesty that he afterwards kept so well the former reported the proceedings of the deputation to a boer meeting when he took a very different tone to that in which he addressed lord carnarvon announcing that if there existed a majority of the people in favour of independence he still was vicepresident of the country  both these gentlemen remained for some time in the pay of the british government mr jorissen as attorneygeneral and mr kruger as member of the executive council the government however at length found it desirable to dispense with their services though on different grounds mr jorissen had like several other members of the republican government been a clergyman and was quite unfit to hold the post of attorneygeneral in an important colony like the transvaal where legal questions were constantly arising requiring all the attention of a trained mind and after he had on several occasions been publicly admonished from the bench the government retired him on liberal terms needless to say his opposition to english rule then became very bitter mr krugers appointment expired by law in november 1877 and the government did not think it advisable to reemploy him the terms of his letter of dismissal can be found on page 135 of blue book c 144 and involving as they do a serious charge of misrepresentation in money matters are not very creditable to him after this event he also pursued the cause of independence with increased vigour  during the last months of 1877 and the first part of 1878 agitation against british rule went on unchecked and at last grew to alarming proportions so much so that sir t shepstone on his return from the zulu border in march 1878 where he had been for some months discussing the vexed and dangerous question of the boundary line with the zulus found it necessary to issue a stringent proclamation warning the agitators that their proceedings and meetings were illegal and would be punished according to law this document which was at the time vulgarly known as the holdyourjaw proclamation not being followed by action produced but little effect  on the 4th april 1878 another boer meeting was convened at which it was decided to send a second deputation to england to consist this time of messrs kruger and joubert with mr bok as secretary this deputation proved as abortive as the first sir m hicks beach assuring it in a letter dated 6th august 1878 that it is impossible for many reasons     that the queens sovereignty should now be withdrawn  whilst the government was thus hampered by internal disaffection it had also many other difficulties on its hands first there was the zulu boundary question which was constantly developing new dangers to the country indeed it was impossible to say what might happen in that direction from one week to another nor were its relations with secocoeni satisfactory it will be remembered that just before the annexation this chief had expressed his earnest wish to become a british subject and even paid over part of the fine demanded from him by the boer government to the civil commissioner major clarke in march 1878 however his conduct towards the government underwent a sudden change and he practically declared war it afterwards appeared from secocoenis own statement that he was instigated to this step by a boer abel erasmus by namethe same man who was concerned in the atrocities in the first secocoeni warwho constantly encouraged him to continue the struggle i do not propose to minutely follow the course of this long war which commencing in the beginning of 1878 did not come to an end till after the zulu war when sir garnet wolseley attacked secocoenis stronghold with a large force of troops volunteers and swazi allies and took it with great slaughter the losses on our side were not very heavy so far as white men were concerned but the swazies are reported to have lost 400 killed and 500 wounded  the struggle was during the long period preceding the final attack carried on with great courage and ability by major clarke ra cmg whose force at the best of times only consisted of 200 volunteers and 100 zulus with this small body of men he contrived however to keep secocoeni in check and to take some important strongholds it was marked also by some striking acts of individual bravery of which one performed by major clarke himself whose reputation for cool courage and presence of mind in danger is unsurpassed in south africa is worthy of notice and which had public attention been more concentrated on the secocoeni war would doubtless have won him the victoria cross on one occasion on visiting one of the outlying forts he found that a party of hostile natives who were coming down to the fort on the previous day with a flag of truce had been accidentally fired upon and had at once retreated as his system in native warfare was always to try and inspire his enemy with perfect faith in the honour of englishmen and their contempt of all tricks and treachery even towards a foe he was very angry at this occurrence and at once unarmed and unattended save by his native servant rode up into the mountains to the kraal from which the white flag party had come on the previous day and apologised to the chief for what had happened when i consider how very anxious secocoenis natives were to kill or capture clarke whom they held in great dread and how terrible the end of so great a captain would in all probability have been had he taken alive by these masters of refined torture i confess that i think this act of gentlemanly courage is one of the most astonishing things i ever heard of when he rode up those hills he must have known that he was probably going to meet his death at the hands of justly incensed savages when secocoeni heard of what major clarke had done he was so pleased that he shortly afterwards released a volunteer whom he had taken prisoner and who would otherwise in all probability have been tortured to death i must add that major clarke himself never reported to or alluded to this incident but an account of it can be found in a despatch written by sir o lanyon to the secretary of state dated 2d february 1880  concurrently with though entirely distinct from the political agitation that was being carried on among the boers having for object the restoration of independence a private agitation was set on foot by a few disaffected persons against sir t shepstone with the view of obtaining his removal from office in favour of a certain colonel weatherley the details of this impudent plot are so interesting and the plot itself so typical of the state of affairs with which sir t shepstone had to deal that i will give a short account of it  after the annexation had taken place there were naturally enough a good many individuals who found themselves disappointed in the results so far as they personally were concerned i mean that they did not get so much out of it as they expected among these was a gentleman called colonel weatherley who had come to the transvaal as manager of a goldmining company but getting tired of that had taken a prominent part in the annexation and who being subsequently disappointed about an appointment became a bitter enemy of the administrator i may say at once that colonel weatherley seems to me to have been throughout the dupe of the other conspirators  the next personage was a goodlooking desperado who called himself captain gunn of gunn and who was locally somewhat irreverently known as the very gunn of very gunn this gentleman whose former career had been of a most remarkable order was on the annexation of the country found in the public prison charged with having committed various offences but on colonel weatherleys interesting himself strongly on his behalf he was eventually released without trial on his release he requested the administrator to publish a government notice declaring him innocent of the charges brought against him this sir t shepstone declined to do and so to use his own words in a despatch to the high commissioner on the subject captain gunn of gunn at once became what in this country is called a patriot  the third person concerned was a lawyer who had got into trouble on the diamond fields and who felt himself injured because the rules of the high court did not allow him to practise as an advocate the quartet was made up by mr celliers the editor of the patriotic organ the volkstem who since he had lost the government printing contract found that no language could be too strong to apply to the personnel of the government more especially its head of course there was a lady in it what plot would be complete without she was mrs weatherley now i believe mrs gunn of gunn these gentlemen began operations by drawing up a long petition to sir bartle frere as high commissioner setting forth a string of supposed grievances and winding up with a request that the administrator might be promoted to some other sphere of political usefulness this memorial was forwarded by the committee as they called themselves to various parts of the country for signature but without the slightest success the fact of the matter being that it was not the annexor but the annexation that the boers objected to  at this stage in the proceedings colonel weatherley went to try and forward the good cause with sir bartle frere at the cape his letters to mrs weatherley from thence afterwards put into court in the celebrated divorce case contained many interesting accounts of his attempts in that direction i do not think however that he was cognisant of what was being concocted by his allies in pretoria but being a very vain weak man was easily deceived by them with all his faults he was a gentleman as soon as he was gone a second petition was drawn up by the committee showing the advisability of immediately suspending our present administrator and temporarily appointing and recommending for her majestys royal and favourable consideration an english gentleman of high integrity and honour in whom the country at large has respect and confidence  the english gentleman of high integrity and honour of course proves to be colonel weatherley whose appointment is further on respectfully but earnestly requested since he had thoroughly gained the affections confidence and respect of boers english and other europeans in this country but whilst it is comparatively easy to write petitions there is sometimes a difficulty in getting people to sign them as proved to be the case with reference to the documents under consideration when the committee and the employes in the office of the volkstem had affixed their valuable signatures it was found to be impossible to induce anybody else to follow their example now a petition with some half dozen signatures attached would not it was obvious carry much weight with the imperial government and no more could be obtained  but really great minds rise superior to such difficulties and so did the committee or some of them or one of them if they could not get genuine signatures to their petitions they could at any rate manufacture them this great idea once hit out so vigorously was it prosecuted that they or some of them or one of them produced in a very little while no less than 3883 signatures of which sixteen were proved to be genuine five were doubtful and all the rest fictitious but the gentleman whoever he was who was the working partner in the schemeand i may state by way of parenthesis that when gunn of gunn was subsequently arrested petitions in process of signature were found under the mattress of his bedcalculated without his host he either did not know or had forgotten that on receipt of such documents by a superior officer they are at once sent to the officer accused to report upon this course was followed in the present case and the petitions were discovered to be gross impostures the ingenuity exercised by their author or authors was really very remarkable for it must be remembered that not one of the signatures was forged they were all invented and had of course to be written in a great variety of hands the plan generally pursued was to put down the names of people living in the country with slight variations thus de villiers became de williers and van zyl van zul i remember that my own name appeared on one of the petitions with some slight alteration some of the names were evidently meant to be facetious thus there was a jan verneuker which means john the cheat  of the persons directly or indirectly concerned in this rascally plot the unfortunate colonel weatherly subsequently apologised to sir t shepstone for his share in the agitation and shortly afterwards died fighting bravely on kambula captain gunn of gunn and mrs weatherley after having given rise to the most remarkable divorce case i ever heardit took fourteen days to trywere on the death of colonel weatherley united in the bonds of holy matrimony and are i believe still in pretoria the lawyer vanished i know not where whilst mr celliers still continues to edit that admirably conducted journal the volkstem nor if i may judge from the report of a speech made by him recently at a boer festival which by the way was graced by the presence of our representative mr hudson the british resident has his right hand forgotten its cunning or rather his tongue lost the use of those peculiar and recherche epithets that used to adorn the columns of the volkstem i see that he on this occasion denounced the english element as being poisonous and dangerous to a state and stated amidst loud cheers that he despised it mr celliers lines have fallen in pleasant places in any other country he would long ago have fallen a victim to the stern laws of libel i recommend him to the notice of enterprising irish newspapers such is the freshness and vigour of his style that i am confident he would make the fortune of any hibernian journal  some little time after the gunn of gunn frauds a very sad incident happened in connection with the government of the transvaal shortly after the annexation the home government sent out mr sergeaunt cmg one of the crown agents for the colonies to report on the financial condition of the country he was accompanied in an unofficial capacity amongst other gentlemen by captain patterson and his son mr j sergeaunt and when he returned to england these two gentlemen remained behind to go on a shooting expedition about this time sir bartle frere was anxious to send a friendly mission to lo bengula king of the matabele a branch of the zulu tribe living up towards the zambesi this chief had been making himself unpleasant by causing traders to be robbed and it was thought desirable to establish friendly relations with him so it was suggested to captain patterson and mr sergeaunt that they should combine business with pleasure and go on a mission to lo bengula an offer which they accepted and shortly afterwards started for matabeleland with an interpreter and a few servants they reached their destination in safety and having concluded their business with the king started on a visit to the zambesi falls on foot leaving the interpreter with the wagon the falls were about twelve days walk from the kings kraal and they were accompanied thither by young mr thomas the son of the local missionary two kafir servants and twenty native bearers supplied by lo bengula the next thing that was heard of them was that they had all died through drinking poisoned water full details of the manner of their deaths being sent down by lo bengula  in the first shock and confusion of such news it was not very closely examined at any rate by the friends of the dead men but on reflection there were several things about it that appeared strange for instance it was well known that captain patterson had a habit for which indeed we had often laughed at him of however thirsty he might be always having his water boiled when he was travelling in order to destroy impurities and it seemed odd that he should on this one occasion have neglected the precaution also it was curious that the majority of lo bengulas bearers appeared to have escaped whereas all the others were without exception killed nor even in that district is it usual to find water so bad that it will kill with the rapidity it had been supposed to do in this case unless indeed it had been designedly poisoned these doubts of the poisoningbywaterstory resolved themselves into certainty when the waggon returned in charge of the interpreter when by putting two and two together we were able to piece out the real history of the diabolical murder of our poor friends with considerable accuracy a story which shows what bloodthirsty wickedness a savage is capable of when he fancies his interests are threatened  it appeared that when captain patterson first interviewed lo bengula he was not at all well received by him i must by way of explanation state that there exists a pretender to his throne kruman by name who as far as i can make out is the real heir to the kingdom this man had for some cause or other fled the country and for a time acted as gardener to sir t shepstone in natal at the date of messrs patterson and sergeaunts mission to matabeleland he was living i believe in the transvaal captain patterson on finding himself so ill received by the king and not being sufficiently acquainted with the character of savage chiefs most unfortunately either by accident or design dropped some hint in the course of conversation about this kruman from that moment lo bengulas conduct towards the mission entirely changed and dropping his former tone he became profusely civil and from that moment too he doubtless determined to kill them probably fearing that they might forward some scheme to oust him and place kruman on whose claim a large portion of his people looked favourably on the throne  when their business was done and captain patterson told the king that they were anxious before returning to visit the zambesi falls he readily fell in with their wish but in the first instance refused permission to young thomas the son of the missionary to accompany them only allowing him to do so on the urgent representation of captain patterson the reason for this was no doubt that he had kindly feelings towards the lad and did not wish to include him in the slaughter  captain patterson was a man of extremely methodical habits and amongst other things was in the habit of making notes of all that he did his notebook had been taken off his body and sent down to pretoria with the other things in it we found entries of his preparations for the trip including the number and names of the bearers provided by lo bengula we also found the chronicle of the first three days journey and that of the morning of the fourth day but there the record stopped the last entry was probably made a few minutes before he was killed and it is to be observed that there was no entry of the party having been for several days without water as stated by the messengers and then finding the poisoned water  this evidence by itself would not have amounted to much but now comes the curious part of the story showing the truth of the old adage murder will out it appears that when the waggon was coming down to pretoria in charge of the interpreter it was outspanned one day outside the borders of lo bengulas country when some kafirsbechuanas i thinkcame up asked for some tobacco and fell into conversation with the driver remarking that he had come up with a full waggon and now he went down with an empty one the driver replied by lamenting the death by poisoned water of his masters whereupon one of the kafirs told him the following storyhe said that a brother of his was out hunting a little while back in the desert for ostriches with a party of other kafirs when hearing shots fired some way off they made for the spot thinking that white men were out shooting and that they would be able to beg meat on reaching the spot which was by a pool of water they saw the bodies of three white men lying on the ground and also those of a hottentot and a kafir surrounded by an armed party of kafirs they at once asked the kafirs what they had been doing killing the white men and were told to be still for it was by order of the king they then learned the whole story it appeared that the white men had made a midday halt by the water when one of the bearers who had gone to the edge of the pool suddenly shouted to them to come and look at a great snake in the water captain patterson ran up and as he leaned over the edge was instantly killed by a blow with an axe the others were then shot and assegaied the kafir further described the clothes that his brother had seen on the bodies and also some articles that had been given to his party by the murderers that left little doubt as to the veracity of his story and so ended the mission to matabeleland  no public notice was taken of the matter for the obvious reason that it was impossible to get at lo bengula to punish him nor would it have been easy to come by legal evidence to disprove the ingenious story of the poisoned water since anybody trying to reach the spot of the massacre would probably fall a victim to some similar accident before he got back again it is devoutly to be hoped that the punishment he deserves will sooner or later overtake the author of this devilish and wholesale murder  the beginning of 1879 was signalised by the commencement of operations in zululand and by the news of the terrible disaster at isandhlwana which fell on pretoria like a thunderclap it was not however any surprise to those who were acquainted with zulu tactics and with the plan of attack adopted by the english commanders in fact i know that one solemn warning of what would certainly happen to him if he persisted in his plan of advance was addressed to lord chelmsford through the officer in command at pretoria by a gentlemen whose position and long experience of the zulus and their mode of attack should have carried some weight if it ever reached him he took to the best of my recollection no notice of it whatever  but though some such disaster was daily expected by a few the majority of both soldiers and civilians never dreamed of anything of the sort the general idea being that the conquest of cetywayo was a very easy undertaking and the shock produced by the news of isandhlwana was proportionally great especially as it reached pretoria in a much exaggerated form i shall never forget the appearance of the town that morning business was entirely suspended and the streets were filled with knots of men talking with scared faces as well they might for there was scarcely anybody but had lost a friend and many thought that their sons or brothers were among the dead on that bloody field among others sir t shepstone lost one son and thought for some time that he had lost three  shortly after this event sir t shepstone went to england to confer with the secretary of state on various matters connected with the transvaal carrying with him the affection and respect of all who knew him not excepting the majority of the malcontent boers he was succeeded by colonel now sir owen lanyon who was appointed to administer the government during the absence of sir t shepstone  by the boers however the news of our disaster was received with great and unconcealed rejoicing or at least by the irreconcilable portion of that people englands necessity was their opportunity and one of which they certainly meant to avail themselves accordingly notices were sent out summoning the burghers of the transvaal to attend a mass meeting on the 18th march at a place about thirty miles from pretoria emissaries were also sent to native chiefs to excite them to follow cetywayos example and massacre all the english within reach of whom a man called solomon prinsloo was one of the most active the natives however notwithstanding the threats used towards them one and all declined the invitation  it must not be supposed that all the boers who attended these meetings did so of their own free will on the contrary a very large number came under compulsion since they found that the english authorities were powerless to give them protection the recalcitrants were threatened with all sorts of pains and penalties if they did not attend a favourite menace being that they should be made biltong of when the country was given back ie be cut into strips and hung in the sun to dry few luckily for themselves were brave enough to tempt fortune by refusing to come but those who did have had to leave the country since the war whatever were the means employed the result was an armed meeting of about 3000 boers who evidently meant mischief  just about this time a corps had been raised in pretoria composed for the most part of gentlemen and known as the pretoria horse for the purpose of proceeding to the zulu border where cavalry especially cavalry acquainted with the country was earnestly needed in the emergency of the times officials were allowed to join this corps a permission of which i availed myself and was elected one of the lieutenants the corps was not after all allowed to go to zululand on account of the threatening aspect adopted by the boers against whom it was retained for service in my capacity as an officer of the corps i was sent out with a small body of picked men all good riders and light weights to keep up a constant communication between the boer camp and the administrator and found the work both interesting and exciting my headquarters were at an inn about twentyfive miles from pretoria to which our agents in the meeting used to come every evening and report how matters were proceeding whereupon if the road was clear i despatched a letter to headquarters or if i feared that the messengers would be caught en route by boer patrols and searched i substituted different coloured ribbons according to what i wished to convey there was a relief hidden in the trees or rocks every six miles all day and most of the night whose business it was to take the despatch or ribbon and gallop on with it to the next station in which way we used to get the despatches into town in about an hour and a quarter        it is customary in south african volunteer forces to      allow the members to elect their own officers provided the      men elected are such as the government approves this is      done so that the corps may not afterwards be able to      declare that they have no confidence in their officers in      action or to grumble at their treatment by them  on one or two occasions the boers came to the inn and threatened to shoot us but as our orders were to do nothing unless our lives were actually in danger we took no notice the officer who came out to relieve me had not however been there more than a day or two before he and all his troopers were hunted back into pretoria by a large mob of armed boers whom they only escaped by very hard riding  meanwhile the boers were by degrees drawing nearer and nearer to the town till at last they pitched their laagers within six miles and practically besieged it all business was stopped the houses were loopholed and fortified and advantageous positions were occupied by the military and the various volunteer corps the building normally in the occupation of the government mules fell to the lot of the pretoria horse and though it was undoubtedly a post of honour i honestly declare that i have no wish to sleep for another month in a mule stable that has not been cleaned out for several years however by sinking a well and erecting bastions and a staging for sharpshooters we converted it into an excellent fortress though it would not have been of much use against artillery our patrols used to be out all night since we chiefly feared a night attack and generally every preparation was made to resist the onset that was hourly expected and i believe that it was that state of preparedness that alone prevented it  whilst this meeting was going on and when matters had come to a point that seemed to render war inevitable sir b frere arrived at pretoria and had several interviews with the boer leaders at which they persisted in demanding their independence and nothing short of it after a great deal of talk the meeting finally broke up without any actual appeal to arms though it had during its continuance assumed many of the rights of government such as stopping postcarts and individuals and sending armed patrols about the country the principal reason of its breakup was that the zulu war was now drawing to a close and the leaders saw that there would soon be plenty of troops available to suppress any attempt at revolt but they also saw to what lengths they could go with impunity they had for a period of nearly two months been allowed to throw the whole country into confusion to openly violate the laws and to intimidate and threaten her majestys loyal subjects with war and death the lesson was not lost on them but they postponed action till a more favourable opportunity offered  sir bartle frere before his departure took an opportunity at a public dinner given him at potchefstroom of assuring the loyal inhabitants of the country that the transvaal would never be given back  meanwhile a new pharaoh had arisen in egypt in the shape of sir g wolseley and on the 29th june 1879 we find him communicating the fact to sir o lanyon in very plain language telling him that he disapproved of his course of action with regard to secocoeni and that in future you will please take orders only from me  as soon as sir garnet had completed his arrangements for the pacification of zululand he proceeded to pretoria and having caused himself to be sworn in as governor set vigorously to work i must say that in his dealings with the transvaal he showed great judgment and a keen appreciation of what the country needed namely strong government the fact of the matter being i suppose that being very popular with the home authorities he felt that he could more or less command their support in what he did a satisfaction not given to most governors who never know but that they may be thrown overboard in emergency in lighten the ship  one of his first acts was to issue a proclamation stating that whereas it appears that notwithstanding repeated assurances of the contrary given by her majestys representatives in this territory uncertainty or misapprehension exists amongst some of her majestys subjects as to the intention of her majestys government regarding the maintenance of british rule and sovereignty over the territory of the transvaal and whereas it is expedient that all grounds for such uncertainty or misapprehension should be removed once and for all beyond doubt or question now therefore i do hereby proclaim and make known in the name and on behalf of her majesty the queen that it is the will and determination of her majestys government that this transvaal territory shall be and shall continue to be for ever an integral portion of her majestys dominions in south africa  alas sir g wolseleys estimate of the value of a solemn pledge thus made in the name of her majesty whose word has hitherto been held to be sacred differed greatly to that of mr gladstone and his government  sir garnet wolseleys operations against secocoeni proved eminently successful and were the best arranged bit of native warfare that i have yet heard of in south africa one blow was struck and only one but that was crushing of course the secret of his success lay in the fact that he had an abundance of force but it was not ensured by that alone good management being very requisite in an affair of the sort especially where native allies have to be dealt with the cost of the expedition not counting other secocoeni war expenditure amounted to over 300000 pounds all of which is now lost to this country  another step in the right direction undertaken by sir garnet was the establishment of an executive council and also of a legislative council for the establishment of which letters patent were sent from downing street in november 1880  meanwhile the boers paying no attention to the latter proclamation for they guessed that it like other proclamations in the transvaal would be a mere brutum fulmen had assembled for another mass meeting at which they went forward a step and declared a government which was to treat with the english authorities they had now learnt that they could do what they liked with perfect impunity provided they did not take the extreme course of massacring the english they had yet to learn that they might even do that at the termination of this meeting a vote of thanks was passed to mr leonard courtney of london and other members of the british parliament it was wise of the boer leaders to cultivate mr courtney of london as a result of this meeting pretorius one of the principal leaders and bok the secretary were arrested on a charge of treason and underwent a preliminary examination but as the secretary of state sir m hicks beach looked rather timidly on the proceeding and the local authorities were doubtful of securing a verdict the prosecution was abandoned and necessarily did more harm than good being looked upon as another proof of the impotence of the government  shortly afterwards sir g wolseley changed his tactics and instead of attempting to imprison pretorius offered him a seat on the executive council with a salary attached this was a much more sensible way of dealing with him and he at once rose to the bait stating his willingness to join the government after a while but that he could not publicly do so at the moment lest he should lose his influence with those who were to be brought round through him it does not however appear that mr pretorius ever did actually join the executive probably because he found public opinion too strong to allow him to do so  in december 1879 a new light broke upon the boers for in the previous month mr gladstone had been delivering his noted attack on the policy of the conservative government those midlothian speeches did harm it is said in many parts of the world but i venture to think that they have proved more mischievous in south africa than anywhere else at any rate they have borne fruit sooner it is not to be supposed that mr gladstone really cared anything about the transvaal or its independence when he was denouncing the hideous outrage that had been perpetrated by the conservative government in annexing it on the contrary as he acquiesced in the annexation at the time when lord kimberley stated that it was evidently unavoidable and declined to rescind it when he came into power it is to be supposed that he really approved of it or at the least looked on it as a necessary evil however this may be any stick will do to beat a dog with and the transvaal was a convenient point on which to attack the government he probably neither knew nor cared what effect his reckless words might have on ignorant boers thousands of miles away and yet humanly speaking many a man would have been alive and strong today whose bones now whiten the african veldt had those words never been spoken then for the first time the boers learnt that if they played their cards properly and put on sufficient pressure they would in the event of the liberal party coming to office have little difficulty in coercing it as they wished  there was a fair chance at the time of the utterance of the midlothian speeches that the agitation would by degrees die away sir g wolseley had succeeded in winning over pretorius and the boers in general were sick of mass meetings indeed a memorial was addressed to sir g wolseley by a number of boers in the potchefstroom district protesting against the maintenance of the movement against her majestys rule which considering the great amount of intimidation exercised by the malcontents may be looked upon as a favourable sign  but when it slowly came to be understood among the boers that a great english minister had openly espoused their cause and that he would perhaps soon be allpowerful the moral gain to them was incalculable they could now go to the doubting ones and saywe must be right about the matter because putting our own feelings out of the question the great gladstone says we are we find the committee of the boer malcontents at their meeting in march 1880 reading a letter to mr gladstone in which he was thanked for the great sympathy shown to their fate and a hope expressed that if he succeeded in getting power he would not forget them in fact a charming unanimity prevailed between our great minister and the boer rebels for their interests were the same the overthrow of the conservative government if however every leader of the opposition were to intrigue or countenance intrigues with those who are seeking to undermine the authority of her majesty whether they be boers or irishmen in order to help himself to power the country might suffer in the long run  but whatever feelings may have prompted her majestys opposition the home government and their agent sir garnet wolseley blew no uncertain blast if we may judge from their words and actions thus we find sir garnet speaking as follows at a banquet given in his honour at pretoria  i am told that these men the boers are told to keep on agitating in this way for a change of government in england may give them again the old order of things nothing can show greater ignorance of english politics than such an idea i tell you that there is no government whig or tory liberal conservative or radical who would dare under any circumstances to give back this country they would not dare because the english people would not allow them to give back the country what would it mean to give it back to external danger to the danger of attack by hostile tribes on its frontier and who if the english government were removed for one day would make themselves felt the next not an official of government paid for months it would mean national bankruptcy no taxes being paid the same thing recurring again which had existed before would mean danger without anarchy and civil war within every possible misery the strangulation of trade and the destruction of property  it is very amusing to read this passage by the light of after events on other occasions sir garnet wolseley will probably not be quite so confident as to the future when it is to be controlled by a radical government  this explicit and straightforward statement of sir garnets produced a great effect on the loyal inhabitants of the transvaal which was heightened by the publication of the following telegram from the secretary of stateyou may fully confirm explicit statements made from the time to time as to inability of her majestys government to entertain any proposal for withdrawal of the queens sovereignty  on the faith of these declarations many englishmen migrated to the transvaal and settled there whilst those who were in the country now invested all their means being confident that they would not lose their property through its being returned to the boers the excitement produced by mr gladstones speeches began to quiet down and be forgotten for the time arrear taxes were paid up by the malcontents and generally the aspect of affairs was such in sir garnet wolseleys opinion as justified him in writing in april 1880 to the secretary of state expressing his belief that the agitation was dying out indeed so sanguine was he on that point that he is reported to have advised the withdrawal of the cavalry regiment stationed in the territory a piece of economy that was one of the immediate causes of the revolt  the reader will remember the financial condition of the country at the time of the annexation which was one of utter bankruptcy after three years of british rule however we find notwithstanding the constant agitation that had been kept up that the total revenue receipts for the first quarter of 1879 and 1880 amounted to 22773 pounds and 44982 pounds respectively that is to say that during the last year of british rule the revenue of the country more than doubled itself and amounted to about 160000 pounds ayear taking the quarterly returns at the low average of 40000 pounds it must however be remembered that this sum would have been very largely increased in subsequent years most probably doubled at any rate the revenue would have been amply sufficient to make the province one of the most prosperous in south africa and to have enabled it to shortly repay all debts due to the british government and further to provide for its own defence trade also which in april 1877 was completely paralysed had increased enormously so early as the middle of 1879 the committee of the transvaal chamber of commerce pointed out in a resolution adopted by them that the trade of the country had in two years risen from almost nothing to the considerable sum of two millions sterling per annum and that it was entirely in the hands of those favourable to british rule they also pointed out that more than half the land tax was paid by englishmen or other europeans adverse to boer government land too had risen greatly in value of which i can give the following instance about a year after the annexation i together with a friend bought a little property on the outskirts of pretoria which with a cottage we put up on it cost some 300 pounds just before the rebellion we fortunately determined to sell it and had no difficulty in getting 650 pounds for it i do not believe that it would now fetch a fifty pound note        in blue book no c 2866 of september 1881 which is      descriptive of various events connected with the boer      rising is published as an appendix a despatch from sir      garnet wolseley dated october 1879 this despatch declares      the writers opinion that the boer discontent is on the      increase its publication thusapropos des bottesnearly      two years after it was written is rather an amusing      incident it certainly gives one the idea that sir garnet      wolseley fearing that his reputation for infallibility      might be attacked by scoffers for not having foreseen the      boer rebellion and perhaps uneasily conscious of other      despatches very different in tenor and subsequent in date      and mindful of the withdrawal of the cavalry regiment by      his advice had caused it to be tacked on to the blue book      as a documentary i told you so and a proof that whoever      else was blinded he foresaw it contains however the      following remarkable passageeven were it not impossible      for many other reasons to contemplate a withdrawal of our      authority from the transvaal the position of insecurity in      which we should leave this loyal and important section of      the community the english inhabitants by exposing them to      the certain retaliation of the boers would constitute in      my opinion an insuperable obstacle to retrocession      subjected to the same danger moreover would be those of      the boers whose superior intelligence and courageous      character has rendered them loyal to our government       as the government took the trouble to publish the despatch      it is a pity that they did not think fit to pay more      attention to its contents  i cannot conclude this chapter better than by drawing attention to a charming specimen of the correspondence between the boer leaders and their friend mr courtney the letter in question which is dated 26th june purports to be written by messrs kruger and joubert but it is obvious that it owes its origin to some member or members of the dutch party at the cape from whence indeed it is written this is rendered evident both by its general style and also by the use of such terms as satrap and by references to napoleon iii and cayenne about whom messrs kruger and joubert know no more than they do of peru and the incas  after alluding to former letters the writers blow a blast of triumph over the downfall of the conservative government and then make a savage attack on the reputation of sir bartle frere the stubborn satrap is throughout described as a liar and every bad motive imputed to him really the fact that mr courtney should encourage such epistles as this is enough to give colour to the boast made by some of the leading boers after the war that they had been encouraged to rebel by a member of the british government  at the end of this letter and on the same page of the blue book is printed the telegram recalling sir bartle frere dated 1st august 1880 it really reads as though the second document was consequent to the first one thing is very clear the feelings of her majestys new government towards sir bartle frere differed only in the method of their expression from those set forth by the boer leaders in their letter to mr courtney whilst their object namely to be rid of him was undoubtedly identical with that of the dutch

tactics  when the liberal ministry became an accomplished fact instead of a happy possibility mr gladstone did not find it convenient to adopt the line of policy with reference to the transvaal that might have been expected from his utterances whilst leader of the opposition on the contrary he declared in parliament that the annexation could not be cancelled and on the 8th june 1880 we find him in answer to a boer petition written with the object of inducing him to act up to the spirit of his words and rescind the annexation writing thuslooking to all circumstances both of the transvaal and the rest of south africa and to the necessity of preventing a renewal of disorders which might lead to disastrous consequences not only to the transvaal but to the whole of south africa our judgment is that the queen cannot be advised to relinquish her sovereignty over the transvaal but consistently with the maintenance of that sovereignty we desire that the white inhabitants of the transvaal should without prejudice to the rest of the population enjoy the fullest liberty to manage their local affairs we believe that this liberty may be most easily and promptly conceded to the transvaal as a member of a south african confederation  unless words have lost their signification this passage certainly means that the transvaal must remain a british colony but that england will be prepared to grant it responsible government more especially if it will consent to a confederation scheme mr gladstone however in a communication dated 1st june 1881 and addressed to the unfortunate transvaal loyals for whom he expresses respect and sympathy interprets his meaning thus it is stated as i observe that a promise was given to me that the transvaal should never be given back there is no mention of the terms or date of this promise if the reference be to my letter of 8th june 1880 to messrs kruger and joubert i do not think the language of that letter justifies the description given nor am i sure in what manner or to what degree the fullest liberty to manage their local affairs which i then said her majestys government desired to confer on the white population of the transvaal differs from the settlement now about being made in its bearing on the interests of those whom your committee represents  such twisting of the meaning of words would in a private person be called dishonest it will also occur to most people that mr gladstone might have spared the deeply wronged and loyal subjects of her majesty whom he was addressing the taunt he levels at them in the second paragraph i have quoted if asked he would no doubt say that he had not the slightest intention of laughing at them but when he deliberately tells them that it makes no difference to their interests whether they remain her majestys subjects under a responsible government or become the servants of men who were but lately in arms against them and her majestys authority he is either mocking them or offering an insult to their understandings  by way of comment on his remarks i may add that he had in a letter replying to a petition from these same loyal inhabitants addressed to him in may 1880 informed them that he had already told the boer representatives that the annexation could not be rescinded although mr gladstone is undoubtedly the greatest living master of the art of getting two distinct and opposite sets of meanings out of one set of words it would try even his ingenuity to make out to the satisfaction of an impartial mind that he never gave any pledge about the retention of the transvaal  indeed it is from other considerations clear that he had no intention of giving up the country to the boers whose cause he appears to have taken up solely for electioneering purposes had he meant to do so he would have carried out his intention on succeeding to office and indeed as things have turned out it is deeply to be regretted that he did not for bad as such a step would have been it would at any rate have had a better appearance than our ultimate surrender after three defeats it would also have then been possible to secure the repayment of some of the money owing to this country and to provide for the proper treatment of the natives and the compensation of the loyal inhabitants who could no longer live there since it must naturally have been easier to make terms with the boers before they had defeated our troops  on the other hand we should have missed the grandest and most soulstirring display of radical theories practically applied that has as yet lightened the darkness of this country but although mr gladstone gave his official decision against returning the country there seems to be little doubt that communications on the subject were kept up with the boer leaders through some prominent members of the radical party whom it was said went so far as to urge the boers to take up arms against us when mr white came to this country on behalf of the loyalists after the surrender he stated that this was so at a public meeting and said further that he had in his possession proofs of his statements he even went so far as to name the gentleman he accused and to challenge him to deny it i have not been able to gather that mr whites statements were contradicted  however this may be after a pause agitation in the transvaal suddenly recommenced with redoubled vigour it began through a man named bezuidenhout who refused to pay his taxes thereupon a waggon was seized in execution under the authority of the court and put up to auction but its sale was prevented by a crowd of rebel boers who kicked the auctioneer off the waggon and dragged the vehicle away this was on the 11th november 1880 when this intelligence reached pretoria sir owen lanyon sent down a few companies of the 21st regiment under the command of major thornhill to support the landdrost in arresting the rioters and appointed captain raaf cmg to act as special messenger to the landdrosts court at potchefstroom with authority to enrol special constables to assist him to carry out the arrests on arrival at potchefstroom captain raaf found that without an armed force it was quite impossible to effect any arrest on the 26th november sir owen lanyon realising the gravity of the situation telegraphed to sir george colley asking that the 58th regiment should be sent back to the transvaal sir george replied that he could ill spare it on account of daily expected outbreak of pondos and possible appeal for help from cape colony and that the government must be supported by the loyal inhabitants  it will be seen that the boers had with some astuteness chosen a very favourable time to commence operations the hands of the cape government were full with the basutu war so no help could be expected from it sir g wolseley had sent away the only cavalry regiment that remained in the country and lastly sir owen lanyon had quite recently allowed a body of 300 trained volunteers mostly if not altogether drawn from among the loyalists to be raised for service in the basutu war a serious drain upon the resources of a country so sparsely populated as the transvaal  meanwhile a mass meeting had been convened by the boers for the 8th january to consider mr gladstones letter but the bezuidenhout incident had the effect of putting forward the date of assembly by a month and it was announced that it would be held on the 8th december subsequently the date was shifted to the 15th and then back again to the 8th every effort was made by threats of future vengeance to secure the presence of as many burghers as possible attempts were also made to persuade the native chiefs to send representatives and to promise to join in an attack on the english these entirely failed the meeting was held at a place called paarde kraal and resulted in the sudden declaration of the republic and the appointment of the famous triumvirate kruger joubert and pretorius it then moved into heidelberg a little town about sixty miles from pretoria and on the 16th december the republic was formally proclaimed in a long proclamation containing a summary of the events of the few preceding years and declaring the arrangements the malcontents were willing to make with the english authorities the terms offered in this document are almost identical with those finally accepted by her majestys government with the exception that in the proclamation of the 16th december the boer leaders declare their willingness to enter into confederation and to guide their native policy by general rules adopted in concurrence with the colonies and states of south africa this was a more liberal offer than that which we ultimately agreed to but then the circumstances had changed  this proclamation was forwarded to sir owen lanyon with a covering letter in which the following words occurwe declare in the most solemn manner that we have no desire to spill blood and that from our side we do not wish war it lies in your hands to force us to appeal to arms in selfdefence     we expect your answer within twice twentyfour hours  i beg to direct particular attention to these paragraphs as they have a considerable interest in view of what followed  the letter and proclamation reached government house pretoria at 1030 on the evening of friday the 17th december sir owen lanyons proclamation written in reply was handed to the messenger at noon on sunday 19th december or within about thirtysix hours of his arrival and could hardly have reached the rebel camp sixty miles off before dawn the next day the 20th december on which day at about one oclock a detachment of the 94th was ambushed and destroyed on the road between middelburg and pretoria about eighty miles off by a force despatched from heidelburg for that purpose some days before on the 16th december or the same day on which the triumvirate had despatched the proclamation to pretoria containing their terms and expressing in the most solemn manner that they had no desire to shed blood a large boer force was attacking potchefstroom  so much then for the sincerity of the professions of their desire to avoid bloodshed  the proclamation sent by sir o lanyon in reply recited in its preamble the various acts of which the rebels had been guilty including that of having wickedly sought to incite the said loyal native inhabitants throughout the province to take up arms against her majestys government announced that matters had now been put into the hands of the officer commanding her majestys troops and promised pardon to all who would disperse to their homes  it was at potchefstroom which town had all along been the nursery of the rebellion that actual hostilities first broke out potchefstroom as a town is much more boer in its sympathies than pretoria which is or rather was almost purely english sir owen lanyon had as stated before sent a small body of soldiers thither to support the civil authorities and had also appointed major clarke cmg an officer of noted coolness and ability to act as special commissioner for the district  major clarkes first step was to try in conjunction with captain raaf to raise a corps of volunteers in which he totally failed those of the townsfolk who were not boers at heart had too many business relations with the surrounding farmers and perhaps too little faith in the stability of english rule after mr gladstones utterances to allow them to indulge in patriotism at the time of the outbreak between seventy and eighty thousand sterling was owing to firms in potchefstroom by neighbouring boers a sum amply sufficient to account for their lukewarmness in the english cause subsequent events have shown that the potchefstroom shopkeepers were wise in their generation  on the 15th december a large number of boers came into the town and took possession of the printingoffice in order to print the proclamation already alluded to major clarke made two attempts to enter the office and see the leaders but without success  on the 16th a boer patrol fired on some of the mounted infantry and the fire was returned these were the first shots fired during the war and they were fired by boers orders were thereupon signalled to clarke by lieutenantcolonel winsloe 21st regiment now commanding at the fort which he afterwards defended so gallantly that he was to commence firing clarke was in the landdrosts office on the market square with a force of about twenty soldiers under captain falls and twenty civilians under captain raaf cmg a position but illsuited for defensive purposes from whence fire was accordingly opened the boers taking up positions in the surrounding houses commanding the office shortly after the commencement of the fighting captain falls was shot dead whilst talking to major clarke the latter having a narrow escape a bullet grazing his head just above the ear the fighting continued during the 17th and till the morning of the 18th when the boers succeeded in firing the roof which was of thatch by throwing fireballs on to it major clarke then addressed the men telling them that though personally he did not care about his own life he did not see that they could serve any useful purpose by being burned alive so he should surrender which he did with a loss of about six killed and wounded the camp meanwhile had repulsed with loss the attack made on it and was never again directly attacked  whilst these events were in progress at potchefstroom a much more awful tragedy was in preparation on the road between middelburg and pretoria  on the 23rd november colonel bellairs at the request of sir owen lanyon directed a concentration on pretoria of most of the few soldiers that there were in the territory in view of the disturbed condition of the country in accordance with these orders colonel anstruther marched from lydenburg a town about 180 miles from pretoria on the 5th december with the headquarters and two companies of the 94th regiment being a total of 264 men three women and two children and the disproportionately large train of thirtyfour oxwaggons or an oxwaggon capable of carrying five thousand pounds weight to every eight persons and here i may remark that it is this enormous amount of baggage without which it appears to be impossible to move the smallest body of men that renders infantry regiments almost useless for service in south africa except for garrisoning purposes both zulus and boers can get over the ground at thrice the pace possible to the unfortunate soldier and both races despise them accordingly the zulus call our infantry pack oxen in this particular instance colonel anstruthers defeat or rather annihilation is to a very great extent referable to his enormous baggage train since in the first place had he not lost valuable days in collecting more waggons he would have been safe in pretoria before danger arose it must also be acknowledged that his arrangements on the line of march were somewhat reckless though it can hardly be said that he was ignorant of his danger thus we find that colonel bellairs wrote to colonel anstruther warning him of the probability of an attack and impressing on him the necessity of keeping a good lookout the letter being received and acknowledged by the latter on the 17th december  to this warning was added a still more impressive one that came to my knowledge privately a gentleman well known to me received on the morning after the troops had passed through the town of middelburg on their way to pretoria a visit from an old boer with whom he was on friendly terms who had purposely come to tell him that a large patrol was out to ambush the troops on the pretoria road my informant having convinced himself of the truth of the statement at once rode after the soldiers and catching them up some distance from middelburg told colonel anstruther what he had heard imploring him he said with all the energy he could command to take better precautions against surprise the colonel however laughed at his fears and told him that if the boers came he would frighten them away with the big drum  at one oclock on sunday the 20th december the column was marching along about a mile and a half from a place known as bronkers spruit and thirtyeight miles from pretoria when suddenly a large number of mounted boers were seen in loose formation on the left side of the road the band was playing at the time and the column was extended over more than half a mile the rearguard being about a hundred yards behind the last waggon the band stopped playing on seeing the boers and the troops halted when a man was seen advancing with a white flag whom colonel anstruther went out to meet accompanied by conductor egerton a civilian they met about one hundred and fifty yards from the column and the man gave colonel anstruther a letter which announced the establishment of the south african republic stated that until they heard lanyons reply to their proclamation they did not know if they were at war or not that consequently they could not allow any movements of troops which would be taken as a declaration of war this letter was signed by joubert one of the triumvirate colonel anstruther replied that he was ordered to pretoria and to pretoria he must go  whilst this conference was going on the boers of whom there were quite five hundred had gradually closed round the column and took up positions behind rocks and trees which afforded them excellent cover whilst the troops were on a bare plain and before colonel anstruther reached his men a murderous fire was poured in upon them from all sides the fire was hotly returned by the soldiers most of the officers were struck down by the first volley having no doubt been picked out by the marksmen the firing lasted about fifteen minutes and at the end of that time seven out of the nine officers were down killed and wounded an eighth captain elliot one of two who escaped untouched being reserved for an even more awful fate the majority of the men were also down and had the hail of lead continued much longer it is clear that nobody would have been left colonel anstruther who was lying badly wounded in five places seeing what a hopeless state affairs were in ordered the bugler to sound the cease firing and surrendered one of the three officers who were not much hurt was most providentially dr ward who had but a slight wound in the thigh all the others except captain elliot and one lieutenant were either killed or died from the effects of their wounds there were altogether 56 killed and 101 wounded including a woman mrs fox twenty more afterwards died of their wounds the boer loss appears to have been very small  after the fight conductor egerton with a sergeant was allowed to walk into pretoria to obtain medical assistance the boers refusing to give him a horse or even to allow him to use his own the boer leader also left dr ward eighteen men and a few stores for the wounded with which he made shift as best he could nobody can read this gentlemans report without being much impressed with the way in which though wounded himself he got through his terrible task of without assistance attending to the wants of 101 sufferers beginning the task at two pm it took him till six the next morning before he had seen the last man it is to be hoped that his services have met with some recognition dr ward remained near the scene of the massacre with his wounded men till the declaration of peace when he brought them down to maritzburg having experienced great difficulty in obtaining food for them during so many weeks  this is a short account of what i must with reluctance call a most cruel and carefully planned massacre i may mention that a zulu driver who was with the rearguard and escaped into natal stated that the boers shot all the wounded men who formed that body his statement was to a certain extent borne out by the evidence of one of the survivors who stated that all the bodies found in that part of the field nearly threequarters of a mile away from the head of the column had a bullet hole through the head or breast in addition to their other wounds  the administrator in the transvaal in council thus comments on the occurrence in an official minutethe surrounding and gradual hemming in under a flag of truce of a force and the selection of spots from which to direct their fire as in the case of the unprovoked attack by the rebels upon colonel anstruthers force is a proceeding of which very few like incidents can be mentioned in the annals of civilised warfare  the boer leaders however were highly elated at their success and celebrated it in a proclamation of which the following is an extractinexpressible is the gratitude of the burghers for this blessing conferred on them thankful to the brave general f joubert and his men who have upheld the honour of the republic on the battlefield bowed down in the dust before almighty god who had thus stood by them and with a loss of over a hundred of the enemy only allowed two of ours to be killed  in view of the circumstances of the treacherous hemming in and destruction of this small body of unprepared men most people would think this language rather highflown not to say blasphemous  on the news of this disaster reaching pretoria sir owen lanyon issued a proclamation placing the country under martial law as the town was large straggling and incapable of defence all the inhabitants amounting to over four thousand souls were ordered up to camp where the best arrangements possible were made for their convenience in these quarters they remained for three months driven from their comfortable homes and cheerfully enduring all the hardships want and discomforts consequence on their position whilst they waited in patience for the appearance of that relieving column that never came people in england hardly understand what these men and women went through because they chose to remain loyal let them suppose that all the inhabitants of an ordinary english town with the exception of the class known as poor people which can hardly be said to exist in a colony were at an hours notice orderedall the aged and the sick delicate women and tiny childrento leave their homes to the mercy of the enemy and crowd up in a little space under shelter of a fort with nothing but canvas tents or sheds to cover them from the fierce summer suns and rains and the coarsest rations to feed them whilst the husbands and brothers were daily engaged with a cunning and dangerous enemy and sometimes brought home wounded or dead they will then have some idea of what was gone through by the loyal people of pretoria in their weak confidence in the good faith of the english government  the arrangements made for the defence of the town were so ably and energetically carried out by sir owen lanyon assisted by the military officers that no attack upon it was ever attempted it seems to me that the organisation that could provide for the penning up of four thousand people for months and carry it out without the occurrence of a single unpleasantness or expression of discontent must have had something remarkable about it of course it would have been impossible without the most loyal cooperation on the part of those concerned indeed everybody in the town lent a helping hand judges served out rations members of the executive inspected nuisances and so forth there was only one instance of striking and then of all people in the world it was the five civil doctors who thinking it a favourable opportunity to fleece the government combined to demand five guineas aday each for their services i am glad to say that they did not succeed in their attempt at extortion  on the 23d december the boer leaders issued a second proclamation in reply to that of sir o lanyon of the 18th which is characterised by an utter absence of regard for the truth being in fact nothing but a tissue of impudent falsehoods it accuses sir o lanyon of having bombarded women and children of arming natives against the boers and of firing on the boers without declaring war not one of these accusations has any foundation in fact as the boers well knew but they also knew that sir owen being shut up in pretoria was not in a position to rebut their charges which they hoped might to some extent be believed and create sympathy for them in other parts of the world this was the reason for the issue of the proclamation which well portrays the character of its framers  life at pretoria was varied by occasional sorties against the boer laagers situated at different points in the neighbourhood generally about six or eight miles from the town these expeditions were carried out with considerable success though with some loss the heaviest incurred being when the boers having treacherously hoisted the white flag opened a heavy fire on the pretoria forces as soon as they beguiled into confidence emerged from their cover in the course of the war one in every four of the pretoria mounted volunteers was killed or wounded  but perhaps the most serious of all the difficulties the government had to meet was that of keeping the natives in check as has before been stated they were devotedly attached to our rule and during the three years of its continuance had undergone what was to them a strange experience they had neither been murdered beaten or enslaved naturally they were in no hurry to return to the old order of things in which murder flogging and slavery were events of everyday occurrence nor did the behaviour of the boers on the outbreak of the war tend to reconcile them to any such idea thus we find that the farmers had pressed a number of natives from waterberg into one of their laagers zwart koppies two of them tried to run away a boer saw them and shot them both again on the 7th january a native reported to the authorities at pretoria that he and some others were returning from the diamond fields driving some sheep a boer came and asked them to sell the sheep they refused whereupon he went away but returning with some other dutchmen fired on the kafirs killing one  on the 2d january information reached pretoria that on the 26th december some boers fired on some natives who were resting outside potchefstroom and killed three the rest fled whereupon the boers took the cattle they had with them  on the 11th january some men who had been sent from pretoria with despatches for standerton were taken prisoners whilst prisoners they saw ten men returning from the fields stopped by the boers and ordered to come to the laager they refused and ran away were fired on five being killed and one getting his arm broken  these are a few instances of the treatment meted out to the unfortunate natives taken at haphazard from the official reports there are plenty more of the same nature if anybody cares to read them  as soon as the news of the rising reached them every chief of any importance sent in to offer aid to government and many of them especially montsoia our old ally in the keate award district took the loyals of the neighbourhood under their protection several took charge of government property and cattle during the disturbances and one had four or five thousand pounds in gold the product of a recently collected tax given him to take care of by the commissioner of his district who was afraid that the money would be seized by the boers in every instance the property entrusted to their charge was returned intact the loyalty of all the native chiefs under very trying circumstances for the boers were constantly attempting to cajole or frighten them into joining them is a remarkable proof of the great affection of the kafirs more especially those of the basutu tribes who love peace better than war for the queens rule the government of pretoria need only have spoken one word to set an enormous number of armed men in motion against the boers with the most serious results to the latter any other government in the world would in its extremity have spoken that word but fortunately for the boers it is against english principles to set black against white under any circumstances  besides the main garrison at pretoria there were forts defended by soldiery and loyals at the following placespotchefstroom rustenburg lydenburg marabastad and wakkerstroom none of which were taken by the boers        colonel winsloe however being short of provisions was      beguiled by the fraudulent representations and acts of the      boer commander into surrendering the fort at potchefstroom      during the armistice  one of the first acts of the triumvirate was to despatch a large force from heidelberg with orders to advance into natal territory and seize the pass over the drakensberg known as langs nek so as to dispute the advance of any relieving column this movement was promptly executed and strong boer troops patrolled natal country almost up to newcastle  the news of the outbreak followed as it was by that of the bronkers spruit massacre and captain elliots murder created a great excitement in natal all available soldiers were at once despatched up country together with a naval brigade who on arrival at newcastle brought up the strength of the imperial troops of all arms to about a thousand men on the 10th january sir george colley left maritzburg to join the force at newcastle but at this time nobody dreamt that he meant to attack the nek with such an insignificant column it was known that the loyals and troops who were shut up in the various towns in the transvaal had sufficient provisions to last for some months and that there was therefore nothing to necessitate a forlorn hope indeed the possibility of sir george colley attempting to enter the transvaal was not even speculated upon until just before his advance it being generally considered as out of the question  the best illustration i can give of the feeling that existed about the matter is to quote my own case i had been so unfortunate as to land in natal with my wife and servants just as the transvaal troubles began my intention being to proceed to a place i had near newcastle for some weeks i remained in maritzburg but finding that the troops were to concentrate on newcastle and being besides heartily wearied of the great expense and discomfort of hotel life in that town i determined to go on up country looking on it as being as safe as any place in the colony of course the possibility of sir george attacking the nek before the arrival of the reinforcements did not enter into my calculations as i thought it a venture that no sensible man would undertake on the day of my start however there was a rumour about the town that the general was going to attack the boer position though i did not believe it i thought it as well to go and ask the colonial secretary colonel mitchell privately if there was any truth in it adding that if there was as i had a pretty intimate knowledge of the boers and their shooting powers and what the inevitable result of such a move would be i should certainly prefer as i had ladies with me to remain where i was colonel mitchell told me frankly that he knew no more about sir georges plans than i did but he added i might be sure that so able and prudent a soldier would not do anything rash his remark concurred with my own opinion so i started and on arrival at newcastle a week later was met by the intelligence that sir george had advanced that morning to attack the nek to return was almost impossible since both horses and travellers were pretty nearly knocked up also anybody who has travelled with his family in summertime over the awful track of alternate slough and boulders between maritzburg and newcastle known in the colony as a road will understand that at the time the adventurous voyagers would far rather risk being shot than face a return journey  the only thing to do under the circumstances was to await the course of events which were now about to develop themselves with startling rapidity the little town of newcastle was at this time an odd sight and remained so all through the war the hotels were crowded to overflowing with refugees and on every spare patch of land were erected tents mud huts canvas houses and every kind of covering that could be utilised under the pressure of necessity to house the many homeless families who had succeeded in effecting their escape from the transvaal many of whom were reduced to great straits  on the morning of the 28th january anybody listening attentively in the neighbourhood of newcastle could hear the distant boom of heavy guns we were not kept long in suspense for in the afternoon news arrived that sir george had attacked the nek and failed with heavy loss the excitement in the town was intense for in addition to other considerations the 58th regiment which had suffered most had been quartered there for some time and both the officers and men were personally known to the inhabitants  the story of the fight is well known and needs little repetition and a sad story it is the boers who at that time were some 2000 strong were posted and entrenched on steep hills against which sir george colley hurled a few hundred soldiers it was a forlorn hope but so gallant was the charge especially that of the mounted squadron led by major bronlow that at one time it nearly succeeded but nothing could stand under the withering fire from the boer schanses and as regards the foot soldiers they never had a chance colonel deane tried to take them up the hill with a rush with the result that by the time they reached the top some of the men were actually sick from exhaustion and none could hold a rifle steady there on the bare hilltop they crouched and lay while the pitiless fire from redoubt and rock lashed them like hail till at last human nature could bear it no longer and what was left of them retired slowly down the slope but for many that gallant charge was their last earthly action as they charged they fell and where they fell they were afterwards buried the casualties killed and wounded amounted to 195 which considering the small number of troops engaged in the actual attack is enormously heavy and shows more plainly than words can tell the desperate nature of the undertaking amongst the killed were colonel deane major poole major hingeston and lieutenant elwes major essex was the only staff officer engaged who escaped the same officer who was one of the fortunate four who lived through isandhlwana on this occasion his usual good fortune attended him for though his horse was killed and his helmet knocked off he was not touched the boer loss was very trivial  sir george colley in his admirably lucid despatch about this occurrence addressed to the secretary of state for war does not enter much into the question as to the motives that prompted him to attack simply stating that his object was to relieve the besieged towns he does not appear to have taken into consideration what was obvious to anybody who knew the country and the boers that even if he had succeeded in forcing the nek in itself almost an impossibility he could never have operated with any success in the transvaal with so small a column without cavalry and with an enormous train of waggons he would have been harassed day and night by the boer skirmishers his supplies cut off and his advance made practically impossible also the nek would have been reoccupied behind him since he could not have detached sufficient men to hold it and in all probability newcastle his base of supplies would have fallen into the hands of the enemy  the moral effect of our defeat on the boers was very great up to this time there had been many secret doubts amongst a large section of them as to what the upshot of an encounter with the troops might be and with this party in the same way that defeat or even the anxiety of waiting to be attacked would have turned the scale one way victory turned it the other it gave them unbounded confidence in their own superiority and infused a spirit of cohesion and mutual reliance into their ranks which had before been wanting waverers wavered no longer but gave a loyal adherence to the good cause and what was still more acceptable large numbers of volunteerswhatever president brand may say to the contrarypoured in from the orange free state  what sir george colleys motive was in making so rash a move is of course quite inexplicable to the outside observer it was said at the time in natal that he was a man with a theory namely that small bodies of men properly handled were as useful and as likely to obtain the object in view as a large force whether or no this was so i am not prepared to say but it is undoubtedly the case that very clever men have sometimes very odd theories and it may be that he was a striking instance in point  for some days after the battle at langs nek affairs were quiet and it was hoped that they would remain so till the arrival of the reinforcements which were on their way out the hope proved a vain one on the 7th february it was reported that the escort proceeding from newcastle to the generals camp with the post a distance of about eighteen miles had been fired on and forced to return  on the 8th about midday we were all startled by the sound of fighting proceeding apparently from a hill known as scheins hoogte about ten miles from newcastle it was not know that the general contemplated any move and everybody was entirely at a loss to know what was going on the general idea being however that the camp near langs nek had been abandoned and that sir george was retiring on newcastle  the firing grew hotter and hotter till at last it was perfectly continuous the cannon evidently being discharged as quickly as they could be loaded whilst their dull booming was accompanied by the unceasing crash and roll of the musketry towards three oclock the firing slackened and we thought it was all over one way or the other but about five oclock it broke out again with increased vigour at dusk it finally ceased about this time some kafirs came to my house and told us that an english force was hemmed in on a hill this side of the ingogo river that they were fighting bravely but that their arms were tired adding that they thought they would be all killed at night  needless to say we spent that night with heavy hearts expecting every minute to hear the firing begin again and ignorant of what fate had befallen our poor soldiers on the hill morning put an end to our suspense and we then learnt that we had suffered what under the circumstances amounted to a crushing defeat it appears that sir george had moved out with a force of five companies of the 60th regiment two guns and a few mounted men to in his own words patrol the road and meet and escort some waggons expected from newcastle as soon as he passed the ingogo he was surrounded by a body of boers sent after him from langs nek on a small triangular plateau and sharply assailed on all sides with a break of about two hours from three to five the assault was kept up till nightfall with very bad results so far as we were concerned seeing that out of a body of about 500 men over 150 were killed and wounded the reinforcements sent for from the camp apparently did not come into action for some unexplained reason the boers did not follow up their attack that night perhaps because they did not think it possible that our troops could effect their escape back to the camp and considered that the next morning would be soon enough to return and finish the business the general however determined to get back and scratch teams of such mules ridinghorses and oxen as had lived through the day being harnessed to the guns the dispirited and exhausted survivors of the force managed to ford the ingogo now swollen by rain which had fallen in the afternoon poor lieutenant wilkinson the adjutant of the 60th losing his life in the operation and to struggle through the dense darkness back to camp  on the hilltop they had lately held the dead lay thick there too exposed to the driving rain and bitter wind lay the wounded many of whom would be dead before the rising of the morrows sun it must indeed have been a sight never to be forgotten by those who saw it the nighti remember wellwas cold and rainy the great expanses of hill and plain being sometimes lit by the broken gleams of an uncertain moon and sometimes plunged into intensest darkness by the passing of a heavy cloud now and again flashes of lightning threw every crag and outline into vivid relief and the deep muttering of distant thunder made the wild gloom more solemn then a gust of icy wind would come tearing down the valleys to be followed by a pelting thunder showerand thus the night wore away  when one reflects what discomfort and even danger an ordinary healthy person would suffer if left after a hard days work to lie all night in the rain and wind on the top of a stony mountain without food or even water to assuage his thirst it becomes to some degree possible to realise what the sufferings of our wounded after the battle of ingogo must have been those who survived were next day taken to the hospital at newcastle  what sir george colleys real object was in exposing himself to the attack has never transpired it can hardly have been to clear the road as he says in his despatch because the road was not held by the enemy but only visited occasionally by their patrols the result of the battle was to make the boers whose losses were trifling more confident than ever and to greatly depress our soldiers sir george had now lost between three and four hundred men out of his column of little over a thousand which was thereby entirely crippled of his staff officers major essex now alone survived his usual good fortune having carried him safe through the battle of ingogo what makes his repeated escapes the more remarkable is that he was generally to be found in the heaviest firing a man so fortunate as major essex ought to be rewarded for his good fortune if for no other reason though if reports are true there would be no need to fall back on that to find grounds on which to advance a soldier who has always borne himself so well  another result of the ingogo battle was that the boers knowing that we had no force to cut them off and always secure of a retreat into the free state passed round newcastle in free state territory and descended from fifteen hundred to two thousand strong into natal for the purpose of destroying the reinforcements which were now on their way up under general wood this was on the 11th of february and from that date till the 18th the upper districts of natal were in the hands of the enemy who cut the telegraph wires looted waggons stole herds of cattle and horses and otherwise amused themselves at the expense of her majestys subjects in natal  it was a very anxious time for those who knew what boers are capable of and had women and children to protect and who were never sure if their houses would be left standing over their heads from one day to another  every night we were obliged to place out kafirs as scouts to give us timely warning of the approach of marauding parties and to sleep with loaded rifles close to our hands and sometimes when things looked very black in our clothes with horses ready saddled in the stable nor were our fears groundless for one day a patrol of some five hundred boers encamped on the next place which by the way belonged to a dutchman and stole all the stock on it the property of an englishman they also intercepted a train of waggons destroyed the contents and burnt them numerous were the false alarms it was our evil fortune to experience for instance one night i was sitting in the drawingroom reading about eleven oclock with a door leading on to the verandah slightly ajar for the night was warm when suddenly i heard myself called by name in a muffled voice and asked if the place was in the possession of the boers looking towards the door i saw a fullcocked revolver coming round the corner and on opening it in some alarm i could indistinctly discern a line of armed figures in a crouching attitude stretching along the verandah into the garden beyond it turned out to be a patrol of the mounted police who had received information that a large number of boers had seized the place and had come to ascertain the truth of the report as we gathered from them that the boers were certainly near we did not pass a very comfortable night  meanwhile we were daily expecting to hear that the troops had been attacked along the line of march and knowing the nature of the country and the many opportunities it affords for ambuscading and destroying one of our straggling columns encumbered with innumerable waggons we had the worst fears for the result at length a report reached us to the effect that the reinforcements were expected on the morrow and that they were not going to cross the ingagaan at the ordinary drift which was much commanded by hills but at a lower drift on our own place about three miles from newcastle which was only slightly commanded we also heard that it was the intention of the boers to attack them at this point and to fall back on my house and the hills beyond accordingly we thought it about time to retreat and securing a few valuables such as plate we made our way into the town leaving the house and its contents to take their chance at newcastle an attack was daily expected if for no other reason to obtain possession of the stores collected there  the defences of the place were however in a wretched condition no proper outlook was kept and there was an utter want of effective organisation the military element at the camp had enough to do to look after itself and did not concern itself with the safety of the town and the mounted policea colonial force paid by the colonyhad been withdrawn from the little forts round newcastle as the general wanted them for other purposes and a message sent that the town must defend its own forts there were it is true a large number of ablebodied men in the place who were willing to fight but they had no organisation the very laager was not finished until the danger was past  then there was a large party who were for surrendering the town to the boers because if they fought it might afterwards injure their trade with this section of the population the feeling of patriotism was strong no doubt but that of pocket was stronger i am convinced that the boers would have found the capture of newcastle an easy task and i confess that what i then saw did not inspire me with great hopes of the safety of the colony when it gets responsible government and has to depend for protection on burgher forces colonial volunteer forces are i think as good troops as any in the world but an unorganised colonial mob pulled this way and that by different sentiments and interests is as useless as any other mob with the difference that it is more impatient of control  for some unknown reason the boer leaders providentially changed their minds about attacking the reinforcements and their men were withdrawn to the nek as swiftly and silently as they had been advanced and on the 17th february the reinforcements marched into newcastle to the very great relief of the inhabitants who had been equally anxious for their own safety and that of the troops personally i was never in my life more pleased to see her majestys uniform and we were equally rejoiced on returning home to find that nothing had been injured after this we had quiet for a while  on the 21st february we heard that two fresh regiments had been sent up to the camp at langs nek and that general wood had been ordered down country by sir george colley to bring up more reinforcements this item of news caused much surprise as nobody could understand why now that the road was clear and that there was little chance of its being again blocked a general should be sent down to do work which could to all appearance have been equally well done by the officers in command of the reinforcing regiments with the assistance of their transport riders it was however understood that an agreement had been entered into between the two generals that no offensive operations should be undertaken till wood returned  with the exception of occasional scares there was no further excitement till sunday the 27th february when whilst sitting on the verandah after lunch i thought i heard the sound of distant artillery others present differed with me thinking the sound was caused by thunder but as i adhered to my opinion we determined to ride into town and see on arrival there we found the place full of rumours from which we gathered that some fresh disaster had occurred and that messages were pouring down the wires from mount prospect camp we then went on to camp thinking that we should learn more there but they knew nothing about it several officers asking us what new shave we had got hold of a considerable number of troops had been marched from newcastle that morning to go to mount prospect but when it was realised that something had occurred they were stopped and marched back again bit by bit we managed to gather the truth at first we heard that our men had made a most gallant resistance on the hill mowing down the advancing enemy by hundreds till at last their ammunition failing they fought with their bayonets using stones and meat tins as missiles i wish that our subsequent information had been to the same effect  it appears that on the evening of the 26th sir george colley after mess suddenly gave orders for a force of a little over six hundred men consisting of detachments from no less than three different regiments the 58th 60th 92d and the naval brigade to be got ready for an expedition without revealing his plans to anybody until late in the afternoon and then without more ado marched them up to the top of majubaa great squaretopped mountain to the right of and commanding the boer position at langs nek the troops reached the top about three in the morning after a somewhat exhausting climb and were stationed at different points of the plateau in a scientific way whilst the darkness lasted they could by the glittering of the watchfires trace from this point of vantage the position of the boer laagers that lay 2000 yards beneath them whilst the dawn of day revealed every detail of the defensive works and showed the country lying at their feet like a map  on arrival at the top it was represented to the general that a rough entrenchment should be thrown up but he would not allow it to be done on account of the men being wearied with their marching up this was a fatal mistake behind an entrenchment however slight one would think that 600 english soldiers might have defied the whole boer army and much more the 200 or 300 men by whom they were hunted down majuba it appears that about 1015 am colonel steward and major fraser again went to general colley to arrange to start the sailors on an entrenchment    finding the ground so exposed the general did not give orders to entrench  as soon as the boers found out that the hill was in the occupation of the english their first idea was to leave the nek and they began to inspan with that object but discovering that there were no guns commanding them they changed their mind and set to work to storm the hill instead as far as i have been able to gather the number of boers who took the mountain was about 300 or possibly 400 i do not think there were more than that the boers themselves declare solemnly that they were only 100 strong but this i do not believe they slowly advanced up the hill till about 1130 when the real attack began the dutchmen coming on more rapidly and confidently and shooting with everincreasing accuracy as they found our fire quite ineffective  about a quarter to one our men retreated to the last ridge and general colley was shot through the head after this the retreat became a rout and the soldiers rushed pellmell down the precipitous sides of the hill the boers knocking them over by the score as they went till they were out of range a few were also i heard killed by the shells from the guns that were advanced from the camp to cover the retreat but as this does not appear in the reports perhaps it is not true our loss was about 200 killed and wounded including sir george colley drs landon and cornish and commander romilly who was shot with an explosive bullet and died after some days suffering when the wounded commander was being carried to a more sheltered spot it was with great difficulty that the boers were prevented from massacring him as he lay they being under the impression that he was sir garnet wolseley as was the case at ingogo the wounded were left on the battlefield all night in very inclement weather to which some of them succumbed it is worthy of note that after the fight was over they were treated with considerable kindness by the boers  not being a soldier of course i cannot venture to give any military reasons as to how it was that what was after all a considerable force was so easily driven from a position of great natural strength but i think i may without presumption state my opinion was to the real cause which was the villanous shooting of the british soldier though the troops did not as was said at the time run short of ammunition it is clear that they fired away a great many rounds at men who in storming the hill must necessarily have exposed themselves more or less of whom they managed to hitcertainly not more than six or sevenwhich was the outside of the boer casualties from this it is clear that they can neither judge distance nor hit a moving object nor did they probably know that when shooting down hill it is necessary to aim low such shooting as the english soldier is capable of may be very well when he has an army to aim at but it is useless in guerilla warfare against a foe skilled in the use of the rifle and the art of taking shelter  a couple of months after the storming of majuba i together with a friend had a conversation with a boer a volunteer from the free state in the late war and one of the detachment that stormed majuba who gave us a circumstantial account of the attack with the greatest willingness he said that when it was discovered that the english had possession of the mountain they thought that the game was up but after a while bolder counsels prevailed and volunteers were called for to storm the hill only seventy men could be found to perform the duty of whom he was one they started up the mountain in fear and trembling but soon found that every shot passed over their heads and went on with greater boldness only three men he declared were hit on the boer side one was killed one was hit in the arm and he himself was the third getting his face grazed by a bullet of which he showed us the scar he stated that the first to reach the top ridge was a boy of twelve and that as soon as the troops saw them they fled when he said he paid them out for having nearly killed him knocking them over one after another like bucks as they ran down the hill adding that it was alter lecker very nice he asked us how many men we had lost during the war and when we told him about seven hundred killed and wounded laughed in our faces saying he knew that our dead amounted to several thousands on our assuring him that this was not the case he replied well dont lets talk of it any more because we are good friends now and if we go on you will lie and i shall lie and then we shall get angry the war is over now and i dont want to quarrel with the english if one of them takes off his hat to me i always acknowledge it he did not mean any harm in talking thus it is what englishmen have to put up with now in south africa the boers have beaten us and act accordingly  this man also told us that the majority of the rifles they picked up were sighted for 400 yards whereas the latter part of the fighting had been carried on within 200  sir george colleys death was much lamented in the colony where he was deservedly popular indeed anybody who had the honour of knowing that kindhearted gentleman could not do otherwise than deeply regret his untimely end what his motive was in occupying majuba in the way he did has never so far as i am aware transpired the move in itself would have been an excellent one had it been made in force or accompanied by a direct attack on the nekbut as undertaken seems to have been objectless there were of course many rumours as to the motives that prompted his action of which the most probable seems to be that being aware of what the home government intended to do with reference to the transvaal he determined to strike a blow to try and establish british supremacy first knowing how mischievous any apparent surrender would be whatever his faults may have been as a general he was a brave man and had the honour of his country much at heart  it was also said by soldiers who saw him the night the troops marched up majuba that the general was not himself and it was hinted that continual anxiety and the chagrin of failure had told upon his mind as against this however must be set the fact that his telegrams to the secretary of state for war the last of which he must have despatched only about halfanhour before he was shot are cool and collected and written in the same unconcerned toneas though he were a critical spectator of an interesting scenethat characterises all his communications more especially his despatches they at any rate give no evidence of shaken nerve or unduly excited brain nor can i see that any action of his with reference to the occupation of majuba is out of keeping with the details of his generalship upon other occasions he was always confident to rashness and possessed by the idea that every man in the ranks was full of as high a spirit and as brave as he was himself indeed most people will think that so far from its being a rasher action the occupation of majuba bad generalship as it seems was a wiser move than either the attack on the nek or the ingogo fiasco  but at the best all his movements are difficult to be understand by a civilian though they may for ought we know have been part of an elaborate plan perfected in accordance with the rules of military science

met in january 1881 the government announced through the mediumship of the queens speech that it was their intention to vindicate her majestys authority in the transvaal i have already briefly described the somewhat unfortunate attempts to gain this end by force of arms and i now propose to follow the course of the diplomatic negotiations entered into by the ministry with the same object  as soon as the hostilities in the transvaal took a positive form causing great dismay among the home authorities whose paths as we all know are the paths of peaceat any price and whilst in the first confusion of calamity they knew not where to turn president brand stepped upon the scene in the character of our mutual friend and by the government at any rate was rapturously welcomed  this gentleman has for many years been at the head of the government of the orange free state whose fortunes he had directed with considerable ability he is a man of natural talent and kindhearted disposition and has the advancement of the boer cause in south africa much at heart the rising in the transvaal was an event that gave him a great and threefold opportunity first of interfering with the genuinely benevolent object of checking bloodshed secondly of advancing the dutch cause throughout south africa under the cloak of amiable neutrality and striking a dangerous blow at british supremacy over the dutch and british prestige with the natives and thirdly of putting the english government under a lasting obligation to him of this opportunity he has availed himself to the utmost in each particular  so soon as things began to look serious mr brand put himself into active telegraphic communication with the various british authorities with the view of preventing bloodshed by inducing the english government to accede to the boer demands he was also earnest in his declarations that the free state was not supporting the transvaal which considering that it was practically the insurgent base of supplies where they had retired their women children and cattle and that it furnished them with a large number of volunteers was perhaps straining the truth  about this time also we find lord kimberley telegraphing to mr brand that if only the transvaal boers will desist from armed opposition to the queens authority he thinks some arrangement might be made this is the first indication made public of what was passing in the minds of her majestys government on whom its radical supporters were now beginning to put the screw to induce or threaten them into submitting to the boer demands  again on the 11th january the president telegraphed to lord kimberley through the orange free state consul in london suggesting that sir h de villiers the chief justice at the cape should be appointed a commissioner to go to the transvaal to settle matters oddly enough about the same time the same proposition emanated from the dutch party in the cape colony headed by mr hofmeyer a coincidence that inclines one to the opinion that these friends of the boers had some further reason for thus urging sir henry de villiers appointment as commissioner beyond his apparent fitness for the post of which his high reputation as a lawyer and in his private capacity was a sufficient guarantee  the explanation is not hard to find the fact being that rightly or wrongly sir henry de villiers who is himself of dutch descent is noted throughout south africa for his sympathies with the boer cause and both president brand and the dutch party in the cape shrewdly suspected that if the settling of differences were left to his discretion the boers and their interests would receive very gentle handling the course of action adopted by him when he became a member of the royal commission went far to support this view for it will be noticed in the report of the commissioners that in every single point he appears to have taken the boer side of the contention indeed so blind was he to their faults that he would not even admit that the horrible potchefstroom murders and atrocities which are condemned both by sir h robinson and sir evelyn wood in language as strong as the formal terms of a report will allow were acts contrary to the rules of civilised warfare if those acts had been perpetrated by englishmen on boers or even on natives i venture to think sir henry de villiers would have looked at them in a very different light  in the same telegram in which president brand recommends the appointment of sir henry de villiers he states that the allegations made by the triumvirate in the proclamation in which they accused sir owen lanyon of committing various atrocities deserve to be investigated as they maintain that the collision was commenced by the authorities nobody knew better than mr brand that any english official would be quite incapable of the conduct ascribed to sir owen lanyon whilst even if the collision had been commenced by the authorities which as it happened it was not they would under the circumstances have been amply justified in so commencing it this remark by president brand in his telegram was merely an attempt to throw an air of probability over a series of slanderous falsehoods  messages of this nature continued to pour along the wires from day to day but the tone of those from the colonial office grew gradually humbler thus we find lord kimberley telegraphing on the 8th february that if the boers would desist from armed opposition all reasonable guarantees would be given as to their treatment after submission and that a scheme would be framed for the permanent friendly settlement of difficulties it will be seen that the government had already begun to water the meaning of their declaration that they would vindicate her majestys authority no doubt mr chamberlain mr courtney and their followers had given another turn to the radical screw  it is however clear that at this time no idea of the real aims of the government had entered into the mind of sir george colley since on the 7th february he telegraphed home a plan which he proposed to adopt on entering the transvaal which included a suggestion that he should grant a complete amnesty only to those boers who would sign a declaration of loyalty  in answer to this he was ordered to do nothing of the sort but to promise protection to everybody and refer everything home  then came the battle of ingogo which checked for the time the flow of telegrams or rather varied their nature for those despatched during the next few days deal with the question of reinforcements on the 13th february however negotiations were reopened by paul kruger one of the triumvirate who offered if all the troops were ordered to withdraw from the transvaal to give them a free passage through the nek to disperse the boers and to consent to the appointment of a commission  the offer was jumped at by lord kimberley who without making reference to the question of withdrawing the soldiers offered if only the boers would disperse to appoint a commission with extensive powers to develop the permanent friendly settlement scheme the telegram ends thus add that if this proposal is accepted you now are authorised to agree to suspension of hostilities on our part this message was sent to general wood because the boers had stopped the communications with colley on the 19th sir george colley replies in these words which show his astonishment at the policy adopted by the home government and which in the opinion of most people redound to his credit  latter part of your telegram to wood not understood there can be no hostilities if no resistance is made but am i to leave langs nek in natal territory in boer occupation and our garrisons isolated and short of provisions or occupy former and relieve latter lord kimberley hastens to reply that the garrisons must be left free to provision themselves but we do not mean that you should march to the relief of garrisons or occupy langs nek if an arrangement proceeds  it will be seen that the definition of what vindication of her majestys authority consisted grew broader and broader it now included the right of the boers to continue to occupy their positions in the colony of natal  meanwhile the daily fire of complimentary messages was being kept up between president brand and lord kimberley who alternatively gave sincere thanks to lord kimberley and fully appreciated the friendly spirit of president brand till on the 21st february the latter telegraphs through colley hope of amicable settlement by negotiation but this will be greatly facilitated if somebody on spot and friendly disposed to both could by personal communication with both endeavour to smooth difficulties offers his services to her majestys government and kruger and pretorius and joubert are willing needless to say his services were accepted  presently however on 27th february sir george colley made his last move and took possession of majuba his defeat and death had the effect of causing another temporary check in the peace negotiations whilst sir frederick roberts with ample reinforcements was despatched to natal it had the further effect of increasing the haughtiness of the boer leaders and infusing a corresponding spirit of pliability or generosity into the negotiations of her majestys government  thus on 2d march the boers through president brand and sir evelyn wood inform the secretary of state for the colonies that they are willing to negotiate but decline to submit or cease opposition sir evelyn wood who evidently did not at all like the line of policy adopted by the government telegraphed that he thought the best thing to do would be for him to engage the boers and disperse them vi et armis without any guarantees considering the disasters we have sustained and that he should if absolutely necessary be empowered to promise life and property to the leaders but that they should be banished from the country in answer to this telegram lord kimberley informs him that her majestys government will amnesty everybody except those who have committed acts contrary to the rules of civilised warfare and that they will agree to anything and appoint a commission to carry out the details and be ready for friendly communications with any persons appointed by the boers  thus was her majestys authority finally reestablished in the transvaal  it was not a very grand climax nor the kind of arrangement to which englishmen are accustomed but perhaps considering the circumstances and the wellknown predilections of those who made the settlement it was as much as could be expected  the action of the government must not be considered as though they were unfettered in their judgment it can never be supposed that they acted as they did because they thought such action right or even wise for that would be to set them down as men of a very low order of intelligence which they certainly are not  it is clear that no set of sensible men who had after much consideration given their decision that under all the circumstances the transvaal must remain british territory and who on a revolt subsequently breaking out in that territory had declared that her majestys rule must be upheld would have putting aside all other circumstances deliberately stultified themselves by almost unconditionally and of their own free will abandoning the country and all her majestys subjects living in it that would be to pay a poor tribute to their understanding since it is clear that if reasons existed for retaining the transvaal before the war as they were satisfied there did those reasons would exist with still greater force after a war had been undertaken and three crushing defeats sustained which if left unavenged must as they knew have a most disastrous effect on our prestige throughout the south african continent  i prefer to believe that the government was coerced into acting as it did by radical pressure both from outside and from its immediate supporters in the house and that it had to choose between making an unconventional surrender in the transvaal and losing the support of a very powerful party under these circumstances it being liberal in politics naturally followed its instincts and chose surrender  if such a policy was bad in itself and necessarily mischievous in its consequences so much the worse for those who suffered by it it was clear that the government could not be expected to lose votes in order to forward the true interests of countries so far off as the south african colonies which had had the misfortune to be made a party question of and must take the consequences  there is no doubt that the interest brought to bear on the government was very considerable for not only had they to deal with their own supporters and with the shadowy caucus that was ready to let the lash of its displeasure descend even on the august person of mr gladstone should he show signs of letting slip so rich an opportunity for the vindication of the holiest principles of advanced radicalism but also with the hydraheaded crowd of visionaries and professional sentimentalists who swarm in this country and who are always ready to take up any cause from that of jumbo or of a murderer to that of oppressed peoples such as the bulgarians or the transvaal boers  these gentlemen burning with zeal and filled with that confidence which proverbially results from the hasty assimilation of imperfect and erroneous information found in the transvaal question a great opportunity of making a noise andas in a disturbed farmyard the bray of the domestic donkey ringing loud and clear among the utterances of more intelligent animals overwhelms and extinguishes themso and with like effect amongst the confused sound of various english opinions about the boer rising rose the trumpetnote of the transvaal independence committee and its supporters  as we have seen they did not sound in vain  on the 6th of march an armistice with the boers had been entered into by sir evelyn wood which was several times prolonged up to the 21st march when sir evelyn wood concluded a preliminary peace with the boer leaders which under certain conditions guaranteed the restoration of the country within six months and left all other points to be decided by a royal commission  the news of this peace was at first received in the colony in the silence of astonishment personally i remember i would not believe that it was true it seemed to us who had been witnesses of what had passed and knew what it all meant something so utterly incredible that we thought there must be a mistake  if there had been any one redeeming circumstance about it if the english arms had gained a single decisive victory it might have been so but it was hard for englishmen just at first to understand that not only had the transvaal been to all appearance wrested from them by force of arms but that they were henceforth to be subject as they well knew would be the case to the coarse insults of victorious boers and the sarcasms of keenerwitted kafirs  people in england seem to fancy that when men go to the colonies they lose all sense of pride in their country and think of nothing but their own advantage i do not think that this is the case indeed i believe that individual for individual there exists a greater sense of loyalty and a deeper pride in their nationality and in the proud name of england among colonists than among englishmen proper certainly the humiliation of the transvaal surrender was more keenly felt in south africa than it was at home but perhaps the impossibility of imposing upon people in that country with the farrago of nonsense about bloodguiltiness and national morality which was made such adroit use of at home may have made the difference  i know that personally i would not have believed it possible that i could feel any public event so keenly as i did this indeed i quickly made up my mind that if the peace was confirmed the neighbourhood of the transvaal would be no fit or comfortable residence for an englishman and that i would at any cost leave the countrywhich i accordingly did  newcastle was a curious sight the night after the peace was declared every hotel and bar was crowded with refugees who were trying to relieve their feelings by cursing the name of gladstone with a vigour originality and earnestness that i have never heard equalled and declaring in ironical terms how proud they were to be citizens of englanda country that always kept its word then they set to work with many demonstrations of contempt to burn the effigy of the right honourable gentleman at the head of her majestys government an example by the way that was followed throughout south africa  even sir evelyn wood who is very popular in the colony was hissed as he walked through the town and great surprise was expressed that a soldier who came out expressly to fight the boers should consent to become the medium of communication in such a dirty business and indeed there was some excuse for all this bitterness for the news meant ruin to very many  but if people in natal and at the cape received the news with astonishment how shall i describe its effect upon the unfortunate loyal inhabitants in the transvaal on whom it burst like a thunderbolt  they did not say much however and indeed there was nothing to be said they simply began to pack up such things as they could carry with them and to leave the country which they well knew would henceforth be utterly untenable for englishmen or english sympathisers in a few weeks they came pouring down through newcastle by hundreds it was the most melancholy exodus that can be imagined there were people of all classes officials gentlefolk workpeople and loyal boers but they had a connecting link they had all been loyal and they were all ruined  most of these people had gone to the transvaal since it became a british colony and invested all they had in it and now their capital was lost and their labour rendered abortive indeed many of them whom one had known as well to do in the transvaal came down to natal hardly knowing how they would feed their families next week  it must be understood that so soon as the queens sovereignty was withdrawn the value of landed and house property in the transvaal went down to nothing and has remained there ever since thus a fairsized house in pretoria brought in a rental varying from ten to twenty pounds a month during british occupation but after the declaration of peace owners of houses were glad to get people to live in them to keep them from falling into ruin those who owned land or had invested money in businesses suffered in the same way their property remains neither profitable or saleable and they themselves are precluded by their nationality from living on it the art of boycotting not being peculiar to ireland  nor were they the only sufferers the officials many of whom had taken to the government service as a permanent profession in which they expected to pass their lives were suddenly dismissed mostly with a small gratuity which would about suffice to pay their debts and told to find their living as best they could it was indeed a case of vae victiswoe to the conquered loyalists        the following extract is clipped from a recent issue of      the transvaal advertiser it describes the present      condition of pretoria       the streets grown over with rank vegetation the water      furrows uncleaned and unattended emitting offensive and      unhealthy stenches the houses showing evident signs of      dilapidation and decay the side paths in many places      dangerous to pedestrians in fact everything the eye can      rest upon indicates the downfall which has overtaken this      once prosperous city the visitor can if he be so minded      betake himself to the outskirts and suburbs where he will      perceive the same sad evidences of neglect public grounds      unattended roads uncared for mills and other public works      crumbling into ruin these palpable signs of decay most      strongly impress him a blight seems to have come over this      lately fair and prosperous town rapidly it is becoming a      deserted village a city of the dead  the commission appointed by her majestys government consisted of sir hercules robinson sir henry de villiers and sir evelyn wood president brand being also present in his capacity of friend of both parties and to their discretion were left the settlement of all outstanding questions amongst these were the mode of trial of those persons who had been guilty of acts contrary to the rules of civilised warfare the question of severance of territory from the transvaal on the eastern boundary the settlement of the boundary in the keateaward districts the compensation for losses sustained during the war the functions of the british resident and other matters their place of meeting was at newcastle in natal and from thence they proceeded to pretoria  the first question of importance that came before the commission was the mode of trial to be adopted in the cases of those persons accused of acts contrary to the usages of civilised warfare such as murder the attorneygeneral for the transvaal strongly advised that a special tribunal should be constituted to try these cases principally because after a civil war in which all the inhabitants of a country with very few exceptions have taken part a jury of fair and impartial men truly unbiassed will be very difficult to get together it is satisfactory to know that the commissioners gave this somewhat obvious fact their grave consideration which according to their report resulted in their determining to let the cases go before the ordinary court and be tried by a jury because in referring them to a specially constituted court which would have done equal justice without fear or favour the british government would have made for itself among the dutch population of south africa a name for vindictive oppression which no generosity in other affairs could efface  there is more in this determination of the commissioners or rather of the majority of themfor sir e wood to his credit be it said refused to agree in their decisionthan meets the eye the fact of the matter being that it was privately well known to them that though the boer leaders might be willing to allow a few of the murderers to undergo the form of a trial neither they nor the boers themselves meant to permit the farce to go any further had the men been tried by a special tribunal they would in all probability have been condemned to death and then would have come the awkward question of carrying out the sentence on individuals whose deeds were looked on if not with general approval at any rate without aversion by the great mass of their countrymen in short it would probably have become necessary either to reprieve them or to fight the boers again since it was very certain that they would not have allowed them to be hung therefore the majority of the commissioners finding themselves face to face with a dead wall determined to slip round it instead of boldly climbing it by referring the cases to the transvaal high court cheerfully confident of what the result must be  after all the matter was much cry about little wool for of all the crimes committed by the boersa list of some of which will be found in the appendix to this bookin only three cases were a proportion of the perpetrators produced and put through the form of trial those three were the dastardly murder of captain elliot who was shot by his boer escort while crossing the vaal river on parole the murder of a man named malcolm who was kicked to death in his own house by boers who afterwards put a bullet through his head to make the job look better and the murder of a doctor named barber who was shot by his escort on the border of the free state a few of the men concerned in the first two of these crimes were tried in pretoria and it was currently reported at that time that in order to make their acquittal certain our attorneygeneral received instructions not to exercise his right of challenging jurors on behalf of the crown whether or not this is true i am not prepared to say but i believe it is a fact that he did not exercise that right though the counsel of the prisoners availed themselves of it freely with the result that in elliots case the jury was composed of eight boers and one german nine being the full south african jury the necessary result followed in both cases the prisoners were acquitted in the teeth of the evidence barbers murderers were tried in the free state and were as might be expected acquitted  thus it will be seen that of all the perpetrators of murder and other crimes during the course of the war not one was brought to justice  the offence for which their victims died was in nearly every case that they had served were serving or were loyal to her majesty the queen in no single case has england exacted retribution for the murder of her servants and citizens but nobody can read through the long list of these dastardly slaughters without feeling that they will not go unavenged the innocent blood that has been shed on behalf of this country and the tears of children and widows now appeal to a higher tribunal than that of mr gladstones government and assuredly they will not appeal in vain  the next point of importance dealt with by the commission was the question whether or no any territory should be severed from the transvaal and kept under english rule for the benefit of the native inhabitants lord kimberley acting under pressure put upon him by members of the aborigines protection society instructed the commission to consider the advisability of severing the districts of lydenburg and zoutpansberg and also a strip of territory bordering on zululand and swazieland from the transvaal so as to place the inhabitants of the first two districts out of danger of maltreatment by the boers and to interpose a buffer between zulus and swazies and boer aggression and vice versa  the boer leaders had it must be remembered acquiesced in the principle of such a separation in the preliminary peace signed by sir evelyn wood and themselves the majority of the commission however sir evelyn wood dissenting finally decided against the retention of either of these districts a decision which i think was a wise one though i arrive at that conclusion on very different grounds to those adopted by the majority of the commission  personally i cannot see that it is the duty of england to play policeman to the whole world to have retained these native districts would have been to make ourselves responsible for their good government and to have guaranteed them against boer encroachment which i do not think that we were called upon to do it is surely not incumbent upon us having given up the transvaal to the boers to undertake the management of the most troublesome part of it the zulu border besides bad as the abandonment of the transvaal is i think that if it was to be done at all it was best to do it thoroughly since to have kept some natives under our protection and to have handed over the rest to the tender mercies of the boers would only be to render our injustice more obvious whilst weakening the power of the natives themselves to combine in selfdefence since those under our protection would naturally have little sympathy with their more unfortunate brethrentheir interests and circumstances being different  the commission do not seem to have considered the question from these points of view but putting them on one side there are many other considerations connected with it which are ably summed up in their report amongst these is the danger of disturbances commenced between zulus or swazies and boers spreading into natal and the probability of the fomenting of disturbances amongst the zulus by boers the great argument for the retention of some territory if only as a symbol that the english had not been driven out of the country is however set forth in the fortysixth paragraph of the report which runs as followsthe moral considerations that determine the actions of civilised governments are not easily understood by barbarians in whose eyes successful force is alone the sign of superiority and it appeared possible that the surrender by the british crown of one of its possessions to those who had been in arms against it might be looked upon by the natives in no other way than as a token of the defeat and decay of the british power and that thus a serious shock might be given to british authority in south africa and the capacity of great britain to govern and direct the vast native population within and without her south african dominionsa capacity resting largely on the renown of her namemight be dangerously impaired  these words coming from so unexpected a source do not though couched in such mild language hide the startling importance of the question discussed on the contrary they accurately and with double weight convey the sense and gist of the most damning argument against the policy of the retrocession of the transvaal in its entirety and proceeding from their own carefully chosen commissioners can hardly have been pleasant reading to lord kimberley and his colleagues  the majority of the commission then proceeds to set forth the arguments advanced by the boers against the retention of any territory which appear to have been chiefly of a sentimental character since we are informed that the people it seemed certain would not have valued the restoration of a mutilated country sentiment in a great measure had led them to insurrection and the force of such it was impossible to disregard sir e wood in his dissent states that he cannot even agree with the premises of his colleagues argument since he is convinced that it was not sentiment that had led to the outbreak but a general and rooted aversion to taxation if he had added and a hatred not only of english rule but of all rule he would have stated the complete cause of the transvaal rebellion in the next paragraph of the report however we find the real cause of the pliability of the commission in the matter which is the same that influenced them in their decision about the mode of trial of the murderers and other questionsthey feared that the people would appeal to arms if they decided against their wishes  discreditable and disgraceful as it may seem nobody can read this report without plainly seeing that the commissioners were in treating with the boers on these points in the position of ambassadors from a beaten people getting the best terms they could of course they well knew that this was not the case but whatever the boer leaders may have said the boers themselves did not know this or even pretend to look at the matter in any other light when we asked for the country back said they we did not get it after we had three times defeated the english we did get it the logical conclusion from the facts being that we got it because we defeated the english this was their tone and it is not therefore surprising that whenever the commission threatened to decide anything against them they with a smile let it know that if it did they would be under the painful necessity of reoccupying langs nek it was never necessary to repeat the threat since the majority of the commission would thereupon speedily find a way to meet the views of the boer representatives  sir evelyn wood in his dissent thus correctly sums up the matterto contend that the royal commission ought not to decide contrary to the wishes of the boers because such decision might not be accepted is to deny to the commission the very power of decision that it was agreed should be left in its hands exactly so but it is evident that the commission knew its place and so far from attempting to exercise any power of decision it was quite content with such concessions as it could obtain by means of bargaining thus as an additional reason against the retention of any territory it is urged that if this territory was retained the majority of your commissioners    would have found themselves in no favourable position for obtaining the concurrence of the boer leaders as to other matters in fact her majestys commission appointed or supposed to be appointed to do her majestys will and pleasure shook in its shoes before men who had lately been rebels in arms against her authority and humbly submitted itself to their dicta  the majority of the commission went on to express their opinion that by giving away about the retention of territory they would be able to obtain better terms for the natives generally and larger powers for the british resident but as sir evelyn wood points out in his report they did nothing of the sort the terms of the agreement about the resident and other native matters being all consequent on and included in the first agreement of peace besides they seem to have overlooked the fact that such concessions as they did obtain are only on paper and practically worthless whilst all bona fide advantages remained with the boers  the decision of the commissioners in the question of the keate award which next came under their consideration appears to have been a judicious one being founded on the very careful report of colonel moysey re who had been for many months collecting information on the spot the keate award territory is a region lying to the southwest of the transvaal and was like many other districts in that country originally in the possession of natives of the baralong and batlapin tribes individual boers having however more suo taken possession of tracts of land in the district difficulties speedily arose between their government and the native chiefs and in 1871 mr keate lieutenantgovernor of natal was by mutual consent called in to arbitrate on the matter his decision was entirely in favour of the natives and was accordingly promptly and characteristically repudiated by the boer volksraad from that time till the rebellion the question remained unsettled and was indeed a very thorny one to deal with the commission acting on the principle in medio tutissimus ibis drew a line through the midst of the disputed territory or in other words set aside mr keates award and interpreted the dispute in favour of the boers  this decision was accepted by all parties at the time but it has not resulted in the maintenance of peace the principal chief montsoia is an old ally and staunch friend of the english a fact which the boers were not able to forget or forgive and they appear to have stirred up rival chiefs to attack him and to have allowed volunteers from the transvaal to assist them montsoia has also enlisted some white volunteers and several fights have taken place in which the loss of life has been considerable whether or no the transvaal government is directly concerned it is impossible to say but from the fact that cannon are said to have been used against montsoia it would appear that it is since private individuals do not as a rule own armstrong guns        i beg to refer any reader interested in this matter to      the letter of transvaal to the standard which i have      republished in the appendix to this book  amongst the questions remaining for the consideration of the commissioners was that of what compensation should be given for losses during the war of course the great bulk of the losses sustained were of an indirect nature resulting from the necessary and enormous depreciation in the value of land and other property consequent on the retrocession into this matter the home government declined to enter thereby saving its pocket at the price of its honour since it was upon english guarantees that the country would remain a british possession that the majority of the unfortunate loyals invested their money in it it was however agreed by the commission sir h de villiers dissenting that the boers should be liable for compensation in cases where loss had been sustained through commandeering seizure confiscation destruction or damage of property the sums awarded under these heads have already amounted to about 110000 pounds which sum has been defrayed by the imperial government the boer authorities stating that they were not in a position to pay it  in connection with this matter i will pass to the financial clauses of the report when the country was annexed the public debt amounted to 301727 pounds under british rule this debt was liquidated to the extent of 150000 pounds but the total was brought up by a parliamentary grant a loan from the standard bank and sundries to 390404 pounds which represented the public debt of the transvaal on the 31st december 1880 this was further increased by moneys advanced by the standard bank and english exchequer during the war and till the 8th august 1881 during which time the country yielded no revenue to 457393 pounds to this must be added an estimated sum of 200000 pounds for compensation charges pension allowances c and a further sum of 383000 pounds the cost of the successful expedition against secocoeni that of the unsuccessful one being left out of account bringing up the total public debt to over a million of which about 800000 pounds is owing to this country  this sum with the characteristic liberality that distinguished them in their dealings with the boers but which was not so marked where loyals were concerned the commissioners sir evelyn wood dissenting reduced by a stroke of the pen to 265000 pounds thus entirely remitting an approximate sum of 500000 pounds or 600000 pounds to the sum of 265000 pounds still owing must be added say another 150000 pounds for sums lately advanced to pay the compensation claims bringing up the actual amount now owing to england to something under half a million of which i say with confidence she will never see a single 10000 pounds as this contingency was not contemplated or if contemplated not alluded to by the royal commission provision was made for a sinking fund by means of which the debt which is a second charge on the revenues of the states is to be extinguished in twentyfive years  it is a strange instance of the proverbial irony of fate that whilst the representatives of the imperial government were thus showering gifts of hundreds of thousands of pounds upon men who had spurned the benefits of her majestys rule made war upon her forces and murdered her subjects no such consideration was extended to those who had remained loyal to her throne their claims for compensation were passed by unheeded and looking from the windows of the room in which they sat in newcastle the members of the commission might have seen them flocking down from a country that could no longer be their home those that were rich among them made poor and those that were poor reduced to destitution  the only other point which it will be necessary for me to touch on in connection with this report is the duties of the british resident and his relations to the natives he was to be invested as representative of the suzerain with functions for securing the execution of the terms of peace as regards 1 the control of the foreign relations of the state 2 the control of the frontier affairs of the state and 3 the protection of the interests of the natives in the state  as regards the first of these points it was arranged that the interests of subjects of the transvaal should be left in the hands of her majestys representatives abroad since boers are of all people in the world the most stayathome our ambassadors and consuls are not likely to be troubled much on their account with reference to the second point the commission made stipulations that would be admirable if there were any probability of their being acted up to the resident is to report any encroachment on native territory by boers to the high commissioner and when the resident and the boer government differ the decision of the suzerain is to be final this is a charming way of settling difficulties but the commission forgets to specify how the suzerains decision is to be enforced after what has happened it can hardly have relied on awe of the name of england to bring about the desired obedience  but besides thus using his beneficent authority to prevent subjects of the transvaal from trespassing on their neighbours land the resident is to exercise a general supervision over the interests of all the natives in the country considering that they number about a million and are scattered over a territory larger than france one would think that this duty alone would have taken up the time of any ordinary man and indeed sir evelyn wood was in favour of the appointment of subresidents to assist him the majority of the commission refused however to listen to any such suggestionbelieving they said that the least possible interference with the independent government of the state would be the wisest quite so but i suppose it never occurred to them to ask the natives what their views of the matter were the resident was also to be a member of a native location committee which was at some future time to provide land for natives to live on  in perusing this report it is easy to follow with more or less accuracy the individual bent of its framers sir hercules robinson figures throughout as a man who has got a disagreeable business to carry out in obedience to instructions that admit of no trifling with and who has set himself to do the best he can for his country and those who suffer through his countrys policy whilst obeying those instructions he has evidently choked down his feelings and opinions as an individual and turned himself into an official machine merely registering in detail the will of lord kimberley with sir henry de villiers the case is very different one feels throughout that the task is to him a congenial one and that the boer cause has in him an excellent friend indeed had he been an advocate of their cause instead of a member of the commission he could not have espoused their side on every occasion with greater zeal according to him they were always in the right and in them he could find no guile mr hofmeyer and president brand exercised a wise discretion from their own point of view when they urged his appointment as special commissioner i now come to sir evelyn wood who was in the position of an independent englishman neither prejudiced in favour of the boers or the reverse and on whom as a military man lord kimberley would find it difficult to put the official screw the results of his happy position are obvious in the paper attached to the end of the report and signed by him in which he totally and entirely differs from the majority of the commission on every point of importance most people will think that this very outspoke and forcible dissent deducts somewhat from the value of the report and throws a shadow of doubt on the wisdom of its provisions  the formal document of agreement between her majestys government and the boer leaders commonly known as the convention was signed by both parties at pretoria on the afternoon of the 3d august 1881 in the same room in which nearly four years before the annexation proclamation was signed by sir t shepstone  whilst this business was being transacted in government house a curious ceremony was going on just outside and within sight of the windows this was the ceremonious burial of the union jack which was followed to the grave by a crowd of about 2000 loyalists and native chiefs on the outside of the coffin was written the word resurgam and an eloquent oration was delivered over the grave such demonstrations are no doubt foolish enough but they are not entirely without political significance  but a more unpleasant duty awaited the commissioners than that of attaching their signatures to a documentconsisting of the necessity of conveying her majestys decision as to the retrocession to about a hundred native chiefs until now her majestys subjects who had been gathered together to hear it it must be borne in mind that the natives had not been consulted as to the disposal of the country although they outnumber the white people in the proportion of twenty to one and that beyond some worthless paper stipulations nothing had been done for their interests  personally i must plead guilty to what i know is by many especially by those who are attached to the boer cause considered as folly if not worse namely a sufficient interest in the natives and sympathy with their sufferings to bring me to the conclusion that in acting thus we have inflicted a cruel injustice upon them it seems to me that as they were the original owners of the soil they were entitled to some consideration in the question of its disposal and consequently and incidentally of their own i am aware that it is generally considered that the white man has a right to the black mans possessions and land and that it is his high and holy mission to exterminate the wretched native and take his place but with this conclusion i venture to differ so far as my own experience of natives has gone i have found that in all the essential qualities of mind and body they very much resemble white men with the exception that they are as a race quickerwitted more honest and braver than the ordinary run of white men of them might be aptly quoted the speech shakespeare puts into shylocks mouth hath not a jew eyes hath not a jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions in the same way i ask has a native no feelings or affections does he not suffer when his parents are shot or his children stolen or when he is driven a wanderer from his home does he not know fear feel pain affection hate and gratitude most certainly he does and this being so i cannot believe that the almighty who made both white and black gave to the one race the right or mission of exterminating or even of robbing or maltreating the other and calling the process the advance of civilisation it seems to me that on only one condition if at all have we the right to take the black mans land and that is that we provide them with an equal and a just government and allow no maltreatment of them either as individuals or tribes but on the contrary do our best to elevate them and wean them from savage customs otherwise the practice is surely undefensible  i am aware however that with the exception of a small class these are sentiments which are not shared by the great majority of the public either at home or abroad indeed it can be plainly seen how little sympathy they command from the fact that but scanty remonstrance was raised at the treatment meted out to our native subjects in the transvaal when they were to the number of nearly a million handed over from the peace justice and security that on the whole characterise our rule to a state of things and possibilities of wrong and suffering which i will not try to describe  to the chiefs thus assembled sir hercules robinson as president of the royal commission read a statement and then retired refusing to allow them to speak in answer the statement informed the natives that her majestys government with that sense of justice which befits a great and powerful nation had returned the country to the boers whose representatives messrs kruger pretorius and joubert i now said sir hercules have much pleasure in introducing to you if reports are true the native chiefs had many of them personally and all of them by reputation already the advantage of a very intimate acquaintance with all three of these gentlemen so that an introduction was somewhat superfluous  sir hercules went on to explain to them that locations would be allotted to them at some future time that a british resident would be appointed whose especial charge they would be but that they must bear in mind that he was not the ruler of the country but the government subject to her majestys suzerain rights natives were no doubt expected to know by intuition what suzerain rights are the statement then goes on to give them good advice as to the advantages of indulging in manual labour when asked to do so by the boers and generally to show them how bright and happy is the future that lies before them lest they should be too elated by such good tidings they are however reminded that it will be necessary to retain the law relating to passes which is in the hands of a people like the boers about as unjust a regulation as a dominant race can invent for the oppression of a subject people and had in the old days of the republic been productive of much hardship the statement winds up by assuring them that their interests will never be forgotten or neglected by her majestys government having read the document the commission hastily withdrew and after their withdrawal the chiefs were allowed to state their opinions to the secretary for native affairs  in availing themselves of this permission it is noticeable that no allusion was made to all the advantages they were to reap under the convention nor did they seem to attach much importance to the appointment of the british resident on the contrary all their attention was given to the great fact that the country had been ceded to the boers and that they were no longer the queens subjects we are told in mr shepstones report that they got very excited and asked whether it was thought that they had no feelings or hearts that they were thus treated as a stick or piece of tobacco which could be passed from hand to hand without question umgombarie a zoutpansberg chief said i am umgombarie i have fought with the boers and have many wounds and they know that what i say is true    i will never consent to place myself under their rule i belong to the english government i am not a man who eats with both sides of his jaw at once i only use one side i am english i have said silamba said i belong to the english i will never return under the boers you see me a man of my rank and position is it right that such as i should be seized and laid on the ground and flogged as has been done to me and other chiefs  sinkanhla said we hear and yet do not hear we cannot understand we are troubling you chief by talking in this way we hear the chiefs say that the queen took the country because the people of the country wished it and again that the majority of the owners of the country did not wish their rule and that therefore the country was given back we should like to have the man pointed out from among us black people who objects to the rule of the queen we are the real owners of the country we were here when the boers came and without asking leave settled down and treated us in every way badly the english government then came and took the country we have now had four years of rest and peaceful and just rule we have been called here today and are told that the country our country has been given to the boers by the queen this is a thing which surprises us did the country then belong to the boers did it not belong to our fathers and forefathers before us long before the boers came here we have heard that the boers country is at the cape if the queen wishes to give them their land why does she not give them back the cape  i have quoted this speech at length because although made by a despised native it sets forth their case more powerfully and in happier language than i can do  umyethile said we have no heart for talking i have returned to the country from sechelis where i had to fly from boer oppression our hearts are black and heavy with grief today at the news told us we are in agony our intestines are twisting and writhing inside of us just as you see a snake do when it is struck on the head    we do not know what has become of us but we feel dead it may be that the lord may change the nature of the boers and that we will not be treated like dogs and beasts of burden as formerly but we have no hope of such a change and we leave you with heavy hearts and great apprehension as to the future in his report mr shepstone the secretary for native affairs says one chief jan sibilo who has been he informed me personally threatened with death by the boers after the english leave could not restrain his feelings but cried like a child  i have nothing to add to these extracts which are taken from many such statements they are the very words of the persons most concerned and will speak for themselves  the convention was signed on the 3d august 1881 and was to be formally ratified by a volksraad or parliament of the burghers within three months of that date in default of which it was to fall to the ground and become null and void  anybody who has followed the course of affairs with reference to the retrocession of the transvaal or who has even taken the trouble to read through this brief history will probably come to the conclusion that under all the circumstances the boers had got more than they could reasonably expect not so however the boers themselves on the 28th september the newlyelected volksraad referred the convention to a general committee to report on and on the 30th september the report was presented on the 3d october a telegram was despatched through the british resident to his excellency w e gladstone in which the volksraad states that the convention is not acceptable  1 because it is in conflict with the sand river treaty of 1852  2 because it violates the peace agreement entered into with sir evelyn wood in confidence of which the boers laid down their arms  the volksraad consequently declared that modifications were desirable and that certain articles must be altered  to begin with they declare that the conduct of foreign relations does not appertain to the suzerain only supervision and that the articles bearing on these points must consequently be modified they next attack the native question stating that the suzerain has not the right to interfere with our legislature and state that they cannot agree to article 3 which gives the suzerain a right of veto on legislation connected with the natives to article 13 by virtue of which natives are to be allowed to acquire land and to the last part of article 26 by which it is provided that whites of alien race living in the transvaal shall not be taxed in excess of the taxes imposed on transvaal citizens  they further declare that it is infra dignitatem for the president of the transvaal to be a member of a commission this refers to the native location commission on which he is in the terms of the convention to sit together with the british resident and a third person jointly appointed  they next declare that the amount of the debt for which the commission has made them liable should be modified considering that england had already made them a present of from 600000 pounds to 800000 pounds this is a most barefaced demand finally they state that articles 15 16 26 and 27 are superfluous and only calculated to wound our sense of honour sic  article 15 enacts that no slavery or apprenticeship shall be tolerated  article 16 provides for religious toleration  article 26 provides for the free movement trading and residence of all persons other than natives conforming themselves to the laws of the transvaal  article 27 gives to all the right of free access to the courts of justice  putting the sense of honour of the transvaal volksraad out of the question past experience has but too plainly proved that these articles are by no means superfluous  in reply to this message sir hercules robinson telegraphs to the british resident on the 21st october in the following words  having forwarded volksraad resolution of 15th to earl of kimberley i am desired to instruct you in reply to repeat to the triumvirate that her majestys government cannot entertain any proposals for a modification of the convention until after it has been ratified and the necessity for further concession proved by experience  i wish to draw particular attention to the last part of this message which is extremely typical of the line of policy adopted throughout in the transvaal business the english government dared not make any further concession to the boers because they felt that they had already strained the temper of the country almost to breaking in the matter on the other hand they were afraid that if they did not do something the boers would tear up the convention and they would find themselves face to face with the old difficulty under these circumstances they have fallen back upon their temporising and unenglish policy which leaves them a backdoor to escape through whatever turn things take should the boers now suddenly turn round and declare which is extremely probable that they repudiate their debt to us or that they are sick of the presence of a british resident the government will be able to announce that the necessity for further concession has now been proved by experience and thus escape the difficulty in short this telegram has deprived the convention of whatever finality it may have possessed and made it as a document as worthless as it is as a practical settlement that this is the view taken of it by the boers themselves is proved by the text of the ratification which followed on the receipt of this telegram  the tone of this document throughout is in my opinion considering from whom it came and against whom it is directed very insolent and it amply confirms what i have previously said that the boers looked upon themselves as a victorious people making terms with those they have conquered the ratification leads off thus the volksraad is not satisfied with this convention and considers that the members of the triumvirate performed a fervent act of love for the fatherland when they upon their own responsibility signed such an unsatisfactory state document this is damning with faint praise indeed it then goes on to recite the various points of object stating that the answers from the english government proved that they were well founded the english government it says acknowledges indirectly by this answer the telegram of 21st october quoted above that the difficulties raised by the volksraad are neither fictitious nor unfounded inasmuch as it desires from us the concession that we the volksraad shall submit it to a practical test it will be observed that english is here represented as begging the favour of a trial of her conditions from the volksraad of the transvaal boers the ratification is in these words therefore it is that the raad here unanimously resolves not to go into further discussion of the convention and maintaining all objections to the convention as made before the royal commission or stated in the raad and for the purpose of showing to everybody that the love of peace and unity inspires us for the time and provisionally submitting the articles of the convention to a practical test hereby complying with the request of the english government contained in the telegram of the 13th october 1881 proceeds to ratify the convention  it would have been interesting to have seen how such a ratification as this which is no ratification but an insult would have been accepted by lord beaconsfield i think that within twentyfour hours of its arrival in downing street the boer volksraad would have received a startling answer but lord beaconsfield is dead and by his successor it was received with all due thankfulness and humility his words however on this subject still remain to us and even his great rival might have done well to listen to them it was in the course of what was i believe the last speech he made in the house of lords that speaking about the transvaal rising he warned the government that it was a very dangerous thing to make peace with rebellious subjects in arms against the authority of the queen the warning passed unheeded and the peace was made in the way i have described  as regards the convention itself it will be obvious to the reader that the boers have not any intention of acting up to its provisions mild as they are if they can possibly avoid them whilst on the other hand there is no force at hand to punish their disregard or breach it is all very well to create a resident with extensive powers but how is he to enforce his decisions what is he to do if his awards are laughed at and made a mockery of as they are and will be the position of mr hudson at pretoria is even worse than that of mr osborn in zululand for instance the convention specifies in the first article that the transvaal is to be known as the transvaal state the boer government have however thought fit to adopt the name of south african republic in all public documents mr hudson was accordingly directed to remonstrate which he did in a feeble way his remonstrance was politely acknowledged but the country is still officially called the south african republic the convention and mr hudsons remonstrations notwithstanding mr hudson however appears to be better suited to the position than would have been the case had an englishman pure and simple been appointed since it is evident that things that would have struck the latter as insults to the queen he represented and his country generally are not so understood by him in fact he admirably represents his official superiors in his capacity of swallowing rebuffs and when smitten on one cheek delightedly offering the other  thus we find him attending a boer meeting of thanksgiving for the success that had waited on their arms and the recognition of their independence where most people will consider he was out of place to this meeting thus graced by his presence an address was presented by a branch of the africander bond a powerful institution having for its object the total uprootal of english rule and english customs in south africa to which he must have listened with pleasure in it he in common with other members of the meeting is informed that you took up the sword and struck the briton with such force that the britons through fear revived that sense of justice to which they could not be brought by petitions and that the day will soon come that we shall enter with you on one arena for the entire independence of south africa ie independence from english rule  on the following day the government gave a dinner to which all those who had done good service during the late hostilities were invited the british resident being apparently the only englishman asked amongst the other celebrities present i notice the name of buskes this man who is an educated hollander was the moving spirit of the potchefstroom atrocities indeed so dark is his reputation that the royal commission refused to transact business with him or to admit him into their presence mr hudson was not so particular and now comes the most extraordinary part of the episode at the dinner it was necessary that the health of her majesty as suzerain should be proposed and with studied insolence this was done last of all the leading political toasts and immediately after that of the triumvirate notwithstanding this fact and that the toast was couched by mr joubert who stated that he would not attempt to explain what a suzerain was in what appear to be semiironical terms we find that mr hudson begged to tender his thanks to the honourable mr joubert for the kind way in which he proposed the toast  it may please mr hudson to see the name of the queen thus metaphorically dragged in triumph at the chariot wheels of the triumvirate but it is satisfactory to know that the spectacle is not appreciated in england since on a question in the house of lords by the earl of carnarvon who characterised it as a deliberate insult lord kimberley replied that the british resident had been instructed that in future he was not to attend public demonstrations unless he had previously informed himself that the name of her majesty would be treated with proper respect let us hope that this official reprimand will have its effect and that mr hudson will learn therefrom that there is such a thing as trop de zeleeven in a good cause  the convention is now a thing of the past the appropriate rewards have been lavishly distributed to its framers and president brand has at last prevailed upon the volksraad of the orange free state to allow him to become a knight grand cross of saint michael and saint georgethe same prize looked forward to by our most distinguished public servants at the close of the devotion of their life to the service of their country but its results are yet to comethough it would be difficult to forecast the details of their development one thing however is clear the signing of that document signalised an entirely new departure in south african affairs and brought us within a measurable distance of the abandonment for the present at any rate of the supremacy of english rule in south africa  this is the larger issue of the matter and it is already bearing fruit emboldened by their success in the transvaal the dutch party at the cape are demanding and the demand is to be granted that the dutch tongue be admitted pari passu with english as the official language in the law courts and the house of assembly when a country thus consents to use a foreign tongue equally with its own it is a sure sign that those who speak it are rising to power but the party looks higher than this and openly aims at throwing off english rule altogether and declaring south africa a great dutch republic the course of events is favourable to their aspiration responsible government is to be granted to natal which country not being strong enough to stand alone in the face of the many dangers that surround her will be driven into the arms of the dutch party to save herself from destruction it will be useless for her to look for help from england and any feelings of repugnance she may feel to boer rule will soon be choked by necessity and a mutual interest it is however possible that some unforeseen event such as the advent to power of a strong conservative ministry may check the tide that now sets so strongly in favour of dutch supremacy  it seems to me however to be a question worthy of the consideration of those who at present direct the destinies of the empire whether it would not be wise as they have gone so far to go a little further and favour a scheme for the total abandonment of south africa retaining only table bay if they do not it is now quite within the bounds of sober possibility that they may one day have to face a fresh transvaal rebellion only on a ten times larger scale and might find it difficult to retain even table bay if on the other hand they do i believe that all the white states in south africa will confederate of their own freewill under the pressure of the necessity for common action and the dutch element being preponderant at once set to work to exterminate the natives on general principles in much the same way and from much the same motives that a cook exterminates black beetles because she thinks them ugly and to clear the kitchen  i need hardly say that such a policy is not one that commands my sympathy but her majestys government having put their hand to the plough it is worth their while to consider it it would at any rate be in perfect accordance with their declared sentiments and command an enthusiastic support from their followers  as regards the smaller and more immediate issue of the retrocession namely its effect on the transvaal itself it cannot be other than evil the act is i believe quite without precedent in our history and it is difficult to see looking at it from those high grounds of national morality assumed by the government what greater arguments can be advanced in its favour than could be found to support the abandonment oflet us sayireland indeed a certain parallel undoubtedly exists between the circumstances of the two countries ireland was like the transvaal annexed though a long time ago and has continually agitated for its freedom the irish hate us so did the boers in ireland englishmen are being shot and england is running the awful risk of bloodguiltiness as it did in the transvaal in ireland smouldering revolution is being fanned into flame by mr gladstones speeches and acts as it was in the transvaal in ireland as in the transvaal there exists a strong loyal class that receives insults instead of support from the government and whose property as was the case there is taken from them without compensation to be flung as a sop to stop the mouths of the queens enemies and so i might go on finding many such similarities of circumstances but my parallel like most parallels must break down at last thusit mattered little to england whether or no she let the transvaal go but to let ireland go would be more than even mr gladstone dare attempt  somehow if you follow these things far enough you always come to vulgar first principles the difference between the case of the transvaal and that of ireland is a difference not of justice but of cause for both causes are equally unjust or just according as they are viewed but of mere common expediency judging from the elevated standpoint of the national morality theory however which as we know soars above such truisms as the foolish statement that force is a remedy or that if you wish to retain your prestige you must not allow defeats to pass unavenged i cannot see why if it was righteous to abandon the transvaal it would not be equally righteous to abandon ireland  as for the transvaal that country is not to be congratulated on its success for it has destroyed all its hopes of permanent peace has ruined its trade and credit and has driven away the most useful and productive class in the community the boers elated by their success in arms will be little likely to settle down to peaceable occupations and still less likely to pay their taxes which indeed i hear they are already refusing to do they have learnt how easily even a powerful government can be upset and the lesson is not likely to be forgotten for want of repetition to their own weak one  already the transvaal government hardly knows which way to turn for funds and is perhaps fortunately for itself quite unable to borrow through want of credit  as regards the native question i agree with mr h shepstone who in his report on this subject says that he does not believe that the natives will inaugurate any action against the boers so long as the latter do not try to collect taxes or otherwise interfere with them but if the boer government is to continue to exist it will be bound to raise taxes from the natives since it cannot collect much from its white subjects the first general attempt of the sort will be the signal for active resistance on the part of the natives whom if they act without concert the boers will be able to crush in detail though with considerable loss if on the other hand they should have happened during the last few years to have learnt the advantages of combination as is quite possible perhaps they will crush the boers  the only thing that is at present certain about the matter is that there will be bloodshed and that before long for instance the montsoia difficulty in the keate award has in it the possibilities of a serious war and there are plenty such difficulties ready to spring into life within and without the transvaal  in all human probability it will take but a small lapse of time for the transvaal to find itself in the identical position from which we relieved it by the annexation  what course events will then take it is impossible to say it may be found desirable to reannex the country though in my opinion that would be after all that has passed an unfortunate step its inhabitants may be cut up piecemeal by a combined movement of native tribes as they would have been had they not been rescued by the english government in 1877 or it is possible that the orange free state may consent to take the transvaal under its wing who can say there is only one thing that our recently abandoned possession can count on for certain and that is trouble both from its white subjects and the natives who hate the boers with a bitter and a wellearned hatred  the whole question can so far as its moral aspect is concerned be summed up in a few words  whether or no the annexation was a necessity at the moment of its executionwhich i certainly maintain it wasit received the unreserved sanction of the home authorities and the relations of sovereign and subject with all the many and mutual obligations involved in that connection were established between the queen of england and every individual of the motley population of the transvaal nor was this change an empty form for to the largest proportion of that population this transfer of allegiance brought with it a priceless and a vital boon to them it meantfreedom and justicefor where on any portion of this globe over which the british ensign floats does the law even wink at cruelty or wrong  a few years passed away and a small number of the queens subjects in the transvaal rose in rebellion against her authority and inflicted some reverses on her arms thereupon in spite of the reiterated pledges given to the contrarypartly under stress of defeat and partly in obedience to the pressure of advanced viewsthe country was abandoned and the vast majority who had remained faithful to the crown was handed to the cruel despotism of the minority who had rebelled against it  such an act of treachery to those to whom we were bound with double chainsby the strong ties of a common citizenship and by those claims to englands protection from violence and wrong which have hitherto been wont to command it even where there was no duty to fulfil and no authority to vindicatestandsi believewithout parallel on our records and marks a new departure in our history  i cannot end these pages without expressing my admiration of the extremely able way in which the boers managed their revolt when once they felt that having undertaken the thing it was a question of life and death with them it shows that they have good stuff in them somewhere which under the firm but just rule of her majesty might have been much developed and it makes it the more sad that they should have been led to throw off that rule and have been allowed to do so by an english government  in conclusion there is one point that i must touch on and that is the effect of the retrocession on the native mind which i can only describe as most disastrous the danger alluded to in the report of the royal commission has been most amply realised and the prevailing belief in the steadfastness of our policy and the inviolability of our plighted word which has hitherto been the great secret of our hold on the kafirs has been rudely shaken the motives that influenced or are said to have influenced the government in their act are naturally quite unintelligible to savages however clever who do believe that force is a remedy and who have seen the inhabitants of a country ruled by england defeat english soldiers and take possession of it whilst those who remained loyal to england were driven out of it it will not be wonderful if some of them say the natives of natal deduce therefrom conclusions unfavourable to loyalty and evince a desire to try the same experiment  it is however unprofitable to speculate on the future which must be left to unfold itself  the curtain is so far as this country is concerned down for the moment on the south african stage when it rises again there is but too much reason to fear that it will reveal a state of confusion which unless it is more wisely and consistently dealt with in the future than it has been in the past may develop into chaos     appendix    i  the potchefstroom atrocities c  there were more murders and acts of cruelty committed during the war at potchefstroom where the behaviour of the boers was throughout both deceitful and savage than at any other place  when the fighting commenced a number of ladies and children the wives and children of english residents took refuge in the fort shortly after it had been invested they applied to be allowed to return to their homes in the town till the war was over the request was refused by the boer commander who said that as they had gone there they might stop and perish there one poor lady the wife of a gentleman well known in the transvaal was badly wounded by having the point of a stake which had been cut in two by a bullet driven into her side she was at the time in a state of pregnancy and died some days afterwards in great agony her little sister was shot through the throat and several other women and children suffered from bullet wounds and fever arising from their being obliged to live for months exposed to rain and heat with insufficient food  the moving spirit of all the potchefstroom atrocities was a cruel wretch of the name of buskes a welleducated man who as an advocate of the high court had taken the oath of allegiance to the queen  one deponent swears that he saw this buskes wearing captain falls diamond ring which he had taken from sergeant ritchie to whom it was handed to be sent to england and also that he had possessed himself of the carriages and other goods belonging to prisoners taken by the boers another deponent whose name is omitted in the blue book for precautionary reasons swears that on the next night the patrol again came to my house accompanied by one buskes who was secretary of the boer committee and again asked where my wife and daughter were i replied in bed and buskes then said i must see for myself i refused to allow him and he forced me with a loaded gun held to my breast to open the curtains of the bed when he pulled the bedclothes half off my wife and altogether off my daughter i then told him if i had a gun i would shoot him he placed a loaded gun at my breast when my wife sprang out of bed and got between us        buskes was afterwards forced to deliver up the ring  i remember hearing at the time that this buskes who is a good musician took one of his victims who was on the way to execution into the chapel and played the dead march in saul or some such piece over him on the organ  after the capture of the court house a good many englishmen fell into the hands of the boers most of these were sentenced to hard labour and deprivation of civil rights the sentence was enforced by making them work in the trenches under a heavy fire from the fort one poor fellow f w finlay by name got his head blown off by a shell from his own friends in the fort and several loyal kafirs suffered the same fate after these events the remaining prisoners refused to return to the trenches till they had been tamed by being thrashed with the butt end of guns and by threats of receiving twentyfive lashes each  but their fate bad as it was was not so awful as that suffered by dr woite and j van der linden  dr woite had attended the boer meeting which was held before the outbreak and written a letter from thence to major clarke in which he had described the talk of the boers as silly bluster he was not a paid spy this letter was unfortunately for him found in major clarkes pocketbook and because of it he was put through a form of trial taken out and shot dead all on the same day he left a wife and large family who afterwards found their way to natal in a destitute condition  the case of van der linden is somewhat similar he was one of raafs volunteers and as such had taken the oath of allegiance to the queen in the execution of his duty he made a report to his commanding officer about the boer meeting and which afterwards fell into the hands of the boers on this he was put through the form of trial and though in the service of the queen was found guilty of treason and condemned to death one of his judges a little less stonyhearted than the rest pointed out that when the prisoner committed the crime martial law had not yet been proclaimed nor the state but it availed him nothing he was taken out and shot  a kafir named carolus was also put through the form of trial and shot for no crime at all that i can discover  ten unarmed kafir drivers who had been sent away from the fort were shot down in cold blood by a party of boers several witnesses depose to having seen their remains lying together close to potchefstroom  various other kafirs were shot none of the perpetrators of these crimes were brought to justice the royal commission comments on these acts as follows  in regard to the deaths of woite van de linden and carolus the boer leaders do not deny the fact that those men had been executed but sought to justify it the majority of your commissioners felt bound to record their opinion that the taking of the lives of these men was an act contrary to the rules of civilised warfare sir h de villiers was of opinion that the executions in these cases having been ordered by properly constituted court martial of the boers forces after due trial did not fall under the cognisance of your commissioners  upon the case of william finlay the majority of your commissioners felt bound to record the opinion that the sacrifice of finlays life through forced labour under fire in the trenches was an act contrary to the rules of civilised warfare sir h de villiers did not feel justified by the facts of the case in joining in this expression of opinion sic as to the case of the kafir andries your commissioners decided that although the shooting of this man appeared to them from the information laid before them to be not in accordance with the rules of civilised warfare under all the circumstances of the case it was not desirable to insist upon a prosecution  the majority of your commissioners although feeling it a duty to record emphatically their disapproval of the acts that resulted in the deaths of woite van der linden finlay and carolus yet found it impossible to bring to justice the persons guilty of these acts  it will be observed that sir h de villiers does not express any disapproval emphatic or otherwise of these wicked murders  but potchefstroom did not enjoy a monopoly of murder  in december 1880 captain elliot who was a survivor from the bronker spruit massacre and captain lambart who had been taken prisoner by the boers whilst bringing remounts from the free state were released from heidelberg on parole on condition that they left the country an escort of two men brought them to a drift of the vaal river where they refused to cross because they could not get their cart through the river being in flood the escort then returned to heidelberg and reported that the officers would not cross a civil note was then sent back to captains elliot and lambart signed by p j joubert telling them to pass the vaal river immediately by the road that will be shown to you what secret orders if any were sent with this letter has never transpired but i decline to believe that either in this or in barbers case the boer escort took upon themselves the responsibility of murdering their prisoners without authority of some kind for the deed  the men despatched from heidelberg with the letter found lambert and elliot wandering about and trying to find the way to standerton they presented the letter and took them towards a drift in the vaal shortly before they got there the prisoners noticed that their escort had been reinforced it would be interesting to know if these extra men were not sent to assist in the murder how and why they turned up as they did and joined themselves to the escort the prisoners were taken to an old and disused drift of the vaal river and told to cross it was now dark and the river was much swollen with rain in fact impassable for the cart and horses captains elliot and lambart begged to be allowed to outspan till the next morning but were told that they must cross which they accordingly attempted to do a few yards from the bank the cart stuck on a rock and whilst in this position the boer escort poured a volley into it poor elliot was instantly killed one bullet fracturing his skull another passing through the back a third shattering the right thigh and a fourth breaking the left wrist the cart was also riddled but strange to say captain lambert was untouched and succeeded in swimming to the further bank the boers firing at him whenever the flashes of lightning revealed his whereabouts after sticking some time in the mud of the bank he managed to effect his escape and next day reached the house of an englishman called groom living in the free state and from thence made his way to natal  two of the murderers were put through a form of trial after the conclusion of peace and acquitted  the case of the murder of dr barber is of a somewhat similar character to that of elliot except that there is in this case a curious piece of indirect evidence that seems to connect the murder directly with piet joubert one of the triumvirate  in the month of february 1881 two englishmen came to the boer laager at langs nek to offer their services as doctors their names were dr barber who was well known to the boers and his assistant mr walter dyas and they came not from natal but the orange free state on arrival at the boer camp they were at first well received but after a little while seized searched and tied up all night to a disselboom pole of a waggon next morning they were told to mount their horses and started from the camp escorted by two men who were to take them over the free state line  when they reached the free state line the boers told them to get off their horses which they were ordered to bring back to the camp they did so bade goodday to their escort and started to walk on towards their destination when they had gone about forty yards dyas heard the report of a rifle and barber called out my god i am shot and fell dead  dyas went down on his hands and knees and saw one of the escort deliberately aim at him he then jumped up and ran dodging from right to left trying to avoid the bullet presently the man fired and he felt himself struck through the thigh he fell with his face to the men and saw his wouldbe assassin put a fresh cartridge into his rifle and aim at him turning his face to the ground he awaited his death but the bullet whizzed past his head he then saw the men take the horses and go away thinking they had finished him after waiting a while he managed to get up and struggled to a house not far off where he was kindly treated and remained till he recovered  some time after this occurrence a hottentot named allan smith made a statement at newcastle from which it appears that he had been taken prisoner by the boers and made to work for them one night he saw barber and dyas tied to the disselboom and overheard the following which i will give in his own words  i went to a fire where some boers were sitting among them was a lowsized man moderately stout with a darkbrown full beard apparently about thirtyfive years of age i do not know his name he was telling his comrades that he had brought an order from piet joubert to viljoen to take the two prisoners to the free state line and shoot them there he said in the course of conversation piet joubert het gevraacht waarom was de mensche neet dood geschiet toen hulle bijde eerste laager gekom het piet joubert asked why were the men not shot when they came to the first laager they then saw me at the fire and one of them said you must not talk before that fellow he understands what you say and will tell everybody  next morning viljoen told me to go away and gave me a pass into the free state he said in dutch you must not drive for any englishmen again if we catch you doing so we will shoot you and if you do not go away quick and we catch you hanging about when we bring the two men to the line we will shoot you too  dyas who escaped made an affidavit with reference to this statement in which he says i have read the foregoing affidavit of allan smith and i say that the person described in the third paragraph thereof as bringing orders from piet joubert to viljoen corresponds with one of the boers who took dr barber and myself to the free state and to the best of my belief he is the man who shot dr barber  the actual murderers were put on their trial in the free state and of course acquitted in his examination at the trial allan smith says it was a young man who said that joubert had given orders that barber had to be shot    it was not at night but in the morning early when the young man spoke about piet jouberts order  most people will gather from what i have quoted that there exists a certain connection between the dastardly murder of dr barber and the attempted murder of mr dyas and piet joubert one of that able triumvirate of which mr gladstone speaks so highly  i shall only allude to one more murder though more are reported to have occurred amongst themthat of mr malcolm who was kicked to death by boersand that is mr greens  mr green was an english golddigger and was travelling along the main road to his home at spitzcop the road passed close by the military camp at lydenburg into which he was called on coming out he went to a boer patrol with a flag of truce and whilst talking to them was shot dead the rev j thorne the english clergyman at lydenburg describes this murder in an affidavit in the following words  that i was the clergyman who got together a party of englishmen and brought down the body of mr green who was murdered by the boers and buried it i have ascertained the circumstances of the murder which were as followsmr green was on his way to the goldfields as he was passing the fort he was called in by the officers and sent out again with a message to the boer commandant immediately on leaving the camp he went to the boer guard opposite with a flag of truce in his hand while parleying with the boers who proposed to make a prisoner of him he was shot through the head  no prosecution was instituted in this case mr green left a wife and children in a destitute condition    ii  pledges given by mr gladstones government as to the retention of the transvaal as a british colony  the following extracts from the speeches despatches and telegrams of members of the present government with reference to the proposed retrocession of the transvaal are not without interest  during the month of may 1880 lord kimberley despatched a telegram to sir bartle frere in which the following words occur under no circumstances can the queens authority in the transvaal be relinquished  in a despatch dated 20th may and addressed to sir bartle frere lord kimberley says that the sovereignty of the queen in the transvaal could not be relinquished  in a speech in the house of lords on the 24th may 1880 lord kimberley said  there was a still stronger reason than that for not receding it was impossible to say what calamities such a step as receding might not cause we had at the cost of much blood and treasure restored peace and the effect of our now reversing our policy would be to leave the province in a state of anarchy and possibly to cause an internecine war for such a risk he could not make himself responsible the number of the natives in the transvaal was estimated at about 800000 and that of the whites less than 500000 difficulties with the zulus and frontier tribes would again arise and looking as they must to south africa as a whole the government after a careful consideration of the question came to the conclusion that we could not relinquish the transvaal nothing could be more unfortunate than uncertainty in respect to such a matter  on the 8th june 1880 mr gladstone in reply to a boer memorial wrote as follows  it is undoubtedly a matter for much regret that it should since the annexation have appeared that so large a number of the population of dutch origin in the transvaal are opposed to the annexation of that territory but it is impossible now to consider that question as if it were presented for the first time we have to do with a state of things which has existed for a considerable period during which obligations have been contracted especially though not exclusively towards the native population which cannot be set aside looking to all the circumstances both of the transvaal and the rest of south africa and to the necessity of preventing a renewal of disorders which might lead to disastrous consequences not only to the transvaal but to the whole of south africa our judgment is that the queen cannot be advised to relinquish the transvaal  her majestys speech delivered in parliament on the 6th january 1881 contains the following words a rising in the transvaal has recently imposed upon me the duty of vindicating my authority  these extracts are rather curious reading in face of the policy adopted by the government after our troops had been defeated    iii  the case of indabezimbi  this is a case which came under my own notice the complainant is now a tenant of my own when indabezimbi appeared before mr cochrane and myself his appearance fully bore out his description of the assault made upon him we did everything in our power to help him to recover his son and his property but without effect the matter was fully reported to sir hercules robinson and sir e wood and a question was asked on the subject in the house of commons i append mr courtneys answer this case which is perfectly authentic will prove instructive reading as showing the treatment the kafir must expect at the hands of the boer now that he is no longer protected by us it must be remembered that the vast majority of such incidents are never heard of the kafirs suffer and are still the assault and robbery of indabezimbi took place in natal territory   statement of indabezimbi  i used to work on mr robsons sons place and on his death i went to meyers in the utrecht district of the transvaal about a year ago i took all my property with me there lived on the farm old isaac meyer solomon meyer who died during the war young isaac meyer jan meyer martinus meyer also a man called cornelius a bijwooner who loved in solomons place after he died  according to custom i sent my son to work for old isaac meyer as i lived on his place when the war began all the meyer family moved further into the transvaal my son going with them as herd i went up to klip river with them as driver where the river forms the boundary between the free state and transvaal i returned at once leaving my son with the meyers he was a small boy about twelve years of age at the termination of the war the meyers sent for me to drive them down i met them a days journey this side of klip river i asked them where my son was old isaac meyer told me he had sent him to look for horses he did not return and another boy was sent who brought the horses the horses were found close by no one went to look for my son i asked old isaac meyer for leave to go and offer a reward amongst the kafirs for my son he refused saying i must drive him home and then he would give me a pass to come back and look for him on our arrival at the farm i and my wife again applied to old isaac meyer to be allowed to go and see about my son he refused saying i must first shear the sheep i replied that he well knew that i could not shear sheep i said how can i work when my heart is sore for my son meyer said again that i must wait awhile as the rivers were full i said how could that matter seeing that both in coming and going with the waggons we crossed no rivers as he refused me a pass i started without one to seek my son on arrival at mavovos kraal i met my brother who told me that i must go no further or the boers would shoot me having no pass i returned on my return my wives told me that the meyers had come every morning to look for me with guns to shoot me telling them that it was now no longer the days for sjamboking flogging with hide whips the natives but the days for shooting them on hearing this i collected my goods and by morning had everything on the natal side of the buffalo riveron natal ground about midday martinus meyer overtook us by degazas kraal and asked me what i was doing on the natal side of the river i told him i was leaving for natal because i found it altogether too hot for me in the transvaal he said that if i came back he would make everything comfortable i refused he then attacked me with a knobkerrie and would have killed me had not one of my wives seeing that i was badly hurt knocked him down with a piece of iron martinus then mounted his horse and galloped off i then got on my horse and fled my wives hid themselves in the afternoon there came to the waggon jan meyer martinus meyer young isaac meyer and the man called cornelius they hunted all about for us with the object of shooting us as they told degazas kafirs my wives then saw them inspan the waggon and take everything away i had a waggon twelve oxen four cows and a mare also a box containing two hundred pounds in gold a telescope clothes and other things my wives found the box broken on the ground and all the contents gone forty sacks of grain belonging to me were also taken i was robbed of everything i had with the exception of the horse i escaped on the waggon was one i hired from my brother a relation the oxen were my own brothers eighty pounds of the money i got from the standard bank in newcastle for oxen sold to the owner of the store on the ingagane drift the rest i had accumulated in fees from doctoring i am a doctor amongst my own people i come now to ask you to allow me to settle on your land as a refugee  signed indabezimbi his x mark  this statement was made by indabezimbi at hilldrop newcastle natal on the seventeenth of august eighteen hundred and eightyone in the presence of the undersigned witnesses  signed h rider haggard a h d cochrane j h gay roberts  nbthe outrage of which indabezimbi has here given an account occurred within a week of the present date august 17th 1881   statement of the woman nongena wife of indabezimbi  my masters name is isaac meyer he lives in the transvaal south of utrecht we have lived on the farm about a year on the farm lived also jan meyer martinus meyer and young isaac meyer sons of old isaac meyer there was also another man on the farm whose name i do not know when the waggon went up with the meyers family to the centre of the transvaal when the late war broke out my husband drove old isaac meyers waggon and my son ungazaan also went to drive on stock after my husband had driven the waggon to its destination in the transvaal he returned to the kraal leaving his son ungazaan with the meyers after the war was over my husband was sent for by the meyers to drive back the waggons on arrival of the meyers at the farm i found my husband had returned but my son was left behind i asked my master where my son was my master replied he did not know he had sent to boy to bring up horses but he had not brought them another boy was sent who brought the horses he said he had not seen the boy ungazaan since he left to look for the horses as they had left the place the morning after the boy was missing my husband asked for a pass to go back and look for the boy meyer refused and my husband went without one to look for ungazaan my son he returned without the boy owing he said to the want of a pass my husband dared not go into the country without a pass during my husbands absence the three sons of old isaac meyer namely martinus jan and isaac came every morning to search for my husband saying we will kill him he leaves our work to go without our leave for look for the boy they came once with sjamboks but afterwards with guns saying they would kill him if they found him on hearing this my husband said we cannot then stay here longer he then went at once and borrowed a waggon and twelve

husband with a kerrie he hit him also in the mouth with his fist he hit my husband on the head with a kerrie he beat my husband on the foot when he was trying to creep away in a hut and would have killed him had not one of his wives named camgagaan hit martinus on the head with a piece of iron martinus on recovery rode away my husband also fled on a horse  i with the other wives fled and hid ourselves close by in the grass and stones presently we saw from our own hidingplace three white men armed with guns seeking for us their names were martinus meyer jan meyer and isaac meyer all three sons of old isaac meyer they sought us in vain from our hidingplace we heard the waggon driven away and later when we went back to degazas kraal they told us that the meyers had inspanned the waggon and had returned with it to the transvaal side of the buffalo river the names of those who saw the boers go away with the waggon are gangtovo capaches nomatonga nomamane and others the boers took away on the waggon that night all the last load we had brought over from the transvaal together with all our clothes and some of the sacks first brought over were loaded up all our cattle were taken and our box was broken and the 200 pounds taken away we found the pieces of the box on the ground when we came from our hidingplace we then fled the people at degazas kraal told us that the boers had said that they would return and take away that which they were forced to leave behind when they took the first load we have since heard from degaza that the boers came back again and took what remained of our property at degazas kraal degaza saw the boers take the things himself  this is all i know of the facts the assaults and robbery took place as near as i can say about fourteen days ago  signed nongena her x mark  gagaoola also wife of indabezimbi statesi have heard all that nongena has told you her words are true i was present when the assault and robbery took place  signed gagaoola her x mark  these statements were made to us at hilldrop newcastle natal on the twentysecond of august eighteen hundred and eightyone  a h d cochrane  h rider haggard  signed ayah her x mark interpreter   indabezimbi  mr alderman fowler asked the under secretary of state for the colonies whether the british resident at pretoria had brought under the notice of the transvaal government the circumstances of an outrage committed in august last by a party of boers on the person and property of a kafir named indabezimbi who was at that time residing in natal and whether any steps had been taken by the authorities of the transvaal either to institute a judicial inquiry into the matter or to surrender the offenders to the government of natal  mr courtneyon the 13th of october the british resident reported that according to promise the government has caused an investigation to be made at utrecht and informed him that the result was somewhat to invalidate the statement of indabezimbi but that the documents connected with the investigation at utrecht would speedily be forwarded to him with a view to correspondence through him with the natal government no further communication has been received it must be observed that in the absence of any extradition convention a judicial inquiry in this case is practically impossible the outrage whatever it was having been committed in natal and the offenders being in the transvaal her majestys government are taking active steps to reestablish a system of extradition in pursuance of article 29 of the convention the despatches on this subject will be given to parliament when the correspondence is completed    iv  a boer advertisement  it may be interesting to englishmen to know what treatment is meted out to such of their fellowcountrymen as have been bold enough or forced by necessity to remain in the transvaal since the retrocession the following is a translation of an advertisement recently published in the volkstem a transvaal paper and is a fair sample of what loyalists have to expect   warning  we the undersigned burghers of the ward aapies river hereby warn all loyal persons who have registered themselves with the british resident that they are not to come into our houses or into our farms and still less to offer to shake hands they can greet us at a distance on the road like kafirs and those who act contrary to this notice can expect the result   presumably the result that the englishman who takes the liberty to offer to shake hands with a boer can expect is to be beaten or murdered this notice is signed by the justice of the peace or veld cornet of the district anybody who knows the estimation in which a kafir is held by the boers will understand its peculiar insolence    v  transvaals letter to the standard  the following letter appeared in the issue of the standard of the 31st may 1882 and is dated pretoria 27th april it is signed transvaal probably because the author were he to put his name at the foot of so candid a document would find himself in much the same position as that occupied at the present moment by an irish landlord who has outraged the susceptibilities of the land league he would be rigorously boycotted and might in the event of any disturbance be made into a target the transvaal boers are very sensitive to criticism especially where their native policy is concerned i take the liberty to reprint the letter here partly because i feel sure that i will be forwarding the wishes of the writer by assisting to give publicity to his facts and partly on account of the striking and recent confirmation it affords on every point to my remarks on the same subject  sirin calling your attention to what is going on on the southwestern border of the transvaal i may possibly tell you of some things which you may already have heard of for in the present isolated condition of the country without telegraphs and with a very imperfect postal system added to the jealousy of the boer government in keeping their actions secret from the outside world it is not only very difficult to get at the truth of what is happening but the people in one portion of the country are in many cases totally ignorant of what is going on in another nevertheless i feel it incumbent on me to call the attention of the english people through your widely circulating journal to what has come under my observation with reference to the disgraceful native war which is and has been raging on the southwest border of this country  during the late boer war you may be aware of the fact that a very large number if not all of the natives were strongly in favour of the english government and only awaited the signal from it to rush upon their old oppressors but the natives although forbidden by the english government from joining with them against the boers it is hardly necessary to say that had it not been for this the war would have had a very different ending nevertheless afforded an asylum and protection to the lives and property of refugee englishmen and loyalists notable among these natives was a chief named montsiou whose tribe is situated just outside the borders of the transvaal to the southwest this chief and his people received numbers of refugees who fled to them for protection from the rapacity of the boers and watched over them and their property throughout the war for this offence the boers swore to be revenged on him and hardly was the war finished when they commenced commandeering in the potchefstroom district under the pretence of protecting their borders but with the ostensible purpose of inflicting chastisement on this loyal chief and the better to effect their purpose they allied themselves with a neighbouring chief who had some old grudge against him and by promises of assistance and hopes of plunder induced him to commence a war under cover of which they could join and thus effect the purpose they had in view  the chiefs whom the boers had instigated to harass montsiou got the worst of it and the action of the boers who were actively commandeering in the potchefstroom district under commandant cronge was brought to the notice of the royal commission through complaints made by loyal boers and resulted in an inquiry into the subject which showed that his opponent was the aggressor and was acting under the advice of and assistance from the boers the royal commission managed to patch matters up but no sooner were their labours over and the country fairly handed over to the boers than moshete and masouw instigated by the boers commenced again harassing montsiou with the avowed purpose of bringing on a war and so far succeeded as to oblige montsiou to take up arms in selfdefence  from that time forward the war has gone on increasing in dimensions until other chiefs have been drawn into it and the boer volunteers fighting against montsiou and monkoroane are almost equal in numbers to the natives the boers while doing all they can to crush montsiou on account of the protection he afforded loyalists during the late war against the english government are careful not to do it in an official way because that might cause trouble with england whereas by aiding and assisting it privately they could do quite as much without incurring responsibility you may naturally ask how i know all this and what proofs i can advance in support of it some time after the royal commission had left the country and the war had commenced again piet joubert who is commandantgeneral went down to the border with the object of putting an end to the war this i presume he did for the sake of appearances for it is well known that he entertains a strong hatred against those natives who in any way showed a partiality for british rule and when it is remembered that piet jouberts journey did not result in a cessation of hostilities but in an increase and that ever since his journey the war has increased in area and in numbers and that in no single instance has a boer volunteer been prevented from crossing the border or ammunition for use against montsiou been stopped the sincerity of his intentions may well be doubted  then again officers in the boer jagers went about pretoria endeavouring to obtain volunteers to fight against montsiou saying that they were to have some months leave from the government and that subscriptions would be raised to assist those men who had no private means this took place almost immediately after piet jouberts return from the border and while he was in pretoria and the general opinion was that he was at the bottom of it but as it became rather more public than was intended the british resident was obliged to take notice of it and the result was that the boers though in general treating the british resident with little consideration thought it wisest to carry on their operations in a more private manner more especially as their object could be attained quite as effectually in this way  while the boers are assisting moshete and masouw by every means in their power with the sole object of crushing montsiou and monkoroane another loyal chief the colonial government no doubt under instructions from home are doing their best to prevent volunteers or ammunition reaching them and have already rested men in kimberley who have been trying to raise volunteers to go to their assistance  the result of this is that the loyal chiefs are suffering under a double disadvantage for while their enemies are receiving every assistance they are blockaded on all sides and through the action of the english government in preventing them obtaining assistance are rapidly falling a prey to the boers those only who know anything of the boer method of warfare against natives will know what this means and in spite of the boer government doing all they can to keep things secret horrible tales of the cruelties perpetrated by them leak out occasionally  it seems to me a disgraceful thing and a stain on the honour of england that these loyal chiefs and their tribes should be robbed plundered and shot down like dogs simply because they afforded protection to the lives and property of englishmen during the late war and yet these things are going on and are being perpetrated on the border of englands colonies if england will not step in and insist on the boers putting a stop to this murderous war then in gods name let her not prevent these poor natives from obtaining ammunition and assistance to enable them to defend their country they succoured our countrymen and if we cannot succour them the least we can do is not to interfere to prevent them from protecting themselves  of course it suits the boer government to make out that they have nothing to do with the war and cannot prevent boer volunteers from fighting these chiefs and so long as the english government rests satisfied with these answers so long will this disgraceful state of things go on let the english government be firm however and insist on the boers taking no part in this war and it will ceasea sure proof that the boer government have the power to stop it if they have the will  not only are the boers wreaking vengeance upon montsiou and monkoroane but a friend of theirs a chief of the name of kalafin whose tribe is situated in the zeerust district transvaal has been robbed by them of everything he possessed this chief had english sympathies and as he presumed to build a wall round his town he gave the boers the excuse they wanted he was ordered to take the wall down which he did at the same time proving that he only built it to prevent his cattle straying among the huts he was then ordered to come to pretoria which he did accordingly he was then ordered to pay a fine of three thousand cattle which fine he paid no sooner was this done than the boers bent on his ruin raised the fine to ten thousand head the poor chief in vain pleaded his inability to pay it was the old story of the wolf and the lamb because he couldnt pay the boers construed it into an act of disobedience and at once ordered their men to go in and take everything he possessed this tribe is small and weak which the boers well knew eyewitnesses of what followed say it was a heartrending sight the women with children in their arms pleaded in vain to the boers to leave them something or they would starve but the latter only jeered at them what these poor people will do god only knows for the boers stripped them of every living thing they possessed and with the proceeds of this robbery the boer government intend to replenish their coffers  the british resident mr hudson it is believed shuts his eyes to many things no doubt his is a difficult position to fill and doubtless he is aware that if he reports everything to the english government the boers have it in their power to make his position anything but a pleasant one in any case the english portion of the community here while admitting his good qualities socially have little confidence in him officially  my object in writing this letter however is not so much to show what a disgraceful state the government is in as to try and awaken sympathy in the breasts of my countrymen for the cause of these loyal chiefs while the government are writing despatches to the british resident these chiefs and their people are being ruined past remedying    vi  a visit to the chief secocoeni        this paper was written just before the annexation of the      transvaal in 1877  towards the end of march i had occasion to visit the basuto chief secocoeni in his native stronghold beyond the loolu berg a range to the northeast of pretoria about 250 miles away and as this journey was typical of travelling in the wilds of south africa an account of it may prove interesting  it is perhaps necessary to explain for the benefit of those who are not acquainted with south african politics that secocoeni is the chieftain who has been at war with the late transvaal republic who drove back its forces capturing some 7000 head of cattle it is from this raid that the present state of affairs has arisen so that this obscure chief with his 9000 warriors has materially affected the future destinies of south africa negotiations of peace had been set on foot and it was in connection with these delicate matters that the journey was to be undertaken  going to secocoeni at this time of year ah said one gentleman well look here i sent five natives through that country in this same month march last year out of those five three died of the fever and the other two just got through with their lives i only tell you you know that you may take precautions this is a bad fever year however fever or no fever we had to go as it was necessary to travel rapidly we could only take four ridinghorses three for ourselves and the fourth for a zulu named lankiboy who also led a packhorse and carried an enormous knobkerry or shillelagh stuck in his buttonhole as though it were a weddingbouquet  behind our saddles were fastened our saddlebags containing a change of clothing and in front we strapped a rug and a mackintosh our commissariat consisted of four tins of potted ham and our medicinechest of some quinine cockles pills and a roll of stickingplaster which with a revolver and a huntingknife or two completed our equipment  we knew little of our route save that our destination lay due east so due east we steered after riding for about twenty miles and crossing the mahaliesburg range that stretches away north for hundreds of miles we came to a boers house where we offsaddled to feed our horses it must be understood that the boers were the one certain difficulty and one of the possible dangers to be encountered on our road for at no time are they are pleasant people to deal with and just now they are remarkably unpleasant towards englishmen  for instance at this first house we managed to get some forage for our horses before our scowling host found out who we were but not a bit could we get to eat have you no bread myn heer we have no bread to spare have you any eggs we have no eggs can you let us have some milk susan have you got any milk to give these carles fellows finally we succeeded in buying three cups of milk for a shilling as a favour and that is all we got from sunrise to sunset  riding on empty stomachs for another sixty miles over the plains we came to a boers house where we had to sleep just before we reached the door i noticed what i have often seen since some graves in a row with heaps of stones piled over them it appears that these people do not care about bring buried in consecrated ground their only anxiety being to be put in a coffin and they are generally laid to rest near to their doors there is neither railing nor headstone and no trees or flowers those green emblematic garments with which civilised people try to hide the ugliness of death i remember once seeing several graves within two or three yards of the public road so that in a year or so the waggons will be rumbling over the heads of those who lie beneath  when you ride up to a boers house the etiquette is to wait until some member of the family asks you to offsaddle and then you must go in and shake hands with every one a most disagreeable custom none of the womenwho are very plainrise to meet one they just hold out their hands this house was a fair specimen of the sort of habitation indulged in by the ordinary boer the main room was about eighteen feet square with that kind of door which allows the upper half to open whilst the lower remains shut such as is used in stables in england the flooring is made of cowdung into which peach stones are trodden at the threshold in order to prevent its wearing away the furniture consists of a deal table and some chairs rather nearly made of strips of hide fastened to a wooden frame there is no ceiling but only beams to which are fastened strips of biltong or games flesh dried in the sun out of this room open one or two more in which the whole family sleep without much attempt at privacy  sitting about the room were two or three young mothers without stockings and nursing babies in the corner on a chair made twice as large as any of the others reposed the mother of the family a woman of large size the whole house was pervaded by a sickly odour like that of a vault whilst the grime and filth of it baffle description and this was the place we had to eat and sleep in however there was no help for it the only thing to do was to light ones pipe and smoke after an hour or so supper was put upon the table consisting of a bowl full of boiled bones a small stack of mealie cobs and be it added some good breadandbutter the eating arrangements of these people are certainly very trying the other day we had to eat our dinner in a boers house with a reeking oxhide just torn from the animal lying on the floor beside us together with portions of the poor beasts head whose flesh we were eating however on this occasion we were spared the oxhide and being very hungry managed to put up with the other discomforts after a long grace our suppers were served out to us i remember i got an enormous bone with but little flesh on it which if i may form an opinion from its great size and from a rapid anatomical survey must have been the tibia of an ox a young boer sat opposite to mea wonderful fellow he got through several mealie cobs and large ones too whilst i was eating half a one his method was peculiar and shows what practice can do he shoved a mealie cob into his mouth gave it a bite and a wrench just like one of those patent american threshing machines brought the cob out perfectly clear of grain and took another after the supper was over we had another long grace ending with voor spijze en drunk de heer ik dank for food and drink the lord i thank  after supper we went outside in order to escape the feetwashing ceremony all in the same water which this simple pastoral people are said to indulge in and which they might expect the uitlander stranger to enter into with enthusiasm when we came back we found that the womenwho bytheby do not eat till the men have finishedhad done their meal and gone to bed having first made us up a luxurious couch on the floor consisting of a filthy featherbed and an equally filthy blanket my heart misgave me when i looked at that bed it may have been fancy but once or twice i thought it moved however there was no choice unless we chose to sit up all night so in we got looking for all the world like three big sunburned dolls put to bed by some little girl i as the youngest blew out the light and thenfrom every side they came up ones arms up ones legs down ones back they scampered till life became a burden sleep was impossible one could only lie awake and calculate the bites per minute and the quantity of blood one would lose before daybreak cold as it was i would have turned out and slept in the veldt only my rug was over my two companions as well as myself so i could not take it i have slept in a good many different places and in very fairly uncomfortable places but i never had such a night before  at the first grey dawn of morning the old frau came stumbling out of the bedroom and sat down without ceremony in her big chair waiting till she thought that we had reached a sufficiently advanced stage in our toiletteand her idea of what that was must have been a strange oneshe shouted out to her daughters that they could com and in they all came very glad were we when we had paid our bill which was a heavy one and were in the saddle once more riding through the cold morning mist that lay in masses on all the ridges of the hills like snow on mountains  it was needful to start early for we had more than sixty miles to cover and our ponies had done a good journey the day before the work that one can get out of these ponies is marvellous there was my pony mettle who had my eleven stone to carry to say nothing of the saddle heavy saddlebags and a roll of rugs who came in at the end of his journey as fresh as paint we cantered easily over the great highveldt prairies now and then passing clumps of trees outposts of the bushveldt these enormous plains notwithstanding their dreary vastness have a wild beauty of their own the grass is what is called sour grass and has a peculiar blue tinge but stock do not like it so well as the lowveldt grass which is sweeter and fattens them more quickly though it does not put them in such good fettle the rock here is all white sandstone and thinly overlaps an enormous bed of coal cropping up from beneath the waterwashed surface at this time of year there are very few beasts or birds of any sort to be seen though in the winter the veldt is one moving mass of trek or migratory game  our destination that day was botsabelo the most important missionstation and one of the very few successful ones in southeastern africa as we neared it the country gradually broke into hills of peculiar and beautiful formation which rendered the last two hours of our ride in the dark through an unknown country rather a difficult job however we stumbled through streams and over boulders and about nine oclock were lucky enough to come right upon the station where we were most kindly received by dr merensky the station itself stands on the brow of a hill surrounded by gardens and orchards beneath it lie slope and mountain stream and valley over which are dotted numbers of kraals to say nothing of three or four substantial houses occupied by the assistant missionary and german artisans near dr merenskys house stands the church by far the best i have seen in the transvaal and there is also a store with some wellbuilt workshops around it all the neighbouring country belongs to the station which is in fact like a small independent state 40000 acres in extent on a hilltop overshadowing the station are placed the fortifications consisting of thick walls running in a circle with upstanding towers in which stand one or two cannon but it all reminds one more of an old norman keep with its village clustered in its protecting shadow than of a modern mission establishment  dr merensky commenced his labours in secocoenis country but was forced to fly from thence by night with his wife and newborn baby to escape being murdered by that chiefs orders who like most kafir potentates has an intense aversion to missionaries twelve years ago he established this station and gathering his scattered converts around him defied secocoeni to drive him thence twice that chief has sent out a force to sweep him away and murder his people and twice they have come and looked and like false sextus turned back again the boers too have more than once threatened to destroy him for it is unpleasant to them to have so intelligent a witness in their midst but they have never dared to try the place is really impregnable to basutus and boers zulus might carry it with their grand steady rush but it would be at a terrible sacrifice of life in fact dr merensky has been forced by the pressure of circumstances to teach his men the use of a rifle as well as the truths of christianity to trust in god but also to keep their powder dry at a few minutes notice he can turn out 200 wellarmed natives ready for offence or defence and the existence of such a stronghold is of great advantage to the few english in the neighbourhood for the boers know well that should they attack them they might draw down the vengeance of dr merenskys formidable body of christian soldiers  we only passed one night at botsabelo and next morning went on to middelburg or nazareth which is an hours ride from the station here too we met with a warm welcome from the handful of english residents but we were eager to push on as rapidly as possible for our kind friends told us that it would be impossible to proceed to secocoenis on horseback because of the deadly nature of the country for horses so we had to hire an oxwaggon which they provisioned for us and much to our disgust as we were pressed for time were obliged to fall back on that dilatory method of travelling  we decided that we would take the three oldest and least valuable horses with us in order to proceed with them from fort weeber which was our next point to secocoenis town whither waggons could not reach few english readers are aware that there is a mysterious disease among horses in south africa peculiar to the country called horsesickness during the autumn season it carries off thousands of horses annually though some are good and others bad yearsa bad fever year being generally a bad horsesickness year also and vice versa a curious feature about it is that as the veldt gets tamed that is fed off by domesticated animals the sickness gradually disappears no cure has yet been discovered for it and very few horses pull throughperhaps five per cent these are called salted horses and are very valuable as although they are not proof against the disease they are not so liable to take it a salted horse may be known by the peculiar looseness and roughness of his skin and also by a certain unmistakable air of depression as though he felt that the responsibilities of life pressed very heavily upon him he is like a man who has dearly bought his experience he can never forget the terrible lesson taught in the buying  on the fourth day from our start we left middelburg and taking a northeast course from this outpost of civilisation overtook the waggon and camped after a twenty miles trek just on the edge of the bushveldt we had two young boers to drive our waggonsterrible louts however they understood how to drive a waggon and whilst one of them drove the other would sit for hours with a vacant stare on his face thinking it is a solemn fact that from the time we left middelburg till the time we returned neither of those fellows touched water that is to wash themselves the only luxury in the shape of comforts of the toilette which they allowed themselves was a comb with a brass back carefully tied to the roof of the waggon with two strips of oxhide thick enough to have held a hundredweight of lead i dont think they ever used itit was too great a luxury for general usebut they would occasionally untie it and look at it our own outfit in the waggon was necessarily scanty consisting of a few iron pots and plates a kettle some green blankets a lantern and an old antifriction greasecan used for water which gave it a fine flavour of waggonwheels we also had a cartle or wooden frame across which were stretched strips of hide fitted into the waggon about two feet above the floor and intended to sleep on but the less said about that the better  after we left the great highveldt plains over which the fresh breeze was sweeping we dropped down into a beautiful bushclad valley with mountains on either side it was like making a sudden descent into the tropics not a breath of wind stirred the trees and the sun shone with a steady burning heat scarcely a sound broke the silence save the murmur of the river we crossed and recrossed the occasional pipe of a bird and the melancholy cry half sigh half bark of an old baboon who was swinging himself along indignant at our presence  if the sights and sounds were beautiful the sun was hot and the road fearful and we were indeed glad when we reached whiteheads cobalt mine and were most kindly received by the gentlemen who superintend the works the house used to belong to some boer who had deserted the place but left behind him a beautiful orchard of orange and peach trees the place is very feverish and unhealthy and the white ants so troublesome that everything has to be stood in sardine tins full of ashes  on our way from the house we went to see the cobalt mine which is on a hillside a mile away it has only been established about three years and has existed hitherto under the greatest difficulties as regards labour transport machinery danger from surrounding native tribes c but it has already the proprietor informed me reduced the price of cobaltthe blue dye used to colour such things as the willowpattern platesby onehalf in the english market bringing it down from somewhere about 140 pounds to 80 pounds a ton we were very much astonished to see the amount of work which had been done as we expected to find a pit such as the kafirs work for copper but instead of that there was a large slanting shaft quite a hundred yards long to say nothing of various openings out of it following branch leads of ore there is also a vertical shaft one hundred feet deep through which the ore comes up and by which one can ascend and descend in a bucket after we emerged from this awful hole we went into another a drive running straight into the mountain for more than three hundred feet following a vein of black oxide of cobalt which is much more valuable than the ore and though the vein is rarely more than a foot in thickness pays very well leaving the mine we rode on past some old kafir copperworkingscircular pitswhich must have been abandoned to judge from their appearance a hundred years ago till we came to the banks of the great olifants or elephants river this magnificent stream though it is unnavigable owing to frequent rapids has stretches miles long down which a manofwar could steam and after its junction with the elands river it grows larger and larger till pursuing a northeast course it at length falls into the mighty limpopo it is a very majestic but somewhat sluggish stream and its water is not very good you cannot see the river till you are right upon it owing to the great trees with which its steep banks are fringed and in the early morning it is quite hidden from bank to bank by a dense mass of billows of white mist indescribably strange to look upon  but beautiful as this country is it is most unhealthy for man and beast the close odour the long creeping lines of mist the rich rank vegetation the steady heat of day and night all say one word fever and fever of the most virulent type the traveller through this sort of country is conscious of a latent fear lest he should some day begin to feel hot when he ought to be cold and cold when he ought to be hot and so be stricken down to rise prematurely old or perhaps to die and be buried in a lonely grave covered with stones to keep off the jackals we were travelling in the very worst fevermonth march when the summer vegetation is commencing to rot and throw off its poisonous steam what saved us here and afterwards at secocoenis was our temperate living hard exercise and plenty of quinine and tobaccosmoke  all the country through which we were passing is good gameveldt but we saw very little and killed nothing this was chiefly owing to the fact that we did not dare go out of hearing of the waggonwheels for fear of getting lost in the bush a thing very easily done a few years back this veldt swarmed with big game with elephants and giraffes and they are even now occasionally seen we managed now and again to get a glimpse of some of the beautiful impala buck or of a small lot of blue wilderbeestes vanishing between the trees like a troop of wild horses there are still plenty of lions about but we did not hear any whether it was that they had gone to the highveldt after the cattle or that they do not roar so much in summer i do not know perhaps it is as well that we did not for the roar of a lion is very generally followed by what the dutch call a skrech after roaring once or twice to wake the cattle up and make them generally uneasy the lion stations himself about twenty yards to the windward of the waggon the oxen get wind of him and promptly skrech that is break their rims and run madly into the veldt this is just what the lion wants for now he can pick out a fat ox and quietly approach him from the other side till he is within springing distance he then jumps upon him crushes his neck with one bite and eats him at his leisure  and so we trekked on through the sunrise through the burning midday and glowing sunsets steering by the sun and making our own road now through tambouki grass higher than the oxen and now through dense bush till at length one day we said goodbye to the olifants just where the elands river flows into it and turned our faces eastward this course soon brought us on to higher ground and away from the mimosa which loves the low hot valleys into the region of the sugar bush which thrives upon the hillsides this sugar bush is a very handsome and peculiar plant with soft thick leaves standing about twenty feet high it bears a brushlike flower each of which in the cape colony contains half a teaspoonful of delicious honey but curiously enough though in other respects the tree is precisely similar this is not the case in the transvaal or natal at the proper season the cape farmers go out with buckets and shake the flowers till they have collected sufficient honey to last them for the winter a honey more fragrant than that made by bees  after a long ride over the open which must once have been thickly populated to judge from the number of remains of kraals we came at length to fort weeber the fort is very badly situated in the hollow of a plain and so surrounded by fine hills that it is entirely commanded it consists of a single sod wall about two feet thick and five high capped with loose stones whilst at two of the corners stand on raised platforms a sixpounder and a threepounder whitworth gun inside the wall are built rows of mud huts which are occupied by the garrison leaving an open square in the midst of which is placed the magazine we found the garrison in a wretched condition they have not received any pay except government goodfors promissory notes generally known as goodfornothings so they are in a state of abject poverty whilst they are rendered harmless as regards offensive operations by the death from horsesickness of eightytwo of the ninety horses they owned however the officers and garrison gave us a very grand reception as we rode up they fired a salute of twelve guns and then after we had dismounted and been received by the officers we were taken through a lane made by the garrison drawn up in a double line and just as we got to the middle bang went the eighty rifles over our heads then an address was read the volunteers are great people for addresses but a more practical welcome soon followed in the shape of a good dinner  next morning we started a party of seven including the interpreter to ride over the loolu berg to secocoenis a distance of about thirtyeight miles  for the first five miles we passed through the most curious granite formation a succession of small hills entirely composed of rounded boulders of granite weighing from five to 1000 tons and looking exactly like piles of gigantic snowballs hurled together by some mighty hand the granite formation prevails in all this part of the country and individual boulders sometimes take very curious shapes for instance in the bushveldt we passed a great column towering high above the trees composed of six boulders getting smaller and smaller from the base up and each accurately balanced on the one beneath it then we crossed the range of hills which overlooks the fort and passing secocoenis old kraal where he used to live before he retreated to his fastnesses we arrived at a great alluvial valley nine miles broad on the other side of which rises the loolu it was on this plain that the only real fight between the volunteers and secocoenis men took place when the former managed to get between the basutus and the hills and shot them down like game killing over 200 men leaving the battlefield where the skeletons still lie a little to our right we crossed the plain and came to the foot of the loolu all along the base of which stand neat villages inhabited by secocoenis people some of these villages have been burnt by the volunteers and the remainder are entirely deserted their inhabitants having built fresh huts among the rocks in almost inaccessible places the appearance of these white huts peeping out all over the black rocks was very curious and reminded one of the swiss chalets  by the stream that runs along past the villages we offsaddled as both ourselves and our horses were nearly exhausted by the burning heat but as there was not much time to lose after a short rest we started off again and rode on over a bed of magnetic iron lying on the ground in great lumps of almost pure metal until we came to a stretch of what looked remarkably like goldbearing quartz and then to a limestone formation the whole country is evidently rich beyond measure in minerals all this time we were passing through scenery inexpressibly wild and grand and when we had arrived at the highest spot of the pass it reached a climax of savage beauty about forty miles in front of us towered up another magnificent range of bluetinged mountains known as the blue berg whilst all around us rose great bushclad hills opening away in every direction towards gorgeouscoloured valleys the scene was so grand and solemn that i do not think it lies in the power of words to describe it  here we had to dismount to descend a most fearful precipitous path consisting of boulders piled together in the wildest confusion from one to another of which we had to jump driving the horses before us halfway down we offsaddled to rest ourselves and as we did so we noticed that the gall was running from one of the horses noses we knew too well what was the matter and so left him there to die during the night this horse was by far the finest we had with us and his owner used to boast that the poor beast had often carried him a heavy man from his house to pretoria a distance of nearly ninety miles in one day he was also a salted horse it is a curious thing that the sickness generally kills the best horses first  after a short rest we started on again and at the end of another hour reached the bottom of the pass from thence we rode along a gulley that alternately narrowed and widened till at length it brought us right on to secocoenis beautiful feverstricken home  all three of us had seen a good deal of scenery in different parts of the world and one of the party was intimately acquainted with the finest spots in south africa but we were forced to admit that we had never seen anything half so lovely as secocoenis valley we had seen grander views indeed the scene from the top of the pass was grander but never anything that so nearly approached perfection in detail beautiful it was beautiful beyond measure but it was the sort of beauty under whose veil are hidden fever and death and so we pushed on through the still hot eventide till at length we came to the gates of the town where we found makurupiji secocoenis mouth or prime minister who had evidently been informed of our coming by his spies waiting to receive us   makurupiji committed suicide after the town had been stormed preferring death to imprisonment  conducted by this grandee we went on past the chiefs kraals down to the town whence flocked men women and children to look on the white lords all in a primitive state of dress consisting of a strip of skin tied round the middle and the women with their hair powdered with some preparation of iron which gave it a metallic blue tinge  at length we stopped just opposite a beautiful fortified kopje perforated by secret caves where the ammunition of the tribe is hidden no stranger is allowed to enter these caves or even to ascend the kopje though they do not object to ones inspecting some of the other fortifications dismounting from our wearied horses we passed through a cattle kraal and came into the presence of swasi secocoenis uncle a fat old fellow who was busily engaged in braying a skin nearly every male basutu one meets be he high or low is braying a hide of some sort either by rubbing or by masticating it it is a curious sight to come across some twenty of these fellows every one of them twisting or chewing away        afterwards stormed in the attack on secocoenis town by      sir garnet wolseley  swasi was a sort of master of the household his duty it was to receive strangers and see that they were properly looked after so after shaking hands with us furiously he was a wonderful fellow to shake hands he conducted us to our hut it stood in a goodsized courtyard beautifully paved with a sort of concrete of limestone which looked very clean and white and surrounded by a hedge of reeds and sticks tightly tied together inside which ran a slightly raised bench also made of limestone the hut itself was neatly thatched the thatch projecting several feet so as to form a covering to a narrow verandah that ran all round it inside it was commodious and ornamented after the egyptian style with straight and spiral lines painted on with some kind of red ochre and floored with a polished substance certainly these huts are as much superior to those of the zulus as those who dwell in them are inferior to that fine race what the basutus gain in art and handiness they lose in manliness and gentlemanly feeling  we had just laid ourselves down on the grass mats in the courtyardfor it was too hot to go into the hutthoroughly exhausted with our days work and the heat when in came two men each of them dragging a fine indigenous sheep they were accompanied by makurupiji who brought us a message from secocoeni to the effect that he the chief sent to greet us the great chiefs that he sent us also a morsel to eat lest we should be hungry in his house it was but a morselit should have been an ox for great chiefs should eat much meatbut he himself was pinched with hunger his belt was drawn very tight by the boers he was poor and so his gift was poor still he would see if tomorrow he could find a beast that had something besides the skin on its bones that he might offer it to us after this magniloquent address the poor animals were trundled out by the other gate to have their throats cut  after getting some supper and taking our quinine we turned in and slept that night in the best way that the heat would let us rising next morning with the vain hope of getting a bathe of all the discomforts we experienced at secocoenis the scarcity and badness of the water was the worst bad water when you are in a hotbed of fever is a terrible privation and so we had to go unwashed with the exception of having a little water poured over our hands out of gourds we must have presented a curious sight at breakfast that morning before us knelt a sturdy kafir holding a stick in each hand on which were respectively speared a leg and a side of mutton from which we cut off great hunks with our huntingknives and taking them in our fingers devoured them like beasts of prey if we got a bit we did not like our mode of dispensing of it was simple and effective we threw it to one of the natives standing round us among whom was the heirapparent who promptly gobbled it up  breakfast finished a message came from secocoeni asking for spirits to drink but we were not to be taken in in this way for we knew well that if we sent the chief spirits we should get no business done that day and we did not care to run the risk of fever by stopping longer than we could help so we sent back a message to the effect that business must come first and spirits afterwards the head men who brought this message said that they could perfectly understand our objection as far as secocoeni and ourselves were concerned since we had to talk but as they had only to sit still and listen there could be no possible objection to their having something to drink this argument was ingenious but we did not see the force of it as our stock of spirits which we had brought more for medicine than anything else was very limited still we were obliged to promise them a tot after the talking was over in order to keep them civil  our message had the desired effect for presently secocoeni sent to say that it was now time to talk and that his head men would lead us to him so we started up accompanied by makurupiji swasi and galook the general of his forces a fat fellow with a face exactly like a pig the sun beat down with such tremendous force that though we had only threequarters of a mile to walk we felt quite tired by the time we reached the chiefs kraals passing through several cattle kraals we came to a shed under which sat the heirapparent dressed in a gorgeous blanket with his court around him leaving him we entered an inner cattle kraal where in one corner stood a large roughlybuilt shed under the shade of which squatted over a hundred of the head men of the tribe gathered together by secocoeni to witness        as each chief came up to the meetingplace he would pass      before the enclosure where secocoeni was sitting and salute      him by softly striking the hands together and saying      something that sounded like marema  opening out of this kraal was the chiefs private enclosure where stood his huts as we drew near secocoeni who had inspired such terror into the bold burghers of the republic the chief of nine thousand warriors the husband of sixtyfour wives the father of a hundred children rose from the oxhide on which he was seated under the shade of a tree and came to the gate to meet us and a queer sight this potentate was as he stood there shaking hands through the gate of middle age about fortyfive years of age rather fat with a flat nose and small twinkling black eyes he presented an entirely hideous and semirepulsive appearance his dress consisted of a cotton blanket over which was thrown a tigerskin kaross and on his head was stuck an enormous old white felt hat such as the boers wear and known as a wilderbeeste chaser  after we had been duly introduced he retreated to his oxhide and we went and squatted down among the head men secocoeni took no active part in the proceedings that followed he sat in his enclosure and occasionally shouted out some instructions to makurupiji who was literally his mouth speaking for him and making use of the pronoun i during the four hours or so that we were there secocoeni never stopped chewing an intoxicating green leaf very much resembling that of the pomegranate of which he occasionally sent us some  after the business of the commission had come to an end and some of our party started on their homeward journey we were detained by secocoeni who wished to see us privately he sent for us to his private enclosure and we sat down on his oxhide with him and one or two head men it was very curious to see this wily old savage shoving a handful of leaves into his mouth and giving his head a shake and then making some shrewd remark which went straight to the bottom of whatever question was in hand at length we bade secocoeni goodbye having promised to deliver all his respectful messages to our chief and thoroughly wearied arrived at our own hut tired as we were we thought it would be better to start for the fort at once rather than risk the fever for another night so we made up our minds to a long moonlight ride and saddling up got out of secocoenis town about 330 pm having looked our last upon this beautiful fevertrap which only wants water scenery to make it absolutely perfect halfway up we saw the poor horse we had left sick the day before lying dead with dry foam all round his mouth and half his skin taken off by some passing basutu a couple of hundred yards farther on we found another dying left by the party who had started before us it was in truth a valley of the shadow of death luckily our horses lasted us back to the fort but one died there and the other two are dead since  beautiful as was the scene by day in the light of the full moon it was yet more surpassingly lovely it was solemn weird every valley became a mysterious deep and every hill stone and tree shone with that cold pale lustre which the moon alone can throw silence reigned the silence of the dead broken only once or twice by the wild whistling challenge of one of secocoenis warriors as he came bounding down the rocks to see who we were that passed the effect of the fires by the huts perched among the rocks at the entrance to the pass was very strange and beautiful reminding one of the midnight fires of the gnomes in the fairy tales  and so we rode on hour after hour through the night till we wellnigh fell asleep in our saddles and at length about two oclock in the morning we reached the waggons to find the young boers fast asleep in our bed we kicked them out and after swallowing some biscuits tumbled in ourselves for the few hours rest which we so sadly needed  on the following morning thursday two of the party bade farewell to our hosts at the fort and started on one of the quickest possible treks leaving our companion to proceed across country to the fort established by president burgers or porocororo as the basutus call him at steelport  we returned to middelburg by an entirely different route from that by which we came leaving the valley of the olifants to our right we trekked along the highveldt and thus avoided all the fever country roughly speaking we had about 120 miles of country to get over to reach middelburg and we determined to do this in three days and two nights so as to get in on the saturday night as we were much pressed for time now according to english ideas it is no great thing to travel 120 miles in three days but it is six days journey in an oxwaggon over bad country and we were going to do it in half that time by doubling the speed  of course to do this we had to trek night and day for instance on the first day we inspanned at 1030 am and trekked till within an hour of sundown at sundown we inspanned and with one outspan trekked till sunrise outspanned for two hours and on again being seventeen and a half hours under the yoke out of the twentyfour and covering fiftyfive miles of course one cannot do this sort of travelling for more than two or three days without killing the oxen as it was towards the end as soon as the yokes were lifted off the poor beasts dropped down as though they were shot and most of them went lame another great disadvantage is that one suffers very much from want of sleep the jolting of the springless machine as it lumbered over rocks a foot high and through deep spruits or streams brought our heads down with such a fearful jar on the saddlebags that we used for pillows that all sleep was soon knocked out of them or even if we were lucky enough to be crossing a stretch of tolerably smooth ground there was a swaying motion that rubbed ones face up and down till the skin was nearly worn through polishing the saddlebags to such an extent that we might almost have used them for lookingglasses as well as pillows  at secocoenis kraal we had engaged two boys to carry our packs as far as the fort who on their arrival were so well satisfied with the way in which we treated them that they requested to be allowed to proceed with us these young barbarians who went respectively by the names of nojoke and scowl as being the nearest approach in english to their sisutu names were the greatest possible source of amusement to us with their curious ways i never saw such fellows to sleep it is a positive fact that nojoke used frequently to take his rest coiled up like a boa constrictor in a box at the end of the waggon in which box stood three iron pots with their sharp legs sticking up on those legs he peacefully slumbered when the waggon was going over ground that prohibited our even stopping in it scowl was not a nice boy to look at for his naked back was simply cut to pieces and covered with huge weals of which everybody doubtless thought we were the cause on inquiring how he came to get such a tremendous thrashing it turned out that these basutus have a custom of sending young men of a certain age out in couples each armed with a good sjambok a whip cut from the hide of a seacow to thrash one another till one gives in and that it was in one of these encounters that the intelligent scowl got so lacerated but as he remarked with a grin my back is nothing the chiefs should see that of the other boy        of these two lads nojoke subsequently turned out      worthless and went to the diamond fields whilst scowl      became an excellent servant until he took to wearing a      black coat and turned christian when he shortly afterwards      developed into a drunkard and a thief        the age of puberty  we spent one night at middelburg and next morning bidding adieu to our kind english friends started for pretoria taking care to end our first days journey at a house where an englishman lived so as to ensure a clean shakedown here we discovered that the horse i was riding the sole survivor of the five we had started with had got the sickness and so we had to leave him and hire another this horse by the by recovered which is the only instance of an animals conquering the disease which has yet come under my observation we hired the new horse from a boer who charged us exactly three times its proper price and then preached us a sermon quite a quarter of an hour long on his hospitality his kindness of heart and his willingness to help strangers i must tell you that just as we were going to sleep the night before a stranger had come and asked for a shakedown which was given to him in the same room we had risen before daybreak and my companion was expatiating to me in clear and forcible language on the hypocrisy and scoundrelism of this boer when suddenly a sleepy voice out of the darkness murmured thickly i say stranger guess you shouldnt lose your temper guess that ere boer is acting after the manner of human natur and then the owner of the voice turned over and went to sleep again  we had over sixty miles to ride that day and it must have been about eight oclock at night on the sixteenth day of our journey when we reached pretoria and rode straight up to our camp where we were heartily greeted i am sure that some of our friends must have felt a little disappointed at seeing us arrive healthy and fat without a sign of fever after all their melancholy predictions it would not have been human natur if they had not when we got to the camp i called out to masooku my zulu servant to come and take the horses next moment i heard a rush and a scuttle in the tent like the scrimmage in a rabbitburrow when one puts in the ferrets and masooku shouted out in zulu he has come back by chakas head i swear it it is his voice his own voice that calls me my fathers my chiefs  and so ended one of the hardest and most interesting journeys imaginablea journey in which the risk only added to the pleasure still i should not care to make it again at the same time of year    vii  a zulu wardance  in all that worldwide empire which the spirit of the english colonisation has conquered from out of the realms of the distant and unknown and added year by year to the english dominions it is doubtful whether there be any one spot of corresponding area presenting so many large questions social and political as the colony of natal wrested some thirty years ago from the patriarchal boers and peopled by a few scattered scores of adventurous emigrants natal has with hard toil gained for itself a precarious foothold hardly yet to be called an existence known chiefly to the outside world as the sudden birthplace of those tremendous polemical missiles which battered so fiercely some few years ago against the walls of the english church it is now attracting attention to the shape and proportion of that unsolved riddle of the future the native question in those former days of rude and handtomouth legislation when the certain evil of the day had to be met and dealt with before the possible evil of the morrow the seeds of great political trouble were planted in the young colony seeds whose fruit is fast ripening before our eyes  when the strong aggressive hand of england has grasped some fresh portion of the earths surface there is yet a spirit of justice in her heart and head which prompts the question among the first of such demands as to how best and most fairly to deal by the natives of the newlyacquired land in earlier times when steam was not and telegraphs and special correspondents were equally unknown agencies for getting at the truth of things this question was more easily answered across a width of dividing ocean or continent then distant action might be prompt and sharp on emergency and no one would be the wiser but of late years owing to these results of civilisation harsh measures have by the mere pressure of public opinion and without consideration of their necessity in the eyes of the colonists been set aside as impracticable and inhuman in the case of natal most of the early questions of possession and right were settled sword in hand by the pioneer dutch who after a space of terrible warfare drove back the zulus over the tugela and finally took possession of the land but they did not hold it long the same hateful invading englishman with his new ideas and his higher forms of civilisation who had caused them to quit the old colony the land of their birth came and drove them vi et armis from the land of their adoption and it was not long before these same english became lords of this red african soil from the coast up to the drakensberg still there were difficulties for although the newcomers might be lords of the soil there remained yet a remnant and a very troublesome remnant of its original and natural masters shattered fragments of the zulu power in natal men who had once swept over the country in the army of chaka the terrible chaka of the short spear but who had remained behind in the fair new land when chakas raids had been checked by the white man and his deadly weapons remnants too of conquered aboriginal tribes who had found even chakas rule easier than that of their own chieftains swelled the amount to a total of some 100000 souls  one of the first acts of the english government when it took up the reins was to allot to each of these constituent fragments a large portion of the land this might perhaps have been shortsighted legislation but it arose from the necessity of the moment according to even the then received ideas of colonisation and its duties it was hardly possibledanger apartto drive all the natives over the frontier so they were allowed to stay and share the rights and privileges of british subjects but the evil did not stop there ere long some political refugees defeated in battle fled before the avenging hand of the conqueror and craved place and protection from the government of natal it was granted and the principle once established body after body of men poured in for in stepping over the boundary line they left the regions of ruin and terrible death and entered those of peace security and plenty  thus it is that the native population of natal fed from within and without has in thirty years increased enormously in number secluded from the outside world in his location the native has lived in peace and watched his cattle grow upon a thousand hills his wealth has become great and his wives many he no longer dreads swift death by order of the king or by word of the witchdoctor no impi or native regiment can now sweep down on him and eat him up that is carry off his cattle put his kraal to the flames and himself his people his wives and children to the assegai for the first time in the story of the great kafir race he can when he rises in the morning be sure that he will not sleep that night stiff in a bloody grave he has tasted the blessings of peace and security and what is the consequence he has increased and multiplied until his numbers are as grains of sand on the seashore overlapping the borders of his location he squats on private lands he advances like a great tidal wave he cries aloud for room more room this is the trouble which stares us in the face looming larger and more distinct year by year the great overgrowing problem which thoughtful men fear must one day find a sudden and violent solution thus it comes to pass that there hangs low on the horizon of south africa the dark cloud of the native question how and when it will burst no man can pretend to say but some time and in some way burst it must unless means of dispersing it can be found  there is now at work among the kafir population the same motive power which has raised in turn all white nations and having built them up to a certain height has then set to work to sap them until they have fallenthe power of civilisation hand in hand the missionary and the trader have penetrated the locations the efforts of the teacher have met with but a partial success a christian may be a good man in his way but he is a zulu spoiled said cetywayo king of the zulus when arguing the question of christianity with the secretary for native affairs and such is not altogether wrongly the general feeling of the natives with the traders it has been different some have dealt honestlyand more it is to be feared dishonestlynot only with those with whom they have had dealings but with their fellowsubjects and their government it is these men chiefly who have in defiance of the law supplied the natives with those two great modern elements of danger and destruction the ginbottle and the rifle the first is as yet injurious only to the recipients but it will surely react on those who have taught them its use the danger of possessing the rifle may come home to us any day and at any moment  civilisation it would seem when applied to black races produces effects diametrically opposite to those we are accustomed to observe in white nations it debases before it can elevate and as regards the kafirs it is doubtful and remains to be proved whether it has much power to elevate them at all take the average zulu warrior and it will be found that in his natural state his vices are largely counterbalanced by his good qualities in times of peace he is a simple pastoral man leading a goodhumoured easy life with his wives and his cattle perfectly indolent and perfectly happy he is a kind husband and a kinder father he never disowns his poor relations his hospitality is extended alike to white and black he is open in his dealings and faithful to his word and his honesty is a proverb in the land true if war breaks out and the thirst for slaughter comes upon him he turns into a different man when the fierce savage spirit is once aroused blood alone will cool it but even then he has virtues if he is cruel he is brave in the battle if he is reckless of the lives of others he regards not his own and when death comes he meets it without fear and goes to the spirits of his fathers boldly as a warrior should and now reverse the picture and see him in the dawning light of that civilisation which by intellect and by nature he is some five centuries behind see him ignoring its hidden virtues eagerly seize and graft its most prominent vices on to his own besetting sins behold him by degrees adding cunning to his cruelty avarice to his love of possession replacing his bravery by coarse bombast and insolence and his truth by lies behold him inflaming all his passions with the maddening drink of the white man and then follow him through many degrees of degradation until he falls into crime and ends in a jail such are in only too many instances the consequences of this partial civilisation and they are not even counterbalanced except in individual cases by the attempt to learn the truths of a creed which he cannot does not pretend to understand and if this be the result in the comparatively few individuals who have been brought under these influences it may be fair to argue that it will differ only in degree not in kind when the same influences are brought to bear on the same material in corresponding proportions whatever may or may not be the effects of our partial civilisation when imperfectly and spasmodically applied to the vast native population of south africa one thing must in course of time result from it the old customs the old forms the old feelings must each in turn die away the outer expression of these will die first and it will not be long before the very memory of them will fade out of the barbaric heart the rifle must replace and indeed actually has replaced the assegai and the shield and portions of the castoff uniforms of all the armies of europe are to be seen where until lately the bronzelike form of the kafir warrior went naked as on the day he was born but so long as native customs and ceremonies still linger in some of the more distant locations so long will they exercise a certain attraction for dwellers amid tamer scenes it is therefore from a belief in the magnetism of contrast that the highlycivilised reader is invited to come to where he can still meet the barbarian face to face and witness that wild ceremony half jest half grim earnesta zulu war dance  it was the good fortune of the writer of this sketch to find himself some years ago travelling through the upcountry districts of natal in the company of certain high officials of the english government the journey dragged slowly enough by waggon and some monotonous weeks had passed before we pitched our camp one drizzling gusty night on a high plateau surrounded by still loftier hills a wild and dismal place it looked in the growing dusk of an autumn evening nor was it more suggestively cheerful when we rode away from it next morning in the sunshine leaving the waggons to follow slowly our faces were set towards a great mountain towering high above its fellows called pagadis koppagadi being a powerful chief who had fled from the zulus in the early days of the colony and had ever since dwelt loyally and peacefully here in this wild place beneath the protection of the crown messengers had been duly sent to inform him that he was to receive the honour of a visit for your true savage never likes to be taken by surprise other swiftfooted runners had come back with the present of a goat and the respectful answer so oriental in its phraseology that pagadi was old he was infirm yet he would arise and come to greet his lords every mile or so of our slow progress a fresh messenger would spring up before us suddenly as though he had started out of the earth at our feet and prefixing his greeting with the royal salute given with upraised arm bayete bayetea salutation only accorded to zulu royalty to the governors of the different provinces and to sir t shepstone the secretary for native affairshe would deliver his message or his news and fall into the rear presently came one saying pagadi is very old and weak pagadi is weary let his lords forgive him if he meet them not this day tomorrow when the sun is high he will come to their place of encampment and greet his lords and hold festival before them but let his lords the white lords of all the land from the great mountain to the black water go up to his kraal and let them take the biggest hut and drink of the strongest beer there his son the chief that is to be and all his wives shall greet them let his lords be honoured by pagadi through them an acknowledgment was sent and we still rode on beginning the ascent of the formidable stronghold on the flat top of which was placed the chiefs kraal a hard and stiff climb it was up a bridle path with far more resemblance to a staircase than a road but if the road was bad the scenery and the vegetation were wild and beautiful in the extreme now we came to a deep kloof or cleft in the steep mountainside at the bottom of which half hidden by the masses of ferns and rich rank greenery trickled a little stream now to an open space of rough ground covered only with huge weatherwashed boulders a little further on lay a kafir mealiegarden where the tall green stalks were fairly bent to the ground by the weight of the cornladen heads and beyond that again a parklike slope of grassy veldt and ever when we looked behind us the vast undulating plain over which we had come stretched away in its mysterious silence till it blended at length with the soft blue horizon  at last after much hard and steady climbing we reached the top and stood upon a perfectly level space ten or twelve acres in extent exactly in the centre of which was placed the chiefs kraal before we dismounted we rode to the extreme western edge of the plateau to look at one of the most perfectly lovely views it is possible to imagine it was like coming face to face with great primeval nature not nature as we civilised people know her smiling in cornfields waving in wellordered woods but nature as she was on the morrow of the creation there to our left cold and grey and grand rose the great peak flinging its dark shadow far beyond its base two thousand feet and more beneath us lay the valley of the mooi river with the broad tranquil stream flashing silver through its midst over against us rose another range of towering hills with sudden openings in their blue depths through which could be seen the splendid distances of a champaign country immediately at our feet and seeming to girdle the great gaunt peak lay a deep valley through which the little bushmans river forced its shining way all around rose the great bushclad hills so green so bright in the glorious streaming sunlight and yet so awfully devoid of life so solemnly silent it was indeed a sight never to be forgotten this wide panoramic outlook with its towering hills its smiling valleys its flashing streams its allpervading sunlight and its deep sad silence but it was not always so lifeless and so still some few years ago those hills those plains those rivers were teeming each with their various creatures but a short time since and standing here at eventide the traveller could have seen herds of elephants cooling themselves yonder after their days travel whilst the blackheaded whitetusked seacow rose and plunged in the pool below that bushclad hill was the favourite haunt of droves of buffaloes and elands and on that plain swarmed thousands upon thousands of springbok and of quagga of hartebeest and of oribi all alien life must cease before the white man and so these wild denizens of forest stream and plain have passed away never to return  turning at length from the contemplation of a scene so new and so surprising we entered the stockade of the kraal these kraals consist of a stout outer palisade and then at some distance from the first a second enclosure between which the cattle are driven at night or in case of danger at the outer entrance we were met by the chiefs eldest son a finelybuilt man who greeted us with much respect and conducted us through rows of huts to the dwellingplaces of the chiefs family fenced off from the rest by a hedge of tambouki grass in the centre of these stood pagadis hut which was larger and more finely woven and thatched than the rest it is impossible to describe these huts better than by saying that they resemble enormous straw beehives of the oldfashioned pattern in front of the hut were grouped a dozen or so of women clad in that airiest of costumes a string of beads they were pagadis wives and ranged from the first shrivelledup wife of his youth to the plump young damsel bought last month the spokeswoman of the party however was not one of the wives but a daughter of pagadis a handsome girl tall and splendidly formed with a finelycut face this prepossessing young lady entreated her lords to enter which they did in a very unlordly way on their hands and knees so soon as the eye became accustomed to the cool darkness of the hut it was sufficiently interesting to notice the rude attempts at comfort with which it was set forth the flooring of a mixture of clay and cowdung looked exactly like black marble so smooth and polished had it been made and on its shining level surface couches of buckskin and gay blankets were spread in an orderly fashion some little threelegged wooden sleepingpillows and a few cookingpots made up its sole furniture besides in one corner rested a bundle of assegais and warshields and opposite the door were ranged several large calabashes full of twala or native beer the chiefs son and all the women followed us into the hut the ladies sat themselves down demurely in a double row opposite to us but the young chieftain crouched in a distant corner apart and played with his assegais we partook of the beer and exchanged compliments almost oriental in their dignified courtesy in the soft and liquid zulu language but not for long for we still had far to ride the stars were shining in southern glory before we reached the place of our nights encampment and supper and bed were even more than usually welcome there is a pleasure in the canvassheltered meal in the afterpipe and evening talk of the things of the day that has been and those of the day to come here amid these wild surroundings which is unfelt and unknown in scenes of greater comfort and higher civilisation there is a sense of freshness and freedom in the windswept waggonbed that is not to be exchanged for the softest couch in the most luxurious chamber and when at length the morning comes sweet in the scent of flowers and glad in the voice of birds it finds us ready to greet it not hiding it from us with canopy and blind as is the way of cities  the scene of the coming spectacle of this bright new day lies spread before us and certainly no spot could have been better chosen for dramatic effect in front of the waggons is a large flat open space backed by bold rising ground with jutting crags and dotted clumps of luxuriant vegetation all around spreads the dense thornbush allowing but of one way of approach from the left during the morning we could hear snatches of distant chants growing louder and louder as time wore on and could catch glimpses of wild figures threading the thorns warriors hastening to the meetingplace all through the past night the farmers for miles around had been aroused by the loud insistent cries of the chiefs messengers as they flitted far and wide stopping but a moment wherever one of their tribe sojourned and bidding him come and bring plume and shield for pagadi had need of him this day we may be sure the herds are left untended the mealieheads ungathered for the herdsmen and the reapers have come hither to answer to the summons of their chief little reck they whether it be for festival or war he needs them and has called them and that is enough higher and higher rose the fitful distant chant but no one could be seen suddenly there stood before us a creature a woman who save for the colour of her skin might have been the original of any one of macbeths weird sisters little withered and bent nearly double by age her activity was yet past comprehension clad in a strange jumble of snakeskins feathers furs and bones a forked wand in her outstretched hand she rushed to and fro before the little group of white men her eyes gleamed like those of a hawk through her matted hair and the genuineness of her frantic excitement was evident by the quivering flesh and working face and the wild spasmodic words she spoke the spirit at least of her rapid utterances may thus be rendered  ou ou ou ai ai ai oh ye warriors that shall dance before the great ones of the earth come oh ye dyers of spears ye plumed suckers of blood come i the isanusi i the witchfinder i the wise woman i the seer of strange sights i the reader of dark thoughts call ye come ye fierce ones come ye brave ones come and do honour to the white lords ah i hear ye ah i smell ye ah i see ye ye come ye come  hardly had her invocation trailed off into the ou ou ou ai ai ai with which it had opened when there rushed over the edge of the hill hard by another figure scarcely less wild but not so repulsive in appearance this last was a finelybuilt warrior arrayed in the full panoply of savage war with his right hand he grasped his spears and on his left hung his large black oxhide shield lined on its inner side with spare assegais from the mans ring round his head arose a single tall grey plume robbed from the kafir crane his broad shoulders were bare and beneath the armpits was fastened a short garment of strips of skin intermixed with oxtails of different colours from his waist hung a rude kilt made chiefly of goats hair whilst round the calf of the right leg was fixed a short fringe of black oxtails as he stood before us with lifted weapon and outstretched shield his plume bending to the breeze and his savage aspect made more savage still by the graceful statuesque pose the dilated eye and warlike mould of the set features as he stood there an emblem and a type of the times and the things which are passing away his feet resting on ground which he held on sufferance and his hands grasping weapons impotent as a childs toy against those of the white manhe who was the rightful lord of allwhat reflections did he not induce what a moral did he not teach  the warrior left us little time however for either reflections or deductions for striking his shield with his assegai he rapidly poured forth this salutation  bayete bayete o chief from the olden times o lords and chief of chiefs pagadi the son of masingorano the great chief the leader of brave ones the son of ulubako greets you pagadi is humble before you he comes with warrior and with shield but he comes to lay them at your feet o father of chiefs son of the great queen over the water is it permitted that pagad approach you ou i see it is your face is pleasant bayete bayete  he ends and saluting again springs forward and flying hither and thither chants the praises of his chief pagadi he says pagad chief and father of the amocuna is coming pagad the brave in battle the wise in council the slayer of warriors pagad who slew the tiger in the night time pagadi the rich in cattle the husband of many wives the father of many children pagad is coming but not alone he comes surrounded with his children his warriors he comes like a king at the head of his brave children pagadis soldiers are coming his soldiers who know well how to fight his soldiers and his captains who make the hearts of brave men to sink down his shakers of spears his quaffers of blood pagad and his soldiers are coming tremble all ye ou ou ou  as the last words die on his lips the air is filled with a deep murmuring sound like distant thunder it swells and rolls and finally passes away to give place to the noise of the rushing of many feet over the brow of the hill dashes a compact body of warriors running swiftly in lines of four with their captain at their head all clad in the same wild garb as the herald each bears a snowwhite shield carried on the slant and above each warriors head rises a grey herons plume these are the advanceguard formed of the greys or veteran troops as they come into full view the shields heave and fall and then from every throat bursts the warsong of the zulus passing us swiftly they take up their position in a double line on our right and stand there solemnly chanting all the while another rush of feet and another company flits over the hill towards us but they bear coalblack shields and the drooping plumes are black as night they fall into position next the firstcomers and take up the chant now they come faster and faster but all through the same gap in the bush the red shields the dun shields the mottled shields the yellow shields follow each other in quick but regular succession till at length there stands before us a body of some five hundred men presenting in their savage dress their various shields and flashing spears as wild a spectacle as it is possible to conceive  but it is not our eyes only that are astonished for from each of those five hundred throats there swells a chant never to be forgotten from company to company it passes that wild characteristic song so touching in its simple grandeur so expressive in its deep pathetic volume the white men who listened had heard the song of choirs ringing down resounding aisles they had been thrilled by the roll of oratorios pealing in melody beautiful and complex through the grandest of mans theatres but never till now had they heard music of voices so weird so soft and yet so savage so simple and yet so allexpressive of the fiercest passions known to the human heart hark now it dies lower and lower it sinks it grows faint despairing why does he not come our chief our lord why does he not welcome his singers ah see they come the heralds of our lord our chief is coming to cheer his praisers our chief is coming to lead his warriors again it rises and swells louder and louder a song of victory and triumph it rolls against the mountains it beats against the ground he is coming he is here attended by his chosen now we shall go forth to slay now shall we taste of the battle higher yet and higher till at length the chief pagadi swathed in wargarments of splendid furs preceded by runners and accompanied by picked warriors creeps slowly up he is old and tottering and of an unwieldy bulk two attendants support him whilst a third bears his shield and a fourth oh bathos a canebottomed chair one moment the old man stands and surveys his warriors and listens to the familiar warcry as he stands his face is lit with the light of battle the light of remembered days the tottering figure straightens itself the feeble hand becomes strong once more with a shout the old man shakes off his supporters and grasps his shield and then forgetting his weakness and his years he rushes to his chieftains place in the centre of his men and as he comes the chant grows yet louder the time yet faster till it rises and rings and rolls no longer a chant but a warcry a paean of power pagadi stops and raises his hand and the place is filled with a silence that may be felt but not for long the next moment five hundred shields are tossed aloft five hundred spears flash in the sunshine and with a sudden roar forth springs the royal salute bayete  the chief draws back and gives directions to his indunas his thinkers his wise ones men distinguished from their fellows by the absence of shield and plume the indunas pass on the orders to the captains and at once the socalled dance begins first they manoeuvre a little in absolute silence and changing their position with wonderful precision and rapidity but as their blood warms there comes a sound as of the hissing of ten thousand snakes and they charge and charge again a pause and the company of greys on our right throwing itself into open order flits past us like so many vultures to precipitate itself with a wild whistling cry on an opposing body which rushed to meet it they join issue they grapple on them swoops another company then another and another until nothing is to be distinguished except a mass of wild faces heaving of changing forms rolling and writhing twisting and turning and to all appearances killing and being killed whilst the whole air is pervaded with a shrill savage sibillation it is not always the same cry now it is the snorting of a troop of buffaloes now the shriek of the eagle as he seizes his prey anon the terrible cry of the nightprowler the lion and nowmore thrilling than allthe piercing wail of a woman but whatever the cry the cadence rises and falls in perfect time and unanimity no two mix with one another so as to mar the effect of each  again the combatants draw back and pause and then forth from the ranks springs a chosen warrior and hurls himself on an imaginary foe he darts hither and thither with wild activity he bounds five feet into the air like a panther he twists through the grass like a snake and finally making a tremendous effort he seems to slay his airy opponent and sinks exhausted to the ground the onlookers mark their approval or disapproval of the dancers feats by the rising and falling of the strange whistling noise which without the slightest apparent movement of face or lip issues from each mouth warrior after warrior comes forth in turn from the ranks and does battle with his invisible foe and receives his meed of applause the last warrior to spring forward with a wild yell is the future chief pagadis son and successor our friend of yesterday he stands with his shield in one hand and his lifted battleaxeborne by him alonein the other looking proudly around and rattling his lionclaw necklets whilst from every side bursts forth a storm of sibillating applause not from the soldiers only but from the old men women and children through all his fierce pantomimic dance it continues and when he has ended it redoubles then dies away but only to burst out again and again with unquenchable enthusiasm  in order probably to give the warriors a brief breathing space another song is now set up and it is marvellous the accuracy and knowledge of melody with which the parts are sung like a glee of catch the time being kept by a conductor who rushes from rank to rank beating time with a wand yet it is hardly like chanting rather like a weird sobbing melody with tones in it which range from the deepest bass to the shrillest treble it ends in a long sigh and then follows a scene a tumult a melee which hardly admits of a description in words the warriors engage in a mimic combat once more they charge retreat conquer and are defeated all in turns in front of them exciting them to new exertions with word and gesture undulate in a graceful dance of their own the intombis the young beauties of the tribe with green branches in their hands and all their store of savage finery glittering on their shapely limbs some of these maidens are really handsome and round them again dance the children armed with mimic spears and shields wild as seems the confusion through it all even the moments of highest excitement some sort of rough order is maintained more it would seem by mutual sounds than by word of command or sense of discipline  even a zulu warrior must sooner or later grow weary and at length the signal is given for the dance to end the companies are drawn up in order again and receive the praise and thanks of those in whose honour they had been called together to these compliments they reply in a novel and imposing fashion at a given signal each man begins to softly tap his oxhide shield with the handle of his spear producing a sound somewhat resembling the murmur of the distant sea by slow degrees it grows louder and louder till at length it rolls and reechoes from the hills like thunder and comes to its conclusion with a fierce quick rattle this is the royal warsalute of the zulus and is but rarely to be heard one more sonorous salute with voice and hand and then the warriors disappear as they came dropping swiftly and silently over the brow of the hill in companies in a few moments no sign or vestige of dance or dancers remained save before our eyes the welltrodden ground a few lingering girls laden with large calabashes of beer and in our ears some distant dying snatches of chants the singers were on their joyful way to slay and devour the oxen provided as a stimulus and reward for them by their chiefs liberality  when the last dusky figure had topped the rising ground over which the homeward path lay and had stood out for an instant against the flaming background of the western sun and then dropped as it were back into its native darkness beyond those gates of fire the old chief drew near he had divested himself of his heavy wardress and sat down amicably amongst us  ah he said taking the hand of sir theophilus shepstone and addressing him by his native name ah tsompseu tsompseu the seasons are many since first i held this your hand then we two were young and life lay bright before us and now you have grown great and are growing grey and i have grown very old i have eaten the corn of my time till only the cob is left for me to suck and ow it is bitter but it is well that i should grasp this your hand once more oh holder of the spirit of chaka before i sit down and sleep with my fathers ow i am glad        the reader must bear in mind that the zulu warrior is      buried sitting and in full wardress chaka or tchaka was      the founder of the zulu power  imposing as was this oldtime wardance it is not difficult to imagine the heights to which its savage grandeur must have swelled when it was heldas was the custom at each new yearat the kraal of cetywayo king of the zulus then 30000 warriors took part in it and a tragic interest was added to the fierce spectacle by the slaughter of many men it was in fact a great political opportunity for getting rid of the irreconcilable element from council and field then in the moment of wildest enthusiasm the witchfinder darted forward and lightly touched with a switch some doomed man sitting it may be quietly among the spectators or capering with his fellowsoldiers instantly he was led away and his place knew him no more  throughout the whole performance there was one remarkable and genuine feature the strong personal attachment of each member of the tribe to its chiefnot only to the fine old chief pagadi their leader in former years but to the head and leader for the years to come  it must be remembered that this system of chieftainship and its attendant law is to all the social bearings of south african native life what the tree is to its branches it has grown through long long ages amid a people slow to forget old traditions and equally slow to receive new ideas dependent on it are all the natives customs all his keen ideas of right and justice in it lies embodied his history of the past and from it springs his hope for the future surely even the most uncompromising of those marching under the banner of civilisation must hesitate before they condemn this deeprooted system to instant uprootal the various influences of the white man have eaten into the native system as rust into iron and their action will never cease till all be destroyed the bulwarks of barbarism its minor customs and minor laws are gone or exist only in name but its two great principles polygamy and chieftainship yet flourish and are strong time will undo his work and find for these also a place among forgotten things and it is the undoubted duty of us english who absorb people and territories in the high name of civilisation to be true to our principles and our aim and aid the great destroyer by any and every safe and justifiable means but between the legitimate means and the rash miscalculating uprootal of customs and principles which are not the less venerable and good in their way because they do not accord with our own present ideas there is a great gulf fixed such an uprootal might precipitate an outburst of the very evils it aims at destroying        i do not wish the remarks in this paper which was      written some years ago to be taken as representing my      present views on the natal native question formed after a      longer and more intimate acquaintance with its      peculiarities for which i beg to refer the reader to the      chapter on natalauthor  what the ultimate effect of our policy will be when the leaven has leavened the whole when the floodgates are lifted and this vast native population which contrary to all ordinary precedent does not melt away before the sun of the white mans power is let loose in its indolent thousands unrestrained save by the bonds of civilised law who can presume to say but this is not for present consideration subject to due precautions the path of progress must of necessity be followed and the results of such following left in the balancing hands of fate and the future
