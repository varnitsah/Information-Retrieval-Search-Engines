71530595	the chaperon  by henry james     chapter i    an old lady in a high drawingroom had had her chair moved close to the fire where she sat knitting and warming her knees  she was dressed in deep mourning her face had a faded nobleness tempered however by the somewhat illiberal compression assumed by her lips in obedience to something that was passing in her mind  she was far from the lamp but though her eyes were fixed upon her active needles she was not looking at them  what she really saw was quite another train of affairs  the room was spacious and dim the thick london fog had oozed into it even through its superior defences  it was full of dusky massive valuable things  the old lady sat motionless save for the regularity of her clicking needles which seemed as personal to her and as expressive as prolonged fingers  if she was thinking something out she was thinking it thoroughly  when she looked up on the entrance of a girl of twenty it might have been guessed that the appearance of this young lady was not an interruption of her meditation but rather a contribution to it  the young lady who was charming to behold was also in deep mourning which had a freshness if mourning can be fresh an air of having been lately put on  she went straight to the bell beside the chimneypiece and pulled it while in her other hand she held a sealed and directed letter  her companion glanced in silence at the letter then she looked still harder at her work  the girl hovered near the fireplace without speaking and after a due a dignified interval the butler appeared in response to the bell  the time had been sufficient to make the silence between the ladies seem long the younger one asked the butler to see that her letter should be posted and after he had gone out she moved vaguely about the room as if to give her grandmotherfor such was the elder personagea chance to begin a colloquy of which she herself preferred not to strike the first note  as equally with herself her companion was on the face of it capable of holding out the tension though it was already late in the evening might have lasted long  but the old lady after a little appeared to recognise a trifle ungraciously the girls superior resources  have you written to your mother  yes but only a few lines to tell her i shall come and see her in the morning  is that all youve got to say asked the grandmother  i dont quite know what you want me to say  i want you to say that youve made up your mind  yes ive done that granny  you intend to respect your fathers wishes  it depends upon what you mean by respecting them  i do justice to the feelings by which they were dictated  what do you mean by justice the old lady retorted  the girl was silent a moment then she said  youll see my idea of it  i see it already  youll go and live with her  i shall talk the situation over with her tomorrow and tell her that i think that will be best  best for her no doubt  whats best for her is best for me  and for your brother and sister  as the girl made no reply to this her grandmother went on  whats best for them is that you should acknowledge some responsibility in regard to them and considering how young they are try and do something for them  they must do as ive donethey must act for themselves  they have their means now and theyre free  free  theyre mere children  let me remind you that eric is older than i  he doesnt like his mother said the old lady as if that were an answer  i never said he did  and she adores him  oh your mothers adorations  dont abuse her now the girl rejoined after a pause  the old lady forbore to abuse her but she made up for it the next moment by saying  it will be dreadful for edith  what will be dreadful  your desertion of her  the desertions on her side  her consideration for her father does her honour  of course im a brute nen parlons plus said the girl  we must go our respective ways she added in a tone of extreme wisdom and philosophy  her grandmother straightened out her knitting and began to roll it up  be so good as to ring for my maid she said after a minute the young lady rang and there was another wait and another conscious hush  before the maid came her mistress remarked  of course then youll not come to me you know  what do you mean by coming to you  i cant receive you on that footing  shell not come with me if you mean that  i dont mean that said the old lady getting up as her maid came in  this attendant took her work from her gave her an arm and helped her out of the room while rose tramore standing before the fire and looking into it faced the idea that her grandmothers door would now under all circumstances be closed to her  she lost no time however in brooding over this anomaly  it only added energy to her determination to act  all she could do tonight was to go to bed for she felt utterly weary  she had been living in imagination in a prospective struggle and it had left her as exhausted as a real fight  moreover this was the culmination of a crisis of weeks of suspense of a long hard strain  her father had been laid in his grave five days before and that morning his will had been read  in the afternoon she had got edith off to st leonards with their aunt julia and then she had had a wretched talk with eric  lastly she had made up her mind to act in opposition to the formidable will to a clause which embodied if not exactly a provision a recommendation singularly emphatic  she went to bed and slept the sleep of the just  oh my dear how charming  i must take another house  it was in these words that her mother responded to the announcement rose had just formally made and with which she had vaguely expected to produce a certain dignity of effect  in the way of emotion there was apparently no effect at all and the girl was wise enough to know that this was not simply on account of the general line of non allusion taken by the extremely pretty woman before her who looked like her elder sister  mrs tramore had never manifested to her daughter the slightest consciousness that her position was peculiar but the recollection of something more than that fine policy was required to explain such a failure to appreciate roses sacrifice it was simply a fresh reminder that she had never appreciated anything that she was nothing but a tinted and stippled surface her situation was peculiar indeed  she had been the heroine of a scandal which had grown dim only because in the eyes of the london world it paled in the lurid light of the contemporaneous  that attention had been fixed on it for several days fifteen years before there had been a high relish of the vivid evidence as to his wifes misconduct with which in the divorcecourt charles tramore had judged well to regale a cynical public  the case was pronounced awfully bad and he obtained his decree  the folly of the wife had been inconceivable in spite of other examples  she had quitted her children she had followed the other fellow abroad  the other fellow hadnt married her not having had time  he had lost his life in the mediterranean by the capsizing of a boat before the prohibitory term had expired  mrs tramore had striven to extract from this accident something of the austerity of widowhood but her mourning only made her deviation more public she was a widow whose husband was awkwardly alive  she had not prowled about the continent on the classic lines she had come back to london to take her chance  but london would give her no chance would have nothing to say to her as many persons had remarked you could never tell how london would behave  it would not receive mrs tramore again on any terms and when she was spoken of which now was not often it was inveterately said of her that she went nowhere  apparently she had not the qualities for which london compounds though in the cases in which it does compound you may often wonder what these qualities are  she had not at any rate been successful  her lover was dead her husband was liked and her children were pitied for in payment for a topic london will parenthetically pity  it was thought interesting and magnanimous that charles tramore had not married again  the disadvantage to his children of the miserable story was thus left uncorrected and this rather oddly was counted as his sacrifice  his mother whose arrangements were elaborate looked after them a great deal and they enjoyed a mixture of laxity and discipline under the roof of their aunt miss tramore who was independent having for reasons that the two ladies had exhaustively discussed determined to lead her own life  she had set up a home at st leonards and that contracted shore had played a considerable part in the upbringing of the little tramores  they knew about their mother as the phrase was but they didnt know her which was naturally deemed more pathetic for them than for her  she had a house in chester square and an income and a victoriait served all purposes as she never went out in the eveningand flowers on her windowsills and a remarkable appearance of youth  the income was supposed to be in part the result of a bequest from the man for whose sake she had committed the error of her life and in the appearance of youth there was a slightly impertinent implication that it was a sort of afterglow of the same connection  her children as they grew older fortunately showed signs of some individuality of disposition  edith the second girl clung to her aunt julia eric the son clung frantically to polo while rose the elder daughter appeared to cling mainly to herself  collectively of course they clung to their father whose attitude in the family group however was casual and intermittent  he was charming and vague he was like a clever actor who often didnt come to rehearsal fortune which but for that one stroke had been generous to him had provided him with deputies and troubletakers as well as with whimsical opinions and a reputation for excellent taste and whist at his club and perpetual cigars on morocco sofas and a beautiful absence of purpose  nature had thrown in a remarkably fine hand which he sometimes passed over his childrens heads when they were glossy from the nursery brush  on roses eighteenth birthday he said to her that she might go to see her mother on condition that her visits should be limited to an hour each time and to four in the year  she was to go alone the other children were not included in the arrangement  this was the result of a visit that he himself had paid his repudiated wife at her urgent request their only encounter during the fifteen years  the girl knew as much as this from her aunt julia who was full of telltale secrecies  she availed herself eagerly of the license and in course of the period that elapsed before her fathers death she spent with mrs tramore exactly eight hours by the watch  her father who was as inconsistent and disappointing as he was amiable spoke to her of her mother only once afterwards  this occasion had been the sequel of her first visit and he had made no use of it to ask what she thought of the personality in chester square or how she liked it  he had only said did she take you out and when rose answered yes she put me straight into a carriage and drove me up and down bond street had rejoined sharply see that that never occurs again  it never did but once was enough every one they knew having happened to be in bond street at that particular hour  after this the periodical interview took place in private in mrs tramores beautiful little wasted drawingroom  rose knew that rare as these occasions were her mother would not have kept her all to herself had there been anybody she could have shown her to  but in the poor ladys social void there was no one she had after all her own correctness and she consistently preferred isolation to inferior contacts  so her daughter was subjected only to the maternal it was not necessary to be definite in qualifying that  the girl had by this time a collection of ideas gathered by impenetrable processes she had tasted in the ostracism of her ambiguous parent of the acrid fruit of the tree of knowledge  she not only had an approximate vision of what every one had done but she had a private judgment for each case  she had a particular vision of her father which did not interfere with his being dear to her but which was directly concerned in her resolution after his death to do the special thing he had expressed the wish she should not do  in the general estimate her grandmother and her grandmothers money had their place and the strong probability that any enjoyment of the latter commodity would now be withheld from her  it included ediths marked inclination to receive the law and doubtless eventually a more substantial memento from miss tramore and opened the question whether her own course might not contribute to make her sisters appear heartless  the answer to this question however would depend on the success that might attend her own which would very possibly be small  erics attitude was eminently simple he didnt care to know people who didnt know his people  if his mother should ever get back into society perhaps he would take her up  rose tramore had decided to do what she could to bring this consummation about and strangely enoughso mixed were her superstitions and her heresiesa large part of her motive lay in the value she attached to such a consecration  of her mother intrinsically she thought very little now and if her eyes were fixed on a special achievement it was much more for the sake of that achievement and to satisfy a latent energy that was in her than because her heart was wrung by this sufferer  her heart had not been wrung at all though she had quite held it out for the experience  her purpose was a pious game but it was still essentially a game  among the ideas i have mentioned she had her idea of triumph  she had caught the inevitable note the pitch on her very first visit to chester square  she had arrived there in intense excitement and her excitement was left on her hands in a manner that reminded her of a difficult air she had once heard sung at the opera when no one applauded the performer  that flatness had made her sick and so did this in another way  a part of her agitation proceeded from the fact that her aunt julia had told her in the manner of a burst of confidence something she was not to repeat that she was in appearance the very image of the lady in chester square  the motive that prompted this declaration was between aunt julia and her conscience but it was a great emotion to the girl to find her entertainer so beautiful  she was tall and exquisitely slim she had hair more exactly to rose tramores taste than any other she had ever seen even to every detail in the way it was dressed and a complexion and a figure of the kind that are always spoken of as lovely  her eyes were irresistible and so were her clothes though the clothes were perhaps a little more precisely the right thing than the eyes  her appearance was marked to her daughters sense by the highest distinction though it may be mentioned that this had never been the opinion of all the world  it was a revelation to rose that she herself might look a little like that  she knew however that aunt julia had not seen her deposed sisterinlaw for a long time and she had a general impression that mrs tramore was today a more complete productionfor instance as regarded her air of youththan she had ever been  there was no excitement on her sidethat was all her visitors there was no emotionthat was excluded by the plan to say nothing of conditions more primal  rose had from the first a glimpse of her mothers plan it was to mention nothing and imply nothing neither to acknowledge to explain nor to extenuate  she would leave everything to her child with her child she was secure  she only wanted to get back into society she would leave even that to her child whom she treated not as a highstrung and heroic daughter a creature of exaltation of devotion but as a new charming clever useful friend a little younger than herself  already on that first day she had talked about dressmakers  of course poor thing it was to be remembered that in her circumstances there were not many things she could talk about  she wants to go out again thats the only thing in the wide world she wants rose had promptly compendiously said to herself  there had been a sequel to this observation uttered in intense engrossment in her own room half an hour before she had on the important evening made known her decision to her grandmother then ill take her out  shell drag you down shell drag you down julia tramore permitted herself to remark to her niece the next day in a tone of feverish prophecy  as the girls own theory was that all the dragging there might be would be upward and moreover administered by herself she could look at her aunt with a cold and inscrutable eye  very well then i shall be out of your sight from the pinnacle you occupy and i shant trouble you  do you reproach me for my disinterested exertions for the way ive toiled over you the way ive lived for you miss tramore demanded  dont reproach me for being kind to my mother and i wont reproach you for anything  shell keep you out of everythingshell make you miss everything miss tramore continued  then shell make me miss a great deal thats odious said the girl  youre too young for such extravagances her aunt declared  and yet edith who is younger than i seems to be too old for them how do you arrange that  my mothers society will make me older rose replied  dont speak to me of your mother you have no mother  then if im an orphan i must settle things for myself  do you justify her do you approve of her cried miss tramore who was inferior to her niece in capacity for retort and whose limitations made the girl appear pert  rose looked at her a moment in silence then she said turning away i think shes charming  and do you propose to become charming in the same manner  her manner is perfect it would be an excellent model  but i cant discuss my mother with you  youll have to discuss her with some other people miss tramore proclaimed going out of the room  rose wondered whether this were a general or a particular vaticination  there was something her aunt might have meant by it but her aunt rarely meant the best thing she might have meant  miss tramore had come up from st leonards in response to a telegram from her own parent for an occasion like the present brought with it for a few hours a certain relaxation of their dissent  do what you can to stop her the old lady had said but her daughter found that the most she could do was not much  they both had a baffled sense that rose had thought the question out a good deal further than they and this was particularly irritating to mrs tramore as consciously the cleverer of the two  a question thought out as far as she could think it had always appeared to her to have performed its human uses she had never encountered a ghost emerging from that extinction their great contention was that rose would cut herself off and certainly if she wasnt afraid of that she wasnt afraid of anything julia tramore could only tell her mother how little the girl was afraid  she was already prepared to leave the house taking with her the possessions or her share of them that had accumulated there during her fathers illness  there had been a going and coming of her maid a thumping about of boxes an ordering of fourwheelers it appeared to old mrs tramore that something of the objectionableness the indecency of her granddaughters prospective connection had already gathered about the place  it was a violation of the decorum of bereavement which was still fresh there and from the indignant gloom of the mistress of the house you might have inferred not so much that the daughter was about to depart as that the mother was about to arrive  there had been no conversation on the dreadful subject at luncheon for at luncheon at mrs tramores her son never came to it there were always even after funerals and other miseries stray guests of both sexes whose policy it was to be cheerful and superficial  rose had sat down as if nothing had happenednothing worse that is than her fathers death but no one had spoken of anything that any one else was thinking of  before she left the house a servant brought her a message from her grandmotherthe old lady desired to see her in the drawingroom she had on her bonnet and she went down as if she were about to step into her cab  mrs tramore sat there with her eternal knitting from which she forebore even to raise her eyes as after a silence that seemed to express the fulness of her reprobation while rose stood motionless she began  i wonder if you really understand what youre doing  i think so  im not so stupid  i never thought you were but i dont know what to make of you now youre giving up everything  the girl was tempted to inquire whether her grandmother called herself everything but she checked this question answering instead that she knew she was giving up much  youre taking a step of which you will feel the effect to the end of your days mrs tramore went on  in a good conscience i heartily hope said rose  your fathers conscience was good enough for his mother it ought to be good enough for his daughter  rose sat downshe could afford toas if she wished to be very attentive and were still accessible to argument  but this demonstration only ushered in after a moment the surprising words i dont think papa had any conscience  what in the name of all thats unnatural do you mean mrs tramore cried over her glasses  the dearest and best creature that ever lived  he was kind he had charming impulses he was delightful  but he never reflected  mrs tramore stared as if at a language she had never heard a farrago a galimatias  her life was made up of items but she had never had to deal intellectually with a fine shade  then while her needles which had paused an instant began to fly again she rejoined  do you know what you are my dear  youre a dreadful little prig  where do you pick up such talk  of course i dont mean to judge between them rose pursued  i can only judge between my mother and myself  papa couldnt judge for me  and with this she got up  one would think you were horrid  i never thought so before  thank you for that  youre embarking on a struggle with society continued mrs tramore indulging in an unusual flight of oratory  society will put you in your place  hasnt it too many other things to do asked the girl  this question had an ingenuity which led her grandmother to meet it with a merely provisional and somewhat sketchy answer  your ignorance would be melancholy if your behaviour were not so insane  oh no i know perfectly what shell do rose replied almost gaily  shell drag me down  she wont even do that the old lady declared contradictiously shell keep you forever in the same dull hole  i shall come and see you granny when i want something more lively  you may come if you like but youll come no further than the door if you leave this house now you dont enter it again  rose hesitated a moment  do you really mean that  you may judge whether i choose such a time to joke  goodbye then said the girl  goodbye  rose quitted the room successfully enough but on the other side of the door on the landing she sank into a chair and buried her face in her hands  she had burst into tears and she sobbed there for a moment trying hard to recover herself so as to go downstairs without showing any traces of emotion passing before the servants and again perhaps before aunt julia  mrs tramore was too old to cry she could only drop her knitting and for a long time sit with her head bowed and her eyes closed  rose had reckoned justly with her aunt julia there were no footmen but this vigilant virgin was posted at the foot of the stairs  she offered no challenge however she only said  theres some one in the parlour who wants to see you  the girl demanded a name but miss tramore only mouthed inaudibly and winked and waved  rose instantly reflected that there was only one man in the world her aunt would look such deep things about  captain jay her own eyes asked while miss tramores were those of a conspirator  they were for a moment the only embarrassed eyes rose had encountered that day  they contributed to make aunt julias further response evasive after her niece inquired if she had communicated in advance with this visitor  miss tramore merely said that he had been upstairs with her motherhadnt she mentioned itand had been waiting for her  she thought herself acute in not putting the question of the girls seeing him before her as a favour to him or to herself she presented it as a duty and wound up with the proposition  its not fair to him its not kind not to let him speak to you before you go  what does he want to say rose demanded  go in and find out  she really knew for she had found out before but after standing uncertain an instant she went in  the parlour was the name that had always been borne by a spacious sittingroom downstairs an apartment occupied by her father during his frequent phases of residence in hill streetepisodes increasingly frequent after his house in the country had in consequence as rose perfectly knew of his spending too much money been disposed of at a sacrifice which he always characterised as horrid  he had been left with the place in hertfordshire and his mother with the london house on the general understanding that they would change about but during the last years the community had grown more rigid mainly at his mothers expense the parlour was full of his memory and his habits and his thingshis books and pictures and bibelots objects that belonged now to eric rose had sat in it for hours since his death it was the place in which she could still be nearest to him  but she felt far from him as captain jay rose erect on her opening the door  this was a very different presence  he had not liked captain jay  she herself had but not enough to make a great complication of her fathers coldness this afternoon however she foresaw complications  at the very outset for instance she was not pleased with his having arranged such a surprise for her with her grandmother and her aunt  it was probably aunt julia who had sent for him her grandmother wouldnt have done it  it placed him immediately on their side and rose was almost as disappointed at this as if she had not known it was quite where he would naturally be  he had never paid her a special visit but if that was what he wished to do why shouldnt he have waited till she should be under her mothers roof  she knew the reason but she had an angry prospect of enjoyment in making him express it  she liked him enough after all if it were measured by the idea of what she could make him do  in bertram jay the elements were surprisingly mingled you would have gone astray in reading him if you had counted on finding the complements of some of his qualities  he would not however have struck you in the least as incomplete for in every case in which you didnt find the complement you would have found the contradiction he was in the royal engineers and was tall lean and high shouldered  he looked every inch a soldier yet there were people who considered that he had missed his vocation in not becoming a parson  he took a public interest in the spiritual life of the army other persons still on closer observation would have felt that his most appropriate field was neither the army nor the church but simply the worldthe social successful worldly world  if he had a sword in one hand and a bible in the other he had a court guide concealed somewhere about his person  his profile was hard and handsome his eyes were both cold and kind his dark straight hair was imperturbably smooth and prematurely streaked with grey  there was nothing in existence that he didnt take seriously  he had a firstrate power of work and an ambition as minutely organised as a german plan of invasion  his only real recreation was to go to church but he went to parties when he had time  if he was in love with rose tramore this was distracting to him only in the same sense as his religion and it was included in that department of his extremely subdivided life  his religion indeed was of an encroaching annexing sort  seen from in front he looked diffident and blank but he was capable of exposing himself in a way to speak only of the paths of peace wholly inconsistent with shyness  he had a passion for instance for openair speaking but was not thought on the whole to excel in it unless he could help himself out with a hymn  in conversation he kept his eyes on you with a kind of colourless candour as if he had not understood what you were saying and in a fashion that made many people turn red waited before answering  this was only because he was considering their remarks in more relations than they had intended  he had in his face no expression whatever save the one just mentioned and was in his profession already very distinguished  he had seen rose tramore for the first time on a sunday of the previous march at a house in the country at which she was staying with her father and five weeks later he had made her by letter an offer of marriage  she showed her father the letter of course and he told her that it would give him great pleasure that she should send captain jay about his business  my dear child he said we must really have some one who will be better fun than that  rose had declined the honour very considerately and kindly but not simply because her father wished it  she didnt herself wish to detach this flower from the stem though when the young man wrote again to express the hope that he might hopeso long was he willing to waitand ask if he might not still sometimes see her she answered even more indulgently than at first  she had shown her father her former letter but she didnt show him this one she only told him what it contained submitting to him also that of her correspondent  captain jay moreover wrote to mr tramore who replied sociably but so vaguely that he almost neglected the subject under discussiona communication that made poor bertram ponder long he could never get to the bottom of the superficial and all the proprieties and conventions of life were profound to him fortunately for him old mrs tramore liked him he was satisfactory to her longsightedness so that a relation was established under cover of which he still occasionally presented himself in hill streetpresented himself nominally to the mistress of the house  he had had scruples about the veracity of his visits but he had disposed of them he had scruples about so many things that he had had to invent a general way to dig a central drain  julia tramore happened to meet him when she came up to town and she took a view of him more benevolent than her usual estimate of people encouraged by her mother  the fear of agreeing with that lady was a motive but there was a stronger one in this particular case in the fear of agreeing with her niece who had rejected him  his situation might be held to have improved when mr tramore was taken so gravely ill that with regard to his recovery those about him left their eyes to speak for their lips and in the light of the poor gentlemans recent death it was doubtless better than it had ever been  he was only a quarter of an hour with the girl but this gave him time to take the measure of it  after he had spoken to her about her bereavement very much as an especially mild missionary might have spoken to a beautiful polynesian he let her know that he had learned from her companions the very strong step she was about to take  this led to their spending together ten minutes which to her mind threw more light on his character than anything that had ever passed between them  she had always felt with him as if she were standing on an edge looking down into something decidedly deep  today the impression of the perpendicular shaft was there but it was rather an abyss of confusion and disorder than the large bright space in which she had figured everything as ranged and pigeonholed presenting the appearance of the labelled shelves and drawers at a chemists  he discussed without an invitation to discuss he appealed without a right to appeal  he was nothing but a suitor tolerated after dismissal but he took strangely for granted a participation in her affairs  he assumed all sorts of things that made her draw back  he implied that there was everything now to assist them in arriving at an agreement since she had never informed him that he was positively objectionable but that this symmetry would be spoiled if she should not be willing to take a little longer to think of certain consequences  she was greatly disconcerted when she saw what consequences he meant and at his reminding her of them  what on earth was the use of a lover if he was to speak only like ones grandmother and ones aunt  he struck her as much in love with her and as particularly careful at the same time as to what he might say he never mentioned her mother he only alluded indirectly but earnestly to the step  he disapproved of it altogether took an unexpectedly prudent politic view of it  he evidently also believed that she would be dragged down in other words that she would not be asked out  it was his idea that her mother would contaminate her so that he should find himself interested in a young person discredited and virtually unmarriageable  all this was more obvious to him than the consideration that a daughter should be merciful  where was his religion if he understood mercy so little and where were his talent and his courage if he were so miserably afraid of trumpery social penalties  roses heart sank when she reflected that a man supposed to be firstrate hadnt guessed that rather than not do what she could for her mother she would give up all the engineers in the world  she became aware that she probably would have been moved to place her hand in his on the spot if he had come to her saying your idea is the right one put it through at every cost  she couldnt discuss this with him though he impressed her as having too much at stake for her to treat him with mere disdain  she sickened at the revelation that a gentleman could see so much in mere vulgarities of opinion and though she uttered as few words as possible conversing only in sad smiles and headshakes and in intercepted movements toward the door she happened in some unguarded lapse from her reticence to use the expression that she was disappointed in him  he caught at it and seeming to drop his fieldglass pressed upon her with nearer tenderer eyes  can i be so happy as to believe then that you had thought of me with some confidence with some faith  if you didnt suppose so what is the sense of this visit rose asked  one can be faithful without reciprocity said the young man  i regard you in a light which makes me want to protect you even if i have nothing to gain by it  yet you speak as if you thought you might keep me for yourself  for yourself  i dont want you to suffer  nor to suffer yourself by my doing so said rose looking down  ah if you would only marry me next month he broke out inconsequently  and give up going to mamma rose waited to see if he would say what need that matter  cant your mother come to us  but he said nothing of the sort he only answered   she surely would be sorry to interfere with the exercise of any other affection which i might have the bliss of believing that you are now free in however small a degree to entertain  rose knew that her mother wouldnt be sorry at all but she contented herself with rejoining her hand on the door  goodbye  i shant suffer  im not afraid  you dont know how terrible how cruel the world can be  yes i do know  i know everything  the declaration sprang from her lips in a tone which made him look at her as he had never looked before as if he saw something new in her face as if he had never yet known her  he hadnt displeased her so much but that she would like to give him that impression and since she felt that she was doing so she lingered an instant for the purpose  it enabled her to see further that he turned red then to become aware that a carriage had stopped at the door  captain jays eyes from where he stood fell upon this arrival and the nature of their glance made rose step forward to look  her mother sat there brilliant conspicuous in the eternal victoria and the footman was already sounding the knocker  it had been no part of the arrangement that she should come to fetch her it had been out of the questiona stroke in such bad taste as would have put rose in the wrong  the girl had never dreamed of it but somehow suddenly perversely she was glad of it now she even hoped that her grandmother and her aunt were looking out upstairs  my mother has come for me  goodbye she repeated but this time her visitor had got between her and the door  listen to me before you go  i will give you a lifes devotion the young man pleaded  he really barred the way  she wondered whether her grandmother had told him that if her flight were not prevented she would forfeit money  then vividly it came over her that this would be what he was occupied with  i shall never think of youlet me go she cried with passion  captain jay opened the door but rose didnt see his face and in a moment she was out of the house  aunt julia who was sure to have been hovering had taken flight before the profanity of the knock  heavens dear where did you get your mourning the lady in the victoria asked of her daughter as they drove away    chapter ii    lady maresfield had given her boy a push in his plump back and had said to him go and speak to her now its your chance  she had for a long time wanted this scion to make himself audible to rose tramore but the opportunity was not easy to come by  the case was complicated  lady maresfield had four daughters of whom only one was married  it so happened moreover that this one mrs vaughan vesey the only person in the world her mother was afraid of was the most to be reckoned with  the honourable guy was in appearance all his mothers child though he was really a simpler soul  he was large and pink large that is as to everything but the eyes which were diminishing points and pink as to everything but the hair which was comparable faintly to the hue of the richer rose  he had also it must be conceded very small neat teeth which made his smile look like a young ladys  he had no wish to resemble any such person but he was perpetually smiling and he smiled more than ever as he approached rose tramore who looking altogether to his mind as a pretty girl should and wearing a soft white operacloak over a softer black dress leaned alone against the wall of the vestibule at covent garden while a few paces off an old gentleman engaged her mother in conversation  madame patti had been singing and they were all waiting for their carriages  to their ears at present came a vociferation of names and a rattle of wheels  the air through banging doors entered in damp warm gusts heavy with the stale slightly sweet taste of the london season when the london season is overripe and spoiling  guy mangler had only three minutes to reestablish an interrupted acquaintance with our young lady  he reminded her that he had danced with her the year before and he mentioned that he knew her brother his mother had lately been to see old mrs tramore but this he did not mention not being aware of it  that visit had produced on lady maresfields part a private crisis engendered ideas  one of them was that the grandmother in hill street had really forgiven the wilful girl much more than she admitted  another was that there would still be some money for rose when the others should come into theirs  still another was that the others would come into theirs at no distant date the old lady was so visibly going to pieces  there were several more besides as for instance that rose had already fifteen hundred a year from her father  the figure had been betrayed in hill street it was part of the proof of mrs tramores decrepitude  then there was an equal amount that her mother had to dispose of and on which the girl could absolutely count though of course it might involve much waiting as the mother a person of gross insensibility evidently wouldnt die of coldshouldering equally definite to do it justice was the conception that rose was in truth remarkably good looking and that what she had undertaken to do showed and would show even should it fail cleverness of the right sort  cleverness of the right sort was exactly the quality that lady maresfield prefigured as indispensable in a young lady to whom she should marry her second son over whose own deficiencies she flung the veil of a maternal theory that his cleverness was of a sort that was wrong  those who knew him less well were content to wish that he might not conceal it for such a scruple  this enumeration of his mothers views does not exhaust the list and it was in obedience to one too profound to be uttered even by the historian that after a very brief delay she decided to move across the crowded lobby  her daughter bessie was the only one with her maggie was dining with the vaughanveseys and fanny was not of an age  mrs tramore the younger showed only an admirable backher face was to her old gentlemanand bessie had drifted to some other people so that it was comparatively easy for lady maresfield to say to rose in a moment  my dear child are you never coming to see us  we shall be delighted to come if youll ask us rose smiled  lady maresfield had been prepared for the plural number and she was a woman whom it took many plurals to disconcert  im sure guy is longing for another dance with you she rejoined with the most unblinking irrelevance  im afraid were not dancing again quite yet said rose glancing at her mothers exposed shoulders but speaking as if they were muffled in crape  lady maresfield leaned her head on one side and seemed almost wistful  not even at my sisters ball  shes to have something next week  shell write to you  rose tramore on the spot looking bright but vague turned three or four things over in her mind  she remembered that the sister of her interlocutress was the proverbially rich mrs bray a bankeress or a breweress or a builderess who had so big a house that she couldnt fill it unless she opened her doors or her mouth very wide  rose had learnt more about london society during these lonely months with her mother than she had ever picked up in hill street  the younger mrs tramore was a mine of commerages and she had no need to go out to bring home the latest intelligence  at any rate mrs bray might serve as the end of a wedge  oh i dare say we might think of that rose said  it would be very kind of your sister  guyll think of it wont you guy asked lady maresfield  rather guy responded with an intonation as fine as if he had learnt it at a music hall while at the same moment the name of his mothers carriage was bawled through the place  mrs tramore had parted with her old gentleman she turned again to her daughter nothing occurred but what always occurred which was exactly this absence of everythinga universal lapse  she didnt exist even for a second to any recognising eye  the people who looked at herof course there were plenty of thosewere only the people who didnt exist for hers  lady maresfield surged away on her sons arm  it was this noble matron herself who wrote the next day inclosing a card of invitation from mrs bray and expressing the hope that rose would come and dine and let her ladyship take her  she should have only one of her own girls gwendolen vesey was to take the other rose handed both the note and the card in silence to her mother the latter exhibited only the name of miss tramore  you had much better go dear her mother said in answer to which miss tramore slowly tore up the documents looking with clear meditative eyes out of the window  her mother always said you had better gothere had been other incidentsand rose had never even once taken account of the observation  she would make no first advances only plenty of second ones and condoning no discrimination would treat no omission as venial  she would keep all concessions till afterwards then she would make them one by one  fighting society was quite as hard as her grandmother had said it would be but there was a tension in it which made the dreariness vibratethe dreariness of such a winter as she had just passed  her companion had cried at the end of it and she had cried all through only her tears had been private while her mothers had fallen once for all at luncheon on the bleak easter mondayproduced by the way a silent survey of the deadly square brought home to her that every creature but themselves was out of town and having tremendous fun  rose felt that it was useless to attempt to explain simply by her mourning this severity of solitude for if people didnt go to parties at least a few didnt for six months after their father died this was the very time other people took for coming to see them  it was not too much to say that during this first winter of roses period with her mother she had no communication whatever with the world  it had the effect of making her take to reading the new american books  she wanted to see how girls got on by themselves  she had never read so much before and there was a legitimate indifference in it when topics failed with her mother  they often failed after the first days and then while she bent over instructive volumes this lady dressed as if for an impending function sat on the sofa and watched her  rose was not embarrassed by such an appearance for she could reflect that a little before her companion had not even a girl who had taken refuge in queer researches to look at  she was moreover used to her mothers attitude by this time  she had her own description of it it was the attitude of waiting for the carriage  if they didnt go out it was not that mrs tramore was not ready in time and rose had even an alarmed prevision of their some day always arriving first mrs tramores conversation at such moments was abrupt inconsequent and personal  she sat on the edge of sofas and chairs and glanced occasionally at the fit of her gloves she was perpetually gloved and the fit was a thing it was melancholy to see wasted as people do who are expecting guests to dinner  rose used almost to fancy herself at times a perfunctory husband on the other side of the fire  what she was not yet used tothere was still a charm in itwas her mothers extraordinary tact  during the years they lived together they never had a discussion a circumstance all the more remarkable since if the girl had a reason for sparing her companion that of being sorry for her mrs tramore had none for sparing her child she only showed in doing so a happy instinctthe happiest thing about her  she took in perfection a course which represented everything and covered everything she utterly abjured all authority she testified to her abjuration in hourly ingenious touching ways in this manner nothing had to be talked over which was a mercy all round  the tears on easter monday were merely a nervous gust to help show she was not a christmas doll from the burlington arcade and there was no lifting up of the repentant magdalen no uttered remorse for the former abandonment of children  of the way she could treat her children her demeanour to this one was an example it was an uninterrupted appeal to her eldest daughter for direction  she took the law from rose in every circumstance and if you had noticed these ladies without knowing their history you would have wondered what tie was fine enough to make maturity so respectful to youth  no mother was ever so filial as mrs tramore and there had never been such a difference of position between sisters  not that the elder one fawned which would have been fearful she only renounced whatever she had to renounce  if the amount was not much she at any rate made no scene over it  her hand was so light that rose said of her secretly in vague glances at the past no wonder people liked her  she never characterised the old element of interference with her mothers respectability more definitely than as people  they were people it was true for whom gentleness must have been everything and who didnt demand a variety of interests  the desire to go out was the one passion that even a closer acquaintance with her parent revealed to rose tramore  she marvelled at its strength in the light of the poor ladys history  there was comedy enough in this unquenchable flame on the part of a woman who had known such misery  she had drunk deep of every dishonour but the bitter cup had left her with a taste for lighted candles for squeezing up staircases and hooking herself to the human elbow  rose had a vision of the future years in which this taste would grow with restored exerciseof her mother in a longtailed dress jogging on and on and on jogging further and further from her sins through a century of the morning post and down the fashionable avenue of time  she herself would then be very oldshe herself would be dead  mrs tramore would cover a span of life for which such an allowance of sin was small  the girl could laugh indeed now at that theory of her being dragged down  if one thing were more present to her than another it was the very desolation of their propriety  as she glanced at her companion it sometimes seemed to her that if she had been a bad woman she would have been worse than that  there were compensations for being cut which mrs tramore too much neglected  the lonely old lady in hill streetrose thought of her that way now was the one person to whom she was ready to say that she would come to her on any terms  she wrote this to her three times over and she knocked still oftener at her door  but the old lady answered no letters if rose had remained in hill street it would have been her own function to answer them and at the door the butler whom the girl had known for ten years considered her when he told her his mistress was not at home quite as he might have considered a young person who had come about a place and of whose eligibility he took a negative view  that was roses one pang that she probably appeared rather heartless  her aunt julia had gone to florence with edith for the winter on purpose to make her appear more so for miss tramore was still the person most scandalised by her secession  edith and she doubtless often talked over in florence the destitution of the aged victim in hill street  eric never came to see his sister because being full both of family and of personal feeling he thought she really ought to have stayed with his grandmother  if she had had such an appurtenance all to herself she might have done what she liked with it but he couldnt forgive such a want of consideration for anything of his  there were moments when rose would have been ready to take her hand from the plough and insist upon reintegration if only the fierce voice of the old house had allowed people to look her up  but she read ever so clearly that her grandmother had made this a question of loyalty to seventy years of virtue  mrs tramores forlornness didnt prevent her drawing room from being a very public place in which rose could hear certain words reverberate  leave her alone its the only way to see how long shell hold out  the old womans visitors were people who didnt wish to quarrel and the girl was conscious that if they had not let her alonethat is if they had come to her from her grandmothershe might perhaps not have held out  she had no friends quite of her own she had not been brought up to have them and it would not have been easy in a house which two such persons as her father and his mother divided between them  her father disapproved of crude intimacies and all the intimacies of youth were crude  he had married at fiveandtwenty and could testify to such a truth rose felt that she shared even captain jay with her grandmother she had seen what he was worth  moreover she had spoken to him at that last moment in hill street in a way which taken with her former refusal made it impossible that he should come near her again  she hoped he went to see his protectress  he could be a kind of substitute and administer comfort  it so happened however that the day after she threw lady maresfields invitation into the wastepaper basket she received a visit from a certain mrs donovan whom she had occasionally seen in hill street  she vaguely knew this lady for a busybody but she was in a situation which even busybodies might alleviate  mrs donovan was poor but honestso scrupulously honest that she was perpetually returning visits she had never received  she was always clad in weatherbeaten sealskin and had an odd air of being prepared for the worst which was borne out by her denying that she was irish  she was of the english donovans  dear child wont you go out with me she asked  rose looked at her a moment and then rang the bell  she spoke of something else without answering the question and when the servant came she said  please tell mrs tramore that mrs donovan has come to see her  oh thatll be delightful only you mustnt tell your grandmother the visitor exclaimed  tell her what  that i come to see your mamma  you dont said rose  sure i hoped youd introduce me cried mrs donovan compromising herself in her embarrassment  its not necessary you knew her once  indeed and ive known every one once the visitor confessed  mrs tramore when she came in was charming and exactly right she greeted mrs donovan as if she had met her the week before last giving her daughter such a new illustration of her tact that rose again had the idea that it was no wonder people had liked her  the girl grudged mrs donovan so fresh a morsel as a description of her mother at home rejoicing that she would be inconvenienced by having to keep the story out of hill street  her mother went away before mrs donovan departed and rose was touched by guessing her reason the thought that since even this circuitous personage had been moved to come the two might if left together invent some remedy  rose waited to see what mrs donovan had in fact invented  you wont come out with me then  come out with you  my daughters are married  you know im a lone woman  it would be an immense pleasure to me to have so charming a creature as yourself to present to the world  i go out with my mother said rose after a moment  yes but sometimes when shes not inclined  she goes everywhere she wants to go rose continued uttering the biggest fib of her life and only regretting it should be wasted on mrs donovan  ah but do you go everywhere you want the lady asked sociably  one goes even to places one hates  every one does that  oh what i go through this social martyr cried  then she laid a persuasive hand on the girls arm  let me show you at a few places first and then well see  ill bring them all here  i dont think i understand you replied rose though in mrs donovans words she perfectly saw her own theory of the case reflected  for a quarter of a minute she asked herself whether she might not after all do so much evil that good might come  mrs donovan would take her out the next day and be thankful enough to annex such an attraction as a pretty girl  various consequences would ensue and the long delay would be shortened her mothers drawingroom would resound with the clatter of teacups  mrs brays having some big thing next week come with me there and ill show you what i mane mrs donovan pleaded  i see what you mane rose answered brushing away her temptation and getting up  im much obliged to you  you know youre wrong my dear said her interlocutress with angry little eyes  im not going to mrs brays  ill get you a kyard itll only cost me a penny stamp  ive got one said the girl smiling  do you mean a penny stamp  mrs donovan especially at departure always observed all the forms of amity  you cant do it alone my darling she declared  shall they call you a cab rose asked  ill pick one up  i choose my horse  you know you require your start her visitor went on  excuse my mother was roses only reply  dont mention it  come to me when you need me  youll find me in the red book  its awfully kind of you  mrs donovan lingered a moment on the threshold  who will you have now my child she appealed  i wont have any one  rose turned away blushing for her  she came on speculation she said afterwards to mrs tramore  her mother looked at her a moment in silence  you can do it if you like you know  rose made no direct answer to this observation she remarked instead see what our quiet life allows us to escape  we dont escape it  she has been here an hour  once in twenty years  we might meet her three times a day  oh id take her with the rest sighed mrs tramore while her daughter recognised that what her companion wanted to do was just what mrs donovan was doing  mrs donovans life was her ideal  on a sunday ten days later rose went to see one of her old governesses of whom she had lost sight for some time and who had written to her that she was in london unoccupied and ill  this was just the sort of relation into which she could throw herself now with inordinate zeal the idea of it however not preventing a foretaste of the queer expression in the excellent ladys face when she should mention with whom she was living  while she smiled at this picture she threw in another joke asking herself if miss hack could be held in any degree to constitute the nucleus of a circle  she would come to see her in any eventcome the more the further she was dragged down  sunday was always a difficult day with the two ladiesthe afternoons made it so apparent that they were not frequented  her mother it is true was comprised in the habits of two or three old gentlemenshe had for a long time avoided male friends of less than seventywho disliked each other enough to make the room when they were there at once crack with pressure  rose sat for a long time with miss hack doing conscientious justice to the conception that there could be troubles in the world worse than her own and when she came back her mother was alone but with a story to tell of a long visit from mr guy mangler who had waited and waited for her return hes in love with you hes coming again on tuesday mrs tramore announced  did he say so  that hes coming back on tuesday  no that hes in love with me  he didnt need when he stayed two hours  with you  its you hes in love with mamma  that will do as well laughed mrs tramore  for all the use we shall make of him she added in a moment  we shall make great use of him  his mother sent him  oh shell never come  then he shant said rose  yet he was admitted on the tuesday and after she had given him his tea mrs tramore left the young people alone  rose wished she hadntshe herself had another view at any rate she disliked her mothers view which she had easily guessed  mr mangler did nothing but say how charming he thought his hostess of the sunday and what a tremendously jolly visit he had had  he didnt remark in so many words i had no idea your mother was such a good sort but this was the spirit of his simple discourse  rose liked it at firsta little of it gratified her then she thought there was too much of it for good taste  she had to reflect that one does what one can and that mr mangler probably thought he was delicate  he wished to convey that he desired to make up to her for the injustice of society  why shouldnt her mother receive gracefully she asked not audibly and who had ever said she didnt  mr mangler had a great deal to say about the disappointment of his own parent over miss tramores not having come to dine with them the night of his aunts ball  lady maresfield knows why i didnt come rose answered at last  ah now but i dont you know cant you tell me asked the young man  it doesnt matter if your mothers clear about it  oh but why make such an awful mystery of it when im dying to know  he talked about this he chaffed her about it for the rest of his visit  he had at last found a topic after his own heart  if her mother considered that he might be the emblem of their redemption he was an engine of the most primitive construction  he stayed and stayed he struck rose as on the point of bringing out something for which he had not quite as he would have said the cheek  sometimes she thought he was going to begin  by the way my mother told me to propose to you  at other moments he seemed charged with the admission  i say of course i really know what youre trying to do for her nodding at the door  therefore hadnt we better speak of it frankly so that i can help you with my mother and more particularly with my sister gwendolen whos the difficult one  the fact is you see they wont do anything for nothing  if youll accept me theyll call but they wont call without something down  mr mangler departed without their speaking frankly and rose tramore had a hot hour during which she almost entertained vindictively the project of accepting the limpid youth until after she should have got her mother into circulation  the cream of the vision was that she might break with him later  she could read that this was what her mother would have liked but the next time he came the door was closed to him and the next and the next  in august there was nothing to do but to go abroad with the sense on roses part that the battle was still all to fight for a round of country visits was not in prospect and english wateringplaces constituted one of the few subjects on which the girl had heard her mother express herself with disgust  continental autumns had been indeed for years one of the various forms of mrs tramores atonement but rose could only infer that such fruit as they had borne was bitter  the stony stare of belgravia could be practised at homburg and somehow it was inveterately only gentlemen who sat next to her at the table dhote at cadenabbia  gentlemen had never been of any use to mrs tramore for getting back into society they had only helped her effectually to get out of it  she once dropped to her daughter in a moralising mood the remark that it was astonishing how many of them one could know without its doing one any good  fifty of themeven very clever onesrepresented a value inferior to that of one stupid woman  rose wondered at the offhand way in which her mother could talk of fifty clever men it seemed to her that the whole world couldnt contain such a number  she had a sombre sense that mankind must be dull and mean  these cogitations took place in a cold hotel in an eternal swiss rain and they had a flat echo in the transalpine valleys as the lonely ladies went vaguely down to the italian lakes and cities  rose guided their course at moments with a kind of aimless ferocity she moved abruptly feeling vulgar and hating their life though destitute of any definite vision of another life that would have been open to her she had set herself a task and she clung to it but she appeared to herself despicably idle  she had succeeded in not going to homburg waters where london was trying to wash away some of its stains that would be too staring an advertisement of their situation  the main difference in situations to her now was the difference of being more or less pitied at the best an intolerable danger so that the places she preferred were the unsuspicious ones  she wanted to triumph with contempt not with submission  one morning in september coming with her mother out of the marble church at milan she perceived that a gentleman who had just passed her on his way into the cathedral and whose face she had not noticed had quickly raised his hat with a suppressed ejaculation  she involuntarily glanced back the gentleman had paused again uncovering and captain jay stood saluting her in the italian sunshine  oh goodmorning she said and walked on pursuing her course her mother was a little in front  she overtook her in a moment with an unreasonable sense like a gust of cold air that men were worse than ever for captain jay had apparently moved into the church  her mother turned as they met and suddenly as she looked back an expression of peculiar sweetness came into this ladys eyes it made roses take the same direction and rest a second time on captain jay who was planted just where he had stood a minute before he immediately came forward asking rose with great gravity if he might speak to her a moment while mrs tramore went her way again he had the expression of a man who wished to say something very important yet his next words were simple enough and consisted of the remark that he had not seen her for a year  is it really so much as that asked rose  very nearly  i would have looked you up but in the first place i have been very little in london and in the second i believed it wouldnt have done any good  you should have put that first said the girl  it wouldnt have done any good  he was silent over this a moment in his customary deciphering way but the view he took of it did not prevent him from inquiring as she slowly followed her mother if he mightnt walk with her now  she answered with a laugh that it wouldnt do any good but that he might do as he liked  he replied without the slightest manifestation of levity that it would do more good than if he didnt and they strolled together with mrs tramore well before them across the big amusing piazza where the front of the cathedral makes a sort of builded light  he asked a question or two and he explained his own presence  having a months holiday the first clear time for several years he had just popped over the alps  he inquired if rose had recent news of the old lady in hill street and it was the only tortuous thing she had ever heard him say  i have had no communication of any kind from her since i parted with you under her roof  hasnt she mentioned that said rose  i havent seen her  i thought you were such great friends  bertram jay hesitated a moment  well not so much now  what has she done to you rose demanded  he fidgeted a little as if he were thinking of something that made him unconscious of her question then with mild violence he brought out the inquiry  miss tramore are you happy  she was startled by the words for she on her side had been reflectingreflecting that he had broken with her grandmother and that this pointed to a reason  it suggested at least that he wouldnt now be so much like a mouthpiece for that cold ancestral tone  she turned off his questionsaid it never was a fair one as you gave yourself away however you answered it  when he repeated you give yourself away as if he didnt understand she remembered that he had not read the funny american books  this brought them to a silence for she had enlightened him only by another laugh and he was evidently preparing another question which he wished carefully to disconnect from the former  presently just as they were coming near mrs tramore it arrived in the words is this lady your mother  on roses assenting with the addition that she was travelling with her he said  will you be so kind as to introduce me to her  they were so close to mrs tramore that she probably heard but she floated away with a single stroke of her paddle and an inattentive poise of her head  it was a striking exhibition of the famous tact for rose delayed to answer which was exactly what might have made her mother wish to turn and indeed when at last the girl spoke she only said to her companion  why do you ask me that  because i desire the pleasure of making her acquaintance  rose had stopped and in the middle of the square they stood looking at each other  do you remember what you said to me the last time i saw you  oh dont speak of that  its better to speak of it now than to speak of it later  bertram jay looked round him as if to see whether any one would hear but the bright foreignness gave him a sense of safety and he unexpectedly exclaimed  miss tramore i love you more than ever  then you ought to have come to see us declared the girl quickly walking on  you treated me the last time as if i were positively offensive to you  so i did but you know my reason  because i protested against the course you were taking  i did i did the young man rang out as if he still a little stuck to that  his tone made rose say gaily  perhaps you do so yet  i cant tell till ive seen more of your circumstances he replied with eminent honesty  the girl stared her light laugh filled the air  and its in order to see more of them and judge that you wish to make my mothers acquaintance  he coloured at this and he evaded then he broke out with a confused miss tramore let me stay with you a little which made her stop again  your company will do us great honour but there must be a rigid condition attached to our acceptance of it  kindly mention it said captain jay staring at the facade of the cathedral  you dont take us on trial  on trial  you dont make an observation to menot a single one ever ever on the matter that in hill street we had our last words about  captain jay appeared to be counting the thousand pinnacles of the church  i think you really must be right he remarked at last  there you are cried rose tramore and walked rapidly away  he caught up with her he laid his hand upon her arm to stay her if youre going to venice let me go to venice with you  you dont even understand my condition  im sure youre right then  you must be right about everything  thats not in the least true and i dont care a fig whether youre sure or not  please let me go  he had barred her way he kept her longer  ill go and speak to your mother myself  even in the midst of another emotion she was amused at the air of audacity accompanying this declaration  poor captain jay might have been on the point of marching up to a battery  she looked at him a moment then she said  youll be disappointed  disappointed  shes much more proper than grandmamma because shes much more amiable  dear miss tramoredear miss tramore the young man murmured helplessly  youll see for yourself  only theres another condition rose went on  another he cried with discouragement and alarm  you must understand thoroughly before you throw in your lot with us even for a few days what our position really is  is it very bad asked bertram jay artlessly  no one has anything to do with us no one speaks to us no one looks at us  really stared the young man  weve no social existence were utterly despised  oh miss tramore captain jay interposed  he added quickly vaguely and with a want of presence of mind of which he as quickly felt ashamed  do none of your family  the question collapsed the brilliant girl was looking at him  were extraordinarily happy she threw out  now thats all i wanted to know he exclaimed with a kind of exaggerated cheery reproach walking on with her briskly to overtake her mother  he was not dining at their inn but he insisted on coming that evening to their table dhote  he sat next mrs tramore and in the evening he accompanied them gallantly to the opera at a thirdrate theatre where they were almost the only ladies in the boxes  the next day they went together by rail to the charterhouse of pavia and while he strolled with the girl as they waited for the homeward train he said to her candidly  your mothers remarkably pretty she remembered the words and the feeling they gave her  they were the first note of new era  the feeling was somewhat that of an anxious gratified matron who has presented her child and is thinking of the matrimonial market  men might be of no use as mrs tramore said yet it was from this moment rose dated the rosy dawn of her confidence that her protegee would go off and when later in crowded assemblies the phrase or something like it behind a hat or a fan fell repeatedly on her anxious ear your mother is in beauty or ive never seen her look better she had a faint vision of the yellow sunshine and the afternoon shadows on the dusty italian platform  mrs tramores behaviour at this period was a revelation of her native understanding of delicate situations  she needed no account of this one from her daughterit was one of the things for which she had a scent and there was a kind of loyalty to the rules of a game in the silent sweetness with which she smoothed the path of bertram jay  it was clear that she was in her element in fostering the exercise of the affections and if she ever spoke without thinking twice it is probable that she would have exclaimed with some gaiety oh i know all about love  rose could see that she thought their companion would be a help in spite of his being no dispenser of patronage  the key to the gates of fashion had not been placed in his hand and no one had ever heard of the ladies of his family who lived in some vague hollow of the yorkshire moors but none the less he might administer a muscular push  yes indeed men in general were broken reeds but captain jay was peculiarly representative respectability was the womans maximum as honour was the mans but this distinguished young soldier inspired more than one kind of confidence  rose had a great deal of attention for the use to which his respectability was put and there mingled with this attention some amusement and much compassion  she saw that after a couple of days he decidedly liked her mother and that he was yet not in the least aware of it  he took for granted that he believed in her but little notwithstanding which he would have trusted her with anything except rose herself  his trusting her with rose would come very soon  he never spoke to her daughter about her qualities of character but two or three of them and indeed these were all the poor lady had and they made the best show were what he had in mind in praising her appearance  when he remarked  what attention mrs tramore seems to attract everywhere he meant  what a beautifully simple nature it is and when he said  theres something extraordinarily harmonious in the colours she wears it signified upon my word i never saw such a sweet temper in my life  she lost one of her boxes at verona and made the prettiest joke of it to captain jay  when rose saw this she said to herself next season we shall have only to choose  rose knew what was in the box  by the time they reached venice they had stopped at half a dozen little old romantic cities in the most frolicsome aesthetic way she liked their companion better than she had ever liked him before  she did him the justice to recognise that if he was not quite honest with himself he was at least wholly honest with her  she reckoned up everything he had been since he joined them and put upon it all an interpretation so favourable to his devotion that catching herself in the act of glossing over one or two episodes that had not struck her at the time as disinterested she exclaimed beneath her breath look outyoure falling in love  but if he liked correctness wasnt he quite right  could any one possibly like it more than she did  and if he had protested against her throwing in her lot with her mother this was not because of the benefit conferred but because of the injury received  he exaggerated that injury but this was the privilege of a lover perfectly willing to be selfish on behalf of his mistress  he might have wanted her grandmothers money for her but if he had given her up on first discovering that she was throwing away her chance of it oh this was her doing too he had given up her grandmother as much  not keeping well with the old woman as some men would have done not waiting to see how the perverse experiment would turn out and appeasing her if it should promise tolerably with a view to future operations  he had had a simple minded evangelical lurid view of what the girl he loved would find herself in for  she could see this nowshe could see it from his present bewilderment and mystification and she liked him and pitied him with the kindest smile for the original naivete as well as for the actual meekness  no wonder he hadnt known what she was in for since he now didnt even know what he was in for himself  were there not moments when he thought his companions almost unnaturally good almost suspiciously safe  he had lost all power to verify that sketch of their isolation and declassement to which she had treated him on the great square at milan  the last thing he noticed was that they were neglected and he had never for himself had such an impression of society  it could scarcely be enhanced even by the apparition of a large fair hot redhaired young man carrying a ladys fan in his hand who suddenly stood before their little party as on the third evening after their arrival in venice it partook of ices at one of the tables before the celebrated cafe florian  the lamplit venetian dusk appeared to have revealed them to this gentleman as he sat with other friends at a neighbouring table and he had sprung up with unsophisticated glee to shake hands with mrs tramore and her daughter  rose recalled him to her mother who looked at first as though she didnt remember him but presently bestowed a sufficiently gracious smile on mr guy mangler  he gave with youthful candour the history of his movements and indicated the whereabouts of his family he was with his mother and sisters they had met the bob veseys who had taken lord whiteroys yacht and were going to constantinople his mother and the girls poor things were at the grand hotel but he was on the yacht with the veseys where they had lord whiteroys cook  wasnt the food in venice filthy and wouldnt they come and look at the yacht  she wasnt very fast but she was awfully jolly his mother might have come if she would but she wouldnt at first and now when she wanted to there were other people who naturally wouldnt turn out for her  mr mangler sat down he alluded with artless resentment to the way in july the door of his friends had been closed to him  he was going to constantinople but he didnt careif they were going anywhere meanwhile his mother hoped awfully they would look her up  lady maresfield if she had given her son any such message which rose disbelieved entertained her hope in a manner compatible with her sitting for half an hour surrounded by her little retinue without glancing in the direction of mrs tramore  the girl however was aware that this was not a good enough instance of their humiliation inasmuch as it was rather she who on the occasion of their last contact had held off from lady maresfield  she was a little ashamed now of not having answered the note in which this affable personage ignored her mother  she couldnt help perceiving indeed a dim movement on the part of some of the other members of the group she made out an attitude of observation in the highplumed head of mrs vaughanvesey  mrs vesey perhaps might have been looking at captain jay for as this gentleman walked back to the hotel with our young lady they were at the britannia and young mangler who clung to them went in front with mrs tramore he revealed to rose that he had some acquaintance with lady maresfields eldest daughter though he didnt know and didnt particularly want to know her ladyship  he expressed himself with more acerbity than she had ever heard him use christian charity so generally governed his speech about the young donkey who had been prattling to them they separated at the door of the hotel  mrs tramore had got rid of mr mangler and bertram jay was in other quarters  if you know mrs vesey why didnt you go and speak to her  im sure she saw you rose said  captain jay replied even more circumspectly than usual  because i didnt want to leave you  well you can go now youre free rose rejoined  thank you  i shall never go again  that wont be civil said rose  i dont care to be civil  i dont like her  why dont you like her  you ask too many questions  i know i do the girl acknowledged  captain jay had already shaken hands with her but at this he put out his hand again  shes too worldly he murmured while he held rose tramores a moment  ah you dear rose exclaimed almost audibly as with her mother she turned away  the next morning upon the grand canal the gondola of our three friends encountered a stately barge which though it contained several persons seemed pervaded mainly by one majestic presence during the instant the gondolas were passing each other it was impossible either for rose tramore or for her companions not to become conscious that this distinguished identity had markedly inclined itselfa circumstance commemorated the next moment almost within earshot of the other boat by the most spontaneous cry that had issued for many a day from the lips of mrs tramore  fancy my dear lady maresfield has bowed to us  we ought to have returned it rose answered but she looked at bertram jay who was opposite to her  he blushed and she blushed and during this moment was born a deeper understanding than had yet existed between these associated spirits  it had something to do with their going together that afternoon without her mother to look at certain outoftheway pictures as to which ruskin had inspired her with a desire to see sincerely  mrs tramore expressed the wish to stay at home and the motive of this wisha finer shade than any that even ruskin had ever found a phrase forwas not translated into misrepresenting words by either the mother or the daughter  at san giovanni in bragora the girl and her companion came upon mrs vaughanvesey who with one of her sisters was also endeavouring to do the earnest thing  she did it to rose she did it to captain jay as well as to gianbellini she was a handsome longnecked aquiline person of a different type from the rest of her family and she did it remarkably well  she secured our friendsit was her own expressionfor luncheon on the morrow on the yacht and she made it public to rose that she would come that afternoon to invite her mother  when the girl returned to the hotel mrs tramore mentioned before captain jay who had come up to their sittingroom that lady maresfield had called  she stayed a long timeat least it seemed long laughed mrs tramore  the poor lady could laugh freely now yet there was some grimness in a colloquy that she had with her daughter after bertram jay had departed  before this happened mrs veseys card scrawled over in pencil and referring to the morrows luncheon was brought up to mrs tramore  they mean it all as a bribe said the principal recipient of these civilities  as a bribe rose repeated  she wants to marry you to that boy theyve seen captain jay and theyre frightened  well dear mamma i cant take mr mangler for a husband  of course not  but oughtnt we to go to the luncheon  certainly well go to the luncheon rose said and when the affair took place on the morrow she could feel for the first time that she was taking her mother out  this appearance was somehow brought home to every one else and it was really the agent of her success  for it is of the essence of this simple history that in the first place that success dated from mrs veseys venetian dejeuner and in the second reposed by a subtle social logic on the very anomaly that had made it dubious  there is always a chance in things and rose tramores chance was in the fact that gwendolen vesey was as some one had said awfully modern an immense improvement on the exploded science of her mother and capable of seeing what a draw there would be in the comedy if properly brought out of the reversed positions of mrs tramore and mrs tramores diplomatic daughter with a firstrate managerial eye she perceived that people would flock into any roomand all the more into one of hersto see rose bring in her dreadful mother  she treated the cream of english society to this thrilling spectacle later in the autumn when she once more secured both the performers for a week at brimble  it made a hit on the spot the very first eveningthe girl was felt to play her part so well  the rumour of the performance spread every one wanted to see it  it was an entertainment of which that winter in the country and the next season in town persons of taste desired to give their friends the freshness  the thing was to make the tramores come late after every one had arrived  they were engaged for a fixed hour like the american imitator and the patagonian contralto  mrs vesey had been the first to say the girl was awfully original but that became the general view  gwendolen vesey had with her mother one of the few quarrels in which lady maresfield had really stood up to such an antagonist the elder woman had to recognise in general in whose veins it was that the blood of the manglers flowed on account of this very circumstance of her attaching more importance to miss tramores originality her originality be hanged her ladyship had gone so far as unintelligently to exclaim than to the prospects of the unfortunate guy  mrs vesey actually lost sight of these pressing problems in her admiration of the way the mother and the daughter or rather the daughter and the mother it was slightly confusing drew  it was lady maresfields version of the case that the brazen girl she was shockingly coarse had treated poor guy abominably  at any rate it was made known just after easter that miss tramore was to be married to captain jay  the marriage was not to take place till the summer but rose felt that before this the field would practically be won  there had been some bad moments there had been several warm corners and a certain number of cold shoulders and closed doors and stony stares but the breach was effectually madethe rest was only a question of time  mrs tramore could be trusted to keep what she had gained and it was the dowagers the old dragons with prominent fangs and glittering scales whom the trick had already mainly caught  by this time there were several houses into which the liberated lady had crept alone  her daughter had been expected with her but they couldnt turn her out because the girl had stayed behind and she was fast acquiring a new identity that of a parental connection with the heroine of such a romantic story  she was at least the next best thing to her daughter and rose foresaw the day when she would be valued principally as a memento of one of the prettiest episodes in the annals of london  at a big official party in june rose had the joy of introducing eric to his mother  she was a little sorry it was an official partythere were some other such queer people there but eric called observing the shade the next day but one  no observer probably would have been acute enough to fix exactly the moment at which the girl ceased to take out her mother and began to be taken out by her  a later phase was more distinguishablethat at which rose forbore to inflict on her companion a duality that might become oppressive  she began to economise her force she went only when the particular effect was required  her marriage was delayed by the period of mourning consequent upon the death of her grandmother who the younger mrs tramore averred was killed by the rumour of her own new birth  she was the only one of the dragons who had not been tamed  julia tramore knew the truth about thisshe was determined such things should not kill her  she would live to do somethingshe hardly knew what  the provisions of her mothers will were published in the illustrated news from which it appeared that everything that was not to go to eric and to julia was to go to the fortunate edith  miss tramore makes no secret of her own intentions as regards this favourite  edith is not pretty but lady maresfield is waiting for her she is determined gwendolen vesey shall not get hold of her  mrs vesey however takes no interest in her at all  she is whimsical as befits a woman of her fashion but there are two persons she is still very fond of the delightful bertram jays  the fondness of this pair it must be added is not wholly expended in return  they are extremely united but their life is more domestic than might have been expected from the preliminary signs  it owes a portion of its concentration to the fact that mrs tramore has now so many places to go to that she has almost no time to come to her daughters  she is under her soninlaws roof a brilliant but a rare apparition and the other day he remarked upon the circumstance to his wife  if it hadnt been for you she replied smiling she might have had her regular place at our fireside  good heavens how did i prevent it cried captain jay with all the consciousness of virtue  you ordered it otherwise you goose  and she says in the same spirit whenever her husband commends her which he does sometimes extravagantly for the way she launched her mother  nonsense my dearpractically it was you
