60    who goes home                       63     wine water and song     the englishman     st george he was for england   and before he killed the dragon   he drank a pint of english ale   out of an english flagon   for though he fast right readily   in hairshirt or in mail   it isnt safe to give him cakes   unless you give him ale    st george he was for england   and right gallantly set free   the lady left for dragons meat   and tied up to a tree   but since he stood for england   and knew what england means   unless you give him bacon   you mustnt give him beans    st george he is for england   and shall wear the shield he wore   when we go out in armour   with the battlecross before   but though he is jolly company   and very pleased to dine   it isnt safe to give him nuts   unless you give him wine     wine and water     old noah he had an ostrich farm and fowls on the largest scale   he ate his egg with a ladle in an eggcup big as a pail   and the soup he took was elephant soup and the fish he took was whale   but they all were small to the cellar he took when he set out to sail   and noah he often said to his wife when he sat down to dine   i dont care where the water goes if it doesnt get into the wine    the cataract of the cliff of heaven fell blinding off the brink   as if it would wash the stars away as suds go down a sink   the seven heavens came roaring down for the throats of hell to drink   and noah he cocked his eye and said it looks like rain i think   the water has drowned the matterhorn as deep as a mendip mine   but i dont care where the water goes if it doesnt get into the wine    but noah he sinned and we have sinned on tipsy feet we trod   till a great big black teetotaller was sent to us for a rod   and you cant get wine at a psa or chapel or eisteddfod   for the curse of water has come again because of the wrath of god   and water is on the bishops board and the higher thinkers shrine   but i dont care where the water goes if it doesnt get into the wine     the song against grocers     god made the wicked grocer   for a mystery and a sign   that men might shun the awful shops   and go to inns to dine   where the bacons on the rafter   and the wine is in the wood   and god that made good laughter   has seen that they are good    the evilhearted grocer   would call his mother maam   and bow at her and bob at her   her aged soul to damn   and rub his horrid hands and ask   what article was next   though mortis in articulo   should be her proper text    his props are not his children   but pert lads underpaid   who call out cash and bang about   to work his wicked trade   he keeps a lady in a cage   most cruelly all day   and makes her count and calls her miss   until she fades away    the righteous minds of innkeepers   induce them now and then   to crack a bottle with a friend   or treat unmoneyed men   but who hath seen the grocer   treat housemaids to his teas   or crack a bottle of fishsauce   or stand a man a cheese    he sells us sands of araby   as sugar for cash down   he sweeps his shop and sells the dust   the purest salt in town   he crams with cans of poisoned meat   poor subjects of the king   and when they die by thousands   why he laughs like anything    the wicked grocer groces   in spirits and in wine   not frankly and in fellowship   as men in inns do dine   but packed with soap and sardines   and carried off by grooms   for to be snatched by duchesses   and drunk in dressingrooms    the hellinstructed grocer   has a temple made of tin   and the ruin of good innkeepers   is loudly urged therein   but now the sands are running out   from sugar of a sort   the grocer trembles for his time   just like his weight is short     the rolling english road     before the roman came to rye or out to severn strode   the rolling english drunkard made the rolling english road   a reeling road a rolling road that rambles round the shire   and after him the parson ran the sexton and the squire   a merry road a mazy road and such as we did tread   the night we went to birmingham by way of beachy head    i knew no harm of bonaparte and plenty of the squire   and for to fight the frenchman i did not much desire   but i did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed   to straighten out the crooked road an english drunkard made   where you and i went down the lane with alemugs in our hands   the night we went to glastonbury by way of goodwin sands    his sins they were forgiven him or why do flowers run   behind him and the hedges all strengthing in the sun   the wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which   but the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch   god pardon us nor harden us we did not see so clear   the night we went to bannockburn by way of brighton pier    my friends we will not go again or ape an ancient rage   or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age   but walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth   and see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death   for there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen   before we go to paradise by way of kensal green     the song of quoodle     they havent got no noses   the fallen sons of eve   even the smell of roses   is not what they supposes   but more than mind discloses   and more than men believe    they havent got no noses   they cannot even tell   when door and darkness closes   the park a jew encloses   where even the law of moses   will let you steal a smell    the brilliant smell of water   the brave smell of a stone   the smell of dew and thunder   the old bones buried under   are things in which they blunder   and err if left alone    the wind from winter forests   the scent of scentless flowers   the breath of brides adorning   the smell of snare and warning   the smell of sunday morning   god gave to us for ours            and quoodle here discloses   all things that quoodle can   they havent got no noses   they havent got no noses   and goodness only knowses   the noselessness of man     pioneers o pioneers     nebuchadnezzar the king of the jews   suffered from new and original views   he crawled on his hands and knees its said   with grass in his mouth and a crown on his head         with a wowtyiddly etc    those in traditional paths that trod   thought the thing was a curse from god   but a pioneer men always abuse   like nebuchadnezzar the king of the jews    black lord foulon the frenchman slew   thought it a futurist thing to do   he offered them grass instead of bread   so they stuffed him with grass when they cut off his head         with a wowtyiddly etc    for the pride of his soul he perished then   but of course it is always of pride that men   a man in advance of his age accuse   like nebuchadnezzar the king of the jews    simeon scudder of styx in maine   thought of the thing and was at it again   he gave good grass and water in pails   to a thousand irishmen hammering rails         with a wowtyiddly etc    appetites differ and tied to a stake   he was tarred and feathered for conscience sake   but stoning the prophets is ancient news   like nebuchadnezzar the king of the jews     the logical vegetarian   why shouldnt i have a purely vegetarian drink why shouldnt i take vegetables in their highest form so to speak the modest vegetarians ought obviously to stick to wine or beer plain vegetarian drinks instead of filling their goblets with the blood of bulls and elephants as all conventional meateaters do i supposedalroy      you will find me drinking rum     like a sailor in a slum   you will find me drinking beer like a bavarian     you will find me drinking gin     in the lowest kind of inn   because i am a rigid vegetarian      so i cleared the inn of wine     and i tried to climb the sign   and i tried to hail the constable as marion     but he said i couldnt speak     and he bowled me to the beak   because i was a happy vegetarian      oh i knew a doctor gluck     and his nose it had a hook   and his attitudes were anything but aryan     so i gave him all the pork     that i had upon a fork   because i am myself a vegetarian      i am silent in the club     i am silent in the pub   i am silent on a bally peak in darien     for i stuff away for life     shoving peas in with a knife   because i am at heart a vegetarian      no more the milk of cows     shall pollute my private house   than the milk of the wild mares of the barbarian     i will stick to port and sherry     for they are so very very   so very very very vegetarian     the saracens head     the saracens head looks down the lane   where we shall never drink wine again   for the wicked old women who feel wellbred   have turned to a teashop the saracens head    the saracens head out of araby came   king richard riding in arms like flame   and where he established his folk to be fed   he set up a spearand the saracens head    but the saracens head outlived the kings   it thought and it thought of most horrible things   of health and of soap and of standard bread   and of saracen drinks at the saracens head    so the saracens head fulfils its name   they drink no winea ridiculous game   and i shall wonder until im dead   how it ever came into the saracens head     the good rich man     mr mandragon the millionaire he wouldnt have wine or wife   he couldnt endure complexity he lived the simple life   he ordered his lunch by megaphone in manly simple tones   and used all his motors for canvassing voters and twenty telephones   besides a dandy little machine   cunning and neat as ever was seen   with a hundred pulleys and cranks between   made of metal and kept quite clean   to hoist him out of his healthful bed on every day of his life   and wash him and dress him and shave him and brush him         to live the simple life    mr mandragon was most refined and quietly neatly dressed   say all the american newspapers that know refinement best   quiet and neat the hat and hair and the coat quiet and neat   a trouser worn upon either leg while boots adorn the feet   and not as any one would expect   a tigers skin all striped and specked   and a peacock hat with the tail erect   a scarlet tunic with sunflowers decked   which might have had a more marked effect   and pleased the pride of a weaker man that yearned for wine or wife   but fame and the flagon for mr mandragon         obscured the simple life    mr mandragon the millionaire i am happy to say is dead   he enjoyed a quiet funeral in a crematorium shed   and he lies there fluffy and soft and grey and certainly quite refined   when he might have rotted to flowers and fruit with adam and all mankind   or been eaten by wolves athirst for blood   or burnt on a good tall pyre of wood   in a towering flame as a heathen should   or even sat with us here at food   merrily taking twopenny ale and pork with a pocketknife   but this was luxury not for one that went for the simple life     the song against songs     the song of the sorrow of melisande is a weary song and a dreary song   the glory of marianas grange had got into great decay   the song of the raven never more has never been called a cheery song   and the brightest things in baudelaire are anything else but gay    but who will write us a riding song   or a hunting song or a drinking song   fit for them that arose and rode   when day and the wine were red   but bring me a quart of claret out   and i will write you a clinking song   a song of war and a song of wine   and a song to wake the dead    the song of the fury of fragolette is a florid song and a torrid song   the song of the sorrow of tara is sung to a harp unstrung   the song of the cheerful shropshire lad i consider a perfectly horrid song   and the song of the happy futurist is a song that cant be sung    but who will write us a riding song   or a fighting song or a drinking song   fit for the fathers of you and me   that knew how to think and thrive   but the song of beauty and art and love   is simply an utterly stinking song   to double you up and drag you down   and damn your soul alive     me heart     i come from castlepatrick and me heart is on me sleeve   and any sword or pistol boy can hit it with me leave   it shines there for an epaulette as golden as a flame   as naked as me ancestors as noble as me name   for i come from castlepatrick and me heart is on me sleeve   but a lady stole it from me on st gallowglasss eve    the folk that live in liverpool their heart is in their boots   they go to hell like lambs they do because the hooter hoots   where men may not be dancin though the wheels may dance all day   and men may not be smokin but only chimneys may   but i come from castlepatrick and me heart is on me sleeve   but a lady stole it from me on st poleanders eve    the folk that live in black belfast their heart is in their mouth   they see us making murders in the meadows of the south   they think a ploughs a rack they do and cattlecalls are creeds   and they think were burnin witches when were only burnin weeds   but i come from castlepatrick and me heart is on me sleeve   but a lady stole it from me on st barnabass eve     the song of the oak     the druids waved their golden knives   and danced around the oak   when they had sacrificed a man   but though the learned search and scan   no single modern person can   entirely see the joke   but though they cut the throats of men   they cut not down the tree   and from the blood the saplings sprang   of oakwoods yet to be     but ivywood lord ivywood     he rots the tree as ivy would     he clings and crawls as ivy would     about the sacred tree    king charles he fled from worcester fight   and hid him in an oak   in convent schools no man of tact   would trace and praise his every act   or argue that he was in fact   a strict and sainted bloke   but not by him the sacred woods   have lost their fancies free   and though he was extremely big   he did not break the tree     but ivywood lord ivywood     he breaks the tree as ivy would     and eats the woods as ivy would     between us and the sea    great collingwood walked down the glade   and flung the acorns free   that oaks might still be in the grove   as oaken as the beams above   when the great lover sailors love   was kissed by death at sea   but though for him the oaktrees fell   to build the oaken ships   the woodman worshipped what he smote   and honoured even the chips     but ivywood lord ivywood     he hates the tree as ivy would     as the dragon of the ivy would     that has us in his grips     the road to roundabout     some say that guy of warwick   the man that killed the cow   and brake the mighty boar alive   beyond the bridge at slough   went up against a loathly worm   that wasted all the downs   and so the roads they twist and squirm   if i may be allowed the term   from the writhing of the stricken worm   that died in seven towns     i see no scientific proof     that this idea is sound     and i should say they wound about     to find the town of roundabout     the merry town of roundabout     that makes the world go round    some say that robin goodfellow   whose lantern lights the meads   to steal a phrase sir walter scott   in heaven no longer needs   such dance around the trystingplace   the moonstruck lover leads   which superstition i should scout   there is more faith in honest doubt   as tennyson has pointed out   than in those nasty creeds     but peace and righteousness st john     in roundabout can kiss     and since thats all thats found about     the pleasant town of roundabout     the roads they simply bound about     to find out where it is    some say that when sir lancelot   went forth to find the grail   grey merlin wrinkled up the roads   for hope that he should fail   all roads led back to lyonesse   and camelot in the vale   i cannot yield assent to this   extravagant hypothesis   the plain shrewd briton will dismiss   such rumours daily mail     but in the streets of roundabout     are no such factions found     or theories to expound about     or roll upon the ground about     in the happy town of roundabout     that makes the world go round     the song of the strange ascetic     if i had been a heathen     id have praised the purple vine   my slaves should dig the vineyards     and i would drink the wine   but higgins is a heathen     and his slaves grow lean and grey   that he may drink some tepid milk     exactly twice a day    if i had been a heathen     id have crowned neoeras curls   and filled my life with love affairs     my house with dancing girls   but higgins is a heathen     and to lecture rooms is forced   where his aunts who are not married     demand to be divorced    if i had been a heathen     id have sent my armies forth   and dragged behind my chariots     the chieftains of the north   but higgins is a heathen     and he drives the dreary quill   to lend the poor that funny cash     that makes them poorer still    if i had been a heathen     id have piled my pyre on high   and in a great red whirlwind     gone roaring to the sky   but higgins is a heathen     and a richer man than i   and they put him in an oven     just as if he were a pie    now who that runs can read it     the riddle that i write   of why this poor old sinner     should sin without delight   but i i cannot read it     although i run and run   of them that do not have the faith     and will not have the fun     the song of right and wrong     feast on wine or fast on water   and your honour shall stand sure   god almightys son and daughter   he the valiant she the pure   if an angel out of heaven   brings you other things to drink   thank him for his kind attentions   go and pour them down the sink    tea is like the east he grows in   a great yellow mandarin   with urbanity of manner   and unconsciousness of sin   all the women like a harem   at his pigtail troop along   and like all the east he grows in   he is poison when hes strong    tea although an oriental   is a gentleman at least   cocoa is a cad and coward   cocoa is a vulgar beast   cocoa is a dull disloyal   lying crawling cad and clown   and may very well be grateful   to the fool that takes him down    as for all the windy waters   they were rained like tempests down   when good drink had been dishonoured   by the tipplers of the town   when red wine had brought red ruin   and the deathdance of our times   heaven sent us soda water   as a torment for our crimes     who goes home     in the city set upon slime and loam   they cry in their parliament who goes home   and there comes no answer in arch or dome   for none in the city of graves goes home   yet these shall perish and understand   for god has pity on this great land    men that are men again who goes home   tocsin and trumpeter who goes home   for theres blood on the field and blood on the foam   and blood on the body when man goes home   and a voice valedictory who is for victory   who is for liberty
