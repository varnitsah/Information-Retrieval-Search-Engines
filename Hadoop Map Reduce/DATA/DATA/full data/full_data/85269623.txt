         384     observations  on the  conduct of the minority  particularly in the  last session of parliament  addressed to  the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam  1793     letter  to  his grace the duke of portland   my dear lordthe paper which i take the liberty of sending to your grace was for the greater part written during the last session a few days after the prorogation some few observations were added i was however resolved to let it lie by me for a considerable time that on viewing the matter at a proper distance and when the sharpness of recent impressions had been worn off i might be better able to form a just estimate of the value of my first opinions  i have just now read it over very coolly and deliberately my latest judgment owns my first sentiments and reasonings in their full force with regard both to persons and things  during a period of four years the state of the world except for some few and short intervals has filled me with a good deal of serious inquietude i considered a general war against jacobins and jacobinism as the only possible chance of saving europe and england as included in europe from a truly frightful revolution for this i have been censured as receiving through weakness or spreading through fraud and artifice a false alarm whatever others may think of the matter that alarm in my mind is by no means quieted the state of affairs abroad is not so much mended as to make me for one full of confidence at home i see no abatement whatsoever in the zeal of the partisans of jacobinism towards their cause nor any cessation in their efforts to do mischief what is doing by lord lauderdale on the first scene of lord george gordons actions and in his spirit is not calculated to remove my apprehensions they pursue their first object with as much eagerness as ever but with more dexterity under the plausible name of peace by which they delude or are deluded they would deliver us unarmed and defenceless to the confederation of jacobins whose centre is indeed in france but whose rays proceed in every direction throughout the world i understand that mr coke of norfolk has been lately very busy in spreading a disaffection to this war which we carry on for our being in the country in which his property gives him so great an influence it is truly alarming to see so large a part of the aristocratic interest engaged in the cause of the new species of democracy which is openly attacking or secretly undermining the system of property by which mankind has hitherto been governed but we are not to delude ourselves no man can be connected with a party which professes publicly to admire or may be justly suspected of secretly abetting this french revolution who must not be drawn into its vortex and become the instrument of its designs  what i have written is in the manner of apology i have given it that form as being the most respectful but i do not stand in need of any apology for my principles my sentiments or my conduct i wish the paper i lay before your grace to be considered as my most deliberate solemn and even testamentary protest against the proceedings and doctrines which have hitherto produced so much mischief in the world and which will infallibly produce more and possibly greater it is my protest against the delusion by which some have been taught to look upon this jacobin contest at home as an ordinary party squabble about place or patronage and to regard this jacobin war abroad as a common war about trade or territorial boundaries or about a political balance of power among rival or jealous states above all it is my protest against that mistake or perversion of sentiment by which they who agree with us in our principles may on collateral considerations be regarded as enemies and those who in this perilous crisis of all human affairs differ from us fundamentally and practically as our best friends thus persons of great importance may be made to turn the whole of their influence to the destruction of their principles  i now make it my humble request to your grace that you will not give any sort of answer to the paper i send or to this letter except barely to let me know that you have received them i even wish that at present you may not read the paper which i transmit lock it up in the drawer of your librarytable and when a day of compulsory reflection comes then be pleased to turn to it then remember that your grace had a true friend who had comparatively with men of your description a very small interest in opposing the modern system of morality and policy but who under every discouragement was faithful to public duty and to private friendship i shall then probably be dead i am sure i do not wish to live to see such things but whilst i do live i shall pursue the same course although my merits should be taken for unpardonable faults and as such avenged not only on myself but on my posterity  adieu my dear lord and do me the justice to believe me ever with most sincere respect veneration and affectionate attachment  your graces most faithful friend  and most obedient humble servant  edmund burke  beaconsfield sept 29 1793     observations   approaching towards the close of a long period of public service it is natural i should be desirous to stand well i hope i do stand tolerably well with that public which with whatever fortune i have endeavored faithfully and zealously to serve  i am also not a little anxious for some place in the estimation of the two persons to whom i address this paper i have always acted with them and with those whom they represent to my knowledge i have not deviated no not in the minutest point from their opinions and principles of late without any alteration in their sentiments or in mine a difference of a very unusual nature and which under the circumstances it is not easy to describe has arisen between us  in my journey with them through life i met mr fox in my road and i travelled with him very cheerfully as long as he appeared to me to pursue the same direction with those in whose company i set out in the latter stage of our progress a new scheme of liberty and equality was produced in the world which either dazzled his imagination or was suited to some new walks of ambition which were then opened to his view the whole frame and fashion of his politics appear to have suffered about that time a very material alteration it is about three years since in consequence of that extraordinary change that after a pretty long preceding period of distance coolness and want of confidence if not total alienation on his part a complete public separation has been made between that gentleman and me until lately the breach between us appeared reparable i trusted that time and reflection and a decisive experience of the mischiefs which have flowed from the proceedings and the system of france on which our difference had arisen as well as the known sentiments of the best and wisest of our common friends upon that subject would have brought him to a safer way of thinking several of his friends saw no security for keeping things in a proper train after this excursion of his but in the reunion of the party on its old grounds under the duke of portland mr fox if he pleased might have been comprehended in that system with the rank and consideration to which his great talents entitle him and indeed must secure to him in any party arrangement that could be made the duke of portland knows how much i wished for and how earnestly i labored that reunion and upon terms that might every way be honorable and advantageous to mr fox his conduct in the last session has extinguished these hopes forever  mr fox has lately published in print a defence of his conduct on taking into consideration that defence a society of gentlemen called the whig club thought proper to come to the following resolutionthat their confidence in mr fox is confirmed strengthened and increased by the calumnies against him  to that resolution my two noble friends the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam have given their concurrence  the calumnies supposed in that resolution can be nothing else than the objections taken to mr foxs conduct in this session of parliament for to them and to them alone the resolution refers i am one of those who have publicly and strongly urged those objections i hope i shall be thought only to do what is necessary to my justification thus publicly solemnly and heavily censured by those whom i most value and esteem when i firmly contend that the objections which i with many others of the friends to the duke of portland have made to mr foxs conduct are not calumnies but founded on truththat they are not few but manyand that they are not light and trivial but in a very high degree serious and important  that i may avoid the imputation of throwing out even privately any loose random imputations against the public conduct of a gentleman for whom i once entertained a very warm affection and whose abilities i regard with the greatest admiration i will put down distinctly and articulately some of the matters of objection which i feel to his late doctrines and proceedings trusting that i shall be able to demonstrate to the friends whose good opinion i would still cultivate that not levity nor caprice nor less defensible motives but that very grave reasons influence my judgment i think that the spirit of his late proceedings is wholly alien to our national policy and to the peace to the prosperity and to the legal liberties of this nation according to our ancient domestic and appropriated mode of holding them  viewing things in that light my confidence in him is not increased but totally destroyed by those proceedings i cannot conceive it a matter of honor or duty but the direct contrary in any member of parliament to continue systematic opposition for the purpose of putting government under difficulties until mr fox with all his present ideas shall have the principal direction of affairs placed in his hands and until the present body of administration with their ideas and measures is of course overturned and dissolved  to come to particulars  1 the laws and constitution of the kingdom intrust the sole and exclusive right of treating with foreign potentates to the king this is an undisputed part of the legal prerogative of the crown however notwithstanding this mr fox without the knowledge or participation of any one person in the house of commons with whom he was bound by every party principle in matters of delicacy and importance confidentially to communicate thought proper to send mr adair as his representative and with his cipher to st petersburg there to frustrate the objects for which the minister from the crown was authorized to treat he succeeded in this his design and did actually frustrate the kings minister in some of the objects of his negotiation  this proceeding of mr fox does not as i conceive amount to absolute high treasonrussia though on bad terms not having been then declaredly at war with this kingdom but such a proceeding is in law not very remote from that offence and is undoubtedly a most unconstitutional act and an high treasonable misdemeanor  the legitimate and sure mode of communication between this nation and foreign powers is rendered uncertain precarious and treacherous by being divided into two channelsone with the government one with the head of a party in opposition to that government by which means the foreign powers can never be assured of the real authority or validity of any public transaction whatsoever  on the other hand the advantage taken of the discontent which at that time prevailed in parliament and in the nation to give to an individual an influence directly against the government of his country in a foreign court has made a highway into england for the intrigues of foreign courts in our affairs this is a sore evilan evil from which before this time england was more free than any other nation nothing can preserve us from that evilwhich connects cabinet factions abroad with popular factions herebut the keeping sacred the crown as the only channel of communication with every other nation  this proceeding of mr fox has given a strong countenance and an encouraging example to the doctrines and practices of the revolution and constitutional societies and of other mischievous societies of that description who without any legal authority and even without any corporate capacity are in the habit of proposing and to the best of their power of forming leagues and alliances with france  this proceeding which ought to be reprobated on all the general principles of government is in a more narrow view of things not less reprehensible it tends to the prejudice of the whole of the duke of portlands late party by discrediting the principles upon which they supported mr fox in the russian business as if they of that party also had proceeded in their parliamentary opposition on the same mischievous principles which actuated mr fox in sending mr adair on his embassy  2 very soon after his sending this embassy to russia that is in the spring of 1792 a covenanting club or association was formed in london calling itself by the ambitious and invidious title of the friends of the people it was composed of many of mr foxs own most intimate personal and party friends joined to a very considerable part of the members of those mischievous associations called the revolution society and the constitutional society mr fox must have been well apprised of the progress of that society in every one of its steps if not of the very origin of it i certainly was informed of both who had no connection with the design directly or indirectly his influence over the persons who composed the leading part in that association was and is unbounded i hear that he expressed some disapprobation of this club in one case that of mr st john where his consent was formally asked yet he never attempted seriously to put a stop to the association or to disavow it or to control check or modify it in any way whatsoever if he had pleased without difficulty he might have suppressed it in its beginning however he did not only not suppress it in its beginning but encouraged it in every part of its progress at that particular time when jacobin clubs under the very same or similar titles were making such dreadful havoc in a country not thirty miles from the coast of england and when every motive of moral prudence called for the discouragement of societies formed for the increase of popular pretensions to power and direction  3 when the proceedings of this society of the friends of the people as well as others acting in the same spirit had caused a very serious alarm in the mind of the duke of portland and of many good patriots he publicly in the house of commons treated their apprehensions and conduct with the greatest asperity and ridicule he condemned and vilified in the most insulting and outrageous terms the proclamation issued by government on that occasionthough he well knew that it had passed through the duke of portlands hands that it had received his fullest approbation and that it was the result of an actual interview between that noble duke and mr pitt during the discussion of its merits in the house of commons mr fox countenanced and justified the chief promoters of that association and he received in return a public assurance from them of an inviolable adherence to him singly and personally on account of this proceeding a very great number i presume to say not the least grave and wise part of the duke of portlands friends in parliament and many out of parliament who are of the same description have become separated from that time to this from mr foxs particular cabalvery few of which cabal are or ever have so much as pretended to be attached to the duke of portland or to pay any respect to him or his opinions  4 at the beginning of this session when the sober part of the nation was a second time generally and justly alarmed at the progress of the french arms on the continent and at the spreading of their horrid principles and cabals in england mr fox did not as had been usual in cases of far less moment call together any meeting of the duke of portlands friends in the house of commons for the purpose of taking their opinion on the conduct to be pursued in parliament at that critical juncture he concerted his measures if with any persons at all with the friends of lord lansdowne and those calling themselves friends of the people and others not in the smallest degree attached to the duke of portland by which conduct he wilfully gave up in my opinion all pretensions to be considered as of that party and much more to be considered as the leader and mouth of it in the house of commons this could not give much encouragement to those who had been separated from mr fox on account of his conduct on the first proclamation to rejoin that party  5 not having consulted any of the duke of portlands party in the house of commonsand not having consulted them because he had reason to know that the course he had resolved to pursue would be highly disagreeable to themhe represented the alarm which was a second time given and taken in still more invidious colors than those in which he painted the alarms of the former year he described those alarms in this manner although the cause of them was then grown far less equivocal and far more urgent he even went so far as to treat the supposition of the growth of a jacobin spirit in england as a libel on the nation as to the danger from abroad on the first day of the session he said little or nothing upon the subject he contented himself with defending the ruling factions in france and with accusing the public councils of this kingdom of every sort of evil design on the liberties of the peopledeclaring distinctly strongly and precisely that the whole danger of the nation was from the growth of the power of the crown the policy of this declaration was obvious it was in subservience to the general plan of disabling us from taking any steps against france to counteract the alarm given by the progress of jacobin arms and principles he endeavored to excite an opposite alarm concerning the growth of the power of the crown if that alarm should prevail he knew that the nation never would be brought by arms to oppose the growth of the jacobin empire because it is obvious that war does in its very nature necessitate the commons considerably to strengthen the hands of government and if that strength should itself be the object of terror we could have no war  6 in the extraordinary and violent speeches of that day he attributed all the evils which the public had suffered to the proclamation of the preceding summer though he spoke in presence of the duke of portlands own son the marquis of tichfield who had seconded the address on that proclamation and in presence of the duke of portlands brother lord edward bentinck and several others of his best friends and nearest relations  7 on that day that is on the 13th of december 1792 he proposed an amendment to the address which stands on the journals of the house and which is perhaps the most extraordinary record which ever did stand upon them to introduce this amendment he not only struck out the part of the proposed address which alluded to insurrections upon the ground of the objections which he took to the legality of calling together parliament objections which i must ever think litigious and sophistical but he likewise struck out that part which related to the cabals and conspiracies of the french faction in england although their practices and correspondences were of public notoriety mr cooper and mr watt had been deputed from manchester to the jacobins these ambassadors were received by them as british representatives other deputations of english had been received at the bar of the national assembly they had gone the length of giving supplies to the jacobin armies and they in return had received promises of military assistance to forward their designs in england a regular correspondence for fraternizing the two nations had also been carried on by societies in london with a great number of the jacobin societies in france this correspondence had also for its object the pretended improvement of the british constitution what is the most remarkable and by much the more mischievous part of his proceedings that day mr fox likewise struck out everything in the address which related to the tokens of ambition given by france her aggressions upon our allies and the sudden and dangerous growth of her power upon every side and instead of all those weighty and at that time necessary matters by which the house of commons was in a crisis such as perhaps europe never stood to give assurances to our allies strength to our government and a check to the common enemy of europe he substituted nothing but a criminal charge on the conduct of the british government for calling parliament together and an engagement to inquire into that conduct  8 if it had pleased god to suffer him to succeed in this his project for the amendment to the address he would forever have ruined this nation along with the rest of europe at home all the jacobin societies formed for the utter destruction of our constitution would have lifted up their heads which had been beaten down by the two proclamations those societies would have been infinitely strengthened and multiplied in every quarter their dangerous foreign communications would have been left broad and open the crown would not have been authorized to take any measure whatever for our immediate defence by sea or land the closest the most natural the nearest and at the same time from many internal as well as external circumstances the weakest of our allies holland would have been given up bound hand and foot to france just on the point of invading that republic a general consternation would have seized upon all europe and all alliance with every other power except france would have been forever rendered impracticable to us i think it impossible for any man who regards the dignity and safety of his country or indeed the common safety of mankind ever to forget mr foxs proceedings in that tremendous crisis of all human affairs  9 mr fox very soon had reason to be apprised of the general dislike of the duke of portlands friends to this conduct some of those who had even voted with him the day after their vote expressed their abhorrence of his amendment their sense of its inevitable tendency and their total alienation from the principles and maxims upon which it was made yet the very next day that is on friday the 14th of december he brought on what in effect was the very same business and on the same principles a second time  10 although the house does not usually sit on saturday he a third time brought on another proposition in the same spirit and pursued it with so much heat and perseverance as to sit into sunday a thing not known in parliament for many years  11 in all these motions and debates he wholly departed from all the political principles relative to france considered merely as a state and independent of its jacobin form of government which had hitherto been held fundamental in this country and which he had himself held more strongly than any man in parliament he at that time studiously separated himself from those to whose sentiments he used to profess no small regard although those sentiments were publicly declared i had then no concern in the party having been for some time with all outrage excluded from it but on general principles i must say that a person who assumes to be leader of a party composed of freemen and of gentlemen ought to pay some degree of deference to their feelings and even to their prejudices he ought to have some degree of management for their credit and influence in their country he showed so very little of this delicacy that he compared the alarm raised in the minds of the duke of portlands party which was his own an alarm in which they sympathized with the greater part of the nation to the panic produced by the pretended popish plot in the reign of charles the seconddescribing it to be as that was a contrivance of knaves and believed only by wellmeaning dupes and madmen  12 the monday following the 17th of december he pursued the same conduct the means used in england to coöperate with the jacobin army in politics agreed with their modes of proceeding i allude to the mischievous writings circulated with much industry and success as well as the seditious clubs which at that time added not a little to the alarm taken by observing and wellinformed men the writings and the clubs were two evils which marched together mr fox discovered the greatest possible disposition to favor and countenance the one as well as the other of these two grand instruments of the french system he would hardly consider any political writing whatsoever as a libel or as a fit object of prosecution at a time in which the press has been the grand instrument of the subversion of order of morals of religion and i may say of human society itself to carry the doctrines of its liberty higher than ever it has been known by its most extravagant assertors even in france gave occasion to very serious reflections mr fox treated the associations for prosecuting these libels as tending to prevent the improvement of the human mind and as a mobbish tyranny he thought proper to compare them with the riotous assemblies of lord george gordon in 1780 declaring that he had advised his friends in westminster to sign the associations whether they agreed to them or not in order that they might avoid destruction to their persons or their houses or a desertion of their shops this insidious advice tended to confound those who wished well to the object of the association with the seditious against whom the association was directed by this stratagem the confederacy intended for preserving the british constitution and the public peace would be wholly defeated the magistrates utterly incapable of distinguishing the friends from the enemies of order would in vain look for support when they stood in the greatest need of it  13 mr foxs whole conduct on this occasion was without example the very morning after these violent declamations in the house of commons against the association that is on tuesday the 18th he went himself to a meeting of st georges parish and there signed an association of the nature and tendency of those he had the night before so vehemently condemned and several of his particular and most intimate friends inhabitants of that parish attended and signed along with him  14 immediately after this extraordinary step and in order perfectly to defeat the ends of that association against jacobin publications which contrary to his opinions he had promoted and signed a mischievous society was formed under his auspices called the friends of the liberty of the press their title groundlessly insinuated that the freedom of the press had lately suffered or was now threatened with some violation this society was only in reality another modification of the society calling itself the friends of the people which in the preceding summer had caused so much uneasiness in the duke of portlands mind and in the minds of several of his friends this new society was composed of many if not most of the members of the club of the friends of the people with the addition of a vast multitude of others such as mr horne tooke of the worst and most seditious dispositions that could be found in the whole kingdom in the first meeting of this club mr erskine took the lead and directly without any disavowal ever since on mr foxs part made use of his name and authority in favor of its formation and purposes in the same meeting mr erskine had thanks for his defence of paine which amounted to a complete avowal of that jacobin incendiary else it is impossible to know how mr erskine should have deserved such marked applauses for acting merely as a lawyer for his fee in the ordinary course of his profession  15 indeed mr fox appeared the general patron of all such persons and proceedings when lord edward fitzgerald and other persons for practices of the most dangerous kind in paris and in london were removed from the kings guards mr fox took occasion in the house of commons heavily to censure that act as unjust and oppressive and tending to make officers bad citizens there were few however who did not call for some such measures on the part of government as of absolute necessity for the kings personal safety as well as that of the public and nothing but the mistaken lenity with which such practices were rather discountenanced than punished could possibly deserve reprehension in what was done with regard to those gentlemen  16 mr fox regularly and systematically and with a diligence long unusual to him did everything he could to countenance the same principle of fraternity and connection with the jacobins abroad and the national convention of france for which these officers had been removed from the guards for when a bill feeble and lax indeed and far short of the vigor required by the conjuncture was brought in for removing out of the kingdom the emissaries of france mr fox opposed it with all his might he pursued a vehement and detailed opposition to it through all its stages describing it as a measure contrary to the existing treaties between great britain and france as a violation of the law of nations and as an outrage on the great charter itself  17 in the same manner and with the same heat he opposed a bill which though awkward and inartificial in its construction was right and wise in its principle and was precedented in the best times and absolutely necessary at that juncture i mean the traitorous correspondence bill by these means the enemy rendered infinitely dangerous by the links of real faction and pretended commerce would have been had mr fox succeeded enabled to carry on the war against us by our own resources for this purpose that enemy would have had his agents and traitors in the midst of us  18 when at length war was actually declared by the usurpers in france against this kingdom and declared whilst they were pretending a negotiation through dumouriez with lord auckland mr fox still continued through the whole of the proceedings to discredit the national honor and justice and to throw the entire blame of the war on parliament and on his own country as acting with violence haughtiness and want of equity he frequently asserted both at the time and ever since that the war though declared by france was provoked by us and that it was wholly unnecessary and fundamentally unjust  19 he has lost no opportunity of railing in the most virulent manner and in the most unmeasured language at every foreign power with whom we could now or at any time contract any useful or effectual alliance against francedeclaring that he hoped no alliance with those powers was made or was in a train of being made1 he always expressed himself with the utmost horror concerning such alliances so did all his phalanx mr sheridan in particular after one of his invectives against those powers sitting by him said with manifest marks of his approbation that if we must go to war he had rather go to war alone than with such allies  20 immediately after the french declaration of war against us parliament addressed the king in support of the war against them as just and necessary and provoked as well as formally declared against great britain he did not divide the house upon this measure yet he immediately followed this our solemn parliamentary engagement to the king with a motion proposing a set of resolutions the effect of which was that the two houses were to load themselves with every kind of reproach for having made the address which they had just carried to the throne he commenced this long string of criminatory resolutions against his country if king lords and commons of great britain and a decided majority without doors are his country with a declaration against intermeddling in the interior concerns of france the purport of this resolution of noninterference is a thing unexampled in the history of the world when one nation has been actually at war with another the best writers on the law of nations give no sort of countenance to his doctrine of noninterference in the extent and manner in which he used it even when there is no war when the war exists not one authority is against it in all its latitude his doctrine is equally contrary to the enemys uniform practice who whether in peace or in war makes it his great aim not only to change the government but to make an entire revolution in the whole of the social order in every country  the object of the last of this extraordinary string of resolutions moved by mr fox was to advise the crown not to enter into such an engagement with any foreign power so as to hinder us from making a separate peace with france or which might tend to enable any of those powers to introduce a government in that country other than such as those persons whom he calls the people of france shall choose to establish in short the whole of these resolutions appeared to have but one drift namely the sacrifice of our own domestic dignity and safety and the independency of europe to the support of this strange mixture of anarchy and tyranny which prevails in france and which mr fox and his party were pleased to call a government the immediate consequence of these measures was by an example the ill effects of which on the whole world are not to be calculated to secure the robbers of the innocent nobility gentry and ecclesiastics of france in the enjoyment of the spoil they have made of the estates houses and goods of their fellowcitizens  21 not satisfied with moving these resolutions tending to confirm this horrible tyranny and robbery and with actually dividing the house on the first of the long string which they composed in a few days afterwards he encouraged and supported mr grey in producing the very same string in a new form and in moving under the shape of an address of parliament to the crown another virulent libel on all its own proceedings in this session in which not only all the ground of the resolutions was again travelled over but much new inflammatory matter was introduced in particular a charge was made that great britain had not interposed to prevent the last partition of poland on this head the party dwelt very largely and very vehemently mr foxs intention in the choice of this extraordinary topic was evident enough he well knows two things first that no wise or honest man can approve of that partition or can contemplate it without prognosticating great mischief from it to all countries at some future time secondly he knows quite as well that let our opinions on that partition be what they will england by itself is not in a situation to afford to poland any assistance whatsoever the purpose of the introduction of polish politics into this discussion was not for the sake of poland it was to throw an odium upon those who are obliged to decline the cause of justice from their impossibility of supporting a cause which they approve as if we who think more strongly on this subject than he does were of a party against poland because we are obliged to act with some of the authors of that injustice against our common enemy france but the great and leading purpose of this introduction of poland into the debates on the french war was to divert the public attention from what was in our power that is from a steady coöperation against france to a quarrel with the allies for the sake of a polish war which for any useful purpose to poland he knew it was out of our power to make if england can touch poland ever so remotely it must be through the medium of alliances but by attacking all the combined powers together for their supposed unjust aggression upon france he bound them by a now common interest not separately to join england for the rescue of poland the proposition could only mean to do what all the writers of his party in the morning chronicle have aimed at persuading the public to through the whole of the last autumn and winter and to this hour that is to an alliance with the jacobins of france for the pretended purpose of succoring poland this curious project would leave to great britain no other ally in all europe except its old enemy france  22 mr fox after the first days discussion on the question for the address was at length driven to admit to admit rather than to urge and that very faintly that france had discovered ambitious views which none of his partisans that i recollect mr sheridan excepted did however either urge or admit what is remarkable enough all the points admitted against the jacobins were brought to bear in their favor as much as those in which they were defended for when mr fox admitted that the conduct of the jacobins did discover ambition he always ended his admission of their ambitious views by an apology for them insisting that the universally hostile disposition shown to them rendered their ambition a sort of defensive policy thus on whatever roads he travelled they all terminated in recommending a recognition of their pretended republic and in the plan of sending an ambassador to it this was the burden of all his songeverything which we could reasonably hope from war would be obtained from treaty it is to be observed however that in all these debates mr fox never once stated to the house upon what ground it was he conceived that all the objects of the french system of united fanaticism and ambition would instantly be given up whenever england should think fit to propose a treaty on proposing so strange a recognition and so humiliating an embassy as he moved he was bound to produce his authority if any authority he had he ought to have done this the rather because le brun in his first propositions and in his answers to lord grenville defended on principle not on temporary convenience everything which was objected to france and showed not the smallest disposition to give up any one of the points in discussion mr fox must also have known that the convention had passed to the order of the day on a proposition to give some sort of explanation or modification to the hostile decree of the 19th of november for exciting insurrections in all countriesa decree known to be peculiarly pointed at great britain the whole proceeding of the french administration was the most remote that could be imagined from furnishing any indication of a pacific disposition for at the very time in which it was pretended that the jacobins entertained those boasted pacific intentions at the very time in which mr fox was urging a treaty with them not content with refusing a modification of the decree for insurrections they published their evermemorable decree of the 15th of december 1792 for disorganizing every country in europe into which they should on any occasion set their foot and on the 25th and the 30th of the same month they solemnly and on the last of these days practically confirmed that decree  23 but mr fox had himself taken good care in the negotiation he proposed that france should not be obliged to make any very great concessions to her presumed moderation for he had laid down one general comprehensive rule with him as he said constant and inviolable this rule in fact would not only have left to the faction in france all the property and power they had usurped at home but most if not all of the conquests which by their atrocious perfidy and violence they had made abroad the principle laid down by mr fox is thisthat every state in the conclusion of a war has a right to avail itself of its conquests towards an indemnification this principle true or false is totally contrary to the policy which this country has pursued with france at various periods particularly at the treaty of ryswick in the last century and at the treaty of aixlachapelle in this whatever the merits of his rule may be in the eyes of neutral judges it is a rule which no statesman before him ever laid down in favor of the adverse power with whom he was to negotiate the adverse party himself may safely be trusted to take care of his own aggrandizement but as if the black boxes of the several parties had been exchanged mr foxs english ambassador by some odd mistake would find himself charged with the concerns of france if we were to leave france as she stood at the time when mr fox proposed to treat with her that formidable power must have been infinitely strengthened and almost every other power in europe as much weakened by the extraordinary basis which he laid for a treaty for avignon must go from the pope savoy at least from the king of sardinia if not nice liege mentz salm deuxponts and basle must be separated from germany on this side of the rhine liege at least must be lost to the empire and added to france mr foxs general principle fully covered all this how much of these territories came within his rule he never attempted to define he kept a profound silence as to germany as to the netherlands he was something more explicit he said if i recollect right that france on that side might expect something towards strengthening her frontier as to the remaining parts of the netherlands which he supposed france might consent to surrender he went so far as to declare that england ought not to permit the emperor to be repossessed of the remainder of the ten provinces but that the people should choose such a form of independent government as they liked this proposition of mr fox was just the arrangement which the usurpation in france had all along proposed to make as the circumstances were at that time and have been ever since his proposition fully indicated what government the flemings must have in the stated extent of what was left to them a government so set up in the netherlands whether compulsory or by the choice of the sansculottes who he well knew were to be the real electors and the sole electors in whatever name it was to exist must evidently depend for its existence as it had done for its original formation on france in reality it must have ended in that point to which piece by piece the french were then actually bringing all the netherlandsthat is an incorporation with france as a body of new departments just as savoy and liege and the rest of their pretended independent popular sovereignties have been united to their republic such an arrangement must have destroyed austria it must have left holland always at the mercy of france it must totally and forever cut off all political communication between england and the continent such must have been the situation of europe according to mr foxs system of politics however laudable his personal motives may have been in proposing so complete a change in the whole system of great britain with regard to all the continental powers  24 after it had been generally supposed that all public business was over for the session and that mr fox had exhausted all the modes of pressing this french scheme he thought proper to take a step beyond every expectation and which demonstrated his wonderful eagerness and perseverance in his cause as well as the nature and true character of the cause itself this step was taken by mr fox immediately after his giving his assent to the grant of supply voted to him by mr serjeant adair and a committee of gentlemen who assumed to themselves to act in the name of the public in the instrument of his acceptance of this grant mr fox took occasion to assure them that he would always persevere in the same conduct which had procured to him so honorable a mark of the public approbation he was as good as his word  25 it was not long before an opportunity was found or made for proving the sincerity of his professions and demonstrating his gratitude to those who had given public and unequivocal marks of their approbation of his late conduct one of the most virulent of the jacobin faction mr gurney a banker at norwich had all along distinguished himself by his french politics by the means of this gentleman and of his associates of the same description one of the most insidious and dangerous handbills that ever was seen had been circulated at norwich against the war drawn up in an hypocritical tone of compassion for the poor this address to the populace of norwich was to play in concert with an address to mr fox it was signed by mr gurney and the higher part of the french fraternity in that town in this paper mr fox is applauded for his conduct throughout the session and requested before the prorogation to make a motion for an immediate peace with france  26 mr fox did not revoke to this suit he readily and thankfully undertook the task assigned to him not content however with merely falling in with their wishes he proposed a task on his part to the gentlemen of norwich which was that they should move the people without doors to petition against the war he said that without such assistance little good could be expected from anything he might attempt within the walls of the house of commons in the mean time to animate his norwich friends in their endeavors to besiege parliament he snatched the first opportunity to give notice of a motion which he very soon after made namely to address the crown to make peace with france the address was so worded as to coöperate with the handbill in bringing forward matter calculated to inflame the manufacturers throughout the kingdom  27 in support of his motion he declaimed in the most virulent strain even beyond any of his former invectives against every power with whom we were then and are now acting against france in the moral forum some of these powers certainly deserve all the ill he said of them but the political effect aimed at evidently was to turn our indignation from france with whom we were at war upon russia or prussia or austria or sardinia or all of them together in consequence of his knowledge that we could not effectually do without them and his resolution that we should not act with them he proposed that having as he asserted obtained the only avowed object of the war the evacuation of holland we ought to conclude an instant peace  28 mr fox could not be ignorant of the mistaken basis upon which his motion was grounded he was not ignorant that though the attempt of dumouriez on holland so very near succeeding and the navigation of the scheldt a part of the same piece were among the immediate causes they were by no means the only causes alleged for parliaments taking that offence at the proceedings of france for which the jacobins were so prompt in declaring war upon this kingdom other full as weighty causes had been alleged they were1 the general overbearing and desperate ambition of that faction 2 their actual attacks on every nation in europe 3 their usurpation of territories in the empire with the governments of which they had no pretence of quarrel 4 their perpetual and irrevocable consolidation with their own dominions of every territory of the netherlands of germany and of italy of which they got a temporary possession 5 the mischiefs attending the prevalence of their system which would make the success of their ambitious designs a new and peculiar species of calamity in the world 6 their formal public decrees particularly those of the 19th of november and 15th and 25th of december 7 their notorious attempts to undermine the constitution of this country 8 their public reception of deputations of traitors for that direct purpose 9 their murder of their sovereign declared by most of the members of the convention who spoke with their vote without a disavowal from any to be perpetrated as an example to all kings and a precedent for all subjects to follow all these and not the scheldt alone or the invasion of holland were urged by the minister and by mr windham by myself and by others who spoke in those debates as causes for bringing france to a sense of her wrong in the war which she declared against us mr fox well knew that not one man argued for the necessity of a vigorous resistance to france who did not state the war as being for the very existence of the social order here and in every part of europewho did not state his opinion that this war was not at all a foreign war of empire but as much for our liberties properties laws and religion and even more so than any we had ever been engaged in this was the war which according to mr fox and mr gurney we were to abandon before the enemy had felt in the slightest degree the impression of our arms  29 had mr foxs disgraceful proposal been complied with this kingdom would have been stained with a blot of perfidy hitherto without an example in our history and with far less excuse than any act of perfidy which we find in the history of any other nation the moment when by the incredible exertions of austria very little through ours the temporary deliverance of holland in effect our own deliverance had been achieved he advised the house instantly to abandon her to that very enemy from whose arms she had freed ourselves and the closest of our allies  30 but we are not to be imposed on by forms of language we must act on the substance of things to abandon austria in this manner was to abandon holland itself for suppose france encouraged and strengthened as she must have been by our treacherous desertionsuppose france i say to succeed against austria as she had succeeded the very year before england would after its disarmament have nothing in the world but the inviolable faith of jacobinism and the steady politics of anarchy to depend upon against frances renewing the very same attempts upon holland and renewing them considering what holland was and is with much better prospects of success mr fox must have been well aware that if we were to break with the greater continental powers and particularly to come to a rupture with them in the violent and intemperate mode in which he would have made the breach the defence of holland against a foreign enemy and a strong domestic faction must hereafter rest solely upon england without the chance of a single ally either on that or on any other occasion so far as to the pretended sole object of the war which mr fox supposed to be so completely obtained but which then was not at all and at this day is not completely obtained as to leave us nothing else to do than to cultivate a peaceful quiet correspondence with those quiet peaceable and moderate people the jacobins of france  31 to induce us to this mr fox labored hard to make it appear that the powers with whom we acted were full as ambitious and as perfidious as the french this might be true as to other nations they had not however been so to us or to holland he produced no proof of active ambition and ill faith against austria but supposing the combined powers had been all thus faithless and been all alike so there was one circumstance which made an essential difference between them and france i need not therefore be at the trouble of contesting this pointwhich however in this latitude and as at all affecting great britain and holland i deny utterly be it so but the great monarchies have it in their power to keep their faith if they please because they are governments of established and recognized authority at home and abroad france had in reality no government the very factions who exercised power had no stability the french convention had no powers of peace or war supposing the convention to be free most assuredly it was not they had shown no disposition to abandon their projects though long driven out of liege it was not many days before mr foxs motion that they still continued to claim it as a country which their principles of fraternity bound them to protectthat is to subdue and to regulate at their pleasure that party which mr fox inclined most to favor and trust and from which he must have received his assurances if any he did receive that is the brissotins were then either prisoners or fugitives the party which prevailed over them that of danton and marat was itself in a tottering condition and was disowned by a very great part of france to say nothing of the royal party who were powerful and growing and who had full as good a right to claim to be the legitimate government as any of the parisian factions with whom he proposed to treator rather as it seemed to me to surrender at discretion  32 but when mr fox began to come from his general hopes of the moderation of the jacobins to particulars he put the case that they might not perhaps be willing to surrender savoy he certainly was not willing to contest that point with them but plainly and explicitly as i understood him proposed to let them keep itthough he knew or he was much worse informed than he would be thought that england had at the very time agreed on the terms of a treaty with the king of sardinia of which the recovery of savoy was the casus fœderis in the teeth of this treaty mr fox proposed a direct and most scandalous breach of our faith formally and recently given but to surrender savoy was to surrender a great deal more than so many square acres of land or so much revenue in its consequences the surrender of savoy was to make a surrender to france of switzerland and italy of both which countries savoy is the keyas it is known to ordinary speculators in politics though it may not be known to the weavers in norwich who it seems are by mr fox called to be the judges in this matter  a sure way indeed to encourage france not to make a surrender of this key of italy and switzerland or of mentz the key of germany or of any other object whatsoever which she holds is to let her see that the people of england raise a clamor against the war before terms are so much as proposed on any side from that moment the jacobins would be masters of the terms they would know that parliament at all hazards would force the king to a separate peace the crown could not in that case have any use of its judgment parliament could not possess more judgment than the crown when besieged as mr fox proposed to mr gurney by the cries of the manufacturers this description of men mr fox endeavored in his speech by every method to irritate and inflame in effect his two speeches were through the whole nothing more than an amplification of the norwich handbill he rested the greatest part of his argument on the distress of trade which he attributed to the war though it was obvious to any tolerably good observation and much more must have been clear to such an observation as his that the then difficulties of the trade and manufacture could have no sort of connection with our share in it the war had hardly begun we had suffered neither by spoil nor by defeat nor by disgrace of any kind public credit was so little impaired that instead of being supported by any extraordinary aids from individuals it advanced a credit to individuals to the amount of five millions for the support of trade and manufactures under their temporary difficulties a thing before never heard ofa thing of which i do not commend the policy but only state it to show that mr foxs ideas of the effects of war were without any trace of foundation  33 it is impossible not to connect the arguments and proceedings of a party with that of its leaderespecially when not disavowed or controlled by him mr foxs partisans declaim against all the powers of europe except the jacobins just as he does but not having the same reasons for management and caution which he has they speak out he satisfies himself merely with making his invectives and leaves others to draw the conclusion but they produce their polish interposition for the express purpose of leading to a french alliance they urge their french peace in order to make a junction with the jacobins to oppose the powers whom in their language they call despots and their leagues a combination of despots indeed no man can look on the present posture of europe with the least degree of discernment who will not be thoroughly convinced that england must be the fast friend or the determined enemy of france there is no medium and i do not think mr fox to be so dull as not to observe this his peace would have involved us instantly in the most extensive and most ruinous wars at the same time that it would have made a broad highway across which no human wisdom could put an effectual barrier for a mutual intercourse with the fraternizing jacobins on both sides the consequences of which those will certainly not provide against who do not dread or dislike them  34 it is not amiss in this place to enter a little more fully into the spirit of the principal arguments on which mr fox thought proper to rest this his grand and concluding motion particularly such as were drawn from the internal state of our affairs under a specious appearance not uncommonly put on by men of unscrupulous ambition that of tenderness and compassion to the poor he did his best to appeal to the judgments of the meanest and most ignorant of the people on the merits of the war he had before done something of the same dangerous kind in his printed letter the ground of a political war is of all things that which the poor laborer and manufacturer are the least capable of conceiving this sort of people know in general that they must suffer by war it is a matter to which they are sufficiently competent because it is a matter of feeling the causes of a war are not matters of feeling but of reason and foresight and often of remote considerations and of a very great combination of circumstances which they are utterly incapable of comprehending and indeed it is not every man in the highest classes who is altogether equal to it nothing in a general sense appears to me less fair and justifiable even if no attempt were made to inflame the passions than to submit a matter on discussion to a tribunal incapable of judging of more than one side of the question it is at least as unjustifiable to inflame the passions of such judges against that side in favor of which they cannot so much as comprehend the arguments before the prevalence of the french system which as far as it has gone has extinguished the salutary prejudice called our country nobody was more sensible of this important truth than mr fox and nothing was more proper and pertinent or was more felt at the time than his reprimand to mr wilberforce for an inconsiderate expression which tended to call in the judgment of the poor to estimate the policy of war upon the standard of the taxes they may be obliged to pay towards its support  35 it is fatally known that the great object of the jacobin system is to excite the lowest description of the people to range themselves under ambitious men for the pillage and destruction of the more eminent orders and classes of the community the thing therefore that a man not fanatically attached to that dreadful project would most studiously avoid is to act a part with the french propagandists in attributing as they constantly do all wars and all the consequences of wars to the pride of those orders and to their contempt of the weak and indigent part of the society the ruling jacobins insist upon it that even the wars which they carry on with so much obstinacy against all nations are made to prevent the poor from any longer being the instruments and victims of kings nobles and the aristocracy of burghers and rich men they pretend that the destruction of kings nobles and the aristocracy of burghers and rich men is the only means of establishing an universal and perpetual peace this is the great drift of all their writings from the time of the meeting of the states of france in 1789 to the publication of the last morning chronicle they insist that even the war which with so much boldness they have declared against all nations is to prevent the poor from becoming the instruments and victims of these persons and descriptions it is but too easy if you once teach poor laborers and mechanics to defy their prejudices and as this has been done with an industry scarcely credible to substitute the principles of fraternity in the room of that salutary prejudice called our countryit is i say but too easy to persuade them agreeably to what mr fox hints in his public letter that this war is and that the other wars have been the wars of kings it is easy to persuade them that the terrors even of a foreign conquest are not terrors for them it is easy to persuade them that for their part they have nothing to loseand that their condition is not likely to be altered for the worse whatever party may happen to prevail in the war under any circumstances this doctrine is highly dangerous as it tends to make separate parties of the higher and lower orders and to put their interests on a different bottom but if the enemy you have to deal with should appear as france now appears under the very name and title of the deliverer of the poor and the chastiser of the rich the former class would readily become not an indifferent spectator of the war but would be ready to enlist in the faction of the enemywhich they would consider though under a foreign name to be more connected with them than an adverse description in the same land all the props of society would be drawn from us by these doctrines and the very foundations of the public defence would give way in an instant  36 there is no point which the faction of fraternity in england have labored more than to excite in the poor the horror of any war with france upon any occasion when they found that their open attacks upon our constitution in favor of a french republic were for the present repelled they put that matter out of sight and have taken up the more plausible and popular ground of general peace upon merely general principles although these very men in the correspondence of their clubs with those of france had reprobated the neutrality which now they so earnestly press but in reality their maxim was and is peace and alliance with france and war with the rest of the world  37 this last motion of mr fox bound up the whole of his politics during the session this motion had many circumstances particularly in the norwich correspondence by which the mischief of all the others was aggravated beyond measure yet this last motion far the worst of mr foxs proceedings was the best supported of any of them except his amendment to the address the duke of portland had directly engaged to support the warhere was a motion as directly made to force the crown to put an end to it before a blow had been struck the efforts of the faction have so prevailed that some of his graces nearest friends have actually voted for that motion some after showing themselves went away others did not appear at all so it must be where a man is for any time supported from personal considerations without reference to his public conduct through the whole of this business the spirit of fraternity appears to me to have been the governing principle it might be shameful for any man above the vulgar to show so blind a partiality even to his own country as mr fox appears on all occasions this session to have shown to france had mr fox been a minister and proceeded on the principles laid down by him i believe there is little doubt he would have been considered as the most criminal statesman that ever lived in this country i do not know why a statesman out of place is not to be judged in the same manner unless we can excuse him by pleading in his favor a total indifference to principle and that he would act and think in quite a different way if he were in office this i will not suppose one may think better of him and that in case of his power he might change his mind but supposing that from better or from worse motives he might change his mind on his acquisition of the favor of the crown i seriously fear that if the king should tomorrow put power into his hands and that his good genius would inspire him with maxims very different from those he has promulgated he would not be able to get the better of the ill temper and the ill doctrines he has been the means of exciting and propagating throughout the kingdom from the very beginning of their inhuman and unprovoked rebellion and tyrannic usurpation he has covered the predominant faction in france and their adherents here with the most exaggerated panegyrics neither has he missed a single opportunity of abusing and vilifying those who in uniform concurrence with the duke of portlands and lord fitzwilliams opinion have maintained the true grounds of the revolution settlement in 1688 he lamented all the defeats of the french he rejoiced in all their victorieseven when these victories threatened to overwhelm the continent of europe and by facilitating their means of penetrating into holland to bring this most dreadful of all evils with irresistible force to the very doors if not into the very heart of our country to this hour he always speaks of every thought of overturning the french jacobinism by force on the part of any power whatsoever as an attempt unjust and cruel and which he reprobates with horror if any of the french jacobin leaders are spoken of with hatred or scorn he falls upon those who take that liberty with all the zeal and warmth with which men of honor defend their particular and bosom friends when attacked he always represents their cause as a cause of liberty and all who oppose it as partisans of despotism he obstinately continues to consider the great and growing vices crimes and disorders of that country as only evils of passage which are to produce a permanently happy state of order and freedom he represents these disorders exactly in the same way and with the same limitations which are used by one of the two great jacobin factions i mean that of pétion and brissot like them he studiously confines his horror and reprobation only to the massacres of the 2d of september and passes by those of the 10th of august as well as the imprisonment and deposition of the king which were the consequences of that day as indeed were the massacres themselves to which he confines his censure though they were not actually perpetrated till early in september like that faction he condemns not the deposition or the proposed exile or perpetual imprisonment but only the murder of the king mr sheridan on every occasion palliates all their massacres committed in every part of france as the effects of a natural indignation at the exorbitances of despotism and of the dread of the people of returning under that yoke he has thus taken occasion to load not the actors in this wickedness but the government of a mild merciful beneficent and patriotic prince and his suffering faithful subjects with all the crimes of the new anarchical tyranny under which the one has been murdered and the others are oppressed those continual either praises or palliating apologies of everything done in france and those invectives as uniformly vomited out upon all those who venture to express their disapprobation of such proceedings coming from a man of mr foxs fame and authority and one who is considered as the person to whom a great party of the wealthiest men of the kingdom look up have been the cause why the principle of french fraternity formerly gained the ground which at one time it had obtained in this country it will infallibly recover itself again and in ten times a greater degree if the kind of peace in the manner which he preaches ever shall be established with the reigning faction in france  38 so far as to the french practices with regard to france and the other powers of europe as to their principles and doctrines with regard to the constitution of states mr fox studiously on all occasions and indeed when no occasion calls for it as on the debate of the petition for reform brings forward and asserts their fundamental and fatal principle pregnant with every mischief and every crime namely that in every country the people is the legitimate sovereign exactly conformable to the declaration of the french clubs and legislatorsla souveraineté est une indivisible inalienable et imprescriptible elle appartient à la nation aucune section du peuple ni aucun individu ne peut sen attribuer lexercise this confounds in a manner equally mischievous and stupid the origin of a government from the people with its continuance in their hands i believe that no such doctrine has ever been heard of in any public act of any government whatsoever until it was adopted i think from the writings of rousseau by the french assemblies who have made it the basis of their constitution at home and of the matter of their apostolate in every country these and other wild declarations of abstract principle mr fox says are in themselves perfectly right and true though in some cases he allows the french draw absurd consequences from them but i conceive he is mistaken the consequences are most logically though most mischievously drawn from the premises and principles by that wicked and ungracious faction the fault is in the foundation  39 before society in a multitude of men it is obvious that sovereignty and subjection are ideas which cannot exist it is the compact on which society is formed that makes both but to suppose the people contrary to their compacts both to give away and retain the same thing is altogether absurd it is worse for it supposes in any strong combination of men a power and right of always dissolving the social union which power however if it exists renders them again as little sovereigns as subjects but a mere unconnected multitude it is not easy to state for what good end at a time like this when the foundations of all ancient and prescriptive governments such as ours to which people submit not because they have chosen them but because they are born to them are undermined by perilous theories that mr fox should be so fond of referring to those theories upon all occasions even though speculatively they might be truewhich god forbid they should particularly i do not see the reason why he should be so fond of declaring that the principles of the revolution have made the crown of great britain electivewhy he thinks it seasonable to preach up with so much earnestness for now three years together the doctrine of resistance and revolution at allor to assert that our last revolution of 1688 stands on the same or similar principles with that of france we are not called upon to bring forward these doctrines which are hardly ever resorted to but in cases of extremity and where they are followed by correspondent actions we are not called upon by any circumstance that i know of which can justify a revolt or which demands a revolution or can make an election of a successor to the crown necessary whatever latent right may be supposed to exist for effectuating any of these purposes  40 not the least alarming of the proceedings of mr fox and his friends in this session especially taken in concurrence with their whole proceedings with regard to france and its principles is their eagerness at this season under pretence of parliamentary reforms a project which had been for some time rather dormant to discredit and disgrace the house of commons for this purpose these gentlemen had found a way to insult the house by several atrocious libels in the form of petitions in particular they brought up a libel or rather a complete digest of libellous matter from the club called the friends of the people it is indeed at once the most audacious and the most insidious of all the performances of that kind which have yet appeared it is said to be the penmanship of mr tierney to bring whom into parliament the duke of portland formerly had taken a good deal of pains and expended as i hear a considerable sum of money  41 among the circumstances of danger from that piece and from its precedent it is observable that this is the first petition if i remember right coming from a club or association signed by individuals denoting neither local residence nor corporate capacity this mode of petition not being strictly illegal or informal though in its spirit in the highest degree mischievous may and will lead to other things of that nature tending to bring these clubs and associations to the french model and to make them in the end answer french purposes i mean that without legal names these clubs will be led to assume political capacities that they may debate the forms of constitution and that from their meetings they may insolently dictate their will to the regular authorities of the kingdom in the manner in which the jacobin clubs issue their mandates to the national assembly or the national convention the audacious remonstrance i observe is signed by all of that association the friends of the people who are not in parliament and it was supported most strenuously by all the associators who are members with mr fox at their head he and they contended for referring this libel to a committee upon the question of that reference they grounded all their debate for a change in the constitution of parliament the pretended petition is in fact a regular charge or impeachment of the house of commons digested into a number of articles this plan of reform is not a criminal impeachment but a matter of prudence to be submitted to the public wisdom which must be as well apprised of the facts as petitioners can be but those accusers of the house of commons have proceeded upon the principles of a criminal process and have had the effrontery to offer proof on each article  42 this charge the party of mr fox maintained article by article beginning with the firstnamely the interference of peers at elections and their nominating in effect several of the members of the house of commons in the printed list of grievances which they made out on the occasion and in support of their charge is found the borough for which under lord fitzwilliams influence i now sit by this remonstrance and its object they hope to defeat the operation of property in elections and in reality to dissolve the connection and communication of interests which makes the houses of parliament a mutual support to each other mr fox and the friends of the people are not so ignorant as not to know that peers do not interfere in elections as peers but as men of property they well know that the house of lords is by itself the feeblest part of the constitution they know that the house of lords is supported only by its connections with the crown and with the house of commons and that without this double connection the lords could not exist a single year they know that all these parts of our constitution whilst they are balanced as opposing interests are also connected as friends otherwise nothing but confusion could be the result of such a complex constitution it is natural therefore that they who wish the common destruction of the whole and of all its parts should contend for their total separation but as the house of commons is that link which connects both the other parts of the constitution the crown and the lords with the mass of the people it is to that link as it is natural enough that their incessant attacks are directed that artificial representation of the people being once discredited and overturned all goes to pieces and nothing but a plain french democracy or arbitrary monarchy can possibly exist  43 some of these gentlemen who have attacked the house of commons lean to a representation of the people by the headthat is to individual representation none of them that i recollect except mr fox directly rejected it it is remarkable however that he only rejected it by simply declaring an opinion he let all the argument go against his opinion all the proceedings and arguments of his reforming friends lead to individual representation and to nothing else it deserves to be attentively observed that this individual representation is the only plan of their reform which has been explicitly proposed in the mean time the conduct of mr fox appears to be far more inexplicable on any good ground than theirs who propose the individual representation for he neither proposes anything nor even suggests that he has anything to propose in lieu of the present mode of constituting the house of commons on the contrary he declares against all the plans which have yet been suggested either from himself or others yet thus unprovided with any plan whatsoever he pressed forward this unknown reform with all possible warmth and for that purpose in a speech of several hours he urged the referring to a committee the libellous impeachment of the house of commons by the association of the friends of the people but for mr fox to discredit parliament as it stands to countenance leagues covenants and associations for its further discredit to render it perfectly odious and contemptible and at the same time to propose nothing at all in place of what he disgraces is worse if possible than to contend for personal individual representation and is little less than demanding in plain terms to bring on plain anarchy  44 mr fox and these gentlemen have for the present been defeated but they are neither converted nor disheartened they have solemnly declared that they will persevere until they shall have obtained their endspersisting to assert that the house of commons not only is not the true representative of the people but that it does not answer the purpose of such representation most of them insist that all the debts the taxes and the burdens of all kinds on the people with every other evil and inconvenience which we have suffered since the revolution have been owing solely to an house of commons which does not speak the sense of the people  45 it is also not to be forgotten that mr fox and all who hold with him on this as on all other occasions of pretended reform most bitterly reproach mr pitt with treachery in declining to support the scandalous charges and indefinite projects of this infamous libel from the friends of the people by the animosity with which they persecute all those who grow cold in this cause of pretended reform they hope that if through levity inexperience or ambition any young person like mr pitt for instance happens to be once embarked in their design they shall by a false shame keep him fast in it forever many they have so hampered  46 i know it is usual when the peril and alarm of the hour appears to be a little overblown to think no more of the matter but for my part i look back with horror on what we have escaped and am full of anxiety with regard to the dangers which in my opinion are still to be apprehended both at home and abroad this business has cast deep roots whether it is necessarily connected in theory with jacobinism is not worth a dispute the two things are connected in fact the partisans of the one are the partisans of the other i know it is common with those who are favorable to the gentlemen of mr foxs party and to their leader though not at all devoted to all their reforming projects or their gallican politics to argue in palliation of their conduct that it is not in their power to do all the harm which their actions evidently tend to it is said that as the people will not support them they may safely be indulged in those eccentric fancies of reform and those theories which lead to nothing this apology is not very much to the honor of those politicians whose interests are to be adhered to in defiance of their conduct i cannot flatter myself that these incessant attacks on the constitution of parliament are safe it is not in my power to despise the unceasing efforts of a confederacy of about fifty persons of eminence men for the far greater part of very ample fortunes either in possession or in expectancy men of decided characters and vehement passions men of very great talents of all kinds of much boldness and of the greatest possible spirit of artifice intrigue adventure and enterprise all operating with unwearied activity and perseverance these gentlemen are much stronger too without doors than some calculate they have the more active part of the dissenters with them and the whole clan of speculators of all denominationsa large and growing species they have that floating multitude which goes with events and which suffers the loss or gain of a battle to decide its opinions of right and wrong as long as by every art this party keeps alive a spirit of disaffection against the very constitution of the kingdom and attributes as lately it has been in the habit of doing all the public misfortunes to that constitution it is absolutely impossible but that some moment must arrive in which they will be enabled to produce a pretended reform and a real revolution if ever the body of this compound constitution of ours is subverted either in favor of unlimited monarchy or of wild democracy that ruin will most certainly be the result of this very sort of machinations against the house of commons it is not from a confidence in the views or intentions of any statesman that i think he is to be indulged in these perilous amusements  47 before it is made the great object of any mans political life to raise another to power it is right to consider what are the real dispositions of the person to be so elevated we are not to form our judgment on those dispositions from the rules and principles of a court of justice but from those of private discretionnot looking for what would serve to criminate another but what is sufficient to direct ourselves by a comparison of a series of the discourses and actions of certain men for a reasonable length of time it is impossible not to obtain sufficient indication of the general tendency of their views and principles there is no other rational mode of proceeding it is true that in some one or two perhaps not wellweighed expressions or some one or two unconnected and doubtful affairs we may and ought to judge of the actions or words by our previous good or ill opinion of the man but this allowance has its bounds it does not extend to any regular course of systematic action or of constant and repeated discourse it is against every principle of common sense and of justice to ones self and to the public to judge of a series of speeches and actions from the man and not of the man from the whole tenor of his language and conduct i have stated the above matters not as inferring a criminal charge of evil intention if i had meant to do so perhaps they are stated with tolerable exactness but i have no such view the intentions of these gentlemen may be very pure i do not dispute it but i think they are in some great error if these things are done by mr fox and his friends with good intentions they are not done less dangerously for it shows these good intentions are not under the direction of safe maxims and principles  48 mr fox mr sheridan and the gentlemen who call themselves the phalanx have not been so very indulgent to others they have thought proper to ascribe to those members of the house of commons who in exact agreement with the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam abhor and oppose the french system the basest and most unworthy motives for their conductas if none could oppose that atheistic immoral and impolitic project set up in france so disgraceful and destructive as i conceive to human nature itself but with some sinister intentions they treat those members on all occasions with a sort of lordly insolence though they are persons that whatever homage they may pay to the eloquence of the gentlemen who choose to look down upon them with scorn are not their inferiors in any particular which calls for and obtains just consideration from the public not their inferiors in knowledge of public law or of the constitution of the kingdom not their inferiors in their acquaintance with its foreign and domestic interests not their inferiors in experience or practice of business not their inferiors in moral character not their inferiors in the proofs they have given of zeal and industry in the service of their country without denying to these gentlemen the respect and consideration which it is allowed justly belongs to them we see no reason why they should not as well be obliged to defer something to our opinions as that we should be bound blindly and servilely to follow those of mr fox mr sheridan mr grey mr courtenay mr lambton mr whitbread mr taylor and others we are members of parliament and their equals we never consider ourselves as their followers these gentlemen some of them hardly born when some of us came into parliament have thought proper to treat us as desertersas if we had been listed into their phalanx like soldiers and had sworn to live and die in their french principles this insolent claim of superiority on their part and of a sort of vassalage to them on that of other members is what no liberal mind will submit to bear  49 the society of the liberty of the press the whig club and the society for constitutional information and i believe the friends of the people as well as some clubs in scotland have indeed declared that their confidence in and attachment to mr fox has lately been confirmed strengthened and increased by the calumnies as they are called against him it is true mr fox and his friends have those testimonies in their favor against certain old friends of the duke of portland yet on a full serious and i think dispassionate consideration of the whole of what mr fox and mr sheridan and their friends have acted said and written in this session instead of doing anything which might tend to procure power or any share of it whatsoever to them or to their phalanx as they call it or to increase their credit influence or popularity in the nation i think it one of my most serious and important public duties in whatsoever station i may be placed for the short time i have to live effectually to employ my best endeavors by every prudent and every lawful means to traverse all their designs i have only to lament that my abilities are not greater and that my probability of life is not better for the more effectual pursuit of that object but i trust that neither the principles nor exertions will die with me i am the rather confirmed in this my resolution and in this my wish of transmitting it because every ray of hope concerning a possible control or mitigation of the enormous mischiefs which the principles of these gentlemen and which their connections full as dangerous as their principles might receive from the influence of the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam on becoming their colleagues in office is now entirely banished from the mind of every one living it is apparent even to the world at large that so far from having a power to direct or to guide mr fox mr sheridan mr grey and the rest in any important matter they have not through this session been able to prevail on them to forbear or to delay or mitigate or soften any one act or any one expression upon subjects on which they essentially differed  50 even if this hope of a possible control did exist yet the declared opinions and the uniform line of conduct conformable to those opinions pursued by mr fox must become a matter of serious alarm if he should obtain a power either at court or in parliament or in the nation at large and for this plain reason he must be the most active and efficient member in any administration of which he shall form a part that a man or set of men are guided by such not dubious but delivered and avowed principles and maxims of policy as to need a watch and check on them in the exercise of the highest power ought in my opinion to make every man who is not of the same principles and guided by the same maxims a little cautious how he makes himself one of the traverses of a ladder to help such a man or such a set of men to climb up to the highest authority a minister of this country is to be controlled by the house of commons he is to be trusted not controlled by his colleagues in office if he were to be controlled government which ought to be the source of order would itself become a scene of anarchy besides mr fox is a man of an aspiring and commanding mind made rather to control than to be controlled and he never will be nor can be in any administration in which he will be guided by any of those whom i have been accustomed to confide in it is absurd to think that he would or could if his own opinions do not control him nothing can when we consider of an adherence to a man which leads to his power we must not only see what the man is but how he stands related it is not to be forgotten that mr fox acts in close and inseparable connection with another gentleman of exactly the same description as himself and who perhaps of the two is the leader the rest of the body are not a great deal more tractable and over them if mr fox and mr sheridan have authority most assuredly the duke of portland has not the smallest degree of influence  51 one must take care that a blind partiality to some persons and as blind an hatred to others may not enter into our minds under a color of inflexible public principle we hear as a reason for clinging to mr fox at present that nine years ago mr pitt got into power by mischievous intrigues with the court with the dissenters and with other factious people out of parliament to the discredit and weakening of the power of the house of commons his conduct nine years ago i still hold to be very culpable there are however many things very culpable that i do not know how to punish my opinion on such matters i must submit to the good of the state as i have done on other occasionsand particularly with regard to the authors and managers of the american war with whom i have acted both in office and in opposition with great confidence and cordiality though i thought many of their acts criminal and impeachable whilst the misconduct of mr pitt and his associates was yet recent it was not possible to get mr fox of himself to take a single step or even to countenance others in taking any step upon the ground of that misconduct and false policy though if the matters had been then taken up and pursued such a step could not have appeared so evidently desperate as now it is so far from pursuing mr pitt i know that then and for some time after some of mr foxs friends were actually and with no small earnestness looking out to a coalition with that gentleman for years i never heard this circumstance of mr pitts misconduct on that occasion mentioned by mr fox either in public or in private as a ground for opposition to that minister all opposition from that period to this very session has proceeded upon the separate measures as they separately arose without any vindictive retrospect to mr pitts conduct in 1784 my memory however may fail me i must appeal to the printed debates which so far as mr fox is concerned are unusually accurate  52 whatever might have been in our power at an early period at this day i see no remedy for what was done in 1784 i had no great hopes even at the time i was therefore very eager to record a remonstrance on the journals of the house of commons as a caution against such a popular delusion in times to come and this i then feared and now am certain is all that could be done i know of no way of animadverting on the crown i know of no mode of calling to account the house of lords who threw out the india bill in a way not much to their credit as little or rather less am i able to coerce the people at large who behaved very unwisely and intemperately on that occasion mr pitt was then accused by me as well as others of attempting to be minister without enjoying the confidence of the house of commons though he did enjoy the confidence of the crown that house of commons whose confidence he did not enjoy unfortunately did not itself enjoy the confidence though we well deserved it either of the crown or of the public for want of that confidence the then house of commons did not survive the contest since that period mr pitt has enjoyed the confidence of the crown and of the lords and of the house of commons through two successive parliaments and i suspect that he has ever since and that he does still enjoy as large a portion at least of the confidence of the people without doors as his great rival before whom then is mr pitt to be impeached and by whom the more i consider the matter the more firmly i am convinced that the idea of proscribing mr pitt indirectly when you cannot directly punish him is as chimerical a project and as unjustifiable as it would be to have proscribed lord north for supposing that by indirect ways of opposition by opposition upon measures which do not relate to the business of 1784 but which on other grounds might prove unpopular you were to drive him from his seat this would be no example whatever of punishment for the matters we charge as offences in 1784 on a cool and dispassionate view of the affairs of this time and country it appears obvious to me that one or the other of those two great men that is mr pitt or mr fox must be minister they are i am sorry for it irreconcilable mr foxs conduct in this session has rendered the idea of his power a matter of serious alarm to many people who were very little pleased with the proceedings of mr pitt in the beginning of his administration they like neither the conduct of mr pitt in 1784 nor that of mr fox in 1793 but they estimate which of the evils is most pressing at the time and what is likely to be the consequence of a change if mr fox be wedded they must be sensible that his opinions and principles on the now existing state of things at home and abroad must be taken as his portion in his train must also be taken the whole body of gentlemen who are pledged to him and to each other and to their common politics and principles i believe no king of great britain ever will adopt for his confidential servants that body of gentlemen holding that body of principles even if the present king or his successor should think fit to take that step i apprehend a general discontent of those who wish that this nation and that europe should continue in their present state would ensuea discontent which combined with the principles and progress of the new men in power would shake this kingdom to its foundations i do not believe any one political conjecture can be more certain than this  53 without at all defending or palliating mr pitts conduct in 1784 i must observe that the crisis of 1793 with regard to everything at home and abroad is full as important as that of 1784 ever was and if for no other reason by being present is much more important it is not to nine years ago we are to look for the danger of mr foxs and mr sheridans conduct and that of the gentlemen who act with them it is at this very time and in this very session that if they had not been strenuously resisted they would not only have discredited the house of commons as mr pitt did in 1784 when he persuaded the king to reject their advice and to appeal from them to the people but in my opinion would have been the means of wholly subverting the house of commons and the house of peers and the whole constitution actual and virtual together with the safety and independence of this nation and the peace and settlement of every state in the now christian world it is to our opinion of the nature of jacobinism and of the probability by corruption faction and force of its gaining ground everywhere that the question whom and what you are to support is to be determined for my part without doubt or hesitation i look upon jacobinism as the most dreadful and the most shameful evil which ever afflicted mankind a thing which goes beyond the power of all calculation in its mischiefand that if it is suffered to exist in france we must in england and speedily too fall into that calamity  54 i figure to myself the purpose of these gentlemen accomplished and this ministry destroyed i see that the persons who in that case must rule can be no other than mr fox mr sheridan mr grey the marquis of lansdowne lord thurlow lord lauderdale and the duke of norfolk with the other chiefs of the friends of the people the parliamentary reformers and the admirers of the french revolution the principal of these are all formally pledged to their projects if the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam should be admitted into that system as they might and probably would be it is quite certain they could not have the smallest weight in itless indeed than what they now possess if less were possible because they would be less wanted than they now are and because all those who wished to join them and to act under them have been rejected by the duke of portland and lord fitzwilliam themselves and mr fox finding them thus by themselves disarmed has built quite a new fabric upon quite a new foundation there is no trifling on this subject we see very distinctly before us the ministry that would be formed and the plan that would be pursued if we like the plan we must wish the power of those who are to carry it into execution but to pursue the political exaltation of those whose political measures we disapprove and whose principles we dissent from is a species of modern politics not easily comprehensible and which must end in the ruin of the country if it should continue and spread mr pitt may be the worst of men and mr fox may be the best but at present the former is in the interest of his country and of the order of things long established in europe mr fox is not i have for one been born in this order of things and would fain die in it i am sure it is sufficient to make men as virtuous as happy and as knowing as anything which mr fox and his friends abroad or at home would substitute in its place and i should be sorry that any set of politicians should obtain power in england whose principles or schemes should lead them to countenance persons or factions whose object is to introduce some new devised order of things into england or to support that order where it is already introduced in francea place in which if it can be fixed in my mind it must have a certain and decided influence in and upon this kingdom  this is my account of my conduct to my private friends i have already said all i wish to say or nearly so to the public i write this with pain and with an heart full of grief  footnotes  1 it is an exception that in one of his last speeches but not before mr fox seemed to think an alliance with spain might be proper     preface  to the  address of m brissot  to his constituents  translated by  the late william burke esq  1794     preface to brissots address   the french revolution has been the subject of various speculations and various histories as might be expected the royalists and the republicans have differed a good deal in their accounts of the principles of that revolution of the springs which have set it in motion and of the true character of those who have been or still are the principal actors on that astonishing scene  they who are inclined to think favorably of that event will undoubtedly object to every state of facts which comes only from the authority of a royalist thus much must be allowed by those who are the most firmly attached to the cause of religion law and order for of such and not of friends to despotism the royal party is composedthat their very affection to this generous and manly cause and their abhorrence of a revolution not less fatal to liberty than to government may possibly lead them in some particulars to a more harsh representation of the proceedings of their adversaries than would be allowed by the cold neutrality of an impartial judge this sort of error arises from a source highly laudable but the exactness of truth may suffer even from the feelings of virtue history will do justice to the intentions of worthy men but it will be on its guard against their infirmities it will examine with great strictness of scrutiny whatever appears from a writer in favor of his own cause on the other hand whatever escapes him and makes against that cause comes with the greatest weight  in this important controversy the translator of the following work brings forward to the english tribunal of opinion the testimony of a witness beyond all exception his competence is undoubted he knows everything which concerns this revolution to the bottom he is a chief actor in all the scenes which he presents no man can object to him as a royalist the royal party and the christian religion never had a more determined enemy in a word it is brissot it is brissot the republican the jacobin and the philosopher who is brought to give an account of jacobinism and of republicanism and of philosophy  it is worthy of observation that this his account of the genius of jacobinism and its effects is not confined to the period in which that faction came to be divided within itself in several and those very important particulars brissots observations apply to the whole of the preceding period before the great schism and whilst the jacobins acted as one body insomuch that the far greater part of the proceedings of the ruling powers since the commencement of the revolution in france so strikingly painted so strongly and so justly reprobated by brissot were the acts of brissot himself and his associates all the members of the girondin subdivision were as deeply concerned as any of the mountain could possibly be and some of them much more deeply in those horrid transactions which have filled all the thinking part of europe with the greatest detestation and with the most serious apprehensions for the common liberty and safety  a question will very naturally be askedwhat could induce brissot to draw such a picture he must have been sensible it was his own the answer isthe inducement was the same with that which led him to partake in the perpetration of all the crimes the calamitous effects of which he describes with the pen of a masterambition his faction having obtained their stupendous and unnatural power by rooting out of the minds of his unhappy countrymen every principle of religion morality loyalty fidelity and honor discovered that when authority came into their hands it would be a matter of no small difficulty for them to carry on government on the principles by which they had destroyed it  the rights of men and the new principles of liberty and equality were very unhandy instruments for those who wished to establish a system of tranquillity and order they who were taught to find nothing to respect in the title and in the virtues of louis the sixteenth a prince succeeding to the throne by the fundamental laws in the line of a succession of monarchs continued for fourteen hundred years found nothing which could bind them to an implicit fidelity and dutiful allegiance to messrs brissot vergniaud condorcet anacharsis clootz and thomas paine  in this difficulty they did as well as they could to govern the people they must incline the people to obey the work was difficult but it was necessary they were to accomplish it by such materials and by such instruments as they had in their hands they were to accomplish the purposes of order morality and submission to the laws from the principles of atheism profligacy and sedition ill as the disguise became them they began to assume the mask of an austere and rigid virtue they exhausted all the stores of their eloquence which in some of them were not inconsiderable in declamations against tumult and confusion they made daily harangues on the blessings of order discipline quiet and obedience to authority they even showed some sort of disposition to protect such property as had not been confiscated they who on every occasion had discovered a sort of furious thirst of blood and a greedy appetite for slaughter who avowed and gloried in the murders and massacres of the 14th of july of the 5th and 6th of october and of the 10th of august now began to be squeamish and fastidious with regard to those of the 2nd of september  in their pretended scruples on the sequel of the slaughter of the 10th of august they imposed upon no living creature and they obtained not the smallest credit for humanity they endeavored to establish a distinction by the belief of which they hoped to keep the spirit of murder safely bottled up and sealed for their own purposes without endangering themselves by the fumes of the poison which they prepared for their enemies  roland was the chief and the most accredited of the faction his morals had furnished little matter of exception against him old domestic and uxorious he led a private life sufficiently blameless he was therefore set up as the cato of the republican party which did not abound in such characters  this man like most of the chiefs was the manager of a newspaper in which he promoted the interest of his party he was a fatal present made by the revolutionists to the unhappy king as one of his ministers under the new constitution amongst his colleagues were clavière and servan all the three have since that time either lost their heads by the axe of their associates in rebellion or to evade their own revolutionary justice have fallen by their own hands  these ministers were regarded by the king as in a conspiracy to dethrone him nobody who considers the circumstances which preceded the deposition of louis the sixteenth nobody who attends to the subsequent conduct of those ministers can hesitate about the reality of such a conspiracy the king certainly had no doubt of it he found himself obliged to remove them and the necessity which first obliged him to choose such regicide ministers constrained him to replace them by dumouriez the jacobin and some others of little efficiency though of a better description  a little before this removal and evidently as a part of the conspiracy roland put into the kings hands as a memorial the most insolent seditious and atrocious libel that has probably ever been penned this paper roland a few days after delivered to the national assembly2 who instantly published and dispersed it over all france and in order to give it the stronger operation they declared that he and his brother ministers had carried with them the regret of the nation none of the writings which have inflamed the jacobin spirit to a savage fury ever worked up a fiercer ferment through the whole mass of the republicans in every part of france  under the thin veil of prediction he strongly recommends all the abominable practices which afterwards followed in particular he inflamed the minds of the populace against the respectable and conscientious clergy who became the chief objects of the massacre and who were to him the chief objects of a malignity and rancor that one could hardly think to exist in an human heart  we have the relics of his fanatical persecution here we are in a condition to judge of the merits of the persecutors and of the persecuted i do not say the accusers and accused because in all the furious declamations of the atheistic faction against these men not one specific charge has been made upon any one person of those who suffered in their massacre or by their decree of exile  the king had declared that he would sooner perish under their axe he too well saw what was preparing for him than give his sanction to the iniquitous act of proscription under which those innocent people were to be transported  on this proscription of the clergy a principal part of the ostensible quarrel between the king and those ministers had turned from the time of the authorized publication of this libel some of the manoeuvres long and uniformly pursued for the kings deposition became more and more evident and declared  the 10th of august came on and in the manner in which roland had predicted it was followed by the same consequences the king was deposed after cruel massacres in the courts and the apartments of his palace and in almost all parts of the city in reward of his treason to his old master roland was by his new masters named minister of the home department  the massacres of the 2nd of september were begotten by the massacres of the 10th of august they were universally foreseen and hourly expected during this short interval between the two murderous scenes the furies male and female cried out havoc as loudly and as fiercely as ever the ordinary jails were all filled with prepared victims and when they overflowed churches were turned into jails at this time the relentless roland had the care of the general policehe had for his colleague the bloody danton who was minister of justice the insidious pétion was mayor of paris the treacherous manuel was procurator of the common hall the magistrates some or all of them were evidently the authors of this massacre lest the national guard should by their very name be reminded of their duty in preserving the lives of their fellowcitizens the common council of paris pretending that it was in vain to think of resisting the murderers although in truth neither their numbers nor their arms were at all formidable obliged those guards to draw the charges from their muskets and took away their bayonets one of their journalists and according to their fashion one of their leading statesmen gorsas mentions this fact in his newspaper which he formerly called the galley journal the title was well suited to the paper and its author for some felonies he had been sentenced to the galleys but by the benignity of the late king this felon to be one day advanced to the rank of a regicide had been pardoned and released at the intercession of the ambassadors of tippoo sultan his gratitude was such as might naturally have been expected and it has lately been rewarded as it deserved this liberated galleyslave was raised in mockery of all criminal law to be minister of justice he became from his elevation a more conspicuous object of accusation and he has since received the punishment of his former crimes in proscription and death  it will be asked how the minister of the home department was employed at this crisis the day after the massacre had commenced roland appeared but not with the powerful apparatus of a protecting magistrate to rescue those who had survived the slaughter of the first day nothing of this on the 3rd of september that is the day after the commencement of the massacre3 he writes a long elaborate verbose epistle to the assembly in which after magnifying according to the bonton of the revolution his own integrity humanity courage and patriotism he first directly justifies all the bloody proceedings of the 10th of august he considers the slaughter of that day as a necessary measure for defeating a conspiracy which with a full knowledge of the falsehood of his assertion he asserts to have been formed for a massacre of the people of paris and which he more than insinuates was the work of his late unhappy masterwho was universally known to carry his dread of shedding the blood of his most guilty subjects to an excess  without the day of the 10th says he it is evident that we should have been lost the court prepared for a long time waited for the hour which was to accumulate all treasons to display over paris the standard of death and to reign there by terror the sense of the people le sentiment always just and ready when their opinion is not corrupted foresaw the epoch marked for their destruction and rendered it fatal to the conspirators he then proceeds in the cant which has been applied to palliate all their atrocities from the 14th of july 1789 to the present timeit is in the nature of things continues he and in that of the human heart that victory should bring with it some excess the sea agitated by a violent storm roars long after the tempest but everything has bounds which ought at length to be observed  in this memorable epistle he considers such excesses as fatalities arising from the very nature of things and consequently not to be punished he allows a space of time for the duration of these agitations and lest he should be thought rigid and too scanty in his measure he thinks it may be long but he would have things to cease at length but when and wherewhen they may approach his own person  yesterday says he the ministers were denounced vaguely indeed as to the matter because subjects of reproach were wanting but with that warmth and force of assertion which strike the imagination and seduce it for a moment and which mislead and destroy confidence without which no man should remain in place in a free government yesterday again in an assembly of the presidents of all the sections convoked by the ministers with the view of conciliating all minds and of mutual explanation i perceived that distrust which suspects interrogates and fetters operations  in this manner that is in mutual suspicions and interrogatories this virtuous minister of the home department and all the magistracy of paris spent the first day of the massacre the atrocity of which has spread horror and alarm throughout europe it does not appear that the putting a stop to the massacre had any part in the object of their meeting or in their consultations when they were met here was a minister tremblingly alive to his own safety dead to that of his fellowcitizens eager to preserve his place and worse than indifferent about its most important duties speaking of the people he says that their hidden enemies may make use of this agitation the tender appellation which he gives to horrid massacre to hurt their best friends and their most able defenders already the example begins let it restrain and arrest a just rage indignation carried to its height commences proscriptions which fall only on the guilty but in which error and particular passions may shortly involve the honest man  he saw that the able artificers in the trade and mystery of murder did not choose that their skill should be unemployed after their first work and that they were full as ready to cut off their rivals as their enemies this gave him one alarm that was serious this letter of roland in every part of it lets out the secret of all the parties in this revolution plena rimarum est hoc atque illac perfluit we see that none of them condemn the occasional practice of murderprovided it is properly appliedprovided it is kept within the bounds which each of those parties think proper to prescribe in this case roland feared that if what was occasionally useful should become habitual the practice might go further than was convenient it might involve the best friends of the last revolution as it had done the heroes of the first revolution he feared that it would not be confined to the la fayettes and clermonttonnerres the duponts and barnaves but that it might extend to the brissots and vergniauds to the condorcets the pétions and to himself under this apprehension there is no doubt that his humane feelings were altogether unaffected  his observations on the massacre of the preceding day are such as cannot be passed over yesterday said he was a day upon the events of which it is perhaps necessary to leave a veil i know that the people with their vengeance mingled a sort of justice they did not take for victims all who presented themselves to their fury they directed it to them who had for a long time been spared by the sword of the law and who they believed from the peril of circumstances should be sacrificed without delay but i know that it is easy to villains and traitors to misrepresent this effervescence and that it must be checked i know that we owe to all france the declaration that the executive power could not foresee or prevent this excess i know that it is due to the constituted authorities to place a limit to it or consider themselves as abolished  in the midst of this carnage he thinks of nothing but throwing a veil over itwhich was at once to cover the guilty from punishment and to extinguish all compassion for the sufferers he apologizes for it in fact he justifies it he who as the reader has just seen in what is quoted from this letter feels so much indignation at vague denunciations when made against himself and from which he then feared nothing more than the subversion of his power is not ashamed to consider the charge of a conspiracy to massacre the parisians brought against his master upon denunciations as vague as possible or rather upon no denunciations as a perfect justification of the monstrous proceedings against him he is not ashamed to call the murder of the unhappy priests in the carmes who were under no criminal denunciation whatsoever a vengeance mingled with a sort of justice he observes that they had been a long time spared by the sword of the law and calls by anticipation all those who should represent this effervescence in other colors villains and traitors he did not than foresee how soon himself and his accomplices would be under the necessity of assuming the pretended character of this new sort of villany and treason in the hope of obliterating the memory of their former real villanies and treasons he did not foresee that in the course of six months a formal manifesto on the part of himself and his faction written by his confederate brissot was to represent this effervescence as another st bartholomew and speak of it as having made humanity shudder and sullied the revolution forever4  it is very remarkable that he takes upon himself to know the motives of the assassins their policy and even what they believed how could this be if he had no connection with them he praises the murderers for not having taken as yet all the lives of those who had as he calls it presented themselves as victims to their fury he paints the miserable prisoners who had been forcibly piled upon one another in the church of the carmelites by his faction as presenting themselves as victims to their furyas if death was their choice or allowing the idiom of his language to make this equivocal as if they were by some accident presented to the fury of their assassins whereas he knew that the leaders of the murderers sought these pure and innocent victims in the places where they had deposited them and were sure to find them the very selection which he praises as a sort of justice tempering their fury proves beyond a doubt the foresight deliberation and method with which this massacre was made he knew that circumstance on the very day of the commencement of the massacres when in all probability he had begun this letterfor he presented it to the assembly on the very next  whilst however he defends these acts he is conscious that they will appear in another light to the world he therefore acquits the executive power that is he acquits himself but only by his own assertion of those acts of vengeance mixed with a sort of justice as an excess which he could neither foresee nor prevent he could not he says foresee these acts when he tells us the people of paris had sagacity so well to foresee the designs of the court on the 10th of augustto foresee them so well as to mark the precise epoch on which they were to be executed and to contrive to anticipate them on the very day he could not foresee these events though he declares in this very letter that victory must bring with it some excessthat the sea roars long after the tempest so far as to his foresight as to his disposition to prevent if he had foreseen the massacres of that daythis will be judged by his care in putting a stop to the massacre then going on this was no matter of foresight he was in the very midst of it he does not so much as pretend that he had used any force to put a stop to it but if he had used any the sanction given under his hand to a sort of justice in the murderers was enough to disarm the protecting force  that approbation of what they had already done had its natural effect on the executive assassins then in the paroxysm of their fury as well as on their employers then in the midst of the execution of their deliberate coldblooded system of murder he did not at all differ from either of them in the principle of those executions but only in the time of their durationand that only as it affected himself this though to him a great consideration was none to his confederates who were at the same time his rivals they were encouraged to accomplish the work they had in hand they did accomplish it and whilst this grave moral epistle from a grave minister recommending a cessation of their work of vengeance mingled with a sort of justice was before a grave assembly the authors of the massacres proceeded without interruption in their business for four days togetherthat is until the seventh of that month and until all the victims of the first proscription in paris and at versailles and several other places were immolated at the shrine of the grim moloch of liberty and equality all the priests all the loyalists all the first essayists and novices of revolution in 1789 that could be found were promiscuously put to death  through the whole of this long letter of roland it is curious to remark how the nerve and vigor of his style which had spoken so potently to his sovereign is relaxed when he addresses himself to the sansculotteshow that strength and dexterity of arm with which he parries and beats down the sceptre is enfeebled and lost when he comes to fence with the poniard when he speaks to the populace he can no longer be direct the whole compass of the language is tried to find synonymes and circumlocutions for massacre and murder things are never called by their common names massacre is sometimes agitation sometimes effervescence sometimes excess sometimes too continued an exercise of a revolutionary power  however after what had passed had been praised or excused or pardoned he declares loudly against such proceedings in future crimes had pioneered and made smooth the way for the march of the virtues and from that time order and justice and a sacred regard for personal property were to become the rules for the new democracy here roland and the brissotins leagued for their own preservation by endeavoring to preserve peace this short story will render many of the parts of brissots pamphlet in which rolands views and intentions are so often alluded to the more intelligible in themselves and the more useful in their application by the english reader  under the cover of these artifices roland brissot and their party hoped to gain the bankers merchants substantial tradesmen hoarders of assignats and purchasers of the confiscated lands of the clergy and gentry to join with their party as holding out some sort of security to the effects which they possessed whether these effects were the acquisitions of fair commerce or the gains of jobbing in the misfortunes of their country and the plunder of their fellowcitizens in this design the party of roland and brissot succeeded in a great degree they obtained a majority in the national convention composed however as that assembly is their majority was far from steady but whilst they appeared to gain the convention and many of the outlying departments they lost the city of paris entirely and irrecoverably it was fallen into the hands of marat robespierre and danton their instruments were the sansculottes or rabble who domineered in that capital and were wholly at the devotion of those incendiaries and received their daily pay the people of property were of no consequence and trembled before marat and his janizaries as that great man had not obtained the helm of the state it was not yet come to his turn to act the part of brissot and his friends in the assertion of subordination and regular government but robespierre has survived both these rival chiefs and is now the great patron of jacobin order  to balance the exorbitant power of paris which threatened to leave nothing to the national convention but a character as insignificant as that which the first assembly had assigned to the unhappy louis the sixteenth the faction of brissot whose leaders were roland pétion vergniaud isnard condorcet c c c applied themselves to gain the great commercial towns lyons marseilles rouen nantes and bordeaux the republicans of the brissotin description to whom the concealed royalists still very numerous joined themselves obtained a temporary superiority in all these places in bordeaux on account of the activity and eloquence of some of its representatives this superiority was the most distinguished this last city is seated on the garonne or gironde and being the centre of a department named from that river the appellation of girondists was given to the whole party these and some other towns declared strongly against the principles of anarchy and against the despotism of paris numerous addresses were sent to the convention promising to maintain its authority which the addressers were pleased to consider as legal and constitutional though chosen not to compose an executive government but to form a plan for a constitution in the convention measures were taken to obtain an armed force from the several departments to maintain the freedom of that body and to provide for the personal safety of the members neither of which from the 14th of july 1789 to this hour have been really enjoyed by their assemblies sitting under any denomination  this scheme which was well conceived had not the desired success paris from which the convention did not dare to move though some threats of such a departure were from time to time thrown out was too powerful for the party of the gironde some of the proposed guards but neither with regularity nor in force did indeed arrive they were debauched as fast as they came or were sent to the frontiers the game played by the revolutionists in 1789 with respect to the french guards of the unhappy king was now played against the departmental guards called together for the protection of the revolutionists every part of their own policy comes round and strikes at their own power and their own lives  the parisians on their part were not slow in taking the alarm they had just reason to apprehend that if they permitted the smallest delay they should see themselves besieged by an army collected from all parts of france violent threats were thrown out against that city in the assembly its total destruction was menaced a very remarkable expression was used in these debatesthat in future times it might be inquired on what part of the seine paris had stood the faction which ruled in paris too bold to be intimidated and too vigilant to be surprised instantly armed themselves in their turn they accused the girondists of a treasonable design to break the republic one and indivisible whose unity they contended could only be preserved by the supremacy of paris into a number of confederate commonwealths the girondin faction on this account received also the name of federalists  things on both sides hastened fast to extremities paris the mother of equality was herself to be equalized matters were come to this alternative either that city must be reduced to a mere member of the federative republic or the convention chosen as they said by all france was to be brought regularly and systematically under the dominion of the common hall and even of any one of the sections of paris  in this awful contest thus brought to issue the great mother club of the jacobins was entirely in the parisian interest the girondins no longer dared to show their faces in that assembly nine tenths at least of the jacobin clubs throughout france adhered to the great patriarchal jacobinière of paris to which they were to use their own term affiliated no authority of magistracy judicial or executive had the least weight whenever these clubs chose to interfere and they chose to interfere in everything and on every occasion all hope of gaining them to the support of property or to the acknowledgment of any law but their own will was evidently vain and hopeless nothing but an armed insurrection against their anarchical authority could answer the purpose of the girondins anarchy was to be cured by rebellion as it had been caused by it  as a preliminary to this attempt on the jacobins and the commons of paris which it was hoped would be supported by all the remaining property of france it became absolutely necessary to prepare a manifesto laying before the public the whole policy genius character and conduct of the partisans of club government to make this exposition as fully and clearly as it ought to be made it was of the same unavoidable necessity to go through a series of transactions in which all those concerned in this revolution were at the several periods of their activity deeply involved in consequence of this design and under these difficulties brissot prepared the following declaration of his party which he executed with no small ability and in this manner the whole mystery of the french revolution was laid open in all its parts  it is almost needless to mention to the reader the fate of the design to which this pamphlet was to be subservient the jacobins of paris were more prompt than their adversaries they were the readiest to resort to what la fayette calls the most sacred of all duties that of insurrection another era of holy insurrection commenced the 31st of last may as the first fruits of that insurrection grafted on insurrection and of that rebellion improving upon rebellion the sacred irresponsible character of the members of the convention was laughed to scorn they had themselves shown in their proceedings against the late king how little the most fixed principles are to be relied upon in their revolutionary constitution the members of the girondin party in the convention were seized upon or obliged to save themselves by flight the unhappy author of this piece with twenty of his associates suffered together on the scaffold after a trial the iniquity of which puts all description to defiance  the english reader will draw from this work of brissot and from the result of the last struggles of this party some useful lessons he will be enabled to judge of the information of those who have undertaken to guide and enlighten us and who for reasons best known to themselves have chosen to paint the french revolution and its consequences in brilliant and flattering colors they will know how to appreciate the liberty of france which has been so much magnified in england they will do justice to the wisdom and goodness of their sovereign and his parliament who have put them into a state of defence in the war audaciously made upon us in favor of that kind of liberty when we see as here we must see in their true colors the character and policy of our enemies our gratitude will become an active principle it will produce a strong and zealous coöperation with the efforts of our government in favor of a constitution under which we enjoy advantages the full value of which the querulous weakness of human nature requires sometimes the opportunity of a comparison to understand and to relish  our confidence in those who watch for the public will not be lessened we shall be sensible that to alarm us in the late circumstances of our affairs was not for our molestation but for our security we shall be sensible that this alarm was not illtimedand that it ought to have been given as it was given before the enemy had time fully to mature and accomplish their plans for reducing us to the condition of france as that condition is faithfully and without exaggeration described in the following work we now have our arms in our hands we have the means of opposing the sense the courage and the resources of england to the deepest the most craftily devised the best combined and the most extensive design that ever was carried on since the beginning of the world against all property all order all religion all law and all real freedom  the reader is requested to attend to the part of this pamphlet which relates to the conduct of the jacobins with regard to the austrian netherlands which they call belgia or belgium it is from page seventytwo to page eightyfour of this translation here their views and designs upon all their neighbors are fully displayed here the whole mystery of their ferocious politics is laid open with the utmost clearness here the manner in which they would treat every nation into which they could introduce their doctrines and influence is distinctly marked we see that no nation was out of danger and we see what the danger was with which every nation was threatened the writer of this pamphlet throws the blame of several of the most violent of the proceedings on the other party he and his friends at the time alluded to had a majority in the national assembly he admits that neither he nor they ever publicly opposed these measures but he attributes their silence to a fear of rendering themselves suspected it is most certain that whether from fear or from approbation they never discovered any dislike of those proceedings till dumouriez was driven from the netherlands but whatever their motive was it is plain that the most violent is and since the revolution has always been the predominant party  if europe could not be saved without our interposition most certainly it could not i am sure there is not an englishman who would not blush to be left out of the general effort made in favor of the general safety but we are not secondary parties in this war we are principals in the danger and ought to be principals in the exertion if any englishman asks whether the designs of the french assassins are confined to the spot of europe which they actually desolate the citizen brissot the author of this book and the author of the declaration of war against england will give him his answer he will find in this book that the republicans are divided into factions full of the most furious and destructive animosity against each other but he will find also that there is one point in which they perfectly agree that they are all enemies alike to the government of all other nations and only contend with each other about the means of propagating their tenets and extending their empire by conquest  it is true that in this present work which the author professedly designed for an appeal to foreign nations and posterity he has dressed up the philosophy of his own faction in as decent a garb as he could to make her appearance in public but through every disguise her hideous figure may be distinctly seen if however the reader still wishes to see her in all her naked deformity i would further refer him to a private letter of brissot written towards the end of the last year and quoted in a late very able pamphlet of mallet du pan we must says our philosopher set fire to the four corners of europe in that alone is our safety dumouriez cannot suit us i always distrusted him miranda is the general for us he understands the revolutionary power he has courage lights c5 here everything is fairly avowed in plain language the triumph of philosophy is the universal conflagration of europe the only real dissatisfaction with dumouriez is a suspicion of his moderation and the secret motive of that preference which in this very pamphlet the author gives to miranda though without assigning his reasons is declared to be the superior fitness of that foreign adventurer for the purposes of subversion and destruction on the other hand if there can be any man in this country so hardy as to undertake the defence or the apology of the present monstrous usurpers of france and if it should be said in their favor that it is not just to credit the charges of their enemy brissot against them who have actually tried and condemned him on the very same charges among others we are luckily supplied with the best possible evidence in support of this part of his book against them it comes from among themselves camille desmoulins published the history of the brissotins in answer to this very address of brissot it was the countermanifesto of the last holy revolution of the 31st of may and the flagitious orthodoxy of his writings at that period has been admitted in the late scrutiny of him by the jacobin club when they saved him from that guillotine which he grazed in the beginning of his work he displays the task of glory as he calls it which presented itself at the opening of the convention all is summed up in two points to create the french republic to disorganize europe perhaps to purge it of its tyrants by the eruption of the volcanic principles of equality6 the coincidence is exact the proof is complete and irresistible  in a cause like this and in a time like the present there is no neutrality they who are not actively and with decision and energy against jacobinism are its partisans they who do not dread it love it it cannot be viewed with indifference it is a thing made to produce a powerful impression on the feelings such is the nature of jacobinism such is the nature of man that this system must be regarded either with enthusiastic admiration or with the highest degree of detestation resentment and horror  another great lesson may be taught by this book and by the fortune of the author and his party i mean a lesson drawn from the consequences of engaging in daring innovations from an hope that we may be able to limit their mischievous operation at our pleasure and by our policy to secure ourselves against the effect of the evil examples we hold out to the world this lesson is taught through almost all the important pages of history but never has it been taught so clearly and so awfully as at this hour the revolutionists who have just suffered an ignominious death under the sentence of the revolutionary tribunal a tribunal composed of those with whom they had triumphed in the total destruction of the ancient government were by no means ordinary men or without very considerable talents and resources but with all their talents and resources and the apparent momentary extent of their power we see the fate of their projects their power and their persons we see before our eyes the absurdity of thinking to establish order upon principles of confusion or with the materials and instruments of rebellion to build up a solid and stable government  such partisans of a republic amongst us as may not have the worst intentions will see that the principles the plans the manners the morals and the whole system of france is altogether as adverse to the formation and duration of any rational scheme of a republic as it is to that of a monarchy absolute or limited it is indeed a system which can only answer the purposes of robbers and murderers  the translator has only to say for himself that he has found some difficulty in this version his original author through haste perhaps or through the perturbation of a mind filled with a great and arduous enterprise is often obscure there are some passages too in which his language requires to be first translated into frenchat least into such french as the academy would in former times have tolerated he writes with great force and vivacity but the language like everything else in his country has undergone a revolution the translator thought it best to be as literal as possible conceiving such a translation would perhaps be the most fit to convey the authors peculiar mode of thinking in this way the translator has no credit for style but he makes it up in fidelity indeed the facts and observations are so much more important than the style that no apology is wanted for producing them in any intelligible manner  footnotes  2

p 2     appendix   the address of m brissot to his constituents being now almost  forgotten it has been thought right to add as an appendix  that part of it to which mr burke points our particular  attention and upon which he so forcibly comments in his  preface   three sorts of anarchy have ruined our affairs in belgium  the anarchy of the administration of pache which has completely disorganized the supply of our armies which by that disorganization reduced the army of dumouriez to stop in the middle of its conquests which struck it motionless through the months of november and december which hindered it from joining beurnonville and custine and from forcing the prussians and austrians to repass the rhine and afterwards from putting themselves in a condition to invade holland sooner than they did  to this state of ministerial anarchy it is necessary to join that other anarchy which disorganized the troops and occasioned their habits of pillage and lastly that anarchy which created the revolutionary power and forced the union to france of the countries we had invaded before things were ripe for such a measure  who could however doubt the frightful evils that were occasioned in our armies by that doctrine of anarchy which under the shadow of equality of right would establish equality of fact this is universal equality the scourge of society as the other is the support of society an anarchical doctrine which would level all things talents and ignorance virtues and vices places usages and services a doctrine which begot that fatal project of organizing the army presented by dubois de crancé to which it will be indebted for a complete disorganization  mark the date of the presentation of the system of this equality of fact entire equality it had been projected and decreed even at the very opening of the dutch campaign if any project could encourage the want of discipline in the soldiers any scheme could disgust and banish good officers and throw all things into confusion at the moment when order alone could give victory it is this project in truth so stubbornly defended by the anarchists and transplanted into their ordinary tactic  how could they expect that there should exist any discipline any subordination when even in the camp they permit motions censures and denunciations of officers and of generals does not such a disorder destroy all the respect that is due to superiors and all the mutual confidence without which success cannot be hoped for for the spirit of distrust makes the soldier suspicious and intimidates the general the first discerns treason in every danger the second always placed between the necessity of conquest and the image of the scaffold dares not raise himself to bold conception and those heights of courage which electrify an army and insure victory turenne in our time would have carried his head to the scaffold for he was sometimes beat but the reason why he more frequently conquered was that his discipline was severe it was that his soldiers confiding in his talents never muttered discontent instead of fighting without reciprocal confidence between the soldier and the general there can be no army no victory especially in a free government  is it not to the same system of anarchy of equalization and want of subordination which has been recommended in some clubs and defended even in the convention that we owe the pillages the murders the enormities of all kinds which it was difficult for the officers to put a stop to from the general spirit of insubordinationexcesses which have rendered the french name odious to the belgians again is it not to this system of anarchy and of robbery that we are indebted for the revolutionary power which has so justly aggravated the hatred of the belgians against france  what did enlightened republicans think before the 10th of august men who wished for liberty not only for their own country but for all europe they believed that they could generally establish it by exciting the governed against the governors in letting the people see the facility and the advantages of such insurrections  but how can the people be led to that point by the example of good government established among us by the example of order by the care of spreading nothing but moral ideas among them to respect their properties and their rights to respect their prejudices even when we combat them by disinterestedness in defending the people by a zeal to extend the spirit of liberty amongst them  this system was at first followed7 excellent pamphlets from the pen of condorcet prepared the people for liberty the 10th of august the republican decrees the battle of valmy the retreat of the prussians the victory of jemappes all spoke in favor of france all was rapidly destroyed by the revolutionary power without doubt good intentions made the majority of the assembly adopt it they would plant the tree of liberty in a foreign soil under the shade of a people already free to the eyes of the people of belgium it seemed but the mask of a new foreign tyranny this opinion was erroneous i will suppose it so for a moment but still this opinion of belgium deserved to be considered in general we have always considered our own opinions and our own intentions rather than the people whose cause we defend we have given those people a will that is to say we have more than ever alienated them from liberty  how could the belgic people believe themselves free since we exercise for them and over them the rights of sovereigntywhen without consulting them we suppress all in a mass their ancient usages their abuses their prejudices those classes of society which without doubt are contrary to the spirit of liberty but the utility of whose destruction was not as yet proved to them how could they believe themselves free and sovereign when we made them take such an oath as we thought fit as a test to give them the right of voting how could they believe themselves free when openly despising their religious worship which religious worship that superstitious people valued beyond their liberty beyond even their life when we proscribed their priests when we banished them from their assemblies where they were in the practice of seeing them govern when we seized their revenues their domains and riches to the profit of the nation when we carried to the very censer those hands which they regarded as profane doubtless these operations were founded on principles but those principles ought to have had the consent of the belgians before they were carried into practice otherwise they necessarily became our most cruel enemies  arrived ourselves at the last bounds of liberty and equality trampling under our feet all human superstitions after however a four years war with them we attempt all at once to raise to the same eminence men strangers even to the first elementary principles of liberty and plunged for fifteen hundred years in ignorance and superstition we wished to force men to see when a thick cataract covered their eyes even before we had removed that cataract we would force men to see whose dulness of character had raised a mist before their eyes and before that character was altered8  do you believe that the doctrine which now prevails in france would have found many partisans among us in 1789 no a revolution in ideas and in prejudices is not made with that rapidity it moves gradually it does not escalade  philosophy does not inspire by violence nor by seduction nor is it the sword that begets love of liberty  joseph the second also borrowed the language of philosophy when he wished to suppress the monks in belgium and to seize upon their revenues there was seen on him a mask only of philosophy covering the hideous countenance of a greedy despot and the people ran to arms nothing better than another kind of despotism has been seen in the revolutionary power  we have seen in the commissioners of the national convention nothing but proconsuls working the mine of belgium for the profit of the french nation seeking to conquer it for the sovereign of pariseither to aggrandize his empire or to share the burdens of the debts and furnish a rich prize to the robbers who domineered in france  do you believe the belgians have ever been the dupes of those wellrounded periods which they vended in the pulpit in order to familiarize them to the idea of an union with france do you believe they were ever imposed upon by those votes and resolutions made by what is called acclamation for their union of which corruption paid one part9 and fear forced the remainder who at this time of day is unacquainted with the springs and wires of their miserable puppetshow who does not know the farces of primary assemblies composed of a president of a secretary and of some assistants whose days work was paid for no it is not by means which belong only to thieves and despots that the foundations of liberty can be laid in an enslaved country it is not by those means that a newborn republic a people who know not yet the elements of republican governments can be united to us even slaves do not suffer themselves to be seduced by such artifices and if they have not the strength to resist they have at least the sense to know how to appreciate the value of such an attempt  if we would attach the belgians to us we must at least enlighten their minds by good writings we must send to them missionaries and not despotic commissioners10 we ought to give them time to seeto perceive by themselves the advantages of liberty the unhappy effects of superstition the fatal spirit of priesthood and whilst we waited for this moral revolution we should have accepted the offers which they incessantly repeated to join to the french army an army of fifty thousand men to entertain them at their own expense and to advance to france the specie of which she stood in need  but have we ever seen those fifty thousand soldiers who were to join our army as soon as the standard of liberty should be displayed in belgium have we ever seen those treasures which they were to count into our hands can we either accuse the sterility of their country or the penury of their treasure or the coldness of their love for liberty no despotism and anarchy these are the benefits which we have transplanted into their soil we have acted we have spoken like masters and from that time we have found the flemings nothing but jugglers who made the grimace of liberty for money or slaves who in their hearts cursed their new tyrants our commissioners address them in this sort you have nobles and priests among you drive them out without delay or we will neither be your brethren nor your patrons they answered give us but time only leave to us the care of reforming these institutions our answer to them was no it must be at the moment it must be on the spot or we will treat you as enemies we will abandon you to the resentment of the austrians  what could the disarmed belgians object to all this surrounded as they were by seventy thousand men they had only to hold their tongues and to bow down their heads before their masters they did hold their tongues and their silence is received as a sincere and free assent  have not the strangest artifices been adopted to prevent that people from retreating and to constrain them to an union it was foreseen that as long as they were unable to effect an union the states would preserve the supreme authority amongst themselves under pretence therefore of relieving the people and of exercising the sovereignty in their right at one stroke they abolished all the duties and taxes they shut up all the treasuries from that time no more receipts no more public money no more means of paying the salaries of any man in office appointed by the states thus was anarchy organized amongst the people that they might be compelled to throw themselves into our arms it became necessary for those who administered their affairs under the penalty of being exposed to sedition and in order to avoid their throats being cut to have recourse to the treasury of france what did they find in this treasury assignatsthese assignats were advanced at par to belgium by this means on the one hand they naturalized this currency in that country and on the other they expected to make a good pecuniary transaction thus it is that covetousness cut its throat with its own hands the belgians have seen in this forced introduction of assignats nothing but a double robbery and they have only the more violently hated the union with france  recollect the solicitude of the belgians on that subject with what earnestness did they conjure you to take off a retroactive effect from these assignats and to prevent them from being applied to the payment of debts that were contracted anterior to the union  did not this language energetically enough signify that they looked upon the assignats as a leprosy and the union as a deadly contagion  and yet what regard was paid to so just a demand it was buried in the committee of finance that committee wanted to make anarchy the means of an union they only busied themselves in making the belgic provinces subservient to their finances  cambon said loftily before the belgians themselves the belgian war costs us hundreds of millions their ordinary revenues and even some extraordinary taxes will not answer to our reimbursements and yet we have occasion for them the mortgage of our assignats draws near its end what must be done sell the church property of brabant there is a mortgage of two thousand millions eighty millions sterling how shall we get possession of them by an immediate union instantly they decreed this union mens minds were not disposed to it what does it signify let us make them vote by means of money without delay therefore they secretly order the minister of foreign affairs to dispose of four or five hundred thousand livres 20000l sterling to make the vagabonds of brussels drunk and to buy proselytes to the union in all the states but even these means it was said will obtain but a weak minority in our favor what does that signify revolutions said they are made only by minorities it is the minority which has made the revolution of france it is a minority which has made the people triumph  the belgic provinces were not sufficient to satisfy the voracious cravings of this financial system cambon wanted to unite everything that he might sell everything thus he forced the union of savoy in the war with holland he saw nothing but gold to seize on and assignats to sell at par11 do not let us dissemble said he one day to the committee of general defence in presence even of the patriot deputies of holland you have no ecclesiastical goods to offer us for our indemnity it is a revolution in their counters and iron chests12 that must be made amongst the dutch the word was said and the bankers abema and van staphorst understood it  do you think that that word has not been worth an army to the stadtholder that it has not cooled the ardor of the dutch patriots that it has not commanded the vigorous defence of williamstadt  do you believe that the patriots of amsterdam when they read the preparatory decree which gave france an execution on their goodsdo you believe that those patriots would not have liked better to have remained under the government of the stadtholder who took from them no more than a fixed portion of their property than to pass under that of a revolutionary power which would make a complete revolution in their bureaus and strongboxes and reduce them to wretchedness and rags13 robbery and anarchy instead of encouraging will always stifle revolutions  but why they object to me have not you and your friends chosen to expose these measures in the rostrum of the national convention why have you not opposed yourself to all these fatal projects of union  there are two answers to make hereone general one particular  you complain of the silence of honest men you quite forget then honest men are the objects of your suspicion suspicion if it does not stain the soul of a courageous man at least arrests his thoughts in their passage to his lips the suspicions of a good citizen freeze those men whom the calumny of the wicked could not stop in their progress  you complain of their silence you forget then that you have often established an insulting equality between them and men covered with crimes and made up of ignominy  you forget then that you have twenty times left them covered with opprobrium by your galleries  you forget then that you have not thought yourself sufficiently powerful to impose silence upon these galleries  what ought a wise man to do in the midst of these circumstances he is silent he waits the moment when the passions give way he waits till reason shall preside and till the multitude shall listen to her voice  what has been the tactic displayed during all these unions cambon incapable of political calculation boasting his ignorance in the diplomatic flattering the ignorant multitude lending his name and popularity to the anarchists seconded by their vociferations denounced incessantly as counterrevolutionists those intelligent persons who were desirous at least of having things discussed to oppose the acts of union appeared to cambon an overt act of treason the wish so much as to reflect and to deliberate was in his eyes a great crime he calumniated our intentions the voice of every deputy especially my voice would infallibly have been stifled there were spies on the very monosyllables that escaped our lips  footnotes  7 the most seditious libels upon all governments in order to excite insurrection in spain holland and other countriestranslator  8 it may not be amiss once for all to remark on the style of all the philosophical politicians of france without any distinction in their several sects and parties they agree in treating all nations who will not conform their government laws manners and religion to the new french fashion as an herd of slaves they consider the content with which men live under those governments as stupidity and all attachment to religion as the effect of the grossest ignorance  the people of the netherlands by their constitution are as much entitled to be called free as any nation upon earth the austrian government until some wild attempts the emperor joseph made on the french principle but which have been since abandoned by the court of vienna has been remarkably mild no people were more at their ease than the flemish subjects particularly the lower classes it is curious to hear this great oculist talk of couching the cataract by which the netherlands were blinded and hindered from seeing in its proper colors the beautiful vision of the french republic which he has himself painted with so masterly an hand that people must needs be dull blind and brutalized by fifteen hundred years of superstition the time elapsed since the introduction of christianity amongst them who could prefer their former state to the present state of france the reader will remark that the only difference between brissot and his adversaries is in the mode of bringing other nations into the pale of the french republic they would abolish the order and classes of society and all religion at a stroke brissot would have just the same thing done but with more address and managementtranslator  9 see the correspondence of dumouriez especially the letter of the 12th of march  10 they have not as yet proceeded farther with regard to the english dominions here we only see as yet the good writings of paine and of his learned associates and the labors of the missionary clubs and other zealous instructorstranslator  11 the same thing will happen in savoy the persecution of the clergy has soured peoples minds the commissaries represent them to us as good frenchmen i put them to the proof where are the legions how thirty thousand savoyardsare they not armed to defend in concert with us their libertybrissot  12 portefeuille is the word in the original it signifies all movable property which may be represented in bonds notes bills stocks or any sort of public or private securities i do not know of a single word in english that answers it i have therefore substituted that of iron chests as coming nearest to the ideatranslator  13 in the original les reduire à la sansculotterie     a  letter  to  william elliot esq  occasioned by  the account given in a newspaper of the speech made in the house of lords by the  of   in the debate  concerning lord fitzwilliam  1795     letter   beaconsfield may 281795  my dear siri have been told of the voluntary which for the entertainment of the house of lords has been lately played by his grace the  of  a great deal at my expense and a little at his own i confess i should have liked the composition rather better if it had been quite new but every man has his taste and his grace is an admirer of ancient music  there may be sometimes too much even of a good thing a toast is good and a bumper is not bad but the best toasts may be so often repeated as to disgust the palate and ceaseless rounds of bumpers may nauseate and overload the stomach the ears of the most steadyvoting politicians may at last be stunned with three times three i am sure i have been very grateful for the flattering remembrance made of me in the toasts of the revolution society and of other clubs formed on the same laudable plan after giving the brimming honors to citizen thomas paine and to citizen dr priestley the gentlemen of these clubs seldom failed to bring me forth in my turn and to drink mr burke and thanks to him for the discussion he has provoked  i found myself elevated with this honor for even by the collision of resistance to be the means of striking out sparkles of truth if not merit is at least felicity  here i might have rested but when i found that the great advocate mr erskine condescended to resort to these bumper toasts as the pure and exuberant fountains of politics and of rhetoric as i hear he did in three or four speeches made in defence of certain worthy citizens i was rather let down a little though still somewhat proud of myself i was not quite so proud of my voucher though he is no idolater of fame in some way or other mr erskine will always do himself honor methinks however in following the precedents of these toasts he seemed to do more credit to his diligence as a special pleader than to his invention as an orator to those who did not know the abundance of his resources both of genius and erudition there was something in it that indicated the want of a good assortment with regard to richness and variety in the magazine of topics and commonplaces which i suppose he keeps by him in imitation of cicero and other renowned declaimers of antiquity  mr erskine supplied something i allow from the stores of his imagination in metamorphosing the jovial toasts of clubs into solemn special arguments at the bar so far the thing showed talent however i must still prefer the bar of the tavern to the other bar the toasts at the first hand were better than the arguments at the second even when the toasts began to grow old as sarcasms they were washed down with still older pricked election port then the acid of the wine made some amends for the want of anything piquant in the wit but when his grace gave them a second transformation and brought out the vapid stuff which had wearied the clubs and disgusted the courts the drug made up of the bottoms of rejected bottles all smelling so wofully of the cork and of the cask and of everything except the honest old lamp and when that sad draught had been farther infected with the jail pollution of the old bailey and was dashed and brewed and ineffectually stummed again into a senatorial exordium in the house of lords i found all the high flavor and mantling of my honors tasteless flat and stale unluckily the new tax on wine is felt even in the greatest fortunes and his grace submits to take up with the heeltaps of mr erskine  i have had the ill or good fortune to provoke two great men of this age to the publication of their opinions i mean citizen thomas paine and his grace the  of  i am not so great a leveller as to put these two great men on a par either in the state or the republic of letters but the field of glory is a field for all it is a large one indeed and we all may run god knows where in chase of glory over the boundless expanse of that wild heath whose horizon always flies before us i assure his grace if he will yet give me leave to call him so whatever may be said on the authority of the clubs or of the bar that citizen paine who they will have it hunts with me in couples and who only moves as i drag him along has a sufficient activity in his own native benevolence to dispose and enable him to take the lead for himself he is ready to blaspheme his god to insult his king and to libel the constitution of his country without any provocation from me or any encouragement from his grace i assure him that i shall not be guilty of the injustice of charging mr paines next work against religion and human society upon his graces excellent speech in the house of lords i farther assure this noble duke that i neither encouraged nor provoked that worthy citizen to seek for plenty liberty safety justice or lenity in the famine in the prisons in the decrees of convention in the revolutionary tribunal and in the guillotine of paris rather than quietly to take up with what he could find in the glutted markets the unbarricadoed streets the drowsy old bailey judges or at worst the airy wholesome pillory of old england the choice of country was his own taste the writings were the effects of his own zeal in spite of his friend dr priestley he was a free agent i admit indeed that my praises of the british government loaded with all its incumbrances clogged with its peers and its beef its parsons and its pudding its commons and its beer and its dull slavish liberty of going about just as one pleases had something to provoke a jockey of norfolk14 who was inspired with the resolute ambition of becoming a citizen of france to do something which might render him worthy of naturalization in that grand asylum of persecuted merit something which should entitle him to a place in the senate of the adoptive country of all the gallant generous and humane this i say was possible but the truth is with great deference to his grace i say it citizen paine acted without any provocation at all he acted solely from the native impulses of his own excellent heart  his grace like an able orator as he is begins with giving me a great deal of praise for talents which i do not possess he does this to entitle himself on the credit of this gratuitous kindness to exaggerate my abuse of the parts which his bounty and not that of nature has bestowed upon me in this too he has condescended to copy mr erskine these priests i hope they will excuse me i mean priests of the rights of man begin by crowning me with their flowers and their fillets and bedewing me with their odors as a preface to their knocking me on the head with their consecrated axes i have injured say they the constitution and i have abandoned the whig party and the whig principles that i professed i do not mean my dear sir to defend myself against his grace i have not much interest in what the world shall think or say of me as little has the world an interest in what i shall think or say of any one in it and i wish that his grace had suffered an unhappy man to enjoy in his retreat the melancholy privileges of obscurity and sorrow at any rate i have spoken and i have written on the subject if i have written or spoken so poorly as to be quite forgot a fresh apology will not make a more lasting impression i must let the tree lie as it falls perhaps i must take some shame to myself i confess that i have acted on my own principles of government and not on those of his grace which are i dare say profound and wise but which i do not pretend to understand as to the party to which he alludes and which has long taken its leave of me i believe the principles of the book which he condemns are very conformable to the opinions of many of the most considerable and most grave in that description of politicians a few indeed who i admit are equally respectable in all points differ from me and talk his graces language i am too feeble to contend with them they have the field to themselves there are others very young and very ingenious persons who form probably the largest part of what his grace i believe is pleased to consider as that party some of them were not born into the world and all of them were children when i entered into that connection i give due credit to the censorial brow to the broad phylacteries and to the imposing gravity of those magisterial rabbins and doctors in the cabala of political science i admit that wisdom is as the gray hair to man and that learning is like honorable old age but at a time when liberty is a good deal talked of perhaps i might be excused if i caught something of the general indocility it might not be surprising if i lengthened my chain a link or two and in an age of relaxed discipline gave a trifling indulgence to my own notions if that could be allowed perhaps i might sometimes by accident and without an unpardonable crime trust as much to my own very careful and very laborious though perhaps somewhat purblind disquisitions as to their soaring intuitive eagleeyed authority but the modern liberty is a precious thing it must not be profaned by too vulgar an use it belongs only to the chosen few who are born to the hereditary representation of the whole democracy and who leave nothing at all no not the offal to us poor outcasts of the plebeian race  amongst those gentlemen who came to authority as soon or sooner than they came of age i do not mean to include his grace with all those native titles to empire over our minds which distinguish the others he has a large share of experience he certainly ought to understand the british constitution better than i do he has studied it in the fundamental part for one election i have seen he has been concerned in twenty nobody is less of a visionary theorist nobody has drawn his speculations more from practice no peer has condescended to superintend with more vigilance the declining franchises of the poor commons with thrice great hermes he has outwatched the bear often have his candles been burned to the snuff and glimmered and stunk in the sockets whilst he grew pale at his constitutional studies long sleepless nights has he wasted long laborious shiftless journeys has he made and great sums has he expended in order to secure the purity the independence and the sobriety of elections and to give a check if possible to the ruinous charges that go nearly to the destruction of the right of election itself  amidst these his labors his grace will be pleased to forgive me if my zeal less enlightened to be sure than his by midnight lamps and studies has presumed to talk too favorably of this constitution and even to say something sounding like approbation of that body which has the honor to reckon his grace at the head of it those who dislike this partiality or if his grace pleases this flattery of mine have a comfort at hand i may be refuted and brought to shame by the most convincing of all refutations a practical refutation every individual peer for himself may show that i was ridiculously wrong the whole body of those noble persons may refute me for the whole corps if they please they are more powerful advocates against themselves than a thousand scribblers like me can be in their favor if i were even possessed of those powers which his grace in order to heighten my offence is pleased to attribute to me there would be little difference the eloquence of mr erskine might save mr  from the gallows but no eloquence could save mr jackson from the effects of his own potion  in that unfortunate book of mine which is put in the index expurgatorius of the modern whigs i might have spoken too favorably not only of those who wear coronets but of those who wear crowns kings however have not only long arms but strong ones too a great northern potentate for instance is able in one moment and with one bold stroke of his diplomatic pen to efface all the volumes which i could write in a century or which the most laborious publicists of germany ever carried to the fair of leipsic as an apology for monarchs and monarchy whilst i or any other poor puny private sophist was defending the declaration of pilnitz his majesty might refute me by the treaty of basle such a monarch may destroy one republic because it had a king at its head and he may balance this extraordinary act by founding another republic that has cut off the head of its king i defended that great potentate for associating in a grand alliance for the preservation of the old governments of europe but he puts me to silence by delivering up all those governments his own virtually included to the new system of france if he is accused before the parisian tribunal constituted for the trial of kings for having polluted the soil of liberty by the tracks of his disciplined slaves he clears himself by surrendering the finest parts of germany with a handsome cut of his own territories to the offended majesty of the regicides of france can i resist this am i responsible for it if with a torch in his hand and a rope about his neck he makes amende honorable to the sansculotterie of the republic one and indivisible in that humiliating attitude in spite of my protests he may supplicate pardon for his menacing proclamations and as an expiation to those whom he failed to terrify with his threats he may abandon those whom he had seduced by his promises he may sacrifice the royalists of france whom he had called to his standard as a salutary example to those who shall adhere to their native sovereign or shall confide in any other who undertakes the cause of oppressed kings and of loyal subjects  how can i help it if this highminded prince will subscribe to the invectives which the regicides have made against all kings and particularly against himself how can i help it if this royal propagandist will preach the doctrine of the rights of men is it my fault if his professors of literature read lectures on that code in all his academies and if all the pensioned managers of the newspapers in his dominions diffuse it throughout europe in an hundred journals can it be attributed to me if he will initiate all his grenadiers and all his hussars in these high mysteries am i responsible if he will make le droit de lhomme or la souverainté du peuple the favorite parole of his military orders now that his troops are to act with the brave legions of freedom no doubt he will fit them for their fraternity he will teach the prussians to think to feel and to act like them and to emulate the glories of the régiment de léchafaud he will employ the illustrious citizen santerre the general of his new allies to instruct the dull germans how they shall conduct themselves towards persons who like louis the sixteenth whose cause and person he once took into his protection shall dare without the sanction of the people or with it to consider themselves as hereditary kings can i arrest this great potentate in his career of glory am i blamable in recommending virtue and religion as the true foundation of all monarchies because the protector of the three religions of the westphalian arrangement to ingratiate himself with the republic of philosophy shall abolish all the three it is not in my power to prevent the grand patron of the reformed church if he chooses it from annulling the calvinistic sabbath and establishing the décadi of atheism in all his states he may even renounce and abjure his favorite mysticism in the temple of reason in these things at least he is truly despotic he has now shaken hands with everything which at first had inspired him with horror it would be curious indeed to see what i shall not however travel so far to see the ingenious devices and the elegant transparencies which on the restoration of peace and the commencement of prussian liberty are to decorate potsdam and charlottenburg festeggianti what shades of his armed ancestors of the house of brandenburg will the committee of illuminés raise up in the operahouse of berlin to dance a grand ballet in the rejoicings for this auspicious event is it a grand master of the teutonic order or is it the great elector is it the first king of prussia or the last or is the whole long line long i mean a parte ante to appear like banquos royal procession in the tragedy of macbeth  how can i prevent all these arts of royal policy and all these displays of royal magnificence how can i prevent the successor of frederick the great from aspiring to a new and in this age unexampled kind of glory is it in my power to say that he shall not make his confessions in the style of st austin or of rousseau that he shall not assume the character of the penitent and flagellant and grafting monkery on philosophy strip himself of his regal purple clothe his gigantic limbs in the sackcloth and the hairshirt and exercise on his broad shoulders the disciplinary scourge of the holy order of the sansculottes it is not in me to hinder kings from making new orders of religious and martial knighthood i am not hercules enough to uphold those orbs which the atlases of the world are so desirous of shifting from their weary shoulders what can be done against the magnanimous resolution of the great to accomplish the degradation and the ruin of their own character and situation  what i say of the german princes that i say of all the other dignities and all the other institutions of the holy roman empire if they have a mind to destroy themselves they may put their advocates to silence and their advisers to shame i have often praised the aulic council it is very true i did so i thought it a tribunal as well formed as human wisdom could form a tribunal for coercing the great the rich and the powerfulfor obliging them to submit their necks to the imperial laws and to those of nature and of nations a tribunal well conceived for extirpating peculation corruption and oppression from all the parts of that vast heterogeneous mass called the germanic body i should not be inclined to retract these praises upon any of the ordinary lapses into which human infirmity will fall they might still stand though some of their conclusums should taste of the prejudices of country or of faction whether political or religious some degree even of corruption should not make me think them guilty of suicide but if we could suppose that the aulic council not regarding duty or even common decorum listening neither to the secret admonitions of conscience nor to the public voice of fame some of the members basely abandoning their post and others continuing in it only the more infamously to betray it should give a judgment so shameless and so prostitute of such monstrous and even portentous corruption that no example in the history of human depravity or even in the fictions of poetic imagination could possibly match itif it should be a judgment which with cold unfeeling cruelty after long deliberations should condemn millions of innocent people to extortion to rapine and to blood and should devote some of the finest countries upon earth to ravage and desolationdoes any one think that any servile apologies of mine or any strutting and bullying insolence of their own can save them from the ruin that must fell on all institutions of dignity or of authority that are perverted from their purport to the oppression of human nature in others and to its disgrace in themselves as the wisdom of men mates such institutions the folly of men destroys them whatever we may pretend there is always more in the soundness of the materials than in the fashion of the work the order of a good building is something but if it be wholly declined from its perpendicular if the cement is loose and incoherent if the stones are scaling with every change of the weather and the whole toppling on our heads what matter is it whether we are crushed by a corinthian or a doric ruin the fine form of a vessel is a matter of use and of delight it is pleasant to see her decorated with cost and art but what signifies even the mathematical truth of her formwhat signify all the art and cost with which she can be carved and painted and gilded and covered with decorations from stem to sternwhat signify all her rigging and sails her flags her pendants and her streamerswhat signify even her cannon her stores and her provisions if all her planks and timbers be unsound and rotten      quamvis pontica pinus     silvæ filia nobilis     jactes et genus et nomen inutile  i have been stimulated i know not how to give you this trouble by what very few except myself would think worth any trouble at all in a speech in the house of lords i have been attacked for the defence of a scheme of government in which that body inheres and in which alone it can exist peers of great britain may become as penitent as the sovereign of prussia they may repent of what they have done in assertion of the honor of their king and in favor of their own safety but never the gloom that lowers over the fortune of the cause nor anything which the great may do towards hastening their own fall can make me repent of what i have done by pen or voice the only arms i possess in favor of the order of things into which i was born and in which i fondly hoped to die  in the long series of ages which have furnished the matter of history never was so beautiful and so august a spectacle presented to the moral eye as europe afforded the day before the revolution in france i knew indeed that this prosperity contained in itself the seeds of its own danger in one part of the society it caused laxity and debility in the other it produced bold spirits and dark designs a false philosophy passed from academies into courts and the great themselves were infected with the theories which conducted to their ruin knowledge which in the two last centuries either did not exist at all or existed solidly on right principles and in chosen hands was now diffused weakened and perverted general wealth loosened morals relaxed vigilance and increased presumption men of talent began to compare in the partition of the common stock of public prosperity the proportions of the dividends with the merits of the claimants as usual they found their portion not equal to their estimate or perhaps to the public estimate of their own worth when it was once discovered by the revolution in france that a struggle between establishment and rapacity could be maintained though but for one year and in one place i was sure that a practicable breach was made in the whole order of things and in every country religion that held the materials of the fabric together was first systematically loosened all other opinions under the name of prejudices must fall along with it and property left undefended by principles became a repository of spoils to tempt cupidity and not a magazine to furnish arms for defence i knew that attacked on all sides by the infernal energies of talents set in action by vice and disorder authority could not stand upon authority alone it wanted some other support than the poise of its own gravity situations formerly supported persons it now became necessary that personal qualities should support situations formerly where authority was found wisdom and virtue were presumed but now the veil was torn and to keep off sacrilegious intrusion it was necessary that in the sanctuary of government something should be disclosed not only venerable but dreadful government was at once to show itself full of virtue and full of force it was to invite partisans by making it appear to the world that a generous cause was to be asserted one fit for a generous people to engage in from passive submission was it to expect resolute defence no it must have warm advocates and passionate defenders which an heavy discontented acquiescence never could produce what a base and foolish thing is it for any consolidated body of authority to say or to act as if it said i will put my trust not in my own virtue but in your patience i will indulge in effeminacy in indolence in corruption i will give way to all my perverse and vicious humors because you cannot punish me without the hazard of ruining yourselves  i wished to warn the people against the greatest of all evilsa blind and furious spirit of innovation under the name of reform i was indeed well aware that power rarely reforms itself so it is undoubtedly when all is quiet about it but i was in hopes that provident fear might prevent fruitless penitence i trusted that danger might produce at least circumspection i flattered myself in a moment like this that nothing would be added to make authority topheavythat the very moment of an earthquake would not be the time chosen for adding a story to our houses i hoped to see the surest of all reforms perhaps the only sure reformthe ceasing to do ill in the mean time i wished to the people the wisdom of knowing how to tolerate a condition which none of their efforts can render much more than tolerable it was a condition however in which everything was to be found that could enable them to live to nature and if so they pleased to live to virtue and to honor  i do not repent that i thought better of those to whom i wished well than they will suffer me long to think that they deserved far from repenting i would to god that new faculties had been called up in me in favor not of this or that man or this or that system but of the general vital principle that whilst it was in its vigor produced the state of things transmitted to us from our fathers but which through the joint operation of the abuses of authority and liberty may perish in our hands i am not of opinion that the race of men and the commonwealths they create like the bodies of individuals grow effete and languid and bloodless and ossify by the necessities of their own conformation and the fatal operation of longevity and time these analogies between bodies natural and politic though they may sometimes illustrate arguments furnish no argument of themselves they are but too often used under the color of a specious philosophy to find apologies for the despair of laziness and pusillanimity and to excuse the want of all manly efforts when the exigencies of our country call for them the more loudly  how often has public calamity been arrested on the very brink of ruin by the seasonable energy of a single man have we no such man amongst us i am as sure as i am of my being that one vigorous mind without office without situation without public functions of any kind at a time when the want of such a thing is felt as i am sure it is i say one such man confiding in the aid of god and full of just reliance in his own fortitude vigor enterprise and perseverance would first draw to him some few like himself and then that multitudes hardly thought to be in existence would appear and troop about him  if i saw this auspicious beginning baffled and frustrated as i am yet on the very verge of a timely grave abandoned abroad and desolate at home stripped of my boast my hope my consolation my helper my counsellor and my guide you know in part what i have lost and would to god i could clear myself of all neglect and fault in that loss yet thus even thus i would rake up the fire under all the ashes that oppress it i am no longer patient of the public eye nor am i of force to win my way and to justle and elbow in a crowd but even in solitude something may be done for society the meditations of the closet have infected senates with a subtle frenzy and inflamed armies with the brands of the furies the cure might come from the same source with the distemper i would add my part to those who would animate the people whose hearts are yet right to new exertions in the old cause  novelty is not the only source of zeal why should not a maccabæus and his brethren arise to assert the honor of the ancient law and to defend the temple of their forefathers with as ardent a spirit as can inspire any innovator to destroy the monuments of the piety and the glory of ancient ages it is not a hazarded assertion it is a great truth that when once things are gone out of their ordinary course it is by acts out of the ordinary course they can alone be reëstablished republican spirit can only be combated by a spirit of the same natureof the same nature but informed with another principle and pointing to another end i would persuade a resistance both to the corruption and to the reformation that prevails it will not be the weaker but much the stronger for combating both together a victory over real corruptions would enable us to baffle the spurious and pretended reformations i would not wish to excite or even to tolerate that kind of evil spirit which evokes the powers of hell to rectify the disorders of the earth no i would add my voice with better and i trust more potent charms to draw down justice and wisdom and fortitude from heaven for the correction of human vice and the recalling of human error from the devious ways into which it has been betrayed i would wish to call the impulses of individuals at once to the aid and to the control of authority by this which i call the true republican spirit paradoxical as it may appear monarchies alone can be rescued from the imbecility of courts and the madness of the crowd this republican spirit would not suffer men in high place to bring ruin on their country and on themselves it would reform not by destroying but by saving the great the rich and the powerful such a republican spirit we perhaps fondly conceive to have animated the distinguished heroes and patriots of old who knew no mode of policy but religion and virtue these they would have paramount to all constitutions they would not suffer monarchs or senates or popular assemblies under pretences of dignity or authority or freedom to shake off those moral riders which reason has appointed to govern every sort of rude power these in appearance loading them by their weight do by that pressure augment their essential force the momentum is increased by the extraneous weight it is true in moral as it is in mechanical science it is true not only in the draught but in the race these riders of the great in effect hold the reins which guide them in their course and wear the spur that stimulates them to the goals of honor and of safety the great must submit to the dominion of prudence and of virtue or none will long submit to the dominion of the great dîs te minorem quod geris imperas this is the feudal tenure which they cannot alter  indeed my dear sir things are in a bad state i do not deny a good share of diligence a very great share of ability and much public virtue to those who direct our affairs but they are incumbered not aided by their very instruments and by all the apparatus of the state i think that our ministry though there are things against them which neither you nor i can dissemble and which grieve me to the heart is by far the most honest and by far the wisest system of administration in europe their fall would be no trivial calamity  not meaning to depreciate the minority in parliament whose talents are also great and to whom i do not deny virtues their system seems to me to be fundamentally wrong but whether wrong or right they have not enough of coherence among themselves nor of estimation with the public nor of numbers they cannot make up an administration nothing is more visible many other things are against them which i do not charge as faults but reckon among national misfortunes extraordinary things must be done or one of the parties cannot stand as a ministry nor the other even as an opposition they cannot change their situations nor can any useful coalition be made between them i do not see the mode of it nor the way to it this aspect of things i do not contemplate with pleasure  i well know that everything of the daring kind which i speak of is critical but the times are critical new things in a new world i see no hopes in the common tracks if men are not to be found who can be got to feel within them some impulse quod nequeo monstrare et sentio tantum and which makes them impatient of the presentif none can be got to feel that private persons may sometimes assume that sort of magistracy which does not depend on the nomination of kings or the election of the people but has an inherent and selfexistent power which both would recognize i see nothing in the world to hope  if i saw such a group beginning to cluster such as they are they should have all that i can give my prayers and my advice people talk of war or cry for peace have they to the bottom considered the questions either of war or peace upon the scale of the existing world no i fear they have not  why should not you yourself be one of those to enter your name in such a list as i speak of you are young you have great talents you have a clear head you have a natural fluent and unforced elocution your ideas are just your sentiments benevolent open and enlargedbut this is too big for your modesty oh this modesty in time and place is a charming virtue and the grace of all other virtues but it is sometimes the worst enemy they have let him whose print i gave you the other day be engraved in your memory had it pleased providence to have spared him for the trying situations that seem to be coming on notwithstanding that he was sometimes a little dispirited by the disposition which we thought shown to depress him and set him aside yet he was always buoyed up again and on one or two occasions he discovered what might be expected from the vigor and elevation of his mind from his unconquerable fortitude and from the extent of his resources for every purpose of speculation and of action remember him my friend who in the highest degree honored and respected you and remember that great parts are a great trust remember too that mistaken or misapplied virtues if they are not as pernicious as vice frustrate at least their own natural tendencies and disappoint the purposes of the great giver  adieu my dreams are finished  footnotes  14 mr paine is a norfolk man from thetford     thoughts and details  on  scarcity  originally presented  to the right hon william pitt  in the month of november  1795     thoughts and details  on  scarcity   of all things an indiscreet tampering with the trade of provisions is the most dangerous and it is always worst in the time when men are most disposed to itthat is in the time of scarcity because there is nothing on which the passions of men are so violent and their judgment so weak and on which there exists such a multitude of illfounded popular prejudices  the great use of government is as a restraint and there is no restraint which it ought to put upon others and upon itself too rather than that which is imposed on the fury of speculating under circumstances of irritation the number of idle tales spread about by the industry of faction and by the zeal of foolish goodintention and greedily devoured by the malignant credulity of mankind tends infinitely to aggravate prejudices which in themselves are more than sufficiently strong in that state of affairs and of the public with relation to them the first thing that government owes to us the people is information the next is timely coercion the one to guide our judgment the other to regulate our tempers  to provide for us in our necessities is not in the power of government it would be a vain presumption in statesmen to think they can do it the people maintain them and not they the people it is in the power of government to prevent much evil it can do very little positive good in this or perhaps in anything else it is not only so of the state and statesman but of all the classes and descriptions of the rich they are the pensioners of the poor and are maintained by their superfluity they are under an absolute hereditary and indefeasible dependence on those who labor and are miscalled the poor  the laboring people are only poor because they are numerous numbers in their nature imply poverty in a fair distribution among a vast multitude none can have much that class of dependent pensioners called the rich is so extremely small that if all their throats were cut and a distribution made of all they consume in a year it would not give a bit of bread and cheese for one nights supper to those who labor and who in reality feed both the pensioners and themselves  but the throats of the rich ought not to be cut nor their magazines plundered because in their persons they are trustees for those who labor and their hoards are the bankinghouses of these latter whether they mean it or not they do in effect execute their trustsome with more some with less fidelity and judgment but on the whole the duty is performed and everything returns deducting some very trifling commission and discount to the place from whence it arose when the poor rise to destroy the rich they act as wisely for their own purposes as when they burn mills and throw corn into the river to make bread cheap  when i say that we of the people ought to be informed inclusively i say we ought not to be flattered flattery is the reverse of instruction the poor in that case would be rendered as improvident as the rich which would not be at all good for them  nothing can be so base and so wicked as the political canting language the laboring poor let compassion be shown in actionthe more the betteraccording to every mans ability but let there be no lamentation of their condition it is no relief to their miserable circumstances it is only an insult to their miserable understandings it arises from a total want of charity or a total want of thought want of one kind was never relieved by want of any other kind patience labor sobriety frugality and religion should be recommended to them all the rest is downright fraud it is horrible to call them the once happy laborer  whether what may be called the moral or philosophical happiness of the laborious classes is increased or not i cannot say the seat of that species of happiness is in the mind and there are few data to ascertain the comparative state of the mind at any two periods philosophical happiness is to want little civil or vulgar happiness is to want much and to enjoy much  if the happiness of the animal man which certainly goes somewhere towards the happiness of the rational man be the object of our estimate then i assert without the least hesitation that the condition of those who labor in all descriptions of labor and in all gradations of labor from the highest to the lowest inclusively is on the whole extremely meliorated if more and better food is any standard of melioration they work more it is certain but they have the advantage of their augmented labor yet whether that increase of labor be on the whole a good or an evil is a consideration that would lead us a great way and is not for my present purpose but as to the fact of the melioration of their diet i shall enter into the detail of proof whenever i am called upon in the mean time the known difficulty of contenting them with anything but bread made of the finest flour and meat of the first quality is proof sufficient  i further assert that even under all the hardships of the last year the laboring people did either out of their direct gains or from charity which it seems is now an insult to them in fact fare better than they did in seasons of common plenty fifty or sixty years agoor even at the period of my english observation which is about fortyfour years i even assert that full as many in that class as ever were known to do it before continued to save money and this i can prove so far as my own information and experience extend  it is not true that the rate of wages has not increased with the nominal price of provisions i allow it has not fluctuated with that pricenor ought it and the squires of norfolk had dined when they gave it as their opinion that it might or ought to rise and fall with the market of provisions the rate of wages in truth has no direct relation to that price labor is a commodity like every other and rises or falls according to the demand this is in the nature of things however the nature of things has provided for their necessities wages have been twice raised in my time and they hear a full proportion or even a greater than formerly to the medium of provision during the last bad cycle of twenty years they bear a full proportion to the result of their labor if we were wildly to attempt to force them beyond it the stone which we had forced up the hill would only fall back upon them in a diminished demand or what indeed is the far lesser evil an aggravated price of all the provisions which are the result of their manual toil  there is an implied contract much stronger than any instrument or article of agreement between the laborer in any occupation and his employerthat the labor so far as that labor is concerned shall be sufficient to pay to the employer a profit on his capital and a compensation for his risk in a word that the labor shall produce an advantage equal to the payment whatever is above that is a direct tax and if the amount of that tax be left to the will and pleasure of another it is an arbitrary tax  if i understand it rightly the tax proposed on the farming interest of this kingdom is to be levied at what is called the discretion of justices of peace  the questions arising on this scheme of arbitrary taxation are these whether it is better to leave all dealing in which there is no force or fraud collusion or combination entirely to the persons mutually concerned in the matter contracted foror to put the contract into the hands of those who can have none or a very remote interest in it and little or no knowledge of the subject  it might be imagined that there would be very little difficulty in solving this question for what man of any degree of reflection can think that a want of interest in any subject closely connected with a want of skill in it qualifies a person to intermeddle in any the least affairmuch less in affairs that vitally concern the agriculture of the kingdom the first of all its concerns and the foundation of all its prosperity in every other matter by which that prosperity is produced  the vulgar error on this subject arises from a total confusion in the very idea of things widely different in themselvesthose of convention and those of judicature when a contract is making it is a matter of discretion and of interest between the parties in that intercourse and in what is to arise from it the parties are the masters if they are not completely so they are not free and therefore their contracts are void  but this freedom has no farther extent when the contract is made then their discretionary powers expire and a new order of things takes its origin then and not till then and on a difference between the parties the office of the judge commences he cannot dictate the contract it is his business to see that it be enforcedprovided that it is not contrary to preëxisting laws or obtained by force or fraud if he is in any way a maker or regulator of the contract in so much he is disqualified from being a judge but this sort of confused distribution of administrative and judicial characters of which we have already as much as is sufficient and a little more is not the only perplexity of notions and passions which trouble us in the present hour  what is doing supposes or pretends that the farmer and the laborer have opposite intereststhat the farmer oppresses the laborerand that a gentleman called a justice of peace is the protector of the latter and a control and restraint on the former and this is a point i wish to examine in a manner a good deal different from that in which gentlemen proceed who confide more in their abilities than is fit and suppose them capable of more than any natural abilities fed with no other than the provender furnished by their own private speculations can accomplish legislative acts attempting to regulate this part of economy do at least as much as any other require the exactest detail of circumstances guided by the surest general principles that are necessary to direct experiment and inquiry in order again from those details to elicit principles firm and luminous general principles to direct a practical legislative proceeding  first then i deny that it is in this case as in any other of necessary implication that contracting parties should originally have had different interests by accident it may be so undoubtedly at the outset but then the contract is of the nature of a compromise and compromise is founded on circumstances that suppose it the interest of the parties to be reconciled in some medium the principle of compromise adopted of consequence the interests cease to be different  but in the case of the farmer and the laborer their interests are always the same and it is absolutely impossible that their free contracts can be onerous to either party it is the interest of the farmer that his work should be done with effect and celerity and that cannot be unless the laborer is well fed and otherwise found with such necessaries of animal life according to its habitudes as may keep the body in full force and the mind gay and cheerful for of all the instruments of his trade the labor of man what the ancient writers have called the instrumentum vocale is that on which he is most to rely for the repayment of his capital the other two the semivocale in the ancient classification that is the working stock of cattle and the instrumentum mutum such as carts ploughs spades and so forth though not all inconsiderable in themselves are very much inferior in utility or in expense and without a given portion of the first are nothing at all for in all things whatever the mind is the most valuable and the most important and in this scale the whole of agriculture is in a natural and just order the beast is as an informing principle to the plough and cart the laborer is as reason to the beast and the farmer is as a thinking and presiding principle to the laborer an attempt to break this chain of subordination in any part is equally absurd but the absurdity is the most mischievous in practical operation where it is the most easythat is where it is the most subject to an erroneous judgment  it is plainly more the farmers interest that his men should thrive than that his horses should be well fed sleek plump and fit for use or than that his wagon and ploughs should be strong in good repair and fit for service  on the other hand if the farmer ceases to profit of the laborer and that his capital is not continually manured and fructified it is impossible that he should continue that abundant nutriment and clothing and lodging proper for the protection of the instruments he employs  it is therefore the first and fundamental interest of the laborer that the farmer should have a full incoming profit on the product of his labor the proposition is selfevident and nothing but the malignity perverseness and illgoverned passions of mankind and particularly the envy they bear to each others prosperity could prevent their seeing and acknowledging it with thankfulness to the benign and wise disposer of all things who obliges men whether they will or not in pursuing their own selfish interests to connect the general good with their own individual success  but who are to judge what that profit and advantage ought to be certainly no authority on earth it is a matter of convention dictated by the reciprocal conveniences of the parties and indeed by their reciprocal necessitiesbut if the farmer is excessively avariciouswhy so much the better the more he desires to increase his gains the more interested is he in the good condition of those upon whose labor his gains must principally depend  i shall be told by the zealots of the sect of regulation that this may be true and may be safely committed to the convention of the farmer and the laborer when the latter is in the prime of his youth and at the time of his health and vigor and in ordinary times of abundance but in calamitous seasons under accidental illness in declining life and with the pressure of a numerous offspring the future nourishers of the community but the present drains and bloodsuckers of those who produce them what is to be done when a man cannot live and maintain his family by the natural hire of his labor ought it not to be raised by authority  on this head i must be allowed to submit what my opinions have ever been and somewhat at large  and first i premise that labor is as i have already intimated a commodity and as such an article of trade if i am right in this notion then labor must be subject to all the laws and principles of trade and not to regulations foreign to them and that may be totally inconsistent with those principles and those laws when any commodity is carried to market it is not the necessity of the vendor but the necessity of the purchaser that raises the price the extreme want of the seller has rather by the nature of things with which we shall in vain contend the direct contrary operation if the goods at market are beyond the demand they fall in their value if below it they rise the impossibility of the subsistence of a man who carries his labor to a market is totally beside the question in this way of viewing it the only question is what is it worth to the buyer  but if authority comes in and forces the buyer to a price what is this in the case say of a farmer who buys the labor of ten or twelve laboring men and three or four handicraftswhat is it but to make an arbitrary division of his property among them  the whole of his gains i say it with the most certain conviction never do amount anything like in value to what he pays to his laborers and artificers so that a very small advance upon what one man pays to many may absorb the whole of what he possesses and amount to an actual partition of all his substance among them a perfect equality will indeed be producedthat is to say equal want equal wretchedness equal beggary and on the part of the partitioners a woful helpless and desperate disappointment such is the event of all compulsory equalizations they pull down what is above they never raise what is below and they depress high and low together beneath the level of what was originally the lowest  if a commodity is raised by authority above what it will yield with a profit to the buyer that commodity will be the less dealt in if a second blundering interposition be used to correct the blunder of the first and an attempt is made to force the purchase of the commodity of labor for instance the one of these two things must happen either that the forced buyer is ruined or the price of the product of the labor in that proportion is raised then the wheel turns round and the evil complained of falls with aggravated weight on the complainant the price of corn which is the result of the expense of all the operations of husbandry taken together and for some time continued will rise on the laborer considered as a consumer the very best will be that he remains where he was but if the price of the corn should not compensate the price of labor what is far more to be feared the most serious evil the very destruction of agriculture itself is to be apprehended  nothing is such an enemy to accuracy of judgment as a coarse discrimination a want of such classification and distribution as the subject admits of increase the rate of wages to the laborer say the regulatorsas if labor was but one thing and of one value but this very broad generic term labor admits at least of two or three specific descriptions and these will suffice at least to let gentlemen discern a little the necessity of proceeding with caution in their coercive guidance of those whose existence depends upon the observance of still nicer distinctions and subdivisions than commonly they resort to in forming their judgments on this very enlarged part of economy  the laborers in husbandry may be dividedfirst into those who are able to perform the full work of a manthat is what can be done by a person from twentyone years of age to fifty i know no husbandry work mowing hardly excepted that is not equally within the power of all persons within those ages the more advanced fully compensating by knack and habit what they lose in activity unquestionably there is a good deal of difference between the value of one mans labor and that of another from strength dexterity and honest application but i am quite sure from my best observation that any given five men will in their total afford a proportion of labor equal to any other five within the periods of life i have stated that is that among such five men there will be one possessing all the qualifications of a good workman one bad and the other three middling and approximating to the first and the last so that in so small a platoon as that of even five you will find the full complement of all that five men can earn taking five and five throughout the kingdom they are equal therefore an error with regard to the equalization of their wages by those who employ five as farmers do at the very least cannot be considerable  secondly those who are able to work but not the complete task of a daylaborer this class is infinitely diversified but will aptly enough fall into principal divisions men from the decline which after fifty becomes every year more sensible to the period of debility and decrepitude and the maladies that precede a final dissolution women whose employment on husbandry is but occasional and who differ more in effective labor one from another than men do on account of gestation nursing and domestic management over and above the difference they have in common with men in advancing in stationary and in declining life children who proceed on the reverse order growing from less to greater utility but with a still greater disproportion of nutriment to labor than is found in the second of those subdivisions as is visible to those who will give themselves the trouble of examining into the interior economy of a poorhouse  this inferior classification is introduced to show that laws prescribing or magistrates exercising a very stiff and often inapplicable rule or a blind and rash discretion never can provide the just proportions between earning and salary on the one hand and nutriment on the other whereas interest habit and the tacit convention that arise from a thousand nameless circumstances produce a tact that regulates without difficulty what laws and magistrates cannot regulate at all the first class of labor wants nothing to equalize it it equalizes itself the second and third are not capable of any equalization  but what if the rate of hire to the laborer comes far short of his necessary subsistence and the calamity of the time is so great as to threaten actual famine is the poor laborer to be abandoned to the flinty heart and griping hand of base selfinterest supported by the sword of law especially when there is reason to suppose that the very avarice of farmers themselves has concurred with the errors of government to bring famine on the land  in that case my opinion is this whenever it happens that a man can claim nothing according to the rules of commerce and the principles of justice he passes out of that department and comes within the jurisdiction of mercy in that province the magistrate has nothing at all to do his interference is a violation of the property which it is his office to protect without all doubt charity to the poor is a direct and obligatory duty upon all christians next in order after the payment of debts full as strong and by nature made infinitely more delightful to us pufendorf and other casuists do not i think denominate it quite properly when they call it a duty of imperfect obligation but the manner mode time choice of objects and proportion are left to private discretion and perhaps for that very reason it is performed with the greater satisfaction because the discharge of it has more the appearance of freedomrecommending us besides very specially to the divine favor as the exercise of a virtue most suitable to a being sensible of its own infirmity  the cry of the people in cities and towns though unfortunately from a fear of their multitude and combination the most regarded ought in fact to be the least attended to upon this subject for citizens are in a state of utter ignorance of the means by which they are to be fed and they contribute little or nothing except in an infinitely circuitous manner to their own maintenance they are truly fruges consumere nati they are to be heard with great respect and attention upon matters within their provincethat is on trades and manufactures but on anything that relates to agriculture they are to be listened to with the same reverence which we pay to the dogmas of other ignorant and presumptuous men  if any one were to tell them that they were to give in an account of all the stock in their shopsthat attempts would be made to limit their profits or raise the price of the laboring manufacturers upon them or recommend to government out of a capital from the public revenues to set up a shop of the same commodities in order to rival them and keep them to reasonable dealingthey would very soon see the impudence injustice and oppression of such a course they would not be mistaken but they are of opinion that agriculture is to be subject to other laws and to be governed by other principles  a greater and more ruinous mistake cannot be fallen into than that the trades of agriculture and grazing can be conducted upon any other than the common principles of commerce namely that the producer should be permitted and even expected to look to all possible profit which without fraud or violence he can make to turn plenty or scarcity to the best advantage he can to keep back or to bring forward his commodities at his pleasure to account to no one for his stock or for his gain on any other terms he is the slave of the consumer and that he should be so is of no benefit to the consumer no slave was ever so beneficial to the master as a freeman that deals with him on an equal footing by convention formed on the rules and principles of contending interests and compromised advantages the consumer if he were suffered would in the end always be the dupe of his own tyranny and injustice the landed gentleman is never to forget that the farmer is his representative  it is a perilous thing to try experiments on the farmer the farmers capital except in a few persons and in a very few places is far more feeble than commonly is imagined the trade is a very poor trade it is subject to great risks and losses the capital such as it is is turned but once in the year in some branches it requires three years before the money is paid i believe never less than three in the turnip and grassland course which is the prevalent course on the more or less fertile sandy and gravelly loamsand these compose the soil in the south and southeast of england the best adapted and perhaps the only ones that are adapted to the turnip husbandry  it is very rare that the most prosperous farmer counting the value of his quick and dead stock the interest of the money he turns together with his own wages as a bailiff or overseer ever does make twelve or fifteen per centum by the year on his capital i speak of the prosperous in most of the parts of england which have fallen within my observation i have rarely known a farmer who to his own trade has not added some other employment or traffic that after a course of the most unremitting parsimony and labor such for the greater part is theirs and persevering in his business for a long course of years died worth more than paid his debts leaving his posterity to continue in nearly the same equal conflict between industry and want in which the last predecessor and a long line of predecessors before him lived and died  observe that i speak of the generality of farmers who have not more than from one hundred and fifty to three or four hundred acres there are few in this part of the country within the former or much beyond the latter extent unquestionably in other places there are much larger but i am convinced whatever part of england be the theatre of his operations a farmer who cultivates twelve hundred acres which i consider as a large farm though i know there are larger cannot proceed with any degree of safety and effect with a smaller capital than ten thousand pounds and that he cannot in the ordinary course of culture make more upon that great capital of ten thousand pounds than twelve hundred a year  as to the weaker capitals an easy judgment may be formed by what very small errors they may be farther attenuated enervated rendered unproductive and perhaps totally destroyed  this constant precariousness and ultimate moderate limits of a farmers fortune on the strongest capital i press not only on account of the hazardous speculations of the times but because the excellent and most useful works of my friend mr arthur young tend to propagate that error such i am very certain it is of the largeness of a farmers profits it is not that his account of the produce does often greatly exceed but he by no means makes the proper allowance for accidents and losses i might enter into a convincing detail if other more troublesome and more necessary details were not before me  this proposed discretionary tax on labor militates with the recommendations of the board of agriculture they recommend a general use of the drill culture i agree with the board that where the soil is not excessively heavy or incumbered with large loose stones which however is the case with much otherwise good land that course is the best and most productiveprovided that the most accurate eye the most vigilant superintendence the most prompt activity which has no such day as tomorrow in its calendar the most steady foresight and predisposing order to have everybody and everything ready in its place and prepared to take advantage of the fortunate fugitive moment in this coquetting climate of oursprovided i say all these combine to speed the plough i admit its superiority over the old and general methods but under procrastinating improvident ordinary husbandmen who may neglect or let slip the few opportunities of sweetening and purifying their ground with perpetually renovated toil and undissipated attention nothing when tried to any extent can be worse or more dangerous the farm may be ruined instead of having the soil enriched and sweetened by it  but the excellence of the method on a proper soil and conducted by husbandmen of whom there are few being readily granted how and on what conditions is this culture obtained why by a very great increase of labor by an augmentation of the third part at least of the handlabor to say nothing of the horses and machinery employed in ordinary tillage now every man must be sensible how little becoming the gravity of legislature it is to encourage a board which recommends to us and upon very weighty reasons unquestionably an enlargement of the capital we employ in the operations of the hand and then to pass an act which taxes that manual labor already at a very high ratethus compelling us to diminish the quantity of labor which in the vulgar course we actually employ  what is true of the farmer is equally true of the middlemanwhether the middleman acts as factor jobber salesman or speculator in the markets of grain these traders are to be left to their free course and the more they make and the richer they are and the more largely they deal the better both for the farmer and consumer between whom they form a natural and most useful link of connectionthough by the machinations of the old evil counsellor envy they are hated and maligned by both parties  i hear that middlemen are accused of monopoly without question the monopoly of authority is in every instance and in every degree an evil but the monopoly of capital is the contrary it is a great benefit and a benefit particularly to the poor a tradesman who has but a hundred pound capital which say he can turn but once a year cannot live upon a profit of ten per cent because he cannot live upon ten pounds a year but a man of ten thousand pounds capital can live and thrive upon five per cent profit in the year because he has five hundred pounds a year the same proportion holds in turning it twice or thrice these principles are plain and simple and it is not our ignorance so much as the levity the envy and the malignity of our nature that hinders us from perceiving and yielding to them but we are not to suffer our vices to usurp the place of our judgment  the balance between consumption and production makes price the market settles and alone can settle that price market is the meeting and conference of the consumer and producer when they mutually discover each others wants nobody i believe has observed with any reflection what market is without being astonished at the truth the correctness the celerity the general equity with which the balance of wants is settled they who wish the destruction of that balance and would fain by arbitrary regulation decree that defective production should not be compensated by increased price directly lay their axe to the root of production itself they may even in one year of such false policy do mischiefs incalculable because the trade of a farmer is as i have before explained one of the most precarious in its advantages the most liable to losses and the least profitable of any that is carried on it requires ten times more of labor of vigilance of attention of skill and let me add of good fortune also to carry on the business of a farmer with success than what belongs to any other trade  seeing things in this light i am far from presuming to censure the late circular instruction of council to lordlieutenants but i confess i do not clearly discern its object i am greatly afraid that the inquiry will raise some alarm as a measure leading to the french system of putting corn into requisition for that was preceded by an inquisition somewhat similar in its principle though according to their mode their principles are full of that violence which here is not much to be feared it goes on a principle directly opposite to mine it presumes that the market is no fair test of plenty or scarcity it raises a suspicion which may affect the tranquillity of the public mind that the farmer keeps back and takes unfair advantages by delay on the part of the dealer it gives rise obviously to a thousand nefarious speculations  in case the return should on the whole prove favorable is it meant to ground a measure for encouraging exportation and checking the import of corn if it is not what end can it answer and i believe it is not  this opinion may be fortified by a report gone abroad that intentions are entertained of erecting public granaries and that this inquiry is to give government an advantage in its purchases  i hear that such a measure has been proposed and is under deliberation that is for government to set up a granary in every markettown at the expense of the state in order to extinguish the dealer and to subject the farmer to the consumer by securing corn to the latter at a certain and steady price  if such a scheme is adopted i should not like to answer for the safety of the granary of the agents or of the town itself in which the granary was erected the first storm of popular frenzy would fall upon that granary  so far in a political light  in an economical light i must observe that the construction of such granaries throughout the kingdom would be at an expense beyond all calculation the keeping them up would be at a great charge the management and attendance would require an army of agents storekeepers clerks and servants the capital to be employed in the purchase of grain would be enormous the waste decay and corruption would be a dreadful drawback on the whole dealing and the dissatisfaction of the people at having decayed tainted or corrupted corn sold to them as must be the case would be serious  this climate whatever others may be is not favorable to granaries where wheat is to be kept for any time the best and indeed the only good granary is the rickyard of the farmer where the corn is preserved in its own straw sweet clean wholesome free from vermin and from insects and comparatively at a trifle of expense this and the barn enjoying many of the same advantages have been the sole granaries of england from the foundation of its agriculture to this day all this is done at the expense of the undertaker and at his sole risk he contributes to government he receives nothing from it but protection and to this he has a claim  the moment that government appears at market all the principles of market will be subverted i dont know whether the farmer will suffer by it as long as there is a tolerable market of competition but i am sure that in the first place the trading government will speedily become a bankrupt and the consumer in the end will suffer if government makes all its purchases at once it will instantly raise the market upon itself if it makes them by degrees it must follow the course of the market if it follows the course of the market it will produce no effect and the consumer may as well buy as he wants therefore all the expense is incurred gratis  but if the object of this scheme should be what i suspect it is to destroy the dealer commonly called the middleman and by incurring a voluntary loss to carry the baker to deal with government i am to tell them that they must set up another trade that of a miller or a mealman attended with a new train of expenses and risks if in both these trades they should succeed so as to exclude those who trade on natural and private capitals then they will have a monopoly in their hands which under the appearance of a monopoly of capital will in reality be a monopoly of authority and will ruin whatever it touches the agriculture of the kingdom cannot stand before it  a little place like geneva of not more than from twentyfive to thirty thousand inhabitantswhich has no territory or next to nonewhich depends for its existence on the goodwill of three neighboring powers and is of course continually in the state of something like a siege or in the speculation of itmight find some resource in state granaries and some revenue from the monopoly of what was sold to the keepers of publichouses this is a policy for a state too small for agriculture it is not for instance fit for so great a country as the pope possesseswhere however it is adopted and pursued in a greater extent and with more strictness certain of the popes territories from whence the city of rome is supplied being obliged to furnish rome and the granaries of his holiness with corn at a certain price that part of the papal territories is utterly ruined that ruin may be traced with certainty to this sole cause and it appears indubitably by a comparison of their state and condition with that of the other part of the ecclesiastical dominions not subjected to the same regulations which are in circumstances highly flourishing  the reformation of this evil system is in a manner impracticable for first it does keep bread and all other provisions equally subject to the chamber of supply at a pretty reasonable and regular price in the city of rome this preserves quiet among the numerous poor idle and naturally mutinous people of a very great capital but the quiet of the town is purchased by the ruin of the country and the ultimate wretchedness of both the next cause which renders this evil incurable is the jobs which have grown out of it and which in spite of all precautions would grow out of such things even under governments far more potent than the feeble authority of the pope  this example of rome which has been derived from the most ancient times and the most flourishing period of the roman empire but not of the roman agriculture may serve as a great caution to all governments not to attempt to feed the people out of the hands of the magistrates if once they are habituated to it though but for one halfyear they will never be satisfied to have it otherwise and having looked to government for bread on the very first scarcity they will turn and bite the hand that fed them to avoid that evil government will redouble the causes of it and then it will become inveterate and incurable  i beseech the government which i take in the largest sense of the word comprehending the two houses of parliament seriously to consider that years of scarcity or plenty do not come alternately or at short intervals but in pretty long cycles and irregularly and consequently that we cannot assure ourselves if we take a wrong measure from the temporary necessities of one season but that the next and probably more will drive us to the continuance of it so that in my opinion there is no way of preventing this evil which goes to the destruction of all our agriculture and of that part of our internal commerce which touches our agriculture the most nearly as well as the safety and very being of government but manfully to resist the very first idea speculative or practical that it is within the competence of government taken as government or even of the rich as rich to supply to the poor those necessaries which it has pleased the divine providence for a while to withhold from them we the people ought to be made sensible that it is not in breaking the laws of commerce which are the laws of nature and consequently the laws of god that we are to place our hope of softening the divine displeasure to remove any calamity under which we suffer or which hangs over us  so far as to the principles of general policy  as to the state of things which is urged as a reason to deviate from them these are the circumstances of the harvest of 1794 and 1795 with regard to the harvest of 1794 in relation to the noblest grain wheat it is allowed to have been somewhat short but not excessivelyand in quality for the sevenandtwenty years during which i have been a farmer i never remember wheat to have been so good the world were however deceived in their speculations upon itthe farmer as well as the dealer accordingly the price fluctuated beyond anything i can remember for at one time of the year i sold my wheat at 14l a load i sold off all i had as i thought this was a reasonable price when at the end of the season if i had then had any to sell i might have got thirty guineas for the same sort of grain i sold all that i had as i said at a comparatively low price because i thought it a good price compared with what i thought the general produce of the harvest but when i came to consider what my own total was i found that the quantity had not answered my expectation it must be remembered that this year of produce the year 1794 short but excellent followed a year which was not extraordinary in production nor of a superior quality and left but little in store at first this was not felt because the harvest came in unusually earlyearlier than common by a full month  the winter at the end of 1794 and beginning of 1795 was more than usually unfavorable both to corn and grass owing to the sudden relaxation of very rigorous frosts followed by rains which were again rapidly succeeded by frosts of still greater rigor than the first  much wheat was utterly destroyed the clovergrass suffered in many places what i never observed before the ryegrass or coarse bent suffered more than the clover even the meadowgrass in some places was killed to the very roots in the spring appearances were better than we expected all the early sown grain recovered itself and came up with great vigor but that which was late sown was feeble and did not promise to resist any blights in the spring which however with all its unpleasant vicissitudes passed off very well and nothing looked better than the wheat at the time of bloomingbut at that most critical time of all a cold dry east wind attended with very sharp frosts longer and stronger than i recollect at that time of year destroyed the flowers and withered up in an astonishing manner the whole side of the ear next to the wind at that time i brought to town some of the ears for the purpose of showing to my friends the operation of those unnatural frosts and according to their extent i predicted a great scarcity but such is the pleasure of agreeable prospects that my opinion was little regarded  on threshing i found things as i expectedthe ears not filled some of the capsules quite empty and several others containing only withered hungry grain inferior to the appearance of rye my best ears and grain were not fine never had i grain of so low a quality yet i sold one load for 21l at the same time i bought my seed wheat it was excellent at 23l since then the price has risen and i have sold about two load of the same sort at 23l such was the state of the market when i left home last monday little remains in my barn i hope some in the rick may be better since it was earlier sown as well as i can recollect some of my neighbors have better some quite as bad or even worse i suspect it will be found that wherever the blighting wind and those frosts at bloomingtime have prevailed the produce of the wheat crop will turn out very indifferent those parts which have escaped will i can hardly doubt have a reasonable produce  as to the other grains it is to be observed as the wheat ripened very late on account i conceive of the blights the barley got the start of it and was ripe first the crop was with me and wherever my inquiry could reach excellent in some places far superior to mine  the clover which came up with the barley was the finest i remember to have seen  the turnips of this year are generally good  the clover sown last year where not totally destroyed gave two good crops or one crop and a plentiful feed and bating the loss of the ryegrass i do not remember a better produce  the meadowgrass yielded but a middling crop and neither of the sown or natural grass was there in any farmers possession any remainder from the year worth taking into account in most places there was none at all  oats with me were not in a quantity more considerable than in commonly good seasons but i have never known them heavier than they were in other places the oat was not only an heavy but an uncommonly abundant crop  my ground under pease did not exceed an acre or thereabouts but the crop was great indeed i believe it is throughout the country exuberant it is however to be remarked as generally of all the grains so particularly of the pease that there was not the smallest quantity in reserve  the demand of the year must depend solely on its own produce and the price of the spring corn is not to be expected to fall very soon or at any time very low  uxbridge is a great corn market as i came through that town i found that at the last marketday barley was at forty shillings a quarter oats there were literally none and the innkeeper was obliged to send for them to london i forgot to ask about pease potatoes were 5s the bushel  in the debate on this subject in the house i am told that a leading member of great ability little conversant in these matters observed that the general uniform dearness of butchers meat butter and cheese could not be owing to a defective produce of wheat and on this ground insinuated a suspicion of some unfair practice on the subject that called for inquiry  unquestionably the mere deficiency of wheat could not cause the dearness of the other articles which extends not only to the provisions he mentioned but to every other without exception  the cause is indeed so very plain and obvious that the wonder is the other way when a properly directed inquiry is made the gentlemen who are amazed at the price of these commodities will find that when hay is at six pound a load as they must know it is herbage and for more than one year must be scanty and they will conclude that if grass be scarce beef veal mutton butter milk and cheese must be dear  but to take up the matter somewhat more in detailif the wheat harvest in 1794 excellent in quality was defective in quantity the barley harvest was in quality ordinary enough and in quantity deficient this was soon felt in the price of malt  another article of produce beans was not at all plentiful the crop of pease was wholly destroyed so that several farmers pretty early gave up all hopes on that head and cut the green haulm as fodder for the cattle then perishing for want of food in that dry and burning summer i myself came off better than most i had about the fourth of a crop of pease  it will be recollected that in a manner all the bacon and pork consumed in this country the far largest consumption of meat out of towns is when growing fed on grass and on whey or skimmed milkand when fatting partly on the latter this is the case in the dairy countries all of them great breeders and feeders of swine but for the much greater part and in all the corn countries they are fattened on beans barleymeal and pease when the food of the animal is scarce his flesh must be dear this one would suppose would require no great penetration to discover  this failure of so very large a supply of flesh in one species naturally throws the whole demand of the consumer on the diminished supply of all kinds of flesh and indeed on all the matters of human sustenance nor in my opinion are we to expect a greater cheapness in that article for this year even though corn should grow cheaper as it is to be hoped it will the store swine from the failure of subsistence last year are now at an extravagant price pigs at our fairs have sold lately for fifty shillings which two years ago would not have brought more than twenty  as to sheep none i thought were strangers to the general failure of the article of turnips last year the early having been burned as they came up by the great drought and heat the late and those of the early which had escaped were destroyed by the chilling frosts of the winter and the wet and severe weather of the spring in many places a full fourth of the sheep or the lambs were lost what remained of the lambs were poor and ill fed the ewes having had no milk the calves came late and they were generally an article the want of which was as much to be dreaded as any other so that article of food formerly so abundant in the early part of the summer particularly in london and which in a great part supplied the place of mutton for near two months did little less than totally fail  all the productions of the earth link in with each other all the sources of plenty in all and every article were dried or frozen up the scarcity was not as gentlemen seem to suppose in wheat only  another cause and that not of inconsiderable operation tended to produce a scarcity in flesh provision it is one that on many accounts cannot be too much regretted and the rather as it was the sole cause of a scarcity in that article which arose from the proceedings of men themselves i mean the stop put to the distillery  the hogs and that would be sufficient which were fed with the waste wash of that produce did not demand the fourth part of the corn used by farmers in fattening them the spirit was nearly so much clear gain to the nation it is an odd way of making flesh cheap to stop or check the distillery  the distillery in itself produces an immense article of trade almost all over the worldto africa to north america and to various parts of europe it is of great use next to food itself to our fisheries and to our whole navigation a great part of the distillery was carried on by damaged corn unfit for bread and by barley and malt of the lowest quality these things could not be more unexceptionably employed the domestic consumption of spirits produced without complaints a very great revenue applicable if we pleased in bounties to the bringing corn from other places far beyond the value of that consumed in making it or to the encouragement of its increased production at home  as to what is said in a physical and moral view against the home consumption of spirits experience has long since taught me very little to respect the declamations on that subject whether the thunder of the laws or the thunder of eloquence is hurled on gin always i am thunderproof the alembic in my mind has furnished to the world a far greater benefit and blessing than if the opus maximum had been really found by chemistry and like midas we could turn everything into gold  undoubtedly there may be a dangerous abuse in the excess of spirits and at one time i am ready to believe the abuse was great when spirits are cheap the business of drunkenness is achieved with little time or labor but that evil i consider to be wholly done away observation for the last forty years and very particularly for the last thirty has furnished me with ten instances of drunkenness from other causes for one from this ardent spirit is a great medicine often to remove distempers much more frequently to prevent them or to chase them away in their beginnings it is not nutritive in any great degree but if not food it greatly alleviates the want of it it invigorates the stomach for the digestion of poor meagre diet not easily alliable to the human constitution wine the poor cannot touch beer as applied to many occasions as among seamen and fishermen for instance will by no means do the business let me add what wits inspired with champagne and claret will turn into ridiculeit is a medicine for the mind under the pressure of the cares and sorrows of our mortal condition men have at all times and in all countries called in some physical aid to their moral consolationswine beer opium brandy or tobacco  i consider therefore the stopping of the distillery economically financially commercially medicinally and in some degree morally too as a measure rather well meant than well considered it is too precious a sacrifice to prejudice  gentlemen well know whether there be a scarcity of partridges and whether that be an effect of hoarding and combination all the tame race of birds live and die as the wild do  as to the lesser articles they are like the greater they have followed the fortune of the season why are fowls dear was not this the farmers or jobbers fault i sold from my yard to a jobber six young and lean fowls for fourandtwenty shillingsfowls for which two years ago the same man would not have given a shilling apiece he sold them afterwards at uxbridge and they were taken to london to receive the last hand  as to the operation of the war in causing the scarcity of provisions i understand that mr pitt has given a particular answer to it but i do not think it worth powder and shot  i do not wonder the papers are so full of this sort of matter but i am a little surprised it should be mentioned in parliament like all great state questions peace and war may be discussed and different opinions fairly formed on political grounds but on a question of the present price of provisions when peace with the regicides is always uppermost i can only say that great is the love of it  after all have we not reason to be thankful to the giver of all good in our history and when the laborer of england is said to have been once happy we find constantly after certain intervals a period of real famine by which a melancholy havoc was made among the human race the price of provisions fluctuated dreadfully demonstrating a deficiency very different from the worst failures of the present moment never since i have known england have i known more than a comparative scarcity the price of wheat taking a number of years together has had no very considerable fluctuation nor has it risen exceedingly until within this twelvemonth even now i do not know of one man woman or child that has perished from famine fewer if any i believe than in years of plenty when such a thing may happen by accident this is owing to a care and superintendence of the poor far greater than any i remember  the consideration of this ought to bind us all rich and poor together against those wicked writers of the newspapers who would inflame the poor against their friends guardians patrons and protectors not only very few i have observed that i know of none though i live in a place as poor as most have actually died of want but we have seen no traces of those dreadful exterminating epidemics which in consequence of scanty and unwholesome food in former times not unfrequently wasted whole nations let us be saved from too much wisdom of our own and we shall do tolerably well  it is one of the finest problems in legislation and what has often engaged my thoughts whilst i followed that professionwhat the state ought to take upon itself to direct by the public wisdom and what it ought to leave with as little interference as possible to individual discretion nothing certainly can be laid down on the subject that will not admit of exceptionsmany permanent some occasional but the clearest line of distinction which i could draw whilst i had my chalk to draw any line was this that the state ought to confine itself to what regards the state or the creatures of the state namely the exterior establishment of its religion its magistracy its revenue its military force by sea and land the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat in a word to everything that is truly and properly publicto the public peace to the public safety to the public order to the public prosperity in its preventive police it ought to be sparing of its efforts and to employ means rather few unfrequent and strong than many and frequent and of course as they multiply their puny politic race and dwindle small and feeble statesmen who know themselves will with the dignity which belongs to wisdom proceed only in this the superior orb and first mover of their duty steadily vigilantly severely courageously whatever remains will in a manner provide for itself but as they descend from the state to a province from a province to a parish and from a parish to a private house they go on accelerated in their fall they cannot do the lower duty and in proportion as they try it they will certainly fail in the higher they ought to know the different departments of thingswhat belongs to laws and what manners alone can regulate to these great politicians may give a leaning but they cannot give a law  our legislature has fallen into this fault as well as other governments all have fallen into it more or less the once mighty state which was nearest to us locally nearest to us in every way and whose ruins threaten to fall upon our heads is a strong instance of this error i can never quote france without a foreboding sighΈΣΣΕΤΑΙ ΉΜΑΡ scipio said it to his recording greek friend amidst the flames of the great rival of his country that state has fallen by the hands of the parricides of their country called the revolutionists and constitutionalists of france a species of traitors of whose fury and atrocious wickedness nothing in the annals of the frenzy and depravation of mankind had before furnished an example and of whom i can never think or speak without a mixed sensation of disgust of horror and of detestation not easy to be expressed these nefarious monsters destroyed their country for what was good in it for much good there was in the constitution of that noble monarchy which in all kinds formed and nourished great men and great patterns of virtue to the world but though its enemies were not enemies to its faults its faults furnished them with means for its destruction my dear departed friend whose loss is even greater to the public than to me had often remarked that the leading vice of the french monarchy which he had well studied was in good intention illdirected and a restless desire of governing too much the hand of authority was seen in everything and in every place all therefore that happened amiss in the course even of domestic affairs was attributed to the government and as it always happens in this kind of officious universal interference what began in odious power ended always i may say without an exception in contemptible imbecility for this reason as far as i can approve of any novelty i thought well of the provincial administrations those if the superior power had been severe and vigilant and vigorous might have been of much use politically in removing government from many invidious details but as everything is good or bad as it is related or combined government being relaxed above as it was relaxed below and the brains of the people growing more and more addle with every sort of visionary speculation the shiftings of the scene in the provincial theatres became only preparatives to a revolution in the kingdom and the popular actings there only the rehearsals of the terrible drama of the republic  tyranny and cruelty may make men justly wish the downfall of abused powers but i believe that no government ever yet perished from any other direct cause than its own weakness my opinion is against an overdoing of any sort of administration and more especially against this most momentous of all meddling on the part of authoritythe meddling with the subsistence of the people     a  letter to a noble lord  on  the attacks made upon mr burke and his pension in the house of lords  by  the duke of bedford and the earl of lauderdale  early in the present session of parliament  1796     letter   my lordi could hardly flatter myself with the hope that so very early in the season i should have to acknowledge obligations to the duke of bedford and to the earl of lauderdale these noble persons have lost no time in conferring upon me that sort of honor which it is alone within their competence and which it is certainly most congenial to their nature and their manners to bestow  to be ill spoken of in whatever language they speak by the zealots of the new sect in philosophy and politics of which these noble persons think so charitably and of which others think so justly to me is no matter of uneasiness or surprise to have incurred the displeasure of the duke of orleans or the duke of bedford to fall under the censure of citizen brissot or of his friend the earl of lauderdale i ought to consider as proofs not the least satisfactory that i have produced some part of the effect i proposed by my endeavors i have labored hard to earn what the noble lords are generous enough to pay personal offence i have given them none the part they take against me is from zeal to the cause it is wellit is perfectly well i have to do homage to their justice i have to thank the bedfords and the lauderdales for having so faithfully and so fully acquitted towards me whatever arrear of debt was left undischarged by the priestleys and the paines  some perhaps may think them executors in their own wrong i at least have nothing to complain of they have gone beyond the demands of justice they have been a little perhaps beyond their intention favorable to me they have been the means of bringing out by their invectives the handsome things which lord grenville has had the goodness and condescension to say in my behalf retired as i am from the world and from all its affairs and all its pleasures i confess it does kindle in my nearly extinguished feelings a very vivid satisfaction to be so attacked and so commended it is soothing to my wounded mind to be commended by an able vigorous and wellinformed statesman and at the very moment when he stands forth with a manliness and resolution worthy of himself and of his cause for the preservation of the person and government of our sovereign and therein for the security of the laws the liberties the morals and the lives of his people to be in any fair way connected with such things is indeed a distinction no philosophy can make me above it no melancholy can depress me so low as to make me wholly insensible to such an honor  why will they not let me remain in obscurity and inaction are they apprehensive that if an atom of me remains the sect has something to fear must i be annihilated lest like old john ziscas my skin might be made into a drum to animate europe to eternal battle against a tyranny that threatens to overwhelm all europe and all the human race  my lord it is a subject of awful meditation before this of france the annals of all time have not furnished an instance of a complete revolution that revolution seems to have extended even to the constitution of the mind of man it has this of wonderful in it that it resembles what lord verulam says of the operations of nature it was perfect not only in its elements and principles but in all its members and its organs from the very beginning the moral scheme of france furnishes the only pattern ever known which they who admire will instantly resemble it is indeed an inexhaustible repertory of one kind of examples in my wretched condition though hardly to be classed with the living i am not safe from them they have tigers to fall upon animated strength they have hyenas to prey upon carcasses the national menagerie is collected by the first physiologists of the time and it is defective in no description of savage nature they pursue even such as me into the obscurest retreats and haul them before their revolutionary tribunals neither sex nor age nor the sanctuary of the tomb is sacred to them they have so determined a hatred to all privileged orders that they deny even to the departed the sad immunities of the grave they are not wholly without an object their turpitude purveys to their malice and they unplumb the dead for bullets to assassinate the living if all revolutionists were not proof against all caution i should recommend it to their consideration that no persons were ever known in history either sacred or profane to vex the sepulchre and by their sorceries to call up the prophetic dead with any other event than the prediction of their own disastrous fateleave me oh leave me to repose  in one thing i can excuse the duke of bedford for his attack upon me and my mortuary pension he cannot readily comprehend the transaction he condemns what i have obtained was the fruit of no bargain the production of no intrigue the result of no compromise the effect of no solicitation the first suggestion of it never came from me mediately or immediately to his majesty or any of his ministers it was long known that the instant my engagements would permit it and before the heaviest of all calamities had forever condemned me to obscurity and sorrow i had resolved on a total retreat i had executed that design i was entirely out of the way of serving or of hurting any statesman or any party when the ministers so generously and so nobly carried into effect the spontaneous bounty of the crown both descriptions have acted as became them when i could no longer serve them the ministers have considered my situation when i could no longer hurt them the revolutionists have trampled on my infirmity my gratitude i trust is equal to the manner in which the benefit was conferred it came to me indeed at a time of life and in a state of mind and body in which no circumstance of fortune could afford me any real pleasure but this was no fault in the royal donor or in his ministers who were pleased in acknowledging the merits of an invalid servant of the public to assuage the sorrows of a desolate old man  it would ill become me to boast of anything it would as ill become me thus called upon to depreciate the value of a long life spent with unexampled toil in the service of my country since the total body of my services on account of the industry which was shown in them and the fairness of my intentions have obtained the acceptance of my sovereign it would be absurd in me to range myself on the side of the duke of bedford and the corresponding society or as far as in me lies to permit a dispute on the rate at which the authority appointed by our constitution to estimate such things has been pleased to set them  loose libels ought to be passed by in silence and contempt by me they have been so always i knew that as long as i remained in public i should live down the calumnies of malice and the judgments of ignorance if i happened to be now and then in the wrong as who is not like all other men i must bear the consequence of my faults and my mistakes the libels of the present day are just of the same stuff as the libels of the past but they derive an importance from the rank of the persons they come from and the gravity of the place where they were uttered in some way or other i ought to take some notice of them to assert myself thus traduced is not vanity or arrogance it is a demand of justice it is a demonstration of gratitude if i am unworthy the ministers are worse than prodigal on that hypothesis i perfectly agree with the duke of bedford  for whatever i have been i am now no more i put myself on my country i ought to be allowed a reasonable freedom because i stand upon my deliverance and no culprit ought to plead in irons even in the utmost latitude of defensive liberty i wish to preserve all possible decorum whatever it may be in the eyes of these noble persons themselves to me their situation calls for the most profound respect if i should happen to trespass a little which i trust i shall not let it always be supposed that a confusion of characters may produce mistakesthat in the masquerades of the grand carnival of our age whimsical adventures happen odd things are said and pass off if i should fail a single point in the high respect i owe to those illustrious persons i cannot be supposed to mean the duke of bedford and the earl of lauderdale of the house of peers but the duke of bedford and the earl of lauderdale of palace yardthe dukes and earls of brentford there they are on the pavement there they seem to come nearer to my humble level and virtually at least to have waived their high privilege  making this protestation i refuse all revolutionary tribunals where men have been put to death for no other reason than that they had obtained favors from the crown i claim not the letter but the spirit of the old english lawthat is to be tried by my peers i decline his graces jurisdiction as a judge i challenge the duke of bedford as a juror to pass upon the value of my services whatever his natural parts may be i cannot recognize in his few and idle years the competence to judge of my long and laborious life if i can help it he shall not be on the inquest of my quantum meruit poor rich man he can hardly know anything of public industry in its exertions or can estimate its compensations when its work is done i have no doubt of his graces readiness in all the calculations of vulgar arithmetic but i shrewdly suspect that he is little studied in the theory of moral proportions and has never learned the rule of three in the arithmetic of policy and state  his grace thinks i have obtained too much i answer that my exertions whatever they have been were such as no hopes of pecuniary reward could possibly excite and no pecuniary compensation can possibly reward them between money and such services if done by abler men than i am there is no common principle of comparison they are quantities incommensurable money is made for the comfort and convenience of animal life it cannot be a reward for what mere animal life must indeed sustain but never can inspire with submission to his grace i have not had more than sufficient as to any noble use i trust i know how to employ as well as he a much greater fortune than he possesses in a more confined application i certainly stand in need of every kind of relief and easement much more than he does when i say i have not received more than i deserve is this the language i hold to majesty no far very far from it before that presence i claim no merit at all everything towards me is favor and bounty one style to a gracious benefactor another to a proud and insulting foe  his grace is pleased to aggravate my guilt by charging my acceptance of his majestys grant as a departure from my ideas and the spirit of my conduct with regard to economy if it be my ideas of economy wore false and illfounded but they are the duke of bedfords ideas of economy i have contradicted and not my own if he means to allude to certain bills brought in by me on a message from the throne in 1782 i tell him that there is nothing in my conduct that can contradict either the letter or the spirit of those acts does he mean the payoffice act i take it for granted he does not the act to which he alludes is i suppose the establishment act i greatly doubt whether his grace has ever read the one or the other the first of these systems cost me with every assistance which my then situation gave me pains incredible i found an opinion common through all the offices and general in the public at large that it would prove impossible to reform and methodize the office of paymastergeneral i undertook it however and i succeeded in my undertaking whether the military service or whether the general economy of our finances have profited by that act i leave to those who are acquainted with the army and with the treasury to judge  an opinion full as general prevailed also at the same time that nothing could be done for the regulation of the civil list establishment the very attempt to introduce method into it and any limitations to its services was held absurd i had not seen the man who so much as suggested one economical principle or an economical expedient upon that subject nothing but coarse amputation or coarser taxation were then talked of both of them without design combination or the least shadow of principle blind and headlong zeal or factious fury were the whole contribution brought by the most noisy on that occasion towards the satisfaction of the public or the relief of the crown  let me tell my youthful censor that the necessities of that time required something very different from what others then suggested or what his grace now conceives let me inform him that it was one of the most critical periods in our annals  astronomers have supposed that if a certain comet whose path intersected the ecliptic had met the earth in some i forgot what sign it would have whirled us along with it in its eccentric course into god knows what regions of heat and cold had the portentous comet of the rights of man which from its horrid hair shakes pestilence and war and with fear of change perplexes monarchs had that comet crossed upon us in that internal state of england nothing human could have prevented our being irresistibly hurried out of the highway of heaven into all the vices crimes horrors and miseries of the french revolution  happily france was not then jacobinized her hostility was at a good distance we had a limb cut off but we preserved the body we lost our colonies but we kept our constitution there was indeed much intestine heat there was a dreadful fermentation wild and savage insurrection quitted the woods and prowled about our streets in the name of reform such was the distemper of the public mind that there was no madman in his maddest ideas and maddest projects who might not count upon numbers to support his principles and execute his designs  many of the changes by a great misnomer called parliamentary reforms went not in the intention of all the professors and supporters of them undoubtedly but went in their certain and in my opinion not very remote effect home to the utter destruction of the constitution of this kingdom had they taken place not france but england would have had the honor of leading up the deathdance of democratic revolution other projects exactly coincident in time with those struck at the very existence of the kingdom under any constitution there are who remember the blind fury of some and the lamentable helplessness of others here a torpid confusion from a panic fear of the dangerthere the same inaction from a stupid insensibility to it here wellwishers to the mischiefthere indifferent lookerson at the same time a sort of national convention dubious in its nature and perilous in its example nosed parliament in the very seat of its authoritysat with a sort of superintendence over itand little less than dictated to it not only laws but the very form and essence of legislature itself in ireland things ran in a still more eccentric course government was unnerved confounded and in a manner suspended its equipoise was totally gone i do not mean to speak disrespectfully of lord north he was a man of admirable parts of general knowledge of a versatile understanding fitted for every sort of business of infinite wit and pleasantry of a delightful temper and with a mind most perfectly disinterested but it would be only to degrade myself by a weak adulation and not to honor the memory of a great man to deny that he wanted something of the vigilance and spirit of command that the time required indeed a darkness next to the fog of this awful day lowered over the whole region for a little time the helm appeared abandoned      ipse diem noctemque negat discernere cœlo     nec meminisse viæ mediâ palinurus in undâ  at that time i was connected with men of high place in the community they loved liberty as much as the duke of bedford can do and they understood it at least as well perhaps their politics as usual took a tincture from their character and they cultivated what they loved the liberty they pursued was a liberty inseparable from order from virtue from morals and from religionand was neither hypocritically nor fanatically followed they did not wish that liberty in itself one of the first of blessings should in its perversion become the greatest curse which could fall upon mankind to preserve the constitution entire and practically equal to all the great ends of its formation not in one single part but in all its parts was to them the first object popularity and power they regarded alike these were with them only different means of obtaining that object and had no preference over each other in their minds but as one or the other might afford a surer or a less certain prospect of arriving at that end it is some consolation to me in the cheerless gloom which darkens the evening of my life that with them i commenced my political career and never for a moment in reality nor in appearance for any length of time was separated from their good wishes and good opinion  by what accident it matters not nor upon what desert but just then and in the midst of that hunt of obloquy which ever has pursued me with a full cry through life i had obtained a very considerable degree of public confidence i know well enough how equivocal a test this kind of popular opinion forms of the merit that obtained it i am no stranger to the insecurity of its tenure i do not boast of it it is mentioned to show not how highly i prize the thing but my right to value the use i made of it i endeavored to turn that shortlived advantage to myself into a permanent benefit to my country far am i from detracting from the merit of some gentlemen out of office or in it on that occasion no it is not my way to refuse a full and heaped measure of justice to the aids that i receive i have through life been willing to give everything to othersand to reserve nothing for myself but the inward conscience that i had omitted no pains to discover to animate to discipline to direct the abilities of the country for its service and to place them in the best light to improve their age or to adorn it this conscience i have i have never suppressed any man never checked him for a moment in his course by any jealousy or by any policy i was always ready to the height of my means and they wore always infinitely below my desires to forward those abilities which overpowered my own he is an illfurnished undertaker who has no machinery but his own hands to work with poor in my own faculties i ever thought myself rich in theirs in that period of difficulty and danger more especially i consulted and sincerely coöperated with men of all parties who seemed disposed to the same ends or to any main part of them nothing to prevent disorder was omitted when it appeared nothing to subdue it was left uncounselled nor unexecuted as far as i could prevail at the time i speak of and having a momentary lead so aided and so encouraged and as a feeble instrument in a mighty handi do not say i saved my country i am sure i did my country important service there were few indeed that did not at that time acknowledge itand that time was thirteen years ago it was but one voice that no man in the kingdom better deserved an honorable provision should be made for him so much for my general conduct through the whole of the portentous crisis from 1780 to 1782 and the general sense then entertained of that conduct by my country but my character as a reformer in the particular instances which the duke of bedford refers to is so connected in principle with my opinions on the hideous changes which have since barbarized france and spreading thence threaten the political and moral order of the whole world that it seems to demand something of a more detailed discussion  my economical reforms were not as his grace may think the suppression of a paltry pension or employment more or less economy in my plans was as it ought to be secondary subordinate instrumental i acted on state principles i found a great distemper in the commonwealth and according to the nature of the evil and of the object i treated it the malady was deep it was complicated in the causes and in the symptoms throughout it was full of contraindicants on one hand government daily growing more invidious from an apparent increase of the means of strength was every day growing more contemptible by real weakness nor was this dissolution confined to government commonly so called it extended to parliament which was losing not a little in its dignity and estimation by an opinion of its not acting on worthy motives on the other hand the desires of the people partly natural and partly infused into them by art appeared in so wild and inconsiderate a manner with regard to the economical object for i set aside for a moment the dreadful tampering with the body of the constitution itself that if their petitions had literally been complied with the state would have been convulsed and a gate would have been opened through which all property might be sacked and ravaged nothing could have saved the public from the mischiefs of the false reform but its absurdity which would soon have brought itself and with it all real reform into discredit this would have left a rankling wound in the hearts of the people who would know they had failed in the accomplishment of their wishes but who like the rest of mankind in all ages would impute the blame to anything rather than to their own proceedings but there were then persons in the world who nourished complaint and would have been thoroughly disappointed if the people were ever satisfied i was not of that humor i wished that they should be satisfied it was my aim to give to the people the substance of what i knew they desired and what i thought was right whether they desired it or not before it had been modified for them into senseless petitions i knew that there is a manifest marked distinction which ill men with ill designs or weak men incapable of any design will constantly be confoundingthat is a marked distinction between change and reformation the former alters the substance of the objects themselves and gets rid of all their essential good as well as of all the accidental evil annexed to them change is novelty and whether it is to operate any one of the effects of reformation at all or whether it may not contradict the very principle upon which reformation is desired cannot be certainly known beforehand reform is not a change in the substance or in the primary modification of the object but a direct application of a remedy to the grievance complained of so far as that is removed all is sure it stops there and if it fails the substance which underwent the operation at the very worst is but where it was  all this in effect i think but am not sure i have said elsewhere it cannot at this time be too often repeated line upon line precept upon precept until it comes into the currency of a proverbto innovate is not to reform the french revolutionists complained of everything they refused to reform anything and they left nothing no nothing at all unchanged the consequences are before usnot in remote history not in future prognostication they are about us they are upon us they shake the public security they menace private enjoyment they dwarf the growth of the young they break the quiet of the old if we travel they stop our way they infest us in town they pursue us to the country our business is interrupted our repose is troubled our pleasures are saddened our very studies are poisoned and perverted and knowledge is rendered worse than ignorance by the enormous evils of this dreadful innovation the revolution harpies of france sprung from night and hell or from that chaotic anarchy which generates equivocally all monstrous all prodigious things cuckoolike adulterously lay their eggs and brood over and hatch them in the nest of every neighboring state these obscene harpies who deck themselves in i know not what divine attributes but who in reality are foul and ravenous birds of prey both mothers and daughters flutter over our heads and souse down upon our tables and leave nothing unrent unrifled unravaged or unpolluted with the slime of their filthy offal15  if his grace can contemplate the result of this complete innovation or as some friends of his will call it reform in the whole body of its solidity and compound mass at which as hamlet says the face of heaven glows with horror and indignation and which in truth makes every reflecting mind and every feeling heart perfectly thoughtsick without a thorough abhorrence of everything they say and everything they do i am amazed at the morbid strength or the natural infirmity of his mind  it was then not my love but my hatred to innovation that produced my plan of reform without troubling myself with the exactness of the logical diagram i considered them as things substantially opposite it was to prevent that evil that i proposed the measures which his grace is pleased and i am not sorry he is pleased to recall to my recollection i had what i hope that noble duke will remember in all his operations a state to preserve as well as a state to reform i had a people to gratify but not to inflame or to mislead i do not claim half the credit for what i did as for what i prevented from being done in that situation of the public mind i did not undertake as was then proposed to newmodel the house of commons or the house of lords or to change the authority under which any officer of the crown acted who was suffered at all to exist crown lords commons judicial system system of administration existed as they had existed before and in the mode and manner in which they had always existed my measures were what i then truly stated them to the house to be in their intent healing and mediatorial a complaint was made of too much influence in the house of commons i reduced it in both houses and i gave my reasons article by article for every reduction and showed why i thought it safe for the service of the state i heaved the lead every inch of way i made a disposition to expense was complained of to that i opposed not mere retrenchment but a system of economy which would make a random expense without plan or foresight in future not easily practicable i proceeded upon principles of research to put me in possession of my matter on principles of method to regulate it and on principles in the human mind and in civil affairs to secure and perpetuate the operation i conceived nothing arbitrarily nor proposed anything to be done by the will and pleasure of others or my ownbut by reason and by reason only i have ever abhorred since the first dawn of my understanding to this its obscure twilight all the operations of opinion fancy inclination and will in the affairs of government where only a sovereign reason paramount to all forms of legislation and administration should dictate government is made for the very purpose of opposing that reason to will and to caprice in the reformers or in the reformed in the governors or in the governed in kings in senates or in people  on a careful review therefore and analysis of all the component parts of the civil list and on weighing them against each other in order to make as much as possible all of them a subject of estimate the foundation and cornerstone of all regular provident economy it appeared to me evident that this was impracticable whilst that part called the pension list was totally discretionary in its amount for this reason and for this only i proposed to reduce it both in its gross quantity and in its larger individual proportions to a certainty lest if it were left without a general limit it might eat up the civil list serviceif suffered to be granted in portions too great for the fund it might defeat its own end and by unlimited allowances to some it might disable the crown in means of providing for others the pension list was to be kept as a sacred fund but it could not be kept as a constant open fund sufficient for growing demands if some demands would wholly devour it the tenor of the act will show that it regarded the civil list only the reduction of which to some sort of estimate was my great object  no other of the crown funds did i meddle with because they had not the same relations this of the four and a half per cents does his grace imagine had escaped me or had escaped all the men of business who acted with me in those regulations i knew that such a fund existed and that pensions had been always granted on it before his grace was born this fund was full in my eye it was full in the eyes of those who worked with me it was left on principle on principle i did what was then done and on principle what was left undone was omitted i did not dare to rob the nation of all funds to reward merit if i pressed this point too close i acted contrary to the avowed principles on which i went gentlemen are very fond of quoting me but if any one thinks it worth his while to know the rules that guided me in my plan of reform he will read my printed speech on that subject at least what is contained from page 230 to page 241 in the second volume of the collection16 which a friend has given himself the trouble to make of my publications be this as it may these two bills though achieved with the greatest labor and management of every sort both within and without the house were only a part and but a small part of a very large system comprehending all the objects i stated in opening my proposition and indeed many more which i just hinted at in my speech to the electors of bristol when i was put out of that representation all these in some state or other of forwardness i have long had by me  but do i justify his majestys grace on these grounds i think them the least of my services the time gave them an occasional value what i have done in the way of political economy was far from confined to this body of measures i did not come into parliament to con my lesson i had earned my pension before i set my foot in st stephens chapel i was prepared and disciplined to this political warfare the first session i sat in parliament i found it necessary to analyze the whole commercial financial constitutional and foreign interests of great britain and its empire a great deal was then done and more far more would have been done if more had been permitted by events then in the vigor of my manhood my constitution sunk under my labor had i then died and i seemed to myself very near death i had then earned for those who belonged to me more than the duke of bedfords ideas of service are of power to estimate but in truth these services i am called to account for are not those on which i value myself the most if i were to call for a reward which i have never done it should be for those in which for fourteen years without intermission i showed the most industry and had the least success i mean in the affairs of india they are those on which i value myself the most most for the importance most for the labor most for the judgment most for constancy and perseverance in the pursuit others may value them most for the intention in that surely they are not mistaken  does his grace think that they who advised the crown to make my retreat easy considered me only as an economist that well understood however is a good deal if i had not deemed it of some value i should not have made political economy an object of my humble studies from my very early youth to near the end of my service in parliament even before at least to any knowledge of mine it had employed the thoughts of speculative men in other parts of europe at that time it was still in its infancy in england where in the last century it had its origin great and learned men thought my studies were not wholly thrown away and deigned to communicate with me now and then on some particulars of their immortal works something of these studies may appear incidentally in some of the earliest things i published the house has been witness to their effect and has profited of them more or less for above eightandtwenty years  to their estimate i leave the matter i was not like his grace of bedford swaddled and rocked and dandled into a legislator nitor in adversum is the motto for a man like me i possessed not one of the qualities nor cultivated one of the arts that recommend men to the favor and protection of the great i was not made for a minion or a tool as little did i follow the trade of winning the hearts by imposing on the understandings of the people at every step of my progress in life for in every step was i traversed and opposed and at every turnpike i met i was obliged to show my passport and again and again to prove my sole title to the honor of being useful to my country by a proof that i was not wholly unacquainted with its laws and the whole system of its interests both abroad and at home otherwise no rank no toleration even for me i had no arts but manly arts on them i have stood and please god in spite of the duke of bedford and the earl of lauderdale to the last gasp will i stand  had his grace condescended to inquire concerning the person whom he has not thought it below him to reproach he might have found that in the whole course of my life i have never on any pretence of economy or on any other pretence so much as in a single instance stood between any man and his reward of service or his encouragement in useful talent and pursuit from the highest of those services and pursuits to the lowest on the contrary i have on an hundred occasions exerted myself with singular zeal to forward every mans even tolerable pretensions i have more than once had goodnatured reprehensions from my friends for carrying the matter to something bordering on abuse this line of conduct whatever its merits might be was partly owing to natural disposition but i think full as much to reason and principle i looked on the consideration of public service or public ornament to be real and very justice and i ever held a scanty and penurious justice to partake of the nature of a wrong i held it to be in its consequences the worst economy in the world in saving money i soon can count up all the good i do but when by a cold penury i blast the abilities of a nation and stunt the growth of its active energies the ill i may do is beyond all calculation whether it be too much or too little whatever i have done has been general and systematic i have never entered into those trifling vexations and oppressive details that have been falsely and most ridiculously laid to my charge  did i blame the pensions given to mr barré and mr dunning between the proposition and execution of my plan no surely no those pensions were within my principles i assert it those gentlemen deserved their pensions their titlesall they had and if more they had i should have been but pleased the more they were men of talents they were men of service i put the profession of the law out of the question in one of them it is a service that rewards itself but their public service though from their abilities unquestionably of more value than mine in its quantity and in its duration was not to be mentioned with it but i never could drive a hard bargain in my life concerning any matter whatever and least of all do i know how to haggle and huckster with merit pension for myself i obtained none nor did i solicit any yet i was loaded with hatred for everything that was withheld and with obloquy for everything that was given i was thus left to support the grants of a name ever dear to me and ever venerable to the world in favor of those who were no friends of mine or of his against the rude attacks of those who were at that time friends to the grantees and their own zealous partisans i have never heard the earl of lauderdale complain of these pensions he finds nothing wrong till he comes to me this is impartiality in the true modern revolutionary style  whatever i did at that time so far as it regarded order and economy is stable and eternal as all principles must be a particular order of things may be altered order itself cannot lose its value as to other particulars they are variable by time and by circumstances laws of regulation are not fundamental laws the public exigencies are the masters of all such laws they rule the laws and are not to be ruled by them they who exercise the legislative power at the time must judge  it may be new to his grace but i beg leave to tell him that mere parsimony is not economy it is separable in theory from it and in fact it may or it may not be a part of economy according to circumstances expense and great expense may be an essential part in true economy if parsimony were to be considered as one of the kinds of that virtue there is however another and an higher economy economy is a distributive virtue and consists not in saving but in selection parsimony requires no providence no sagacity no powers of combination no comparison no judgment mere instinct and that not an instinct of the noblest kind may produce this false economy in perfection the other economy has larger views it demands a discriminating judgment and a firm sagacious mind it shuts one door to impudent importunity only to open another and a wider to unpresuming merit if none but meritorious service or real talent were to be rewarded this nation has not wanted and this nation will not want the means of rewarding all the service it ever will receive and encouraging all the merit it ever will produce no state since the foundation of society has been impoverished by that species of profusion had the economy of selection and proportion been at all times observed we should not now have had an overgrown duke of bedford to oppress the industry of humble men and to limit by the standard of his own conceptions the justice the bounty or if he pleases the charity of the crown  his grace may think as meanly as he will of my deserts in the far greater part of my conduct in life it is free for him to do so there will always be some difference of opinion in the value of political services but there is one merit of mine which he of all men living ought to be the last to call in question i have supported with very great zeal and i am told with some degree of success those opinions or if his grace likes another expression better those old prejudices which buoy up the ponderous mass of his nobility wealth and titles i have omitted no exertion to prevent him and them from sinking to that level to which the meretricious french faction his grace at least coquets with omit no exertion to reduce both i have done all i could to discountenance their inquiries into the fortunes of those who hold large portions of wealth without any apparent merit of their own i have strained every nerve to keep the duke of bedford in that situation which alone makes him my superior your lordship has been a witness of the use he makes of that preëminence  but be it that this is virtue be it that there is virtue in this wellselected rigor yet all virtues are not equally becoming to all men and at all times there are crimes undoubtedly there are crimes which in all seasons of our existence ought to put a generous antipathy in actioncrimes that provoke an indignant justice and call forth a warm and animated pursuit but all things that concern what i may call the preventive police of morality all things merely rigid harsh and censorial the antiquated moralists at whose feet i was brought up would not have thought these the fittest matter to form the favorite virtues of young men of rank what might have been well enough and have been received with a veneration mixed with awe and terror from an old severe crabbed cato would have wanted something of propriety in the young scipios the ornament of the roman nobility in the flower of their life but the times the morals the masters the scholars have all undergone a thorough revolution it is a vile illiberal school this new french academy of the sansculottes there is nothing in it that is fit for a gentleman to learn  whatever its vogue may be i still flatter myself that the parents of the growing generation will be satisfied with what is to be taught to their children in westminster in eton or in winchester i still indulge the hope that no grown gentleman or nobleman of our time will think of finishing at mr thelwalls lecture whatever may have been left incomplete at the old universities of his country i would give to lord grenville and mr pitt for a motto what was said of a roman censor or prætor or what was he who in virtue of a senatusconsultum shut up certain academiescludere ludum impudentiæ jussit every honest father of a family in the kingdom will rejoice at the breakingup for the holidays and will pray that there may be a very long vacation in all such schools  the awful state of the time and not myself or my own justification is my true object in what i now write or in what i shall ever write or say it little signifies to the world what becomes of such things as me or even as the duke of bedford what i say about either of us is nothing more than a vehicle as you my lord will easily perceive to convey my sentiments on matters far more worthy of your attention it is when i stick to my apparent first subject that i ought to apologize not when i depart from it i therefore must beg your lordships pardon for again resuming it after this very short digressionassuring you that i shall never altogether lose sight of such matter as persons abler than i am may turn to some profit  the duke of bedford conceives that he is obliged to call the attention of the house of peers to his majestys grant to me which he considers as excessive and out of all bounds  i know not how it has happened but it really seems that whilst his grace was meditating his wellconsidered censure upon me he fell into a sort of sleep homer nods and the duke of bedford may dream and as dreams even his golden dreams are apt to be illpieced and incongruously put together his grace preserved his idea of reproach to me but took the subjectmatter from the crown grants to his own family this is the stuff of which his dreams are made in that way of putting things together his grace is perfectly in the right the grants to the house of russell were so enormous as not only to outrage economy but even to stagger credibility the duke of bedford is the leviathan among all the creatures of the crown he tumbles about his unwieldy bulk he plays and frolics in the ocean of the royal bounty huge as he is and whilst he lies floating many a rood he is still a creature his ribs his fins his whalebone his blubber the very spiracles through which he spouts a torrent of brine against his origin and covers me all over with the spray everything of him and about him is from the throne is it for him to question the dispensation of the royal favor  i really am at a loss to draw any sort of parallel between the public merits of his grace by which he justifies the grants he holds and these services of mine on the favorable construction of which i have obtained what his grace so much disapproves in private life i have not at all the honor of acquaintance with the noble duke but i ought to presume and it costs me nothing to do so that he abundantly deserves the esteem and love of all who live with him but as to public service why truly it would not be more ridiculous for me to compare myself in rank in fortune in splendid descent in youth strength or figure with the duke of bedford than to make a parallel between his services and my attempts to be useful to my country it would not be gross adulation but uncivil irony to say that he has any public merit of his own to keep alive the idea of the services by which his vast landed pensions were obtained my merits whatever they are are original and personal his are derivative it is his ancestor the original pensioner that has laid up this inexhaustible fund of merit which makes his grace so very delicate and exceptious about the merit of all other grantees of the crown had he permitted me to remain in quiet i should have said tis his estate thats enough it is his by law what have i to do with it or its history he would naturally have said on his side tis this mans fortune he is as good now as my ancestor was two hundred and fifty years ago i am a young man with very old pensions he is an old man with very young pensions thats all  why will his grace by attacking me force me reluctantly to compare my little merit with that which obtained from the crown those prodigies of profuse donation by which he tramples on the mediocrity of humble and laborious individuals i would willingly leave him to the heralds college which the philosophy of the sansculottes prouder by far than all the garters and norroys and clarencieux and rougedragons that ever pranced in a procession of what his friends call aristocrats and despots will abolish with contumely and scorn these historians recorders and blazoners of virtues and arms differ wholly from that other description of historians who never assign any act of politicians to a good motive these gentle historians on the contrary dip their pens in nothing but the milk of human kindness they seek no further for merit than the preamble of a patent or the inscription on a tomb with them every man created a peer is first an hero readymade they judge of every mans capacity for office by the offices he has filled and the more offices the more ability every general officer with them is a marlborough every statesman a burleigh every judge a murray or a yorke they who alive were laughed at or pitied by all their acquaintance make as good a figure as the best of them in the pages of guillim edmondson and collins  to these recorders so full of goodnature to the great and prosperous i would willingly leave the first baron russell and earl of bedford and the merits of his grants but the aulnager the weigher the meter of grants will not suffer us to acquiesce in the judgment of the prince reigning at the time when they were made they are never good to those who earn them well then since the new grantees have war made on them by the old and that the word of the sovereign is not to be taken let us turn our eyes to history in which great men have always a pleasure in contemplating the heroic origin of their house  the first peer of the name the first purchaser of the grants was a mr russell a person of an ancient gentlemans family raised by being a minion of henry the eighth as there generally is some resemblance of character to create these relations the favorite was in all likelihood much such another as his master the first of those immoderate grants was not taken from the ancient demesne of the crown but from the recent confiscation of the ancient nobility of the land the lion having sucked the blood of his prey threw the offal carcass to the jackal in waiting having tasted once the food of confiscation the favorites became fierce and ravenous this worthy favorites first grant was from the lay nobility the second infinitely improving on the enormity of the first was from the plunder of the church in truth his grace is somewhat excusable for his dislike to a grant like mine not only in its quantity but in its kind so different from his own  mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign his from henry the eighth  mine had not its fund in the murder of any innocent person of illustrious rank17 or in the pillage of any body of unoffending men his grants were from the aggregate and consolidated funds of judgments iniquitously legal and from possessions voluntarily surrendered by the lawful proprietors with the gibbet at their door  the merit of the grantee whom he derives from was that of being a prompt and greedy instrument of a levelling tyrant who oppressed all descriptions of his people but who fell with particular fury on everything that was great and noble mine has been in endeavoring to screen every man in every class from oppression and particularly in defending the high and eminent who in the bad times of confiscating princes confiscating chief governors or confiscating demagogues are the most exposed to jealousy avarice and envy  the merit of the original grantee of his graces pensions was in giving his hand to the work and partaking the spoil with a prince who plundered a part of the national church of his time and country mine was in defending the whole of the national church of my own time and my own country and the whole of the national churches of all countries from the principles and the examples which lead to ecclesiastical pillage thence to a contempt of all prescriptive titles thence to the pillage of all property and thence to universal desolation  the merit of the origin of his graces fortune was in being a favorite and chief adviser to a prince who left no liberty to their native country my endeavor was to obtain liberty for the municipal country in which i was born and for all descriptions and denominations in it mine was to support with unrelaxing vigilance every right every privilege every franchise in this my adopted my dearer and more comprehensive country and not only to preserve those rights in this chief seat of empire but in every nation in every land in every climate language and religion in the vast domain that still is under the protection and the larger that was once under the protection of the british crown  his founders merits were by arts in which he served his master and made his fortune to bring poverty wretchedness and depopulation on his country mine were under a benevolent prince in promoting the commerce manufactures and agriculture of his kingdomin which his majesty shows an eminent example who even in his amusements is a patriot and in hours of leisure an improver of his native soil  his founders merit was the merit of a gentleman raised by the arts of a court and the protection of a wolsey to the eminence of a great and potent lord his merit in that eminence was by instigating a tyrant to injustice to provoke a people to rebellion my merit was to awaken the sober part of the country that they might put themselves on their guard against any one potent lord or any greater number of potent lords or any combination of great leading men of any sort if ever they should attempt to proceed in the same courses but in the reverse orderthat is by instigating a corrupted populace to rebellion and through that rebellion introducing a tyranny yet worse than the tyranny which his graces ancestor supported and of which he profited in the manner we behold in the despotism of henry the eighth  the political merit of the first pensioner of his graces house was that of being concerned as a counsellor of state in advising and in his person executing the conditions of a dishonorable peace with francethe surrendering the fortress of boulogne then our outguard on the continent by that surrender calais the key of france and the bridle in the mouth of that power was not many years afterwards finally lost my merit has been in resisting the power and pride of france under any form of its rule but in opposing it with the greatest zeal and earnestness when that rule appeared in the worst form it could assumethe worst indeed which the prime cause and principle of all evil could possibly give it it was my endeavor by every means to excite a spirit in the house where i had the honor of a seat for carrying on with early vigor and decision the most clearly just and necessary war that this or any nation ever carried on in order to save my country from the iron yoke of its power and from the more dreadful contagion of its principlesto preserve while they can be preserved pure and untainted the ancient inbred integrity piety goodnature and goodhumor of the people of england from the dreadful pestilence which beginning in france threatens to lay waste the whole moral and in a great degree the whole physical world having done both in the focus of its most intense malignity  the labors of his graces founder merited the curses not loud but deep of the commons of england on whom he and his master had effected a complete parliamentary reform by making them in their slavery and humiliation the true and adequate representatives of a debased degraded and undone people my merits were in having had an active though not always an ostentatious share in every one act without exception of undisputed constitutional utility in my time and in having supported on all occasions the authority the efficiency and the privileges of the commons of great britain i ended my services by a recorded and fully reasoned assertion on their own journals of their constitutional rights and a vindication of their constitutional conduct i labored in all things to merit their inward approbation and along with the assistants of the largest the greatest and best of my endeavors i received their free unbiased public and solemn thanks  thus stands the account of the comparative merits of the crown grants which compose the duke of bedfords fortune as balanced against mine in the name of common sense why should the duke of bedford think that none but of the house of russell are entitled to the favor of the crown why should he imagine that no king of england has been capable of judging of merit but king henry the eighth indeed he will pardon me he is a little mistaken all virtue did not end in the first earl of bedford all discernment did not lose its vision when his creator closed his eyes let him remit his rigor on the disproportion between merit and reward in others and they will make no inquiry into the origin of his fortune they will regard with much more satisfaction as he will contemplate with infinitely more advantage whatever in his pedigree has been dulcified by an exposure to the influence of heaven in a long flow of generations from the hard acidulous metallic tincture of the spring it is little to be doubted that several of his forefathers in that long series have degenerated into honor and virtue let the duke of bedford i am sure he will reject with scorn and horror the counsels of the lecturers those wicked panders to avarice and ambition who would tempt him in the troubles of his country to seek another enormous fortune from the forfeitures of another nobility and the plunder of another church let him and i trust that yet he will employ all the energy of his youth and all the resources of his wealth to crush rebellious principles which have no foundation in morals and rebellious movements that have no provocation in tyranny  then will be forgot the rebellions which by a doubtful priority in crime his ancestor had provoked and extinguished on such a conduct in the noble duke many of his countrymen might and with some excuse might give way to the enthusiasm of their gratitude and in the dashing style of some of the old declaimers cry out that if the fates had found no other way in which they could give a18 duke of bedford and his opulence as props to a tottering world then the butchery of the duke of buckingham might be tolerated it might be regarded even with complacency whilst in the heir of confiscation they saw the sympathizing comforter of the martyrs who suffer under the cruel confiscation of this day whilst they beheld with admiration his zealous protection of the virtuous and loyal nobility of france and his manly support of his brethren the yet standing nobility and gentry of his native land then his graces merit would be pure and new and sharp as fresh from the mint of honor as he pleased he might reflect honor on his predecessors or throw it forward on those who were to succeed him he might be the propagator of the stock of honor or the root of it as he thought proper  had it pleased god to continue to me the hopes of succession i should have been according to my mediocrity and the mediocrity of the age i live in a sort of founder of a family i should have left a son who in all the points in which personal merit can be viewed in science in erudition in genius in taste in honor in generosity in humanity in every liberal sentiment and every liberal accomplishment would not have shown himself inferior to the duke of bedford or to any of those whom he traces in his line his grace very soon would have wanted all plausibility in his attack upon that provision which belonged more to mine than to me he would soon have supplied every deficiency and symmetrized every disproportion it would not have been for that successor to resort to any stagnant wasting reservoir of merit in me or in any ancestry he had in himself a salient living spring of generous and manly action every day he lived he would have repurchased the bounty of the crown and ten times more if ten times more he had received he was made a public creature and had no enjoyment whatever but in the performance of some duty at this exigent moment the loss of a finished man is not easily supplied  but a disposer whose power we are little able to resist and whose wisdom it behoves us not at all to dispute has ordained it in another manner and whatever my querulous weakness might suggest a far better the storm has gone over me and i lie like one of those old oaks which the late hurricane has scattered about me i am stripped of all my honors i am torn up by the roots and lie prostrate on the earth there and prostrate there i most unfeignedly recognize the divine justice and in some degree submit to it but whilst i humble myself before god i do not know that it is forbidden to repel the attacks of unjust and inconsiderate men the patience of job is proverbial after some of the convulsive struggles of our irritable nature he submitted himself and repented in dust and ashes but even so i do not find him blamed for reprehending and with a considerable degree of verbal asperity those illnatured neighbors of his who visited his dunghill to read moral political and economical lectures on his misery i am alone i have none to meet my enemies in the gate indeed my lord i greatly deceive myself if in this hard season i would give a peck of refuse wheat for all that is called fame and honor in the world this is the appetite but of a few it is a luxury it is a privilege it is an indulgence for those who are at their ease but we are all of us made to shun disgrace as we are made to shrink from pain and poverty and disease it is an instinct and under the direction of reason instinct is always in the right i live in an inverted order they who ought to have succeeded me are gone before me they who should have been to me as posterity are in the place of ancestors i owe to the dearest relation which ever must subsist in memory that act of piety which he would have performed to me i owe it to him to show that he was not descended as the duke of bedford would have it from an unworthy parent  the crown has considered me after long service the crown has paid the duke of bedford by advance he has had a long credit for any service which he may perform hereafter he is secure and long may he be secure in his advance whether he performs any services or not but let him take care how he endangers the safety of that constitution which secures his own utility or his own insignificance or how he discourages those who take up even puny arms to defend an order of things which like the sun of heaven shines alike on the useful and the worthless his grants are ingrafted on the public law of europe covered with the awful hoar of innumerable ages they are guarded by the sacred rules of prescription found in that full treasury of jurisprudence from which the jejuneness and penury of our municipal law has by degrees been enriched and strengthened this prescription i had my share a very full share in bringing to its perfection19 the duke of bedford will stand as long as prescriptive law enduresas long as the great stable laws of property common to us with all civilized nations are kept in their integrity and without the smallest intermixture of the laws maxims principles or precedents of the grand revolution they are secure against all changes but one the whole revolutionary system institutes digest code novels text gloss comment are not only not the same but they are the very reverse and the reverse fundamentally of all the laws on which civil life has hitherto been upheld in all the governments of the world the learned professors of the rights of man regard prescription not as a title to bar all claim set up against old possession but they look on prescription as itself a bar against the possessor and proprietor they hold an immemorial possession to be no more than a long continued and therefore an aggravated injustice  such are their ideas such their religion and such their law but as to our country and our race as long as the wellcompacted structure of our church and state the sanctuary the holy of holies of that ancient law defended by reverence defended by power a fortress at once and a temple20 shall stand inviolate on the brow of the british sionas long as the british monarchy not more limited than fenced by the orders of the state shall like the proud keep of windsor rising in the majesty of proportion and girt with the double belt of its kindred and coëval towers as long as this awful structure shall oversee and guard the subjected landso long the mounds and dikes of the low fat bedford level will have nothing to fear from all the pickaxes of all the levellers of france as long as our sovereign lord the king and his faithful subjects the lords and commons of this realmthe triple cord which no man can breakthe solemn sworn constitutional frankpledge of this nationthe firm guaranties of each others being and each others rightsthe joint and several securities each in its place and order for every kind and every quality of property and of dignityas long as these ensure so long the duke of bedford is safe and we are all safe togetherthe high from the blights of envy and the spoliations of rapacity the low from the iron hand of oppression and the insolent spurn of contempt amen and so be it and so it will be      dum domus Æneæ capitolî immobile saxum     accolet imperiumque pater romanus habebit  but if the rude inroad of gallic tumult with its sophistical rights of man to falsify the account and its sword as a makeweight to throw into the scale shall be introduced into our city by a misguided populace set on by proud great men themselves blinded and intoxicated by a frantic ambition we shall all of us perish and be overwhelmed in a common ruin if a great storm blow on our coast it will cast the whales on the strand as well as the periwinkles his grace will not survive the poor grantee he despisesno not for a twelvemonth if the great look for safety in the services they render to this gallic cause it is to be foolish even above the weight of privilege allowed to wealth if his grace be one of these whom they endeavor to proselytize he ought to be aware of the character of the sect whose doctrines he is invited to embrace with them insurrection is the most sacred of revolutionary duties to the state ingratitude to benefactors is the first of revolutionary virtues ingratitude is indeed their four cardinal virtues compacted and amalgamated into one and he will find it in everything that has happened since the commencement of the philosophic revolution to this hour if he pleads the merit of having performed the duty of insurrection against the order he lives in god forbid he ever should the merit of others will be to perform the duty of insurrection against him if he pleads again god forbid he should and i do not suspect he will his ingratitude to the crown for its creation of his family others will plead their right and duty to pay him in kind they will laugh indeed they will laugh at his parchment and his wax his deeds will be drawn out with the rest of the lumber of his evidenceroom and burnt to the tune of Ça ira in the courts of bedford then equality house  am i to blame if i attempt to pay his graces hostile reproaches to me with a friendly admonition to himself can i be blamed for pointing out to him in what manner he is like to be affected if the sect of the cannibal philosophers of france should proselytize any considerable part of this people and by their joint proselytizing arms should conquer that government to which his grace does not seem to me to give all the support his own security demands surely it is proper that he and that others like him should know the true genius of this sectwhat their opinions arewhat they have done and to whomand what if a prognostic is to be formed from the dispositions and actions of men it is certain they will do hereafter he ought to know that they have sworn assistance the only engagement they ever will keep to all in this country who bear a resemblance to themselves and who think as such that the whole duty of man consists in destruction they are a misallied and disparaged branch of the house of nimrod they are the duke of bedfords natural hunters and he is their natural game because he is not very profoundly reflecting he sleeps in profound security they on the contrary are always vigilant active enterprising and though far removed from any knowledge which makes men estimable or useful in all the instruments and resources of evil their leaders are not meanly instructed or insufficiently furnished in the french revolution everything is new and from want of preparation to meet so unlookedfor an evil everything is dangerous never before this time was a set of literary men converted into a gang of robbers and assassins never before did a den of bravoes and banditti assume the garb and tone of an academy of philosophers  let me tell his grace that an union of such characters monstrous as it seems is not made for producing despicable enemies but if they are formidable as foes as friends they are dreadful indeed the men of property in france confiding in a force which seemed to be irresistible because it had never been tried neglected to prepare for a conflict with their enemies at their own weapons they were found in such a situation as the mexicans were when they were attacked by the dogs the cavalry the iron and the gunpowder of an handful of bearded men whom they did not know to exist in nature this is a comparison that some i think have made and it is just in france they had their enemies within their houses they were even in the bosoms of many of them but they had not sagacity to discern their savage character they seemed tame and even caressing they had nothing but douce humanité in their mouth they could not bear the punishment of the mildest laws on the greatest criminals the slightest severity of justice made their flesh creep the very idea that war existed in the world disturbed their repose military glory was no more with them than a splendid infamy hardly would they hear of selfdefence which they reduced within such bounds as to leave it no defence at all all this while they meditated the confiscations and massacres we have seen had any one told these unfortunate noblemen and gentlemen how and by whom the grand fabric of the french monarchy under which they flourished would be subverted they would not have pitied him as a visionary but would have turned from him as what they call a mauvais plaisant yet we have seen what has happened the persons who have suffered from the cannibal philosophy of france are so like the duke of bedford that nothing but his graces probably not speaking quite so good french could enable us to find out any difference a great many of them had as pompous titles as he and were of full as illustrious a race some few of them had fortunes as ample several of them without meaning the least disparagement to the duke of bedford were as wise and as virtuous and as valiant and as well educated and as complete in all the lineaments of men of honor as he is and to all this they had added the powerful outguard of a military profession which in its nature renders men somewhat more cautious than those who have nothing to attend to but the lazy enjoyment of undisturbed possessions but security was their ruin they are dashed to pieces in the storm and our shores are covered with the wrecks if they had been aware that such a thing might happen such a thing never could have happened  i assure his grace that if i state to him the designs of his enemies in a manner which may appear to him ludicrous and impossible i tell him nothing that has not exactly happened point by point but twentyfour miles from our own shore i assure him that the frenchified faction more encouraged than others are warned by what has happened in france look at him and his landed possessions as an object at once of curiosity and rapacity he is made for them in every part of their double character as robbers to them he is a noble booty as speculatists he is a glorious subject for their experimental philosophy he affords matter for an extensive analysis in all the branches of their science geometrical physical civil and political these philosophers are fanatics independent of any interest which if it operated alone would make them much more tractable they are carried with such an headlong rage towards every desperate trial that they would sacrifice the whole human race to the slightest of their experiments i am better able to enter into the character of this description of men than the noble duke can be i have lived long and variously in the world without any considerable pretensions to literature in myself i have aspired to the love of letters i have lived for a great many years in habitudes with those who professed them i can form a tolerable estimate of what is likely to happen from a character chiefly dependent for fame and fortune on knowledge and talent as well in its morbid and perverted state as in that which is sound and natural naturally men so formed and finished are the first gifts of providence to the world but when they have once thrown off the fear of god which was in all ages too often the case and the fear of man which is now the case and when in that state they come to understand one another and to act in corps a more dreadful calamity cannot arise out of hell to scourge mankind nothing can be conceived more hard than the heart of a thoroughbred metaphysician it comes nearer to the cold malignity of a wicked spirit than to the frailty and passion of a man it is like that of the principle of evil himself incorporeal pure unmixed dephlegmated defecated evil it is no easy operation to eradicate humanity from the human breast what shakspeare calls the compunctious visitings of nature will sometimes knock at their hearts and protest against their murderous speculations but they have a means of compounding with their nature their humanity is not dissolved they only give it a long prorogation they are ready to declare that they do not think two thousand years too long a period for the good that they pursue it is remarkable that they never see any way to their projected good but by the road of some evil their imagination is not fatigued with the contemplation of human suffering through the wild waste of centuries added to centuries of misery and desolation their humanity is at their horizonand like the horizon it always flies before them the geometricians and the chemists bring the one from the dry bones of their diagrams and the other from the soot of their furnaces dispositions that make them worse than indifferent about those feelings and habitudes which are the supports of the moral world ambition is come upon them suddenly they are intoxicated with it and it has rendered them fearless of the danger which may from thence arise to others or to themselves these philosophers consider men in their experiments no more than they do mice in an airpump or in a recipient of mephitic gas whatever his grace may think of himself they look upon him and everything that belongs to him with no more regard than they do upon the whiskers of that little longtailed animal that has been long the game of the grave demure insidious springnailed velvetpawed greeneyed philosophers whether going upon two legs or upon four  his graces landed possessions are irresistibly inviting to an agrarian experiment they are a downright insult upon the rights of man they are more extensive than the territory of many of the grecian republics and they are without comparison more fertile than most of them there are now republics in italy in germany and in switzerland which do not possess anything like so fair and ample a domain there is scope for seven philosophers to proceed in their analytical experiments upon harringtons seven different forms of republics in the acres of this one duke hitherto they have been wholly unproductive to speculationfitted for nothing but to fatten bullocks and to produce grain for beer still more to stupefy the dull english understanding abbé sieyès has whole nests of pigeonholes full of constitutions readymade ticketed sorted and numbered suited to every season and every fancy some with the top of the pattern at the bottom and some with the bottom at the top some plain some flowered some distinguished for their simplicity others for their complexity some of blood color some of boue de paris some with directories others without a direction some with councils of elders and councils of youngsters some without any council at all some where the electors choose the representatives others where the representatives choose the electors some in long coats and some in short cloaks some with pantaloons some without breeches some with fiveshilling qualifications some totally unqualified so that no constitutionfancier may go unsuited from his shop provided he loves a pattern of pillage oppression arbitrary imprisonment confiscation exile revolutionary judgment and legalized premeditated murder in any shapes into which they can be put what a pity it is that the progress of experimental philosophy should be checked by his graces monopoly such are their sentiments i assure him such is their language when they dare to speak and such are their proceedings when they have the means to act  their geographers and geometricians have been some time out of practice it is some time since they have divided their own country into squares that figure has lost the charms of its novelty they want new lands for new trials it is not only the geometricians of the republic that find him a good subject the chemists have bespoke him after the geometricians have done with him as the first set have an eye on his graces lands the chemists are not less taken with his buildings they consider mortar as a very antirevolutionary invention in its present state but properly employed an admirable material for overturning all establishments they have found that the gunpowder of ruins is far the fittest for making other ruins and so ad infinitum they have calculated what quantity of matter convertible into nitre is to be found in bedford house in woburn abbey and in what his grace and his trustees have still suffered to stand of that foolish royalist inigo jones in covent garden churches playhouses coffeehouses all alike are destined to be mingled and equalized and blended into one common rubbishand well sifted and lixiviated to crystallize into true democratic explosive insurrectionary nitre their academy del cimento per antiphrasin with morveau and hassenfratz at its head have computed that the brave sansculottes may make war on all the aristocracy of europe for a twelvemonth out of the rubbish of the duke of bedfords buildings21  while the morveaux and priestleys are proceeding with these experiments upon the duke of bedfords houses the sieyès and the rest of the analytical legislators and constitutionvenders are quite as busy in their trade of decomposing organization in forming his graces vassals into primary assemblies national guards first second and third requisitioners committees of research conductors of the travelling guillotine judges of revolutionary tribunals legislative hangmen supervisors of domiciliary visitation exactors of forced loans and assessors of the maximum  the din of all this smithery may some time or other possibly wake this noble duke and push him to an endeavor to save some little matter from their experimental philosophy if he pleads his grants from the crown he is ruined at the outset if he pleads he has received them from the pillage of superstitious corporations this indeed will stagger them a little because they are enemies to all corporations and to all religion however they will soon recover themselves and will tell his grace or his learned council that all such property belongs to the nationand that it would be more wise for him if he wishes to live the natural term of a citizen that is according to condorcets calculation six months on an average not to pass for an usurper upon the national property this is what the serjeantsatlaw of the rights of man will say to the puny apprentices of the common law of england  is the genius of philosophy not yet known you may as well think the garden of the tuileries was well protected with the cords of ribbon insultingly stretched by the national assembly to keep the sovereign canaille from intruding on the retirement of the poor king of the french as that such flimsy cobwebs will stand between the savages of the revolution and their natural prey deep philosophers are no triflers brave sansculottes are no formalists they will no more regard a marquis of tavistock than an abbot of tavistock the lord of woburn will not be more respectable in their eyes than the prior of woburn they will make no difference between the superior of a covent garden of nuns and of a covent garden of another description they will not care a rush whether his coat is long or shortwhether the color be purple or blue and buff they will not trouble their heads with what part of his head his hair is out from and they will look with equal respect on a tonsure and a crop their only question will be that of their legendre or some oilier of their legislative butchers how he cuts up how he tallows in the caul or on the kidneys  is it not a singular phenomenon that whilst the sansculotte carcassbutchers and the philosophers of the shambles are pricking their dotted lines upon his hide and like the print of the poor ox that we see in the shopwindows at charing cross alive as he is and thinking no harm in the world he is divided into rumps and sirloins and briskets and into all sorts of pieces for roasting boiling and stewing that all the while they are measuring him his grace is measuring meis invidiously comparing the bounty of the crown with the deserts of the defender of his order and in the same moment fawning on those who have the knife half out of the sheath poor innocent      pleased to the last he crops the flowery food     and licks the hand just raised to shed his blood  no man lives too long who lives to do with spirit and suffer with resignation what providence pleases to command or inflict but indeed they are sharp incommodities which beset old age it was but the other day that on putting in order some things which had been brought here on my taking leave of london forever i looked over a number of fine portraits most of them of persons now dead but whose society in my better days made this a proud and happy place amongst those was the picture of lord keppel it was painted by an artist worthy of the subject the excellent friend of that excellent man from their earliest youth and a common friend of us both with whom we lived for many years without a moment of coldness of peevishness of jealousy or of jar to the day of our final separation  i ever looked on lord keppel as one of the greatest and best men of his age and i loved and cultivated him accordingly he was much in my heart and i believe i was in his to the very last beat it was after his trial at portsmouth that he gave me this picture with what zeal and anxious affection i attended him through that his agony of glorywhat part my son in the early flush and enthusiasm of his virtue and the pious passion with which he attached himself to all my connectionswith what prodigality we both squandered ourselves in courting almost every sort of enmity for his sake i believe he felt just as i should have felt such friendship on such an occasion i partook indeed of this honor with several of the first and best and ablest in the kingdom but i was behindhand with none of them and i am sure that if to the eternal disgrace of this nation and to the total annihilation of every trace of honor and virtue in it things had taken a different turn from what they did i should have attended him to the quarterdeck with no less goodwill and more pride though with far other feelings than i partook of the general flow of national joy that attended the justice that was done to his virtue  pardon my lord the feeble garrulity of age which loves to diffuse itself in discourse of the departed great at my years we live in retrospect alone and wholly unfitted for the society of vigorous life we enjoy the best balm to all wounds the consolation of friendship in those only whom we have lost forever feeling the loss of lord keppel at all times at no time did i feel it so much as on the first day when i was attacked in the house of lords  had he lived that reverend form would have risen in its place and with a mild parental reprehension to his nephew the duke of bedford he would have told him that the favor of that gracious prince who had honored his virtues with the government of the navy of great britain and with a seat in the hereditary great council of his kingdom was not undeservedly shown to the friend of the best portion of his life and his faithful companion and counsellor under his rudest trials he would have told him that to whomever else these reproaches might be becoming they were not decorous in his near kindred he would have told him that when men in that rank lose decorum they lose everything  on that day i had a loss in lord keppel but the public loss of him in this awful crisisi speak from much knowledge of the person he never would have listened to any compromise with the rabble rout of this sansculotterie of france his goodness of heart his reason his taste his public duty his principles his prejudices would have repelled him forever from all connection with that horrid medley of madness vice impiety and crime  lord keppel had two countries one of descent and one of birth their interest and their glory are the same and his mind was capacious of both his family was noble and it was dutch that is he was of the oldest and purest nobility that europe can boast among a people renowned above all others for love of their native land though it was never shown in insult to any human being lord keppel was something high it was a wild stock of pride on which the tenderest of all hearts had grafted the milder virtues he valued ancient nobility and he was not disinclined to augment it with new honors he valued the old nobility and the new not as an excuse for inglorious sloth but as an incitement to virtuous activity he considered it as a sort of cure for selfishness and a narrow mindconceiving that a man born in an elevated place in himself was nothing but everything in what went before and what was to come after him without much speculation but by the sure instinct of ingenuous feelings and by the dictates of plain unsophisticated natural understanding he felt that no great commonwealth could by any possibility long subsist without a body of some kind or other of nobility decorated with honor and fortified by privilege this nobility forms the chain that connects the ages of a nation which otherwise with mr paine would soon be taught that no one generation can bind another he felt that no political fabric could be well made without some such order of things as might through a series of time afford a rational hope of securing unity coherence consistency and stability to the state he felt that nothing else can protect it against the levity of courts and the greater levity of the multitude that to talk of hereditary monarchy without anything else of hereditary reverence in the commonwealth was a lowminded absurdity fit only for those detestable fools aspiring to be knaves who began to forge in 1789 the false money of the french constitution that it is one fatal objection to all new fancied and new fabricated republics among a people who once possessing such an advantage have wickedly and insolently rejected it that the prejudice of an old nobility is a thing that cannot be made it may be improved it may be corrected it may be replenished men may be taken from it or aggregated to it but the thing itself is matter of inveterate opinion and therefore cannot be matter of mere positive institution he felt that this nobility in fact does not exist in wrong of other orders of the state but by them and for them  i knew the man i speak of and if we can divine the future out of what we collect from the past no person living would look with more scorn and horror on the impious parricide committed on all their ancestry and on the desperate attainder passed on all their posterity by the orléans and the rochefoucaults and the fayettes and the vicomtes de noailles and the false périgords and the long et cetera of the perfidious sansculottes of the court who like demoniacs possessed with a spirit of fallen pride and inverted ambition abdicated their dignities disowned their families betrayed the most sacred of all trusts and by breaking to pieces a great link of society and all the cramps and holdings of the state brought eternal confusion and desolation on their country for the fate of the miscreant parricides themselves he would have had no pity compassion for the myriads of men of whom the world was not worthy who by their means have perished in prisons or on scaffolds or are pining in beggary and exile would leave no room in his or in any wellformed mind for any such sensation we are not made at once to pity the oppressor and the oppressed  looking to his batavian descent how could he bear to behold his kindred the descendants of the brave nobility of holland whose blood prodigally poured out had more than all the canals meres and inundations of their country protected their independence to behold them bowed in the basest servitude to the basest and vilest of the human racein servitude to those who in no respect were superior in dignity or could aspire to a better place than that of hangmen to the tyrants to whose sceptred pride they had opposed an elevation of soul that surmounted and overpowered the loftiness of castile the haughtiness of austria and the overbearing arrogance of france  could he with patience bear that the children of that nobility who would have deluged their country and given it to the sea rather than submit to louis the fourteenth who was then in his meridian glory when his arms were conducted by the turennes by the luxembourgs by the boufflers when his councils were directed by the colberts and the louvois when his tribunals were filled by the lamoignons and the daguesseausthat these should be given up to the cruel sport of the pichegrus the jourdans the santerres under the rolands and brissots and gorsas and robespierres the reubells the carnots and talliens and dantons and the whole tribe of regicides robbers and revolutionary judges that from the rotten carcass of their own murdered country have poured out innumerable swarms of the lowest and at once the most destructive of the classes of animated nature which like columns of locusts have laid waste the fairest part of the world  would keppel have borne to see the ruin of the virtuous patricians that happy union of the noble and the burgher who with signal prudence and integrity had long governed the cities of the confederate republic the cherishing fathers of their country who denying commerce to themselves made it flourish in a manner unexampled under their protection could keppel have borne that a vile faction should totally destroy this harmonious construction in favor of a robbing democracy founded on the spurious rights of man  he was no great clerk but he was perfectly well versed in the interests of europe and he could not have heard with patience that the country of grotius the cradle of the law of nations and one of the richest repositories of all law should be taught a new code by the ignorant flippancy of thomas paine the presumptuous foppery of la fayette with his stolen rights of man in his hand the wild profligate intrigue and turbulency of marat and the impious sophistry of condorcet in his insolent addresses to the batavian republic  could keppel who idolized the house of nassau who was himself given to england along with the blessings of the british and dutch revolutions with revolutions of stability with revolutions which consolidated and married the liberties and the interests of the two nations forevercould he see the fountain of british liberty itself in servitude to france could he see with patience a prince of orange expelled as a sort of diminutive despot with every kind of contumely from the country which that family of deliverers had so often rescued from slavery and obliged to live in exile in another country which owes its liberty to his house  would keppel have heard with patience that the conduct to be held on such occasions was to become short by the knees to the faction of the homicides to entreat them quietly to retire or if the fortune of war should drive them from their first wicked and unprovoked invasion that no security should be taken no arrangement made no barrier formed no alliance entered into for the security of that which under a foreign name is the most precious part of england what would he have said if it was even proposed that the austrian netherlands which ought to be a barrier to holland and the tie of an alliance to protect her against any species of rule that might be erected or even be restored in france should be formed into a republic under her influence and dependent upon her power  but above all what would he have said if he had heard it made a matter of accusation against me by his nephew the duke of bedford that i was the author of the war had i a mind to keep that high distinction to myself as from pride i might but from justice i dare not he would have snatched his share of it from my hand and held it with the grasp of a dying convulsion to his end  it would be a most arrogant presumption in me to assume to myself the glory of what belongs to his majesty and to his ministers and to his parliament and to the far greater majority of his faithful people but had i stood alone to counsel and that all were determined to be guided by my advice and to follow it implicitly then i should have been the sole author of a war but it should have been a war on my ideas and my principles however let his grace think as he may of my demerits with regard to the war with regicide he will find my guilt confined to that alone he never shall with the smallest color of reason accuse me of being the author of a peace with regicidebut that is high matter and ought not to be mixed with anything of so little moment as what may belong to me or even to the duke of bedford  i have the honor to be c  edmund burke  footnotes  15      tristius haud illis monstrum nec sævior ulla     pestis et ira deûm stygiis sese extulit

three letters  addressed to  a member of the present parliament  on the  proposals for peace with the regicide directory of france  17967     letter i  on the overtures of peace   my dear sirour last conversation though not in the tone of absolute despondency was far from cheerful we could not easily account for some unpleasant appearances they were represented to us as indicating the state of the popular mind and they were not at all what we should have expected from our old ideas even of the faults and vices of the english character the disastrous events which have followed one upon another in a long unbroken funereal train moving in a procession that seemed to have no endthese were not the principal causes of our dejection we feared more from what threatened to fail within than what menaced to oppress us from abroad to a people who have once been proud and great and great because they were proud a change in the national spirit is the most terrible of all revolutions  i shall not live to behold the unravelling of the intricate plot which saddens and perplexes the awful drama of providence now acting on the moral theatre of the world whether for thought or for action i am at the end of my career you are in the middle of yours in what part of its orbit the nation with which we are carried along moves at this instant it is not easy to conjecture it may perhaps be far advanced in its aphelionbut when to return  not to lose ourselves in the infinite void of the conjectural world our business is with what is likely to be affected for the better or the worse by the wisdom or weakness of our plans in all speculations upon men and human affairs it is of no small moment to distinguish things of accident from permanent causes and from effects that cannot be altered it is not every irregularity in our movement that is a total deviation from our course i am not quite of the mind of those speculators who seem assured that necessarily and by the constitution of things all states have the same periods of infancy manhood and decrepitude that are found in the individuals who compose them parallels of this sort rather furnish similitudes to illustrate or to adorn than supply analogies from whence to reason the objects which are attempted to be forced into an analogy are not found in the same classes of existence individuals are physical beings subject to laws universal and invariable the immediate cause acting in these laws may be obscure the general results are subjects of certain calculation but commonwealths are not physical but moral essences they are artificial combinations and in their proximate efficient cause the arbitrary productions of the human mind we are not yet acquainted with the laws which necessarily influence the stability of that kind of work made by that kind of agent there is not in the physical order with which they do not appear to hold any assignable connection a distinct cause by which any of those fabrics must necessarily grow flourish or decay nor in my opinion does the moral world produce anything more determinate on that subject than what may serve as an amusement liberal indeed and ingenious but still only an amusement for speculative men i doubt whether the history of mankind is yet complete enough if ever it can be so to furnish grounds for a sure theory on the internal causes which necessarily affect the fortune of a state i am far from denying the operation of such causes but they are infinitely uncertain and much more obscure and much more difficult to trace than the foreign causes that tend to raise to depress and sometimes to overwhelm a community  it is often impossible in these political inquiries to find any proportion between the apparent force of any moral causes we may assign and their known operation we are therefore obliged to deliver up that operation to mere chance or more piously perhaps more rationally to the occasional interposition and irresistible hand of the great disposer we have seen states of considerable duration which for ages have remained nearly as they have begun and could hardly be said to ebb or flow some appear to have spent their vigor at their commencement some have blazed out in their glory a little before their extinction the meridian of some has been the most splendid others and they the greatest number have fluctuated and experienced at different periods of their existence a great variety of fortune at the very moment when some of them seemed plunged in unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster they have suddenly emerged they have begun a new course and opened a new reckoning and even in the depths of their calamity and on the very ruins of their country have laid the foundations of a towering and durable greatness all this has happened without any apparent previous change in the general circumstances which had brought on their distress the death of a man at a critical juncture his disgust his retreat his disgrace have brought innumerable calamities on a whole nation a common soldier a child a girl at the door of an inn have changed the face of fortune and almost of nature  such and often influenced by such causes has commonly been the fate of monarchies of long duration they have their ebbs and their flows this has been eminently the fate of the monarchy of france there have been times in which no power has ever been brought so low few have ever flourished in greater glory by turns elevated and depressed that power had been on the whole rather on the increase and it continued not only powerful but formidable to the hour of the total ruin of the monarchy this fall of the monarchy was far from being preceded by any exterior symptoms of decline the interior were not visible to every eye and a thousand accidents might have prevented the operation of what the most clearsighted were not able to discern nor the most provident to divine a very little time before its dreadful catastrophe there was a kind of exterior splendor in the situation of the crown which usually adds to government strength and authority at home the crown seemed then to have obtained some of the most splendid objects of state ambition none of the continental powers of europe were the enemies of france they were all either tacitly disposed to her or publicly connected with her and in those who kept the most aloof there was little appearance of jealousyof animosity there was no appearance at all the british nation her great preponderating rival she had humbled to all appearance she had weakened certainly had endangered by cutting off a very large and by far the most growing part of her empire in that its acme of human prosperity and greatness in the high and palmy state of the monarchy of france it fell to the ground without a struggle it fell without any of those vices in the monarch which have sometimes been the causes of the fall of kingdoms but which existed without any visible effect on the state in the highest degree in many other princes and far from destroying their power had only left some slight stains on their character the financial difficulties were only pretexts and instruments of those who accomplished the ruin of that monarchy they were not the causes of it  deprived of the old government deprived in a manner of all government france fallen as a monarchy to common speculators might have appeared more likely to be an object of pity or insult according to the disposition of the circumjacent powers than to be the scourge and terror of them all but out of the tomb of the murdered monarchy in france has arisen a vast tremendous unformed spectre in a far more terrific guise than any which ever yet have overpowered the imagination and subdued the fortitude of man going straight forward to its end unappalled by peril unchecked by remorse despising all common maxims and all common means that hideous phantom overpowered those who could not believe it was possible she could at all exist except on the principles which habit rather than nature had persuaded them were necessary to their own particular welfare and to their own ordinary modes of action but the constitution of any political being as well as that of any physical being ought to be known before one can venture to say what is fit for its conservation or what is the proper means of its power the poison of other states is the food of the new republic that bankruptcy the very apprehension of which is one of the causes assigned for the fall of the monarchy was the capital on which she opened her traffic with the world  the republic of regicide with an annihilated revenue with defaced manufactures with a ruined commerce with an uncultivated and halfdepopulated country with a discontented distressed enslaved and famished people passing with a rapid eccentric incalculable course from the wildest anarchy to the sternest despotism has actually conquered the finest parts of europe has distressed disunited deranged and broke to pieces all the rest and so subdued the minds of the rulers in every nation that hardly any resource presents itself to them except that of entitling themselves to a contemptuous mercy by a display of their imbecility and meanness even in their greatest military efforts and the greatest display of their fortitude they seem not to hope they do not even appear to wish the extinction of what subsists to their certain ruin their ambition is only to be admitted to a more favored class in the order of servitude under that domineering power  this seems the temper of the day at first the french force was too much despised now it is too much dreaded as inconsiderate courage has given way to irrational fear so it may be hoped that through the medium of deliberate sober apprehension we may arrive at steady fortitude who knows whether indignation may not succeed to terror and the revival of high sentiment spurning away the delusion of a safety purchased at the expense of glory may not yet drive us to that generous despair which has often subdued distempers in the state for which no remedy could be found in the wisest councils  other great states having been without any regular certain course of elevation or decline we may hope that the british fortune may fluctuate also because the public mind which greatly influences that fortune may have its changes we are therefore never authorized to abandon our country to its fate or to act or advise as if it had no resource there is no reason to apprehend because ordinary means threaten to fail that no others can spring up whilst our heart is whole it will find means or make them the heart of the citizen is a perennial spring of energy to the state because the pulse seems to intermit we must not presume that it will cease instantly to beat the public must never be regarded as incurable i remember in the beginning of what has lately been called the seven years war that an eloquent writer and ingenious speculator dr brown upon some reverses which happened in the beginning of that war published an elaborate philosophical discourse to prove that the distinguishing features of the people of england had been totally changed and that a frivolous effeminacy was become the national character nothing could be more popular than that work it was thought a great consolation to us the light people of this country who were and are light but who were not and are not effeminate that we had found the causes of our misfortunes in our vices pythagoras could not be more pleased with his leading discovery but whilst in that splenetic mood we amused ourselves in a sour critical speculation of which we were ourselves the objects and in which every man lost his particular sense of the public disgrace in the epidemic nature of the distemperwhilst as in the alps goitre kept goitre in countenancewhilst we were thus abandoning ourselves to a direct confession of our inferiority to france and whilst many very many were ready to act upon a sense of that inferioritya few months effected a total change in our variable minds we emerged from the gulf of that speculative despondency and wore buoyed up to the highest point of practical vigor never did the masculine spirit of england display itself with more energy nor ever did its genius soar with a prouder preëminence over france than at the time when frivolity and effeminacy had been at least tacitly acknowledged as their national character by the good people of this kingdom  for one if they be properly treated i despair neither of the public fortune nor of the public mind there is much to be done undoubtedly and much to be retrieved we must walk in new ways or we can never encounter our enemy in his devious march we are not at an end of our struggle nor near it let us not deceive ourselves we are at the beginning of great troubles i readily acknowledge that the state of public affairs is infinitely more unpromising than at the period i have just now alluded to and the position of all the powers of europe in relation to us and in relation to each other is more intricate and critical beyond all comparison difficult indeed is our situation in all situations of difficulty men will be influenced in the part they take not only by the reason of the case but by the peculiar turn of their own character the same ways to safety do not present themselves to all men nor to the same men in different tempers there is a courageous wisdom there is also a false reptile prudence the result not of caution but of fear under misfortunes it often happens that the nerves of the understanding are so relaxed the pressing peril of the hour so completely confounds all the faculties that no future danger can be properly provided for can be justly estimated can be so much as fully seen the eye of the mind is dazzled and vanquished an abject distrust of ourselves an extravagant admiration of the enemy present us with no hope but in a compromise with his pride by a submission to his will this short plan of policy is the only counsel which will obtain a hearing we plunge into a dark gulf with all the rash precipitation of fear the nature of courage is without a question to be conversant with danger but in the palpable night of their terrors men under consternation suppose not that it is the danger which by a sure instinct calls out the courage to resist it but that it is the courage which produces the danger they therefore seek for a refuge from their fears in the fears themselves and consider a temporizing meanness as the only source of safety  the rules and definitions of prudence can rarely be exact never universal i do not deny that in small truckling states a timely compromise with power has often been the means and the only means of drawling out their puny existence but a great state is too much envied too much dreaded to find safety in humiliation to be secure it must be respected power and eminence and consideration are things not to be begged they must be commanded and they who supplicate for mercy from others can never hope for justice through themselves what justice they are to obtain as the alms of an enemy depends upon his character and that they ought well to know before they implicitly confide  much controversy there has been in parliament and not a little amongst us out of doors about the instrumental means of this nation towards the maintenance of her dignity and the assertion of her rights on the most elaborate and correct detail of facts the result seems to be that at no time has the wealth and power of great britain been so considerable as it is at this very perilous moment we have a vast interest to preserve and we possess great means of preserving it but it is to be remembered that the artificer may be incumbered by his tools and that resources may be among impediments if wealth is the obedient and laborious slave of virtue and of public honor then wealth is in its place and has its use but if this order is changed and honor is to be sacrificed to the conservation of riches riches which have neither eyes nor hands nor anything truly vital in them cannot long survive the being of their vivifying powers their legitimate masters and their potent protectors if we command our wealth we shall be rich and free if our wealth commands us we are poor indeed we are bought by the enemy with the treasure from our own coffers too great a sense of the value of a subordinate interest may be the very source of its danger as well as the certain ruin of interests of a superior order often has a man lost his all because he would not submit to hazard all in defending it a display of our wealth before robbers is not the way to restrain their boldness or to lessen their rapacity this display is made i know to persuade the people of england that thereby we shall awe the enemy and improve the terms of our capitulation it is made not that we should fight with more animation but that we should supplicate with better hopes we are mistaken we have an enemy to deal with who never regarded our contest as a measuring and weighing of purses he is the gaul that puts his sword into the scale he is more tempted with our wealth as booty than terrified with it as power but let us be rich or poor let us be either in what proportion we may nature is false or this is true that where the essential public force of which money is but a part is in any degree upon a par in a conflict between nations that state which is resolved to hazard its existence rather than to abandon its objects must have an infinite advantage over that which is resolved to yield rather than to carry its resistance beyond a certain point humanly speaking that people which bounds its efforts only with its being must give the law to that nation which will not push its opposition beyond its convenience  if we look to nothing but our domestic condition the state of the nation is full even to plethora but if we imagine that this country can long maintain its blood and its food as disjoined from the community of mankind such an opinion does not deserve refutation as absurd but pity as insane  i do not know that such an improvident and stupid selfishness deserves the discussion which perhaps i may bestow upon it hereafter we cannot arrange with our enemy in the present conjuncture without abandoning the interest of mankind if we look only to our own petty peculium in the war we have had some advantagesadvantages ambiguous in their nature and dearly bought we have not in the slightest degree impaired the strength of the common enemy in any one of those points in which his particular force consistsat the same time that new enemies to ourselves new allies to the regicide republic have been made out of the wrecks and fragments of the general confederacy so far as to the selfish part as composing a part of the community of europe and interested in its fate it is not easy to conceive a state of things more doubtful and perplexing when louis the fourteenth had made himself master of one of the largest and most important provinces of spainwhen he had in a manner overrun lombardy and was thundering at the gates of turinwhen he had mastered almost all germany on this side the rhinewhen he was on the point of ruining the august fabric of the empirewhen with the elector of bavaria in his alliance hardly anything interposed between him and viennawhen the turk hung with a mighty force over the empire on the other sidei do not know that in the beginning of 1704 that is in the third year of the renovated war with louis the fourteenth the state of europe was so truly alarming to england it certainly was not holland and holland is a matter to england of value inestimable was then powerful was then independent and though greatly endangered was then full of energy and spirit but the great resource of europe was in england not in a sort of england detached from the rest of the world and amusing herself with the puppetshow of a naval power it can be no better whilst all the sources of that power and of every sort of power are precarious but in that sort of england who considered herself as embodied with europe but in that sort of england who sympathetic with the adversity or the happiness of mankind felt that nothing in human affairs was foreign to her we may consider it as a sure axiom that as on the one hand no confederacy of the least effect or duration can exist against france of which england is not only a part but the head so neither can england pretend to cope with france but as connected with the body of christendom  our account of the war as a war of communion to the very point in which we began to throw out lures oglings and glances for peace was a war of disaster and of little else the independent advantages obtained by us at the beginning of the war and which were made at the expense of that common cause if they deceive us about our largest and our surest interest are to be reckoned amongst our heaviest losses  the allies and great britain amongst the rest and perhaps amongst the foremost have been miserably deluded by this great fundamental error that it was in our power to make peace with this monster of a state whenever we chose to forget the crimes that made it great and the designs that made it formidable people imagined that their ceasing to resist was the sure way to be secure this pale cast of thought sicklied over all their enterprises and turned all their politics awry they could not or rather they would not read in the most unequivocal declarations of the enemy and in his uniform conduct that more safety was to be found in the most arduous war than in the friendship of that kind of being its hostile amity can be obtained on no terms that do not imply an inability hereafter to resist its designs this great prolific error i mean that peace was always in our power has been the cause that rendered the allies indifferent about the direction of the war and persuaded them that they might always risk a choice and even a change in its objects they seldom improved any advantagehoping that the enemy affected by it would make a proffer of peace hence it was that all their early victories have been followed almost immediately with the usual effects of a defeat whilst all the advantages obtained by the regicides have been followed by the consequences that were natural the discomfitures which the republic of assassins has suffered have uniformly called forth new exertions which not only repaired old losses but prepared new conquests the losses of the allies on the contrary no provision having been made on the speculation of such an event have been followed by desertion by dismay by disunion by a dereliction of their policy by a flight from their principles by an admiration of the enemy by mutual accusations by a distrust in every member of the alliance of its fellow of its cause its power and its courage  great difficulties in consequence of our erroneous policy as i have said press upon every side of us far from desiring to conceal or even to palliate the evil in the representation i wish to lay it down as my foundation that never greater existed in a moment when sudden panic is apprehended it may be wise for a while to conceal some great public disaster or to reveal it by degrees until the minds of the people have time to be recollected that their understanding may have leisure to rally and that more steady councils may prevent their doing something desperate under the first impressions of rage or terror but with regard to a general state of things growing out of events and causes already known in the gross there is no piety in the fraud that covers its true nature because nothing but erroneous resolutions can be the result of false representations those measures which in common distress might be available in greater are no better than playing with the evil that the effort may bear a proportion to the exigence it is fit it should be knownknown in its quality in its extent and in all the circumstances which attend it great reverses of fortune there have been and great embarrassments in council a principled regicide enemy possessed of the most important part of europe and struggling for the rest within ourselves a total relaxation of all authority whilst a cry is raised against it as if it were the most ferocious of all despotism a worse phenomenon our government disowned by the most efficient member of its tribunalsillsupported by any of their constituent partsand the highest tribunal of all from causes not for our present purpose to examine deprived of all that dignity and all that efficiency which might enforce or regulate or if the case required it might supply the want of every other court public prosecutions are become little better than schools for treasonof no use but to improve the dexterity of criminals in the mystery of evasion or to show with what complete impunity men may conspire against the commonwealth with what safety assassins may attempt its awful head everything is secure except what the laws have made sacred everything is tameness and languor that is not fury and faction whilst the distempers of a relaxed fibre prognosticate and prepare all the morbid force of convulsion in the body of the state the steadiness of the physician is overpowered by the very aspect of the disease22 the doctor of the constitution pretending to underrate what he is not able to contend with shrinks from his own operation he doubts and questions the salutary but critical terrors of the cautery and the knife he takes a poor credit even from his defeat and covers impotence under the mask of lenity he praises the moderation of the laws as in his hands he sees them baffled and despised is all this because in our day the statutes of the kingdom are not engrossed in as firm a character and imprinted in as black and legible a type as ever no the law is a clear but it is a dead letter dead and putrid it is insufficient to save the state but potent to infect and to kill living law full of reason and of equity and justice as it is or it should not exist ought to be severe and awful tooor the words of menace whether written on the parchment roll of england or cut into the brazen tablet of borne will excite nothing but contempt how comes it that in all the state prosecutions of magnitude from the revolution to within these two or three years the crown has scarcely ever retired disgraced and defeated from its courts whence this alarming change by a connection easily felt and not impossible to be traced to its cause all the parts of the state have their correspondence and consent they who bow to the enemy abroad will not be of power to subdue the conspirator at home it is impossible not to observe that in proportion as we approximate to the poisonous jaws of anarchy the fascination grows irresistible in proportion as we are attracted towards the focus of illegality irreligion and desperate enterprise all the venomous and blighting insects of the state are awakened into life the promise of the year is blasted and shrivelled and burned up before them our most salutary and most beautiful institutions yield nothing but dust and smut the harvest of our law is no more than stubble it is in the nature of these eruptive diseases in the state to sink in by fits and reappear but the fuel of the malady remains and in my opinion is not in the smallest degree mitigated in its malignity though it waits the favorable moment of a freer communication with the source of regicide to exert and to increase its force  is it that the people are changed that the commonwealth cannot be protected by its laws i hardly think it on the contrary i conceive that these things happen because men are not changed but remain always what they always were they remain what the bulk of us ever must be when abandoned to our vulgar propensities without guide leader or control that is made to be full of a blind elevation in prosperity to despise untried dangers to be overpowered with unexpected reverses to find no clew in a labyrinth of difficulties to get out of a present inconvenience with any risk of future ruin to follow and to bow to fortune to admire successful though wicked enterprise and to imitate what we admire to contemn the government which announces danger from sacrilege and regicide whilst they are only in their infancy and their struggle but which finds nothing that can alarm in their adult state and in the power and triumph of those destructive principles in a mass we cannot be left to ourselves we must have leaders if none will undertake to lead us right we shall find guides who will contrive to conduct us to shame and ruin  we are in a war of a peculiar nature it is not with an ordinary community which is hostile or friendly as passion or as interest may veer aboutnot with a state which makes war through wantonness and abandons it through lassitude we are at war with a system which by its essence is inimical to all other governments and which makes peace or war as peace and war may best contribute to their subversion it is with an armed doctrine that we are at war it has by its essence a faction of opinion and of interest and of enthusiasm in every country to us it is a colossus which bestrides our channel it has one foot on a foreign shore the other upon the british soil thus advantaged if it can at all exist it must finally prevail nothing can so completely ruin any of the old governments ours in particular as the acknowledgment directly or by implication of any kind of superiority in this new power this acknowledgment we make if in a bad or doubtful situation of our affairs we solicit peace or if we yield to the modes of new humiliation in which alone she is content to give us an hearing by that means the terms cannot be of our choosingno not in any part  it is laid in the unalterable constitution of thingsnone can aspire to act greatly but those who are of force greatly to suffer they who make their arrangements in the first run of misadventure and in a temper of mind the common fruit of disappointment and dismay put a seal on their calamities to their power they take a security against any favors which they might hope from the usual inconstancy of fortune i am therefore my dear friend invariably of your opinion though full of respect for those who think differently that neither the time chosen for it nor the manner of soliciting a negotiation were properly consideredeven though i had allowed i hardly shall allow that with the horde of regicides we could by any selection of time or use of means obtain anything at all deserving the name of peace  in one point we are lucky the regicide has received our advances with scorn we have an enemy to whose virtues we can owe nothing but on this occasion we are infinitely obliged to one of his vices we owe more to his insolence than to our own precaution the haughtiness by which the proud repel us has this of good in itthat in making us keep our distance they must keep their distance too in the present case the pride of the regicide may be our safety he has given time for our reason to operate and for british dignity to recover from its surprise from first to last he has rejected all our advances far as we have gone he has still left a way open to our retreat  there is always an augury to be taken of what a peace is likely to be from the preliminary steps that are made to bring it about we may gather something from the time in which the first overtures are made from the quarter whence they come from the manner in which they are received these discover the temper of the parties if your enemy offers peace in the moment of success it indicates that he is satisfied with something it shows that there are limits to his ambition or his resentment if he offers nothing under misfortune it is probable that it is more painful to him to abandon the prospect of advantage than to endure calamity if he rejects solicitation and will not give even a nod to the suppliants for peace until a change in the fortune of the war threatens him with ruin then i think it evident that he wishes nothing more than to disarm his adversary to gain time afterwards a question arises which of the parties is likely to obtain the greater advantages by continuing disarmed and by the use of time  with these few plain indications in our minds it will not be improper to reconsider the conduct of the enemy together with our own from the day that a question of peace has been in agitation in considering this part of the question i do not proceed on my own hypothesis i suppose for a moment that this body of regicide calling itself a republic is a politic person with whom something deserving the name of peace may be made on that supposition let us examine our own proceeding let us compute the profit it has brought and the advantage that it is likely to bring hereafter a peace too eagerly sought is not always the sooner obtained the discovery of vehement wishes generally frustrates their attainment and your adversary has gained a great advantage over you when he finds you impatient to conclude a treaty there is in reserve not only something of dignity but a great deal of prudence too a sort of courage belongs to negotiation as well as to operations of the field a negotiator must often seem willing to hazard the whole issue of his treaty if he wishes to secure any one material point  the regicides were the first to declare war we are the first to sue for peace in proportion to the humility and perseverance we have shown in our addresses has been the obstinacy of their arrogance in rejecting our suit the patience of their pride seems to have been worn out with the importunity of our courtship disgusted as they are with a conduct so different from all the sentiments by which they are themselves filled they think to put an end to our vexatious solicitation by redoubling their insults  it happens frequently that pride may reject a public advance while interest listens to a secret suggestion of advantage the opportunity has been afforded at a very early period in the diplomacy of humiliation a gentleman was sent on an errand23 of which from the motive of it whatever the event might be we can never be ashamed humanity cannot be degraded by humiliation it is its very character to submit to such things there is a consanguinity between benevolence and humility they are virtues of the same stock dignity is of as good a race but it belongs to the family of fortitude in the spirit of that benevolence we sent a gentleman to beseech the directory of regicide not to be quite so prodigal as their republic had been of judicial murder we solicited them to spare the lives of some unhappy persons of the first distinction whose safety at other times could not have been an object of solicitation they had quitted france on the faith of the declaration of the rights of citizens they never had been in the service of the regicides nor at their hands had received any stipend the very system and constitution of government that now prevails was settled subsequent to their emigration they were under the protection of great britain and in his majestys pay and service not an hostile invasion but the disasters of the sea had thrown them upon a shore more barbarous and inhospitable than the inclement ocean under the most pitiless of its storms here was an opportunity to express a feeling for the miseries of war and to open some sort of conversation which after our public overtures had glutted their pride at a cautious and jealous distance might lead to something like an accommodationwhat was the event a strange uncouth thing a theatrical figure of the opera his head shaded with threecolored plumes his body fantastically habited strutted from the back scenes and after a short speech in the mockheroic falsetto of stupid tragedy delivered the gentleman who came to make the representation into the custody of a guard with directions not to lose sight of him for a moment and then ordered him to be sent from paris in two hours  here it is impossible that a sentiment of tenderness should not strike athwart the sternness of politics and make us recall to painful memory the difference between this insolent and bloody theatre and the temperate natural majesty of a civilized court where the afflicted family of asgill did not in vain solicit the mercy of the highest in rank and the most compassionate of the compassionate sex  in this intercourse at least there was nothing to promise a great deal of success in our future advances whilst the fortune of the field was wholly with the regicides nothing was thought of but to follow where it led and it led to everything not so much as a talk of treaty laws were laid down with arrogance the most moderate politician in their clan24 was chosen as the organ not so much for prescribing limits to their claims as to mark what for the present they are content to leave to others they made not laws not conventions not late possession but physical nature and political convenience the sole foundation of their claims the rhine the mediterranean and the ocean were the bounds which for the time they assigned to the empire of regicide what was the chamber of union of louis the fourteenth which astonished and provoked all europe compared to this declaration in truth with these limits and their principle they would not have left even the shadow of liberty or safety to any nation this plan of empire was not taken up in the first intoxication of unexpected success you must recollect that it was projected just as the report has stated it from the very first revolt of the faction against their monarchy and it has been uniformly pursued as a standing maxim of national policy from that time to this it is generally in the season of prosperity that men discover their real temper principles and designs but this principle suggested in their first struggles fully avowed in their prosperity has in the most adverse state of their affairs been tenaciously adhered to the report combined with their conduct forms an infallible criterion of the views of this republic  in their fortune there has been some fluctuation we are to see how their minds have been affected with a change some impression it made on them undoubtedly it produced some oblique notice of the submissions that were made by suppliant nations the utmost they did was to make some of those cold formal general professions of a love of peace which no power has ever refused to make because they mean little and cost nothing the first paper i have seen the publication at hamburg making a show of that pacific disposition discovered a rooted animosity against this nation and an incurable rancor even more than any one of their hostile acts in this hamburg declaration they choose to suppose that the war on the part of england is a war of government begun and carried on against the sense and interests of the peoplethus sowing in their very overtures towards peace the seeds of tumult and sedition for they never have abandoned and never will they abandon in peace in war in treaty in any situation or for one instant their old steady maxim of separating the people from their government let me add and it is with unfeigned anxiety for the character and credit of ministers that i do add if our government perseveres in its as uniform course of acting under instruments with such preambles it pleads guilty to the charges made by our enemies against it both on its own part and on the part of parliament itself the enemy must succeed in his plan for loosening and disconnecting all the internal holdings of the kingdom  it was not enough that the speech from the throne in the opening of the session in 1795 threw out oglings and glances of tenderness lest this coquetting should seem too cold and ambiguous without waiting for its effect the violent passion for a relation to the regicides produced a direct message from the crown and its consequences from the two houses of parliament on the part of the regicides these declarations could not be entirely passed by without notice but in that notice they discovered still more clearly the bottom of their character the offer made to them by the message to parliament was hinted at in their answerbut in an obscure and oblique manner as before they accompanied their notice of the indications manifested on our side with every kind of insolent and taunting reflection the regicide directory on the day which in their gypsy jargon they call the 5th of pluviose in return for our advances charge us with eluding our declarations under evasive formalities and frivolous pretexts what these pretexts and evasions were they do not say and i have never heard but they do not rest there they proceed to charge us and as it should seem our allies in the mass with direct perfidy they are so conciliatory in their language as to hint that this perfidious character is not new in our proceedings however notwithstanding this our habitual perfidy they will offer peace on conditions as moderateas what as reason and as equity require noas moderate as are suitable to their national dignity national dignity in all treaties i do admit is an important consideration they have given us an useful hint on that subject but dignity hitherto has belonged to the mode of proceeding not to the matter of a treaty never before has it been mentioned as the standard for rating the conditions of peaceno never by the most violent of conquerors indemnification is capable of some estimate dignity has no standard it is impossible to guess what acquisitions pride and ambition may think fit for their dignity but lest any doubt should remain on what they think for their dignity the regicides in the next paragraph tell us that they will have no peace with their enemies until they have reduced them to a state which will put them under an impossibility of pursuing their wretched projectsthat is in plain french or english until they have accomplished our utter and irretrievable ruin this is their pacific language it flows from their unalterable principle in whatever language they speak or whatever steps they take whether of real war or of pretended pacification they have never to do them justice been at much trouble in concealing their intentions we were as obstinately resolved to think them not in earnest but i confess jests of this sort whatever their urbanity may be are not much to my taste  to this conciliatory and amicable public communication our sole answer in effect is thiscitizen regicides whenever you find yourselves in the humor you may have a peace with us that is a point you may always command we are constantly in attendance and nothing you can do shall hinder us from the renewal of our supplications you may turn us out at the door but we will jump in at the window  to those who do not love to contemplate the fall of human greatness i do not know a more mortifying spectacle than to see the assembled majesty of the crowned heads of europe waiting as patient suitors in the antechamber of regicide they wait it seems until the sanguinary tyrant carnot shall have snorted away the fumes of the indigested blood of his sovereign then when sunk on the down of usurped pomp he shall have sufficiently indulged his meditations with what monarch he shall next glut his ravening maw he may condescend to signify that it is his pleasure to be awake and that he is at leisure to receive the proposals of his high and mighty clients for the terms on which he may respite the execution of the sentence he has passed upon them at the opening of those doors what a sight it must be to behold the plenipotentiaries of royal impotence in the precedency which they will intrigue to obtain and which will be granted to them according to the seniority of their degradation sneaking into the regicide presence and with the relics of the smile which they had dressed up for the levee of their masters still flickering on their curled lips presenting the faded remains of their courtly graces to meet the scornful ferocious sardonic grin of a bloody ruffian who whilst he is receiving their homage is measuring them with his eye and fitting to their size the slider of his guillotine these ambassadors may easily return as good courtiers as they went but can they ever return from that degrading residence loyal and faithful subjects or with any true affection to their master or true attachment to the constitution religion or laws of their country there is great danger that they who enter smiling into this trophonian cave will come out of it sad and serious conspirators and such will continue as long as they live they will become true conductors of contagion to every country which has had the misfortune to send them to the source of that electricity at best they will become totally indifferent to good and evil to one institution or another this species of indifference is but too generally distinguishable in those who have been much employed in foreign courts but in the present case the evil must be aggravated without measure for they go from their country not with the pride of the old character but in a state of the lowest degradation and what must happen in their place of residence can have no effect in raising them to the level of true dignity or of chaste selfestimation either as men or as representatives of crowned heads  our early proceeding which has produced these returns of affront appeared to me totally new without being adapted to the new circumstances of affairs i have called to my mind the speeches and messages in former times i find nothing like these you will look in the journals to find whether my memory fails me before this time never was a ground of peace laid as it were in a parliamentary record until it had been as good as concluded this was a wise homage paid to the discretion of the crown it was known how much a negotiation must suffer by having anything in the train towards it prematurely disclosed but when those parliamentary declarations were made not so much as a step had been taken towards a negotiation in any mode whatever the measure was an unpleasant and unseasonable discovery  i conceive that another circumstance in that transaction has been as little authorized by any example and that it is as little prudent in itself i mean the formal recognition of the french republic without entering for the present into a question on the good faith manifested in that measure or on its general policy i doubt upon mere temporary considerations of prudence whether it was perfectly advisable it is not within the rules of dexterous conduct to make an acknowledgment of a contested title in your enemy before you are morally certain that your recognition will secure his friendship otherwise it is a measure worse than thrown away it adds infinitely to the strength and consequently to the demands of the adverse party he has gained a fundamental point without an equivalent it has happened as might have been foreseen no notice whatever was taken of this recognition in fact the directory never gave themselves any concern about it and they received our acknowledgment with perfect scorn with them it is not for the states of europe to judge of their title the very reverse in their eye the title of every other power depends wholly on their pleasure  preliminary declarations of this sort thrown out at random and sown as it wore broadcast were never to be found in the mode of our proceeding with france and spain whilst the great monarchies of france and spain existed i do not say that a diplomatic measure ought to be like a parliamentary or a judicial proceeding according to strict precedent i hope i am far from that pedantry but this i know that a great state ought to have some regard to its ancient maxims especially where they indicate its dignity where they concur with the rules of prudence and above all where the circumstances of the time require that a spirit of innovation should be resisted which leads to the humiliation of sovereign powers it would be ridiculous to assert that those powers have suffered nothing in their estimation i admit that the greater interests of state will for a moment supersede all other considerations but if there was a rule that a sovereign never should let down his dignity without a sure payment to his interest the dignity of kings would be held high enough at present however fashion governs in more serious things than furniture and dress it looks as if sovereigns abroad were emulous in bidding against their estimation it seems as if the preëminence of regicide was acknowledgedand that kings tacitly ranked themselves below their sacrilegious murderers as natural magistrates and judges over them it appears as if dignity were the prerogative of crime and a temporizing humiliation the proper part for venerable authority if the vilest of mankind are resolved to be the most wicked they lose all the baseness of their origin and take their place above kings this example in foreign princes i trust will not spread it is the concern of mankind that the destruction of order should not be a claim to rank that crimes should not be the only title to preëminence and honor  at this second stage of humiliation i mean the insulting declaration in consequence of the message to both houses of parliament it might not have been amiss to pause and not to squander away the fund of our submissions until we knew what final purposes of public interest they might answer the policy of subjecting ourselves to further insults is not to me quite apparent it was resolved however to hazard a third trial citizen barthélemy had been established on the part of the new republic at baslewhere with his proconsulate of switzerland and the adjacent parts of germany he was appointed as a sort of factor to deal in the degradation of the crowned heads of europe at basle it was thought proper in order to keep others i suppose in countenance that great britain should appear at this market and bid with the rest for the mercy of the peopleking  on the 6th of march 1796 mr wickham in consequence of authority was desired to sound france on her disposition towards a general pacificationto know whether she would consent to send ministers to a congress at such a place as might be hereafter agreed uponwhether there would be a disposition to communicate the general grounds of a pacification such as france the diplomatic name of the regicide power would be willing to propose as a foundation for a negotiation for peace with his majesty and his allies or to suggest any other way of arriving at the same end of a general pacification but he had no authority to enter into any negotiation or discussion with citizen barthélemy upon these subjects  on the part of great britain this measure was a voluntary act wholly uncalled for on the part of regicide suits of this sort are at least strong indications of a desire for accommodation any other body of men but the directory would be somewhat soothed with such advances they could not however begin their answer which was given without much delay and communicated on the 28th of the same month without a preamble of insult and reproach they doubt the sincerity of the pacific intentions of this court she did not begin say they yet to know her real interests she did not seek peace with good faith this or something to this effect has been the constant preliminary observation now grown into a sort of office form on all our overtures to this power a perpetual charge on the british government of fraud evasion and habitual perfidy  it might be asked from whence did these opinions of our insincerity and ill faith arise it was because the british ministry leaving to the directory however to propose a better mode proposed a congress for the purpose of a general pacification and this they said would render negotiation endless from hence they immediately inferred a fraudulent intention in the offer unquestionably their mode of giving the law would bring matters to a more speedy conclusion as to any other method more agreeable to them than a congress an alternative expressly proposed to them they did not condescend to signify their pleasure  this refusal of treating conjointly with the powers allied against this republic furnishes matter for a great deal of serious reflection they have hitherto constantly declined any other than a treaty with a single power by thus dissociating every state from every other like deer separated from the herd each power is treated with on the merit of his being a deserter from the common cause in that light the regicide power finding each of them insulated and unprotected with great facility gives the law to them all by this system for the present an incurable distrust is sown amongst confederates and in future all alliance is rendered impracticable it is thus they have treated with prussia with spain with sardinia with bavaria with the ecclesiastical state with saxony and here we see them refuse to treat with great britain in any other mode they must be worse than blind who do not see with what undeviating regularity of system in this case and in all cases they pursue their scheme for the utter destruction of every independent powerespecially the smaller who cannot find any refuge whatever but in some common cause  renewing their taunts and reflections they tell mr wickham that their policy has no guides but openness and good faith and that their conduct shall be conformable to these principles they say concerning their government that yielding to the ardent desire by which it is animated to procure peace for the french republic and for all nations it will not fear to declare itself openly charged by the constitution with the execution of the laws it cannot make or listen to any proposal that would be contrary to them the constitutional act does not permit it to consent to any alienation of that which according to the existing laws constitutes the territory of the republic  with respect to the countries occupied by the french armies and which have not been united to france they as well as other interests political and commercial may become the subject of a negotiation which will present to the directory the means of proving how much it desires to attain speedily to a happy pacification that the directory is ready to receive in this respect any overtures that shall be just reasonable and compatible with the dignity of the republic  on the head of what is not to be the subject of negotiation the directory is clear and open as to what may be a matter of treaty all this open dealing is gone she retires into her shell there she expects overtures from you and you are to guess what she shall judge just reasonable and above all compatible with her dignity  in the records of pride there does not exist so insulting a declaration it is insolent in words in manner but in substance it is not only insulting but alarming it is a specimen of what may be expected from the masters we are preparing for our humbled country their openness and candor consist in a direct avowal of their despotism and ambition we know that their declared resolution had been to surrender no object belonging to france previous to the war they had resolved that the republic was entire and must remain so as to what she has conquered from the allies and united to the same indivisible body it is of the same nature that is the allies are to give up whatever conquests they have made or may make upon france but all which she has violently ravished from her neighbors and thought fit to appropriate are not to become so much as objects of negotiation  in this unity and indivisibility of possession are sunk ten immense and wealthy provinces full of strong flourishing and opulent cities the austrian netherlands the part of europe the most necessary to preserve any communication between this kingdom and its natural allies next to holland the most interesting to this country and without which holland must virtually belong to france savoy and nice the keys of italy and the citadel in her hands to bridle switzerland are in that consolidation the important territory of liege is torn out of the heart of the empire all these are integrant parts of the republic not to be subject to any discussion or to be purchased by any equivalent why because there is a law which prevents it what law the law of nations the acknowledged public law of europe treaties and conventions of parties nonot a pretence of the kind it is a declaration not made in consequence of any prescription on her sidenot on any cession or dereliction actual or tacit of other powers it is a declaration pendente lite in the middle of a war one principal object of which was originally the defence and has since been the recovery of these very countries  this strange law is not made for a trivial object not for a single port or for a single fortress but for a great kingdomfor the religion the morals the laws the liberties the lives and fortunes of millions of human creatures who without their consent or that of their lawful government are by an arbitrary act of this regicide and homicide government which they call a law incorporated into their tyranny  in other words their will is the law not only at home but as to the concerns of every nation who has made that law but the regicide republic itself whose laws like those of the medes and persians they cannot alter or abrogate or even so much as take into consideration without the least ceremony or compliment they have sent out of the world whole sets of laws and lawgivers they have swept away the very constitutions under which the legislatures acted and the laws were made even the fundamental sacred rights of man they have not scrupled to profane they have set this holy code at nought with ignominy and scorn thus they treat all their domestic laws and constitutions and even what they had considered as a law of nature but whatever they have put their seal on for the purposes of their ambition and the ruin of their neighbors this alone is invulnerable impassible immortal assuming to be masters of everything human and divine here and here alone it seems they are limited cooped and cabined in and this omnipotent legislature finds itself wholly without the power of exercising its favorite attribute the love of peace in other words they are powerful to usurp impotent to restore and equally by their power and their impotence they aggrandize themselves and weaken and impoverish you and all other nations  nothing can be more proper or more manly than the state publication called a note on this proceeding dated downing street the 10th of april 1796 only that it is better expressed it perfectly agrees with the opinion i have taken the liberty of submitting to your consideration i place it below at full length25 as my justification in thinking that this astonishing paper from the directory is not only a direct negative to all treaty but is a rejection of every principle upon which treaties could be made to admit it for a moment were to erect this power usurped at home into a legislature to govern mankind it is an authority that on a thousand occasions they have asserted in claim and whenever they are able exerted in practice the dereliction of this whole scheme of policy became therefore an indispensable previous condition to all renewal of treaty the remark of the british cabinet on this arrogant and tyrannical claim is natural and unavoidable our ministry state that while these dispositions shall be persisted in nothing is left for the king but to prosecute a war that is just and necessary  it was of course that we should wait until the enemy showed some sort of disposition on his part to fulfil this condition it was hoped indeed that our suppliant strains might be suffered to steal into the august ear in a more propitious season that season however invoked by so many vows conjurations and prayers did not come every declaration of hostility renovated and every act pursued with double animositythe overrunning of lombardythe subjugation of piedmontthe possession of its impregnable fortressesthe seizing on all the neutral states of italyour expulsion from leghorninstances forever renewed for our expulsion from genoaspain rendered subject to them and hostile to usportugal bent under the yokehalf the empire overrun and ravagedwere the only signs which this mild republic thought proper to manifest of her pacific sentiments every demonstration of an implacable rancor and an untamable pride were the only encouragements we received to the renewal of our supplications  here therefore they and we were fixed nothing was left to the british ministry but to prosecute a war just and necessarya war equally just as at the time of our engaging in ita war become ten times more necessary by everything which happened afterwards this resolution was soon however forgot it felt the heat of the season and melted away new hopes were entertained from supplication no expectations indeed were then formed from renewing a direct application to the french regicides through the agentgeneral for the humiliation of sovereigns at length a step was taken in degradation which even went lower than all the rest deficient in merits of our own a mediator was to be soughtand we looked for that mediator at berlin the king of prussias merits in abandoning the general cause might have obtained for him some sort of influence in favor of those whom he had deserted but i have never heard that his prussian majesty had lately discovered so marked an affection for the court of st jamess or for the court of vienna as to excite much hope of his interposing a very powerful mediation to deliver them from the distresses into which he had brought them  if humiliation is the element in which we live if it is become not only our occasional policy but our habit no great objection can be made to the modes in which it may be diversifiedthough i confess i cannot be charmed with the idea of our exposing our lazar sores at the door of every proud servitor of the french republic where the court dogs will not deign to lick them we had if i am not mistaken a minister at that court who might try its temper and recede and advance as he found backwardness or encouragement but to send a gentleman there on no other errand than this and with no assurance whatever that he should not find what he did find a repulse seems to me to go far beyond all the demands of a humiliation merely politic i hope it did not arise from a predilection for that mode of conduct  the cup of bitterness was not however drained to the dregs basle and berlin were not sufficient after so many and so diversified repulses we were resolved to make another experiment and to try another mediator among the unhappy gentlemen in whose persons royalty is insulted and degraded at the seat of plebeian pride and upstart insolence there is a minister from denmark at paris without any previous encouragement to that any more than the other steps we sent through this turnpike to demand a passport for a person who on our part was to solicit peace in the metropolis at the footstool of regicide itself it was not to be expected that any one of those degraded beings could have influence enough to settle any part of the terms in favor of the candidates for further degradation besides such intervention would be a direct breach in their system which did not permit one sovereign power to utter a word in the concerns of his equalanother repulse we were desired to apply directly in our persons we submitted and made the application  it might be thought that here at length we had touched the bottom of humiliation our lead was brought up covered with mud but in the lowest deep a lower deep was to open for us still more profound abysses of disgrace and shame however in we leaped we came forward in our own name the passport such a passport and safeconduct as would be granted to thieves who might come in to betray their accomplices and no better was granted to british supplication to leave no doubt of its spirit as soon as the rumor of this act of condescension could get abroad it was formally announced with an explanation from authority containing an invective against the ministry of great britain their habitual frauds their proverbial punic perfidy no such statepaper as a preliminary to a negotiation for peace has ever yet appeared very few declarations of war have ever shown so much and so unqualified animosity i place it below26 as a diplomatic curiosity and in order to be the better understood in the few remarks i have to make upon a peace which indeed defies all description none but itself can be its parallel  i pass by all the insolence and contumely of the performance as it comes from them the present question is not how we are to be affected with it in regard to our dignity that is gone i shall say no more about it light lie the earth on the ashes of english pride i shall only observe upon it politically and as furnishing a direction for our own conduct in this low business  the very idea of a negotiation for peace whatever the inward sentiments of the parties may be implies some confidence in their faith some degree of belief in the professions which are made concerning it a temporary and occasional credit at least is granted otherwise men stumble on the very threshold i therefore wish to ask what hope we can have of their good faith who as the very basis of the negotiation assume the ill faith and treachery of those they have to deal with the terms as against us must be such as imply a full security against a treacherous conductthat is such terms as this directory stated in its first declaration to place us in an utter impossibility of executing our wretched projects this is the omen and the sole omen under which we have consented to open our treaty  the second observation i have to make upon it much connected undoubtedly with the first is that they have informed you of the result they propose from the kind of peace they mean to grant you that is to say the union they propose among nations with the view of rivalling our trade and destroying our naval power and this they suppose and with good reason too must be the inevitable effect of their peace it forms one of their principal grounds for suspecting our ministers could not be in good earnest in their proposition they make no scruple beforehand to tell you the whole of what they intend and this is what we call in the modern style the acceptance of a proposition for peace in old language it would be called a most haughty offensive and insolent rejection of all treaty  thirdly they tell you what they conceive to be the perfidious policy which dictates your delusive offer that is the design of cheating not only them but the people of england against whose interest and inclination this war is supposed to be carried on  if we proceed in this business under this preliminary declaration it seems to me that we admit now for the third time by something a great deal stronger than words the truth of the charges of every kind which they make upon the british ministry and the grounds of those foul imputations the language used by us which in other circumstances would not be exceptionable in this case tends very strongly to confirm and realize the suspicion of our enemy i mean the declaration that if we do not obtain such terms of peace as suits our opinion of what our interests require then and in that case we shall continue the war with vigor this offer so reasoned plainly implies that without it our leaders themselves entertain great doubts of the opinion and good affections of the british people otherwise there does not appear any cause why we should proceed under the scandalous construction of our enemy upon the former offer made by mr wickham and on the new offer made directly at paris it is not therefore from a sense of dignity but from the danger of radicating that false sentiment in the breasts of the enemy that i think under the auspices of this declaration we cannot with the least hope of a good event or indeed with any regard to the common safety proceed in the train of this negotiation i wish ministry would seriously consider the importance of their seeming to confirm the enemy in an opinion that his frequent use of appeals to the people against their government has not been without its effect if it puts an end to this war it will render another impracticable  whoever goes to the directorial presence under this passport with this offensive comment and foul explanation goes in the avowed sense of the court to which he is sent as the instrument of a government dissociated from the interests and wishes of the nation for the purpose of cheating both the people of france and the people of england he goes out the declared emissary of a faithless ministry he has perfidy for his credentials he has national weakness for his full powers i yet doubt whether any one can be found to invest himself with that character if there should it would be pleasant to read his instructions on the answer which he is to give to the directory in case they should repeat to him the substance of the manifesto which he carries with him in his portfolio  so much for the first manifesto of the regicide court which went along with the passport lest this declaration should seem the effect of haste or a mere sudden effusion of pride and insolence on full deliberation about a week after comes out a second this manifesto is dated the 5th of october one day before the speech from the throne on the vigil of the festive day of cordial unanimity so happily celebrated by all parties in the british parliament in this piece the regicides our worthy friends i call them by advance and by courtesy what by law i shall be obliged to call them hereafter our worthy friends i say renew and enforce the former declaration concerning our faith and sincerity which they pinned to our passport on three other points which run through all their declarations they are more explicit than ever  first they more directly undertake to be the real representatives of the people of this kingdom and on a supposition in which they agree with our parliamentary reformers that the house of commons is not that representative the function being vacant they as our true constitutional organ inform his majesty and the world of the sense of the nation they tell us that the english people see with regret his majestys government squandering away the funds which had been granted to him this astonishing assumption of the public voice of england is but a slight foretaste of the usurpation which on a peace we may be assured they will make of all the powers in all the parts of our vassal constitution if they do these things in the green tree what shall be done in the dry  next they tell us as a condition to our treaty that this government must abjure the unjust hatred it bears to them and at last open its ears to the voice of humanity truly this is even from them an extraordinary demand hitherto it seems we have put wax into our ears to shut them up against the tender soothing strains in the affettuoso of humanity warbled from the throats of reubell carnot tallien and the whole chorus of confiscators domiciliary visitors committeemen of research jurors and presidents of revolutionary tribunals regicides assassins massacrers and septembrisers it is not difficult to discern what sort of humanity our government is to learn from these siren singers our government also i admit with some reason as a step towards the proposed fraternity is required to abjure the unjust hatred which it bears to this body of honor and virtue i thank god i am neither a minister nor a leader of opposition i protest i cannot do what they desire i could not do it if i were under the guillotineor as they ingeniously and pleasantly express it looking out of the little national window even at that opening i could receive none of their light i am fortified against all such affections by the declaration of the government which i must yet consider as lawful made on the 29th of october 179327 and still ringing in my ears this declaration was transmitted not only to all our commanders by sea and land but to our ministers in every court of europe it is the most eloquent and highly finished in the style the most judicious in the choice of topics the most orderly in the arrangement and the most rich in the coloring without employing the smallest degree of exaggeration of any statepaper that has ever yet appeared an ancient writer plutarch i think it is quotes some verses on the eloquence of pericles who is called the only orator that left stings in the minds of his hearers like his the eloquence of the declaration not contradicting but enforcing sentiments of the truest humanity has left stings that have penetrated more than skindeep into my mind and never can they be extracted by all the surgery of murder never can the throbbings they have created be assuaged by all the emollient cataplasms of robbery and confiscation i cannot love the republic  the third point which they have more clearly expressed than ever is of equal importance with the rest and with them furnishes a complete view of the regicide system for they demand as a condition without which our ambassador of obedience cannot be received with any hope of success that he shall be provided with full powers to negotiate a peace between the french republic and great britain and to conclude it definitively between the two powers with their spear they draw a circle about us they will hear nothing of a joint treaty we must make a peace separately from our allies we must as the very first and preliminary step be guilty of that perfidy towards our friends and associates with which they reproach us in our transactions with them our enemies we are called upon scandalously to betray the fundamental securities to ourselves and to all nations in my opinion it is perhaps but a poor one if we are meanly bold enough to send an ambassador such as this official note of the enemy requires we cannot even dispatch our emissary without danger of being charged with a breach of our alliance government now understands the full meaning of the passport  strange revolutions have happened in the ways of thinking and in the feelings of men but it is a very extraordinary coalition of parties indeed and a kind of unheardof unanimity in public councils which can impose this newdiscovered system of negotiation as sound national policy on the understanding of a spectator of this wonderful scene who judges on the principles of anything he ever before saw read or heard of and above all on the understanding of a person who has in his eye the transactions of the last seven years  i know it is supposed that if good terms of capitulation are not granted after we have thus so repeatedly hung out the white flag the national spirit will revive with tenfold ardor this is an experiment cautiously to be made reculer pour mieux sauter according to the french byword cannot be trusted to as a general rule of conduct to diet a man into weakness and languor afterwards to give him the greater strength has more of the empiric than the rational physician it is true that some persons have been kicked into courageand this is no bad hint to give to those who are too forward and liberal in bestowing insults and outrages on their passive companions but such a course does not at first view appear a wellchosen discipline to form men to a nice sense of honor or a quick resentment of injuries a long habit of humiliation does not seem a very good preparative to manly and vigorous sentiment it may not leave perhaps enough of energy in the mind fairly to discern what are good terms or what are not men low and dispirited may regard those terms as not at all amiss which in another state of mind they would think intolerable if they grow peevish in this state of mind they may be roused not against the enemy whom they have been taught to fear but against the ministry28 who are more within their reach and who have refused conditions that are not unreasonable from power that they have been taught to consider as irresistible  if all that for some months i have heard have the least foundation i hope it has not the ministers are perhaps not quite so much to be blamed as their condition is to be lamented i have been given to understand that these proceedings are not in their origin properly theirs it is said that there is a secret in the house of commons it is said that ministers act not according to the votes but according to the dispositions of the majority i hear that the minority has long since spoken the general sense of the nation and that to prevent those who compose it from having the open and avowed lead in that house or perhaps in both houses it was necessary to preoccupy their ground and to take their propositions out of their mouths even with the hazard of being afterwards reproached with a compliance which it was foreseen would be fruitless  if the general disposition of the people be as i hear it is for an immediate peace with regicide without so much as considering our public and solemn engagements to the party in france whose cause we had espoused or the engagements expressed in our general alliances not only without an inquiry into the terms but with a certain knowledge that none but the worst terms will be offered it is all over with us it is strange but it may be true that as the danger from jacobinism is increased in my eyes and in yours the fear of it is lessened in the eyes of many people who formerly regarded it with horror it seems they act under the impression of terrors of another sort which have frightened them out of their first apprehensions but let their fears or their hopes or their desires be what they will they should recollect that they who would make peace without a previous knowledge of the terms make a surrender they are conquered they do not treat they receive the law is this the disposition of the people of england then the people of england are contented to seek in the kindness of a foreign systematic enemy combined with a dangerous faction at home a security which they cannot find in their own patriotism and their own courage they are willing to trust to the sympathy of regicides the guaranty of the british monarchy they are content to rest their religion on the piety of atheists by establishment they are satisfied to seek in the clemency of practised murderers the security of their lives they are pleased to confide their property to the safeguard of those who are robbers by inclination interest habit and system if this be our deliberate mind truly we deserve to lose what it is impossible we should long retain the name of a nation  in matters of state a constitutional competence to act is in many cases the smallest part of the question without disputing god forbid i should dispute the sole competence of the king and the parliament each in its province to decide on war and peace i venture to say no war can be long carried on against the will of the people this war in particular cannot be carried on unless they are enthusiastically in favor of it acquiescence will not do there must be zeal universal zeal in such a cause and at such a time as this is cannot be looked for neither is it necessary zeal in the larger part carries the force of the whole without this no government certainly not our government is capable of a great war none of the ancient regular governments have wherewithal to fight abroad with a foreign foe and at home to overcome repining reluctance and chicane it must be some portentous thing like regicide france that can exhibit such a prodigy yet even she the mother of monsters more prolific than the country of old called ferax monstrorum shows symptoms of being almost effete already and she will be so unless the fallow of a peace comes to recruit her fertility but whatever may be represented concerning the meanness of the popular spirit i for one do not think so desperately of the british nation our minds as i said are light but they are not depraved we are dreadfully open to delusion and to dejection but we are capable of being animated and undeceived  it cannot be concealed we are a divided people but in divisions where a part is to be taken we are to make a muster of our strength i have often endeavored to compute and to class those who in any political view are to be called the people without doing something of this sort we must proceed absurdly we should not be much wiser if we pretended to very great accuracy in our estimate but i think in the calculation i have made the error cannot be very material in england and scotland i compute that those of adult age not declining in life of tolerable leisure for such discussions and of some means of information more or less and who are above menial dependence or what virtually is such may amount to about four hundred thousand there is such a thing as a natural representative of the people this body is that representative and on this body more than on the legal constituent the artificial representative depends this is the british public and it is a public very numerous the rest when feeble are the objects of protectionwhen strong the means of force they who affect to consider that part of us in any other light insult while they cajole us they do not want us for counsellors in deliberation but to list us as soldiers for battle  of these four hundred thousand political citizens i look upon one fifth or about eighty thousand to be pure jacobins utterly incapable of amendment objects of eternal vigilance and when they break out of legal constraint on these no reason no argument no example no venerable authority can have the slightest influence they desire a change and they will have it if they can if they cannot have it by english cabal they will make no sort of scruple of having it by the cabal of france into which already they are virtually incorporated it is only their assured and confident expectation of the advantages of french fraternity and the approaching blessings of regicide intercourse that skins over their mischievous dispositions with a momentary quiet  this minority is great and formidable i do not know whether if i aimed at the total overthrow of a kingdom i should wish to be incumbered with a larger body of partisans they are more easily disciplined and directed than if the number were greater these by their spirit of intrigue and by their restless agitating activity are of a force far superior to their numbers and if times grew the least critical have the means of debauching or intimidating many of those who are now sound as well as of adding to their force large bodies of the more passive part of the nation this minority is numerous enough to make a mighty cry for peace or for war or for any object they are led vehemently to desire by passing from place to place with a velocity incredible and diversifying their character and description they are capable of mimicking the general voice we must not always judge of the generality of the opinion by the noise of the acclamation  the majority the other four fifths is perfectly sound and of the best possible disposition to religion to government to the true and undivided interest of their country such men are naturally disposed to peace they who are in possession of all they wish are languid and improvident with this fault and i admit its existence in all its extent they would not endure to hear of a peace that led to the ruin of everything for which peace is dear to them however the desire of peace is essentially the weak side of that kind of men all men that are ruined are ruined on the side of their natural propensities there they are unguarded above all good men do not suspect that their destruction is attempted through their virtues this their enemies are perfectly aware of and accordingly they the most turbulent of mankind who never made a scruple to shake the tranquillity of their country to its centre raise a continual cry for peace with france peace with regicide and war with the rest of the world is their motto from the beginning and even whilst the french gave the blows and we hardly opposed the vis inertiæ to their efforts from that day to this hour like importunate guineafowls crying one note day and night they have called for peace  in this they are as i confess in all things they are perfectly consistent they who wish to unite themselves to your enemies naturally desire that you should disarm yourself by a peace with these enemies but it passes my conception how they who wish well to their country on its ancient system of laws and manners come not to be doubly alarmed when they find nothing but a clamor for peace in the mouths of the men on earth the least disposed to it in their natural or in their habitual character  i have a good opinion of the general abilities of the jacobins not that i suppose them better born than others but strong passions awaken the faculties they suffer not a particle of the man to be lost the spirit of enterprise gives to this description the full use of all their native energies if i have reason to conceive that my enemy who as such must have an interest in my destruction is also a person of discernment and sagacity then i must be quite sure that in a contest the object he violently pursues is the very thing by which my ruin is likely to be the most perfectly accomplished why do the jacobins cry for peace because they know that this point gained the rest will follow of course on our part why are all the rules of prudence as sure as the laws of material nature to be at this time reversed how comes it that now for the first time men think it right to be governed by the counsels of their enemies ought they not rather to tremble when they are persuaded to travel on the same road and to tend to the same place of rest  the minority i speak of is not susceptible of an impression from the topics of argument to be used to the larger part of the community i therefore do not address to them any part of what i have to say the more forcibly i drive my arguments against their system so as to make an impression where i wish to make it the more strongly i rivet them in their sentiments as for us who compose the far larger and what i call the far better part of the people let me say that we have not been quite fairly dealt with when called to this deliberation the jacobin minority have been abundantly supplied with stores and provisions of all kinds towards their warfare no sort of argumentative materials suited to their purposes have been withheld false they are unsound sophistical but they are regular in their direction they all bear one way and they all go to the support of the substantial merits of their cause the others have not had the question so much as fairly stated to them  there has not been in this century any foreign peace or war in its origin the fruit of popular desire except the war that was made with spain in 1739 sir robert walpole was forced into the war by the people who were inflamed to this measure by the most leading politicians by the first orators and the greatest poets of the time for that war pope sang his dying notes for that war johnson in more energetic strains employed the voice of his early genius for that war glover distinguished himself in the way in which his muse was the most natural and happy the crowd readily followed the politicians in the cry for a war which threatened little bloodshed and which promised victories that were attended with something more solid than glory a war with spain was a war of plunder in the present conflict with regicide mr pitt has not hitherto had nor will perhaps for a few days have many prizes to hold out in the lottery of war to tempt the lower part of our character he can only maintain it by an appeal to the higher and to those in whom that higher part is the most predominant he must look the most for his support whilst he holds out no inducements to the wise nor bribes to the avaricious he may be forced by a vulgar cry into a peace ten times more ruinous than the most disastrous war the weaker he is in the fund of motives which apply to our avarice to our laziness and to our lassitude if he means to carry the war to any end at all the stronger he ought to be in his addresses to our magnanimity and to our reason  in stating that walpole was driven by a popular clamor into a measure not to be justified i do not mean wholly to excuse his conduct my time of observation did not exactly coincide with that event but i read much of the controversies then carried on several years after the contests of parties had ceased the people were amused and in a degree warmed with them the events of that era seemed then of magnitude which the revolutions of our time have reduced to parochial importance and the debates which then shook the nation now appear of no higher moment than a discussion in a vestry when i was very young a general fashion told me i was to admire some of the writings against that minister a little more maturity taught me as much to despise them i observed one fault in his general proceeding he never manfully put forward the entire strength of his cause he temporized be managed and adopting very nearly the sentiments of his adversaries he opposed their inferences this for a political commander is the choice of a weak post his adversaries had the better of the argument as he handled it not as the reason and justice of his cause enabled him to manage it i say this after having seen and with some care examined the original documents concerning certain important transactions of those times they perfectly satisfied me of the extreme injustice of that war and of the falsehood of the colors which to his own ruin and guided by a mistaken policy he suffered to be daubed over that measure some years after it was my fortune to converse with many of the principal actors against that minister and with those who principally excited that clamor none of them no not one did in the least defend the measure or attempt to justify their conduct they condemned it as freely as they would have done in commenting upon any proceeding in history in which they were totally unconcerned thus it will be they who stir up the people to improper desires whether of peace or war will be condemned by themselves they who weakly yield to them will be condemned by history  in my opinion the present ministry are as far from doing full justice to their cause in this war as walpole was from doing justice to the peace which at that time he was willing to preserve they throw the light on one side only of their case though it is impossible they should not observe that the other side which is kept in the shade has its importance too they must know that france is formidable not only as she is france but as she is jacobin france they knew from the beginning that the jacobin party was not confined to that country they knew they felt the strong disposition of the same faction in both countries to communicate and to coöperate for some time past these two points have been kept and even industriously kept out of sight france is considered as merely a foreign power and the seditious english only as a domestic faction the merits of the war with the former have been argued solely on political grounds to prevent the mischievous doctrines of the latter from corrupting our minds matter and argument have been supplied abundantly and even to surfeit on the excellency of our own government but nothing has been done to make us feel in what manner the safety of that government is connected with the principle and with the issue of this war for anything which in the late discussion has appeared the war is entirely collateral to the state of jacobinismas truly a foreign war to us and to all our home concerns as the war with spain in 1739 about guardacostas the madrid convention and the fable of captain jenkinss ears  whenever the adverse party has raised a cry for peace with the regicide the answer has been little more than this that the administration wished for such a peace full as much as the opposition but that the time was not convenient for making it whatever else has been said was much in the same spirit reasons of this kind never touched the substantial merits of the war they were in the nature of dilatory pleas exceptions of form previous questions accordingly all the arguments against a compliance with what was represented as the popular desire urged on with all possible vehemence and earnestness by the jacobins have appeared flat and languid feeble and evasive they appeared to aim only at gaining time they never entered into the peculiar and distinctive character of the war they spoke neither to the understanding nor to the heart cold as ice themselves they never could kindle in our breasts a spark of that zeal which is necessary to a conflict with an adverse zeal much less were they made to infuse into our minds that stubborn persevering spirit which alone is capable of bearing up against those vicissitudes of fortune which will probably occur and those burdens which must be inevitably borne in a long war i speak it emphatically and with a desire that it should be markedin a long war because without such a war no experience has yet told us that a dangerous power has ever been reduced to measure or to reason i do not throw back my view to the peloponnesian war of twentyseven years nor to two of the punic wars the first of twentyfour the second of eighteen nor to the more recent war concluded by the treaty of westphalia which continued i think for thirty i go to what is but just fallen behind living memory and immediately touches our own country let the portion of our history from the year 1689 to 1713 be brought before us we shall find that in all that period of twentyfour years there were hardly five that could be called a season of peace and the interval between the two wars was in reality nothing more than a very active preparation for renovated hostility during that period every one of the propositions of peace came from the enemy the first when they were accepted at the peace of ryswick the second where they were rejected at the congress at gertruydenberg the last when the war ended by the treaty of utrecht even then a very great part of the nation and that which contained by far the most intelligent statesmen was against the conclusion of the war i do not enter into the merits of that question as between the parties i only state the existence of that opinion as a fact from whence you may draw such an inference as you think properly arises from it  it is for us at present to recollect what we have been and to consider what if we please we may be still at the period of those wars our principal strength was found in the resolution of the people and that in the resolution of a part only of the then whole which bore no proportion to our existing magnitude england and scotland were not united at the beginning of that mighty struggle when in the course of the contest they were conjoined it was in a raw an illcemented an unproductive union for the whole duration of the war and long after the names and other outward and visible signs of approximation rather augmented than diminished our insular feuds they were rather the causes of new discontents and new troubles than promoters of cordiality and affection the now single and potent great britain was then not only two countries but from the party heats in both and the divisions formed in each of them each of the old kingdoms within itself in effect was made up of two hostile nations ireland now so large a source of the common opulence and power and which wisely managed might be made much more beneficial and much more effective was then the heaviest of the burdens an army not much less than forty thousand men was drawn from the general effort to keep that kingdom in a poor unfruitful and resourceless subjection  such was the state of the empire the state of our finances was worse if possible every branch of the revenue became less productive after the revolution silver not as now a sort of counter but the body of the current coin was reduced so low as not to have above three parts in four of the value in the shilling in the greater part the value hardly amounted to a fourth it required a dead expense of three millions sterling to renew the coinage public credit that great but ambiguous principle which has so often been predicted as the cause of our certain ruin but which for a century has been the constant companion and often the means of our prosperity and greatness had its origin and was cradled i may say in bankruptcy and beggary at this day we have seen parties contending to be admitted at a moderate premium to advance eighteen millions to the exchequer for infinitely smaller loans the chancellor of the exchequer of that day montagu the father of public credit countersecuring the state by the appearance of the city with the lord mayor of london at his side was obliged like a solicitor for an hospital to go cap in hand from shop to shop to borrow an hundred pound and even smaller sums when made up in driblets as they could their best securities were at an interest of twelve per cent even the paper of the bank now at par with cash and generally preferred to it was often at a discount of twenty per cent by this the state of the rest may be judged  as to our commerce the imports and exports of the nation now sixandforty million did not then amount to ten the inland trade which is commonly passed by in this sort of estimates but which in part growing out of the foreign and connected with it is more advantageous and more substantially nutritive to the state is not only grown in a proportion of near five to one as the foreign but has been augmented at least in a tenfold proportion when i came to england i remember but one river navigation the rate of carriage on which was limited by an act of parliament it was made in the reign of william the third i mean that of the aire and calder the rate was settled at thirteen pence so high a price demonstrated the feebleness of these beginnings of our inland intercourse in my time one of the longest and sharpest contests i remember in your house and which rather resembled a violent contention amongst national parties than a local dispute was as well as i can recollect to hold the price up to threepence even this which a very scanty justice to the proprietors required was done with infinite difficulty as to private credit there were not as i believe twelve bankers shops at that time out of london in this their number when i first saw the country i cannot be quite exact but certainly those machines of domestic credit were then very few they are now in almost every markettown and this circumstance whether the thing be carried to an excess or not demonstrates the astonishing increase of private confidence of general circulation and of internal commercean increase out of all proportion to the growth of the foreign trade our naval strength in the time of king williams war was nearly matched by that of france and though conjoined with holland then a maritime power hardly inferior to our own even with that force we were not always victorious though finally superior the allied fleets experienced many unpleasant reverses on their own element in two years three thousand vessels were taken from the english trade on the continent we lost almost every battle we fought  in 1697 it is not quite an hundred years ago in that state of things amidst the general debasement of the coin the fall of the ordinary revenue the failure of all the extraordinary supplies the ruin of commerce and the almost total extinction of an infant credit the chancellor of the exchequer himself whom we have just seen begging from door to door came forward to move a resolution full of vigor in which far from being discouraged by the generally adverse fortune and the long continuance of the war the commons agreed to address the crown in the following manly spirited and truly animating style  this is the eighth year in which your majestys most dutiful and loyal subjects the commons in parliament assembled have assisted your majesty with large supplies for carrying on a just and necessary war in defence of our religion preservation of our laws and vindication of the rights and liberties of the people of england  afterwards they proceed in this manner  and to show to your majesty and all christendom that the commons of england will not be amused or diverted from their firm resolutions of obtaining by war a safe and honorable peace we do in the name of all those we represent renew our assurances to your majesty that this house will support your majesty and your government against all your enemies both at home and abroad and that they will effectually assist you in the prosecution and carrying on the present war against france  the amusement and diversion they speak of was the suggestion of a treaty proposed by the enemy and announced from the throne thus the people of england felt in the eighth not in the fourth year of the war no sighing or panting after negotiation no motions from the opposition to force the ministry into a peace no messages from ministers to palsy and deaden the resolution of parliament or the spirit of the nation they did not so much as advise the king to listen to the propositions of the enemy nor to seek for peace but through the mediation of a vigorous war this address was moved in an hot a divided a factious and in a great part disaffected house of commons and it was carried nemine contradicente  while that first war which was ill smothered by the treaty of ryswick slept in the thin ashes of a seeming peace a new conflagration was in its immediate causes a fresh and a far greater war was in preparation a year had hardly elapsed when arrangements were made for renewing the contest with tenfold fury the steps which were taken at that time to compose to reconcile to unite and to discipline all europe against the growth of france certainly furnish to a statesman the finest and most interesting part in the history of that great period it formed the masterpiece of king williams policy dexterity and perseverance full of the idea of preserving not only a local civil liberty united with order to our country but to embody it in the political liberty the order and the independence of nations united under a natural head the king called upon his parliament to put itself into a posture to preserve to england the weight and influence it at present had on the councils and affairs abroad it will be requisite europe should see you will not be wanting to yourselves  baffled as that monarch was and almost heartbroken at the disappointment he met with in the mode he first proposed for that great end he held on his course he was faithful to his object and in councils as in arms over and over again repulsed over and over again he returned to the charge all the mortifications he had suffered from the last parliament and the greater he had to apprehend from that newly chosen were not capable of relaxing the vigor of his mind he was in holland when he combined the vast plan of his foreign negotiations when he came to open his design to his ministers in england even the sober firmness of somers the undaunted resolution of shrewsbury and the adventurous spirit of montagu and orford were staggered they were not yet mounted to the elevation of the king the cabinet then the regency met on the subject at tunbridge wells the 28th of august 1698 and there lord somers holding the pen after expressing doubts on the state of the continent which they ultimately refer to the king as best informed they give him a most discouraging portrait of the spirit of this nation so far as relates to england say these ministers it would be want of duty not to give your majesty this clear account that there is a deadness and want of spirit in the nation universally so as not at all to be disposed to the thought of entering into a new war and that they seem to be tired out with taxes to a degree beyond what was discerned till it appeared upon the occasion of the late elections this is the truth of the fact upon which your majesty will determine what resolutions are proper to be taken  his majesty did determineand did take and pursue his resolution in all the tottering imbecility of a new government and with parliament totally unmanageable he persevered he persevered to expel the fears of his people by his fortitude to steady their fickleness by his constancy to expand their narrow prudence by his enlarged wisdom to sink their factious temper in his public spirit in spite of his people he resolved to make them great and gloriousto make england inclined to shrink into her narrow self the arbitress of europe the tutelary angel of the human race in spite of the ministers who staggered under the weight that his mind imposed upon theirs unsupported as they felt themselves by the popular spirit he infused into them his own soul he renewed in them their ancient heart he rallied them in the same cause  it required some time to accomplish this work the people were first gained and through them their distracted representatives under the influence of king william holland had rejected the allurements of every seduction and had resisted the terrors of every menace with hannibal at her gates she had nobly and magnanimously refused all separate treaty or anything which might for a moment appear to divide her affection or her interest or even to distinguish her in identity from england having settled the great point of the consolidation which he hoped would be eternal of the countries made for a common interest and common sentiment the king in his message to both houses calls their attention to the affairs of the states general the house of lords was perfectly sound and entirely impressed with the wisdom and dignity of the kings proceedings in answer to the message which you will observe was narrowed to a single point the danger of the states general after the usual professions of zeal for his service the lords opened themselves at large they go far beyond the demands of the message they express themselves as follows  we take this occasion further to assure your majesty we are very sensible of the great and imminent danger to which the states general are at present exposed and we do perfectly agree with them in believing that their safety and ours are so inseparably united that whatsoever is ruin to the one must be fatal to the other  and we humbly desire your majesty will be pleased not only to make good all the articles of any former treaty to the states general but that you will enter into a strict league offensive and defensive with them for our common preservation and that you will invite into it all princes and states who are concerned in the present visible danger arising from the union of france and spain  and we further desire your majesty that you will be pleased to enter into such alliances with the emperor as your majesty shall think fit pursuant to the ends of the treaty of 1689 towards all which we assure your majesty of our hearty and sincere assistance not doubting but whenever your majesty shall be obliged to engage for the defence of your allies and for securing the liberty and quiet of europe almighty god will protect your sacred person in so righteous a cause and that the unanimity wealth and courage of your subjects will carry your majesty with honor and success through all the difficulties of a just war  the house of commons was more reserved the late popular disposition was still in a great degree prevalent in the representative after it had been made to change in the constituent body the principle of the grand alliance was not directly recognized in the resolution of the commons nor the war announced though they were well aware the alliance was formed for the war however compelled by the returning sense of the people they went so far as to fix the three great immovable pillars of the safety and greatness of england as they were then as they are now and as they must ever be to the end of time they asserted in general terms the necessity of supporting holland of keeping united with our allies and maintaining the liberty of europe though they restricted their vote to the succors stipulated by actual treaty but now they were fairly embarked they were obliged to go with the course of the vessel and the whole nation split before into an hundred adverse factions with a king at its head evidently declining to his tomb the whole nation lords commons and people proceeded as one body informed by one soul under the british union the union of europe was consolidated and it long held together with a degree of cohesion firmness and fidelity not known before or since in any political combination of that extent  just as the last hand was given to this immense and complicated machine the master workman died but the work was formed on true mechanical principles and it was as truly wrought it went by the impulse it had received from the first mover the man was dead but the grand alliance survived in which king william lived and reigned that heartless and dispirited people whom lord somers had represented about two years before as dead in energy and operation continued that war to which it was supposed they were unequal in mind and in means for near thirteen years  for what have i entered into all this detail to what purpose have i recalled your view to the end of the last century it has been done to show that the british nation was then a great peopleto point out how and by what means they came to be exalted above the vulgar level and to take that lead which they assumed among mankind to qualify us for that preëminence we had then an high mind and a constancy unconquerable we were then inspired with no flashy passions but such as were durable as well as warm such as corresponded to the great interests we had at stake this force of character was inspired as all such spirit must ever be from above government gave the impulse as well may we fancy that of itself the sea will swell and that without winds the billows will insult the adverse shore as that the gross mass of the people will be moved and elevated and continue by a steady and permanent direction to bear upon one point without the influence of superior authority or superior mind  this impulse ought in my opinion to have been given in this war and it ought to have been continued to it at every instant it is made if ever war was made to touch all the great springs of action in the human breast it ought not to have been a war of apology the minister had in this conflict wherewithal to glory in success to be consoled in adversity to hold high his principle in all fortunes if it were not given him to support the falling edifice he ought to bury himself under the ruins of the civilized world all the art of greece and all the pride and power of eastern monarchs never heaped upon their ashes so grand a monument  there were days when his great mind was up to the crisis of the world he is called to act in29 his manly eloquence was equal to the elevated wisdom of such sentiments but the little have triumphed over the great an unnatural as it should seem not an unusual victory i am sure you cannot forget with how much uneasiness we heard in conversation the language of more than one gentleman at the opening of this contestthat he was willing to try the war for a year or two and if it did not succeed then to vote for peace as if war was a matter of experiment as if you could take it up or lay it down as an idle frolic as if the dire goddess that presides over it with her murderous spear in her hand and her gorgon at her breast was a coquette to be flirted with we ought with reverence to approach that tremendous divinity that loves courage but commands counsel war never leaves where it found a nation it is never to be entered into without a mature deliberationnot a deliberation lengthened out into a perplexing indecision but a deliberation leading to a sure and fixed judgment when so taken up it is not to be abandoned without reason as valid as fully and as extensively considered peace may be made as unadvisedly as war nothing is so rash as fear and the counsels of pusillanimity very rarely put off whilst they are always sure to aggravate the evils from which they would fly  in that great war carried on against louis the fourteenth for near eighteen years government spared no pains to satisfy the nation that though they were to be animated by a desire of glory glory was not their ultimate object but that everything dear to them in religion in law in liberty everything which as freemen as englishmen and as citizens of the great commonwealth of christendom they had at heart was then at stake this was to know the true art of gaining the affections and confidence of an highminded people this was to understand human nature a danger to avert a danger a present inconvenience and suffering to prevent a foreseen future and a worse calamitythese are the motives that belong to an animal who in his constitution is at once adventurous and provident circumspect and daringwhom his creator has made as the poet says of large discourse looking before and after but never can a vehement and sustained spirit of fortitude be kindled in a people by a war of calculation it has nothing that can keep the mind erect under the gusts of adversity even where men are willing as sometimes they are to barter their blood for lucre to hazard their safety for the gratification of their avarice the passion which animates them to that sort of conflict like all the shortsighted passions must see its objects distinct and near at hand the passions of the lower order are hungry and impatient speculative plundercontingent spoilfuture long adjourned uncertain bootypillage which must enrich a late posterity and which possibly may not reach to posterity at allthese for any length of time will never support a mercenary war the people are in the right the calculation of profit in all such wars is false on balancing the account of such wars ten thousand hogsheads of sugar are purchased at ten thousand times their price the blood of man should never be shed but to redeem the blood of man it is well shed for our family for our friends for our god for our country for our kind the rest is vanity the rest is crime  in the war of the grand alliance most of these considerations voluntarily and naturally had their part some were pressed into the service the political interest easily went in the track of the natural sentiment in the reverse course the carriage does not follow freely i am sure the natural feeling as i have just said is a far more predominant ingredient in this war than in that of any other that ever was waged by this kingdom  if the war made to prevent the union of two crowns upon one head was a just war this which is made to prevent the tearing all crowns from all heads which ought to wear them and with the crowns to smite off the sacred heads themselves this is a just war  if a war to prevent louis the fourteenth from imposing his religion was just a war to prevent the murderers of louis the sixteenth from imposing their irreligion upon us is just a war to prevent the operation of a system which makes life without dignity and death without hope is a just war  if to preserve political independence and civil freedom to nations was a just ground of war a war to preserve national independence property liberty life and honor from certain universal havoc is a war just necessary manly pious and we are bound to persevere in it by every principle divine and human as long as the system which menaces them all and all equally has an existence in the world  you who have looked at this matter with as fair and impartial an eye as can be united with a feeling heart you will not think it an hardy assertion when i affirm that it were far better to be conquered by any other nation than to have this faction for a neighbor before i felt myself authorized to say this i considered the state of all the countries in europe for these last three hundred years which have been obliged to submit to a foreign law in most of those i found the condition of the annexed countries even better certainly not worse than the lot of those which were the patrimony of the conqueror they wanted some blessings but they were free from many very great evils they were rich and tranquil such was artois flanders lorraine alsatia under the old government of france such was silesia under the king of prussia they who are to live in the vicinity of this new fabric are to prepare to live in perpetual conspiracies and seditions and to end at last in being conquered if not to her dominion to her resemblance but when we talk of conquest by other nations it is only to put a case this is the only power in europe by which it is possible we should be conquered to live under the continual dread of such immeasurable evils is itself a grievous calamity to live without the dread of them is to turn the danger into the disaster the influence of such a france is equal to a war its example more wasting than an hostile irruption the hostility with any other power is separable and accidental this power by the very condition of its existence by its very essential constitution is in a state of hostility with us and with all civilized people30  a government of the nature of that set up at our very door has never been hitherto seen or even imagined in europe what our relation to it will be cannot be judged by other relations it is a serious thing to have a connection with a people who live only under positive arbitrary and changeable institutionsand those not perfected nor supplied nor explained by any common acknowledged rule of moral science i remember that in one of my last conversations with the late lord camden we were struck much in the same manner with the abolition in france of the law as a science of methodized and artificial equity france since her revolution is under the sway of a sect whose leaders have deliberately at one stroke demolished the whole body of that jurisprudence which france had pretty nearly in common with other civilized countries in that jurisprudence were contained the elements and principles of the law of nations the great ligament of mankind with the law they have of course destroyed all seminaries in which jurisprudence was taught as well as all the corporations established for its conservation i have not heard of any country whether in europe or asia or even in africa on this side of mount atlas which is wholly without some such colleges and such corporations except france no man in a public or private concern can divine by what rule or principle her judgments are to be directed nor is there to be found a professor in any university or a practitioner in any court who will hazard an opinion of what is or is not law in france in any case whatever they have not only annulled all their old treaties but they have renounced the law of nations from whence treaties have their force with a fixed design they have outlawed themselves and to their power outlawed all other nations  instead of the religion and the law by which they were in a great politic communion with the christian world they have constructed their republic on three bases all fundamentally opposite to those on which the communities of europe are built its foundation is laid in regicide in jacobinism and in atheism and it has joined to those principles a body of systematic manners which secures their operation  if i am asked how i would be understood in the use of these terms regicide jacobinism atheism and a system of correspondent manners and their establishment i will tell you  i call a commonwealth regicide which lays it down as a fixed law of nature and a fundamental right of man that all government not being a democracy is an usurpation31that all kings as such are usurpers and for being kings may and ought to be put to death with their wives families and adherents the commonwealth which acts uniformly upon those principles and which after abolishing every festival of religion chooses the most flagrant act of a murderous regicide treason for a feast of eternal commemoration and which forces all her people to observe itthis i call regicide by establishment  jacobinism is the revolt of the enterprising talents of a country against its property when private men form themselves into associations for the purpose of destroying the preëxisting laws and institutions of their countrywhen they secure to themselves an army by dividing amongst the people of no property the estates of the ancient and lawful proprietorswhen a state recognizes those actswhen it does not make confiscations for crimes but makes crimes for confiscationswhen it has its principal strength and all its resources in such a violation of propertywhen it stands chiefly upon such a violation massacring by judgments or otherwise those who make any struggle for their old legal government and their legal hereditary or acquired possessionsi call this jacobinism by establishment  i call it atheism by establishment when any state as such shall not acknowledge the existence of god as a moral governor of the worldwhen it shall offer to him no religious or moral worshipwhen it shall abolish the christian religion by a regular decreewhen it shall persecute with a cold unrelenting steady cruelty by every mode of confiscation imprisonment exile and death all its ministerswhen it shall generally shut up or pull down churcheswhen the few buildings which remain of this kind shall be opened only for the purpose of making a profane apotheosis of monsters whose vices and crimes have no parallel amongst men and whom all other men consider as objects of general detestation and the severest animadversion of law when in the place of that religion of social benevolence and of individual selfdenial in mockery of all religion they institute impious blasphemous indecent theatric rites in honor of their vitiated perverted reason and erect altars to the personification of their own corrupted and bloody republicwhen schools and seminaries are founded at public expense to poison mankind from generation to generation with the horrible maxims of this impietywhen wearied out with incessant martyrdom and the cries of a people hungering and thirsting for religion they permit it only as a tolerated evili call this atheism by establishment  when to these establishments of regicide of jacobinism and of atheism you add the correspondent system of manners no doubt can be left on the mind of a thinking man concerning their determined hostility to the human race manners are of more importance than laws upon them in a great measure the laws depend the law touches us but here and there and now and then manners are what vex or soothe corrupt or purify exalt or debase barbarize or refine us by a constant steady uniform insensible operation like that of the air we breathe in they give their whole form and color to our lives according to their quality they aid morals they supply them or they totally destroy them of this the new french legislators were aware therefore with the same method and under the same authority they settled a system of manners the most licentious prostitute and abandoned that ever has been known and at the same time the most coarse rude savage and ferocious nothing in the revolution no not to a phrase or a gesture not to the fashion of a hat or a shoe was left to accident all has been the result of design all has been matter of institution no mechanical means could be devised in favor of this incredible system of wickedness and vice that has not been employed the noblest passions the love of glory the love of country have been debauched into means of its preservation and its propagation all sorts of shows and exhibitions calculated to inflame and vitiate the imagination and pervert the moral sense have been contrived they have sometimes brought forth five or six hundred drunken women calling at the bar of the assembly for the blood of their own children as being royalists or constitutionalists sometimes they have got a body of wretches calling themselves fathers to demand the murder of their sons boasting that rome had but one brutus but that they could show five hundred there were instances in which they inverted and retaliated the impiety and produced sons who called for the execution of their parents the foundation of their republic is laid in moral paradoxes their patriotism is always prodigy all those instances to be found in history whether real or fabulous of a doubtful public spirit at which morality is perplexed reason is staggered and from which affrighted nature recoils are their chosen and almost sole examples for the instruction of their youth  the whole drift of their institution is contrary to that of the wise legislators of all countries who aimed at improving instincts into morals and at grafting the virtues on the stock of the natural affections they on the contrary have omitted no pains to eradicate every benevolent and noble propensity in the mind of men in their culture it is a rule always to graft virtues on vices they think everything unworthy of the name of public virtue unless it indicates violence on the private all their new institutions and with them everything is new strike at the root of our social nature other legislators knowing that marriage is the origin of all relations and consequently the first element of all duties have endeavored by every art to make it sacred the christian religion by confining it to the pairs and by rendering that relation indissoluble has by these two things done more towards the peace happiness settlement and civilization of the world than by any other part in this whole scheme of divine wisdom the direct contrary course has been taken in the synagogue of antichristi mean in that forge and manufactory of all evil the sect which predominated in the constituent assembly of 1789 those monsters employed the same or greater industry to desecrate and degrade that state which other legislators have used to render it holy and honorable by a strange uncalledfor declaration they pronounced that marriage was no better than a common civil contract it was one of their ordinary tricks to put their sentiments into the mouths of certain personated characters which they theatrically exhibited at the bar of what ought to be a serious assembly one of these was brought out in the figure of a prostitute whom they called by the affected name of a mother without being a wife this creature they made to call for a repeal of the incapacities which in civilized states are put upon bastards the prostitutes of the assembly gave to this their puppet the sanction of their greater impudence in consequence of the principles laid down and the manners authorized bastards were not long after put on the footing of the issue of lawful unions proceeding in the spirit of the first authors of their constitution succeeding assemblies went the full length of the principle and gave a license to divorce at the mere pleasure of either party and at a months notice with them the matrimonial connection is brought into so degraded a state of concubinage that i believe none of the wretches in london who keep warehouses of infamy would give out one of their victims to private custody on so short and insolent a tenure there was indeed a kind of profligate equity in giving to women the same licentious power the reason they assigned was as infamous as the act declaring that women had been too long under the tyranny of parents and of husbands it is not necessary to observe upon the horrible consequences of taking one half of the species wholly out of the guardianship and protection of the other  the practice of divorce though in some countries permitted has been discouraged in all in the east polygamy and divorce are in discredit and the manners correct the laws in rome whilst rome was in its integrity the few causes allowed for divorce amounted in effect to a prohibition they were only three the arbitrary was totally excluded and accordingly some hundreds of years passed without a single example of that kind when manners were corrupted the laws were relaxed as the latter always follow the former when they are not able to regulate them or to vanquish them of this circumstance the legislators of vice and crime were pleased to take notice as an inducement to adopt their regulation holding out an hope that the permission would as rarely be made use of they knew the contrary to be true and they had taken good care that the laws should be well seconded by the manners their law of divorce like all their laws had not for its object the relief of domestic uneasiness but the total corruption of all morals the total disconnection of social life  it is a matter of curiosity to observe the operation of this encouragement to disorder i have before me the paris paper correspondent to the usual register of births marriages and deaths divorce happily is no regular head of registry amongst civilized nations with the jacobins it is remarkable that divorce is not only a regular head but it has the post of honor it occupies the first place in the list in the three first months of the year 1793 the number of divorces in that city amounted to 562 the marriages were 1785 so that the proportion of divorces to marriages was not much less than one to three a thing unexampled i believe among mankind i caused an inquiry to be made at doctors commons concerning the number of divorces and found that all the divorces which except by special act of parliament are separations and not proper divorces did not amount in all those courts and in an hundred years to much more than one fifth of those that passed in the single city of paris in three months i followed up the inquiry relative to that city through several of the subsequent months until i was tired and found the proportions still the same since then i have heard that they have declared for a revisal of these laws but i know of nothing done it appears as if the contract that renovates the world was under no law at all from this we may take our estimate of the havoc that has been made through all the relations of life with the jacobins of france vague intercourse is without reproach marriage is reduced to the vilest concubinage children are encouraged to cut the throats of their parents mothers are taught that tenderness is no part of their character and to demonstrate their attachment to their party that they ought to make no scruple to rake with their bloody hands in the bowels of those who came from their own  to all this let us join the practice of cannibalism with which in the proper terms and with the greatest truth their several factions accuse each other by cannibalism i mean their devouring as a nutriment of their ferocity some part of the bodies of those they have murdered their drinking the blood of their victims and forcing the victims themselves to drink the blood of their kindred slaughtered before their faces by cannibalism i mean also to signify all their nameless unmanly and abominable insults on the bodies of those they slaughter  as to those whom they suffer to die a natural death they do not permit them to enjoy the last consolations of mankind or those rights of sepulture which indicate hope and which mere nature has taught to mankind in all countries to soothe the afflictions and to cover the infirmity of mortal condition they disgrace men in the entry into life they vitiate and enslave them through the whole course of it and they deprive them of all comfort at the conclusion of their dishonored and depraved existence endeavoring to persuade the people that they are no better than beasts the whole body of their institution tends to make them beasts of prey furious and savage for this purpose the active part of them is disciplined into a ferocity which has no parallel to this ferocity there is joined not one of the rude unfashioned virtues which accompany the vices where the whole are left to grow up together in the rankness of uncultivated nature but nothing is left to nature in their systems  the same discipline which hardens their hearts relaxes their morals whilst courts of justice were thrust out by revolutionary tribunals and silent churches were only the funeral monuments of departed religion there were no fewer than nineteen or twenty theatres great and small most of them kept open at the public expense and all of them crowded every night among the gaunt haggard forms of famine and nakedness amidst the yells of murder the tears of affliction and the cries of despair the song the dance the mimic scene the buffoon laughter went on as regularly as in the gay hour of festive peace i have it from good authority that under the scaffold of judicial murder and the gaping planks that poured down blood on the spectators the space was hired out for a show of dancing dogs i think without concert we have made the very same remark on reading some of their pieces which being written for other purposes let us into a view of their social life it struck us that the habits of paris had no resemblance to the finished virtues or to the polished vice and elegant though not blameless luxury of the capital of a great empire their society was more like that of a den of outlaws upon a doubtful frontierof a lewd tavern for the revels and debauches of banditti assassins bravoes smugglers and their more desperate paramours mixed with bombastic players the refuse and rejected offal of strolling theatres puffing out illsorted verses about virtue mixed with the licentious and blasphemous songs proper to the brutal and hardened course of life belonging to that sort of wretches this system of manners in itself is at war with all orderly and moral society and is in its neighborhood unsafe if great bodies of that kind were anywhere established in a bordering territory we should have a right to demand of their governments the suppression of such a nuisance what are we to do if the government and the whole community is of the same description yet that government has thought proper to invite ours to lay by its unjust hatred and to listen to the voice of humanity as taught by their example  the operation of dangerous and delusive first principles obliges us to have recourse to the true ones in the intercourse between nations we are apt to rely too much on the instrumental part we lay too much weight upon the formality of treaties and compacts we do not act much more wisely when we trust to the interests of men as guaranties of their engagements the interests frequently tear to pieces the engagements and the passions trample upon both entirely to trust to either is to disregard our own safety or not to know mankind men are not tied to one another by papers and seals they are led to associate by resemblances by conformities by sympathies it is with nations as with individuals nothing is so strong a tie of amity between nation and nation as correspondence in laws customs manners and habits of life they have more than the force of treaties in themselves they are obligations written in the heart they approximate men to men without their knowledge and sometimes against their intentions the secret unseen but irrefragable bond of habitual intercourse holds them together even when their perverse and litigious nature sets them to equivocate scuffle and fight about the terms of their written obligations  as to war if it be the means of wrong and violence it is the sole means of justice amongst nations nothing can banish it from the world they who say otherwise intending to impose upon us do not impose upon themselves but it is one of the greatest objects of human wisdom to mitigate those evils which we are unable to remove the conformity and analogy of which i speak incapable like everything else of preserving perfect trust and tranquillity among men has a strong tendency to facilitate accommodation and to produce a generous oblivion of the rancor of their quarrels with this similitude peace is more of peace and war is less of war i will go further there have been periods of time in which communities apparently in peace with each other have been more perfectly separated than in later times many nations in europe have been in the course of long and bloody wars the cause must be sought in the similitude throughout europe of religion laws and manners at bottom these are all the same the writers on public law have often called this aggregate of nations a commonwealth they had reason it is virtually one great state having the same basis of general law with some diversity of provincial customs and local establishments the nations of europe have had the very same christian religion agreeing in the fundamental parts varying a little in the ceremonies and in the subordinate doctrines the whole of the polity and economy of every country in europe has been derived from the same sources it was drawn from the old germanic or gothic custumaryfrom the feudal institutions which must be considered as an emanation from that custumary and the whole has been improved and digested into system and discipline by the roman law from hence arose the several orders with or without a monarch which are called states in every european country the strong traces of which where monarchy predominated were never wholly extinguished or merged in despotism in the few places where monarchy was cast off the spirit of european monarchy was still left those countries still continued countries of statesthat is of classes orders and distinctions such as had before subsisted or nearly so indeed the force and form of the institution called states continued in greater perfection in those republican communities than under monarchies from all those sources arose a system of manners and of education which was nearly similar in all this quarter of the globeand which softened blended and harmonized the colors of the whole there was little difference in the form of the universities for the education of their youth whether with regard to faculties to sciences or to the more liberal and elegant kinds of erudition from this resemblance in the modes of intercourse and in the whole form and fashion of life no citizen of europe could be altogether an exile in any part of it there was nothing more than a pleasing variety to recreate and instruct the mind to enrich the imagination and to meliorate the heart when a man travelled or resided for health pleasure business or necessity from his own country he never felt himself quite abroad  the whole body of this new scheme of manners in support of the new scheme of polities i consider as a strong and decisive proof of determined ambition and systematic hostility i defy the most refining ingenuity to invent any other cause for the total departure of the jacobin republic from every one of the ideas and usages religious legal moral or social of this civilized world and for her tearing herself from its communion with such studied violence but from a formed resolution of keeping no terms with that world it has not been as has been falsely and insidiously represented that these miscreants had only broke with their old government they made a schism with the whole universe and that schism extended to almost everything great and small for one i wish since it is gone thus far that the breach had been so complete as to make all intercourse impracticable but partly by accident partly by design partly from the resistance of the matter enough is left to preserve intercourse whilst amity is destroyed or corrupted in its principle  this violent breach of the community of europe we must conclude to have been made even if they had not expressly declared it over and over again either to force mankind into an adoption of their system or to live in perpetual enmity with a community the most potent we have ever known can any person imagine that in offering to mankind this desperate alternative there is no indication of a hostile mind because men in possession of the ruling authority are supposed to have a right to act without coercion in their own territories as to the right of men to act anywhere according to their pleasure without any moral tie no such right exists men are never in a state of total independence of each other it is not the condition of our nature nor is it conceivable how any man can pursue a considerable course of action without its having some effect upon others or of course without producing some degree of responsibility for his conduct the situations in which men relatively stand produce the rules and principles of that responsibility and afford directions to prudence in exacting it  distance of place does not extinguish the duties or the rights of men but it often renders their exercise impracticable the same circumstance of distance renders the noxious effects of an evil system in any community less pernicious but there are situations where this difficulty does not occur and in which therefore those duties are obligatory and these rights are to be asserted it has ever been the method of public jurists to draw a great part of the analogies on which they form the law of nations from the principles of law which prevail in civil community civil laws are not all of them merely positive those which are rather conclusions of legal reason than matters of statutable provision belong to universal equity and are universally applicable almost the whole prætorian law is such there is a law of neighborhood which does not leave a man perfect master on his own ground when a neighbor sees a new erection in the nature of a nuisance set up at his door he has a right to represent it to the judge who on his part has a right to order the work to be stayed or if established to be removed on this head the parent law is express and clear and has made many wise provisions which without destroying regulate and restrain the right of ownership by the right of vicinage no innovation is permitted that may redound even secondarily to the prejudice of a neighbor the whole doctrine of that important head of prætorian law de novi operis nunciatione is founded on the principle that no new use should be made of a mans private liberty of operating upon his private property from whence a detriment may be justly apprehended by his neighbor this law of denunciation is prospective it is to anticipate what is called damnum infectum or damnum nondum factum that is a damage justly apprehended but not actually done even before it is clearly known whether the innovation be damageable or not the judge is competent to issue a prohibition to innovate until the point can be determined this prompt interference is grounded on principles favorable to both parties it is preventive of mischief difficult to be repaired and of ill blood difficult to be softened the rule of law therefore which comes before the evil is amongst the very best parts of equity and justifies the promptness of the remedy because as it is well observed res damni infecti celeritatem desiderat et periculosa est dilatio this right of denunciation does not hold when things continue however inconveniently to the neighborhood according to the ancient mode for there is a sort of presumption against novelty drawn out of a deep consideration of human nature and human affairs and the maxim of jurisprudence is well laid down vetustas pro lege semper habetur  such is the law of civil vicinity now where there is no constituted judge as between independent states there is not the vicinage itself is the natural judge it is preventively the assertor of its own rights or remedially their avenger neighbors are presumed to take cognizance of each others acts vicini vicinorum facta præsumuntur seire this principle which like the rest is as true of nations as of individual men has bestowed on the grand vicinage of europe a duty to know and a right to prevent any capital innovation which may amount to the erection of a dangerous nuisance32 of the importance of that innovation and the mischief of that nuisance they are to be sure bound to judge not litigiously but it is in their competence to judge they have uniformly acted on this right what in civil society is a ground of action in politic society is a ground of war but the exercise of that competent jurisdiction is a matter of moral prudence as suits in civil society so war in the political must ever be a matter of great deliberation it is not this or that particular proceeding picked out here and there as a subject of quarrel that will do there must be an aggregate of mischief there must be marks of deliberation there must be traces of design there must be indications of malice there must be tokens of ambition there must be force in the body where they exist there must be energy in the mind when all these circumstances combine or the important parts of them the duty of the vicinity calls for the exercise of its competence and the rules of prudence do not restrain but demand it  in describing the nuisance erected by so pestilential a manufactory by the construction of so infamous a brothel by digging a nightcellar for such thieves murderers and housebreakers as never infested the world i am so far from aggravating that i have fallen infinitely short of the evil no man who has attended to the particulars of what has been done in france and combined them with the principles there asserted can possibly doubt it when i compare with this great cause of nations the trifling points of honor the still more contemptible points of interest the light ceremonies the undefinable punctilios the disputes about precedency the lowering or the hoisting of a sail the dealing in a hundred or two of wildcatskins on the other side of the globe which have often kindled up the flames of war between nations i stand astonished at those persons who do not feel a resentment not more natural than politic at the atrocious insults that this monstrous compound offers to the dignity of every nation and who are not alarmed with what it threatens to their safety  i have therefore been decidedly of opinion with our declaration at whitehall in the beginning of this war that the vicinage of europe had not only a right but an indispensable duty and an exigent interest to denunciate this new work before it had produced the danger we have so sorely felt and which we shall long feel the example of what is done by france is too important not to have a vast and extensive influence and that example backed with its power must bear with great force on those who are near it especially on those who shall recognize the pretended republic on the principle upon which it now stands it is not an old structure which you have found as it is and are not to dispute of the original end and design with which it had been so fashioned it is a recent wrong and can plead no prescription it violates the rights upon which not only the community of france but those on which all communities are founded the principles on which they proceed are general principles and are as true in england as in any other country they who though with the purest intentions recognize the authority of these regicides and robbers upon principle justify their acts and establish them as precedents it is a question not between france and england it is a question between property and force the property claims and its claim has been allowed the property of the nation is the nation they who massacre plunder and expel the body of the proprietary are murderers and robbers the state in its essence must be moral and just and it may be so though a tyrant or usurper should be accidentally at the head of it this is a thing to be lamented but this notwithstanding the body of the commonwealth may remain in all its integrity and be perfectly sound in its composition the present case is different it is not a revolution in government it is not the victory of party over party it is a destruction and decomposition of the whole society which never can be made of right by any faction however powerful nor without terrible consequences to all about it both in the act and in the example this pretended republic is founded in crimes and exists by wrong and robbery and wrong and robbery far from a title to anything is war with mankind to be at peace with robbery is to be an accomplice with it  mere locality does not constitute a body politic had cade and his gang got possession of london they would not have been the lord mayor aldermen and common council the body politic of france existed in the majesty of its throne in the dignity of its nobility in the honor of its gentry in the sanctity of its clergy in the reverence of its magistracy in the weight and consideration due to its landed property in the several bailliages in the respect due to its movable substance represented by the corporations of the kingdom all these particular molecules united form the great mass of what is truly the body politic in all countries they are so many deposits and receptacles of justice because they can only exist by justice nation is a moral essence not a geographical arrangement or a denomination of the nomenclator france though out of her territorial possession exists because the sole possible claimant i mean the proprietary and the government to which the proprietary adheres exists and claims god forbid that if you were expelled from your house by ruffians and assassins that i should call the material walls doors and windows of  the ancient and honorable family of  am i to transfer to the intruders who not content to turn you out naked to the world would rob you of your very name all the esteem and respect i owe to you the regicides in france are not france france is out of her bounds but the kingdom is the same  to illustrate my opinions on this subject let us suppose a case which after what has happened we cannot think absolutely impossible though the augury is to be abominated and the event deprecated with our most ardent prayers let us suppose then that our gracious sovereign was sacrilegiously murdered his exemplary queen at the head of the matronage of this land murdered in the same manner that those princesses whose beauty and modest elegance are the ornaments of the country and who are the leaders and patterns of the ingenuous youth of their sex were put to a cruel and ignominious death with hundreds of others mothers and daughters ladies of the first distinction that the prince of wales and the duke of york princes the hope and pride of the nation with all their brethren were forced to fly from the knives of assassins that the whole body of our excellent clergy were either massacred or robbed of all and transported the christian religion in all its denominations forbidden and persecuted the law totally fundamentally and in all its parts destroyed the judges put to death by revolutionary tribunals the peers and commons robbed to the last acre of their estates massacred if they stayed or obliged to seek life in flight in exile and in beggary that the whole landed property should share the very same fate that every military and naval officer of honor and rank almost to a man should be placed in the same description of confiscation and exile that the principal merchants and bankers should be drawn out as from an hencoop for slaughter that the citizens of our greatest and most flourishing cities when the hand and the machinery of the hangman were not found sufficient should have been collected in the public squares and massacred by thousands with cannon if three hundred thousand others should have been doomed to a situation worse than death in noisome and pestilential prisons in such a case is it in the faction of robbers i am to look for my country would this be the england that you and i and even strangers admired honored loved and cherished would not the exiles of england alone be my government and my fellowcitizens would not their places of refuge be my temporary country would not all my duties and all my affections be there and there only should i consider myself as a traitor to my country and deserving of death if i knocked at the door and heart of every potentate in christendom to succor my friends and to avenge them on their enemies could i in any way show myself more a patriot what should i think of those potentates who insulted their suffering brethrenwho treated them as vagrants or at least as mendicantsand could find no allies no friends but in regicide murderers and robbers what ought i to think and feel if being geographers instead of kings they recognized the desolated cities the wasted fields and the rivers polluted with blood of this geometrical measurement as the honorable member of europe called england in that condition what should we think of sweden denmark or holland or whatever power afforded us a churlish and treacherous hospitality if they should invite us to join the standard of our king our laws and our religionif they should give us a direct promise of protectionif after all this taking advantage of our deplorable situation which left us no choice they were to treat us as the lowest and vilest of all mercenariesif they were to send us far from the aid of our king and our suffering country to squander us away in the most pestilential climates for a venal enlargement of their own territories for the purpose of trucking them when obtained with those very robbers and murderers they had called upon us to oppose with our blood what would be our sentiments if in that miserable service we were not to be considered either as english or as swedes dutch danes but as outcasts of the human race whilst we were fighting those battles of their interest and as their soldiers how should we feel if we were to be excluded from all their cartels how must we feel if the pride and flower of the english nobility and gentry who might escape the pestilential clime and the devouring sword should if taken prisoners be delivered over as rebel subjects to be condemned as rebels as traitors as the vilest of all criminals by tribunals formed of maroon negro slaves covered over with the blood of their masters who were made free and organized into judges for their robberies and murders what should we feel under this inhuman insulting and barbarous protection of muscovites swedes or hollanders should we not obtest heaven and whatever justice there is yet on earth oppression makes wise men mad but the distemper is still the madness of the wise which is better than the sobriety of fools their cry is the voice of sacred misery exalted not into wild raving but into the sanctified frenzy of prophecy and inspiration in that bitterness of soul in that indignation of suffering virtue in that exaltation of despair would not persecuted english loyalty cry out with an awful warning voice and denounce the destruction that waits on monarchs who consider fidelity to them as the most degrading of all vices who suffer it to be punished as the most abominable of all crimes and who have no respect but for rebels traitors regicides and furious negro slaves whose crimes have broke their chains would not this warm language of high indignation have more of sound reason in it more of real affection more of true attachment than all the lullabies of flatterers who would hush monarchs to sleep in the arms of death let them be well convinced that if ever this example should prevail in its whole extent it will have its full operation whilst kings stand firm on their base though under that base there is a surewrought mine there will not be wanting to their levees a single person of those who are attached to their fortune and not to their persons or cause but hereafter none will support a tottering throne some will fly for fear of being crushed under the ruin some will join in making it they will seek in the destruction of royalty fame and power and wealth and the homage of kings with reubell with carnot with révellière and with the merlins and the talliens rather than suffer exile and beggary with the condés or the broglies the castries the davarays the sérents the cazalès and the long line of loyal suffering patriot nobility or to be butchered with the oracles and the victims of the laws the dormessons the desprémesnils and the malesherbes this example we shall give if instead of adhering to our fellows in a cause which is an honor to us all we abandon the lawful government and lawful corporate body of france to hunt for a shameful and ruinous fraternity with this odious usurpation that disgraces civilized society and the human race  and is then example nothing it is everything example is the school of mankind and they will learn at no other this war is a war against that example it is not a war for louis the eighteenth or even for the property virtue fidelity of france it is a war for george the third for francis the second and for all the dignity property honor virtue and religion of england of germany and of all nations  i know that all i have said of the systematic unsociability of this newinvented species of republic and the impossibility of preserving peace is answered by asserting that the scheme of manners morals and even of maxims and principles of state is of no weight in a question of peace or war between communities this doctrine is supported by example the case of algiers is cited with an hint as if it were the stronger case i should take no notice of this sort of inducement if i had found it only where first it was i do not want respect for those from whom i first heard it but having no controversy at present with them i only think it not amiss to rest on it a little as i find it adopted with much more of the same kind by several of those on whom such reasoning had formerly made no apparent impression if it had no force to prevent us from submitting to this necessary war it furnishes no better ground for our making an unnecessary and ruinous peace  this analogical argument drawn from the case of algiers would lead us a good way the fact is we ourselves with a little cover others more directly pay a tribute to the republic of algiers is it meant to reconcile us to the payment of a tribute to the french republic that this with other things more ruinous will be demanded hereafter i little doubt but for the present this will not be avowedthough our minds are to be gradually prepared for it in truth the arguments from this case are worth little even to those who approve the buying an algerine forbearance of piracy there are many things which men do not approve that they must do to avoid a greater evil to argue from thence that they are to act in the same manner in all cases is turning necessity into a law upon what is matter of prudence the argument concludes the contrary way because we have done one humiliating act we ought with infinite caution to admit more acts of the same nature lest humiliation should become our habitual state matters of prudence are under the dominion of circumstances and not of logical analogies it is absurd to take it otherwise  i for one do more than doubt the policy of this kind of convention with algiers on those who think as i do the argument ad hominem can make no sort of impression i know something of the constitution and composition of this very extraordinary republic it has a constitution i admit similar to the present tumultuous military tyranny of france by which an handful of obscure ruffians domineer over a fertile country and a brave people for the composition too i admit the algerine community resembles that of francebeing formed out of the very scum scandal disgrace and pest of the turkish asia the grand seignior to disburden the country suffers the dey to recruit in his dominions the corps of janizaries or asaphs which form the directory and council of elders of the african republic one and indivisible but notwithstanding this resemblance which i allow i never shall so far injure the janizarian republic of algiers as to put it in comparison for every sort of crime turpitude and oppression with the jacobin republic of paris there is no question with me to which of the two i should choose to be a neighbor or a subject but situated as i am i am in no danger of becoming to algiers either the one or the other it is not so in my relation to the atheistical fanatics of france i am their neighbor i may become their subject have the gentlemen who borrowed this happy parallel no idea of the different conduct to be held with regard to the very same evil at an immense distance and when it is at your door when its power is enormous as when it is comparatively as feeble as its distance is remote when there is a barrier of language and usages which prevents corruption through certain old correspondences and habitudes from the contagion of the horrible novelties that are introduced into everything else i can contemplate without dread a royal or a national tiger on the borders of pegu i can look at him with an easy curiosity as prisoner within bars in the menagerie of the tower but if by habeas corpus or otherwise he was to come into the lobby of the house of commons whilst your door was open any of you would be more stout than wise who would not gladly make your escape out of the back windows i certainly should dread more from a wildcat in my bedchamber than from all the lions that roar in the deserts behind algiers but in this parallel it is the cat that is at a distance and the lions and tigers that are in our antechambers and our lobbies algiers is not near algiers is not powerful algiers is not our neighbor algiers is not infectious algiers whatever it may be is an old creation and we have good data to calculate all the mischief to be apprehended from it when i find algiers transferred to calais i will tell you what i think of that point in the mean time the case quoted from the algerine reports will not apply as authority we shall put it out of court and so far as that goes let the counsel for the jacobin peace take nothing by their motion  when we voted as you and i did with many more whom you and i respect and love to resist this enemy we were providing for dangers that were direct home pressing and not remote contingent uncertain and formed upon loose analogies we judged of the danger with which we were menaced by jacobin france from the whole tenor of her conduct not from one or two doubtful or detached acts or expressions i not only concurred in the idea of combining with europe in this war but to the best of my power even stimulated ministers to that conjunction of interests and of efforts i joined them with all my soul on the principles contained in that manly and masterly statepaper which i have two or three times referred to33 and may still more frequently hereafter the diplomatic collection never was more enriched than with this piece the historic facts justify every stroke of the master thus painters write their names at co  various persons may concur in the same measure on various grounds they may be various without being contrary to or exclusive of each other i thought the insolent unprovoked aggression of the regicide upon our ally of holland a good ground of war i think his manifest attempt to overturn the balance of europe a good ground of war as a good ground of war i consider his declaration of war on his majesty and his kingdom but though i have taken all these to my aid i consider them as nothing more than as a sort of evidence to indicate the treasonable mind within long before their acts of aggression and their declaration of war the faction in france had assumed a form had adopted a body of principles and maxims and had regularly and systematically acted on them by which she virtually had put herself in a posture which was in itself a declaration of war against mankind  it is said by the directory in their several manifestoes that we of the people are tumultuous for peace and that ministers pretend negotiation to amuse us this they have learned from the language of many amongst ourselves whose conversations have been one main cause of whatever extent the opinion for peace with regicide may be but i who think the ministers unfortunately to be but too serious in their proceedings find myself obliged to say a little more on this subject of the popular opinion  before our opinions are quoted against ourselves it is proper that from our serious deliberation they may be worth quoting it is without reason we praise the wisdom of our constitution in putting under the discretion of the crown the awful trust of war and peace if the ministers of the crown virtually return it again into our hands the trust was placed there as a sacred deposit to secure us against popular rashness in plunging into wars and against the effects of popular dismay disgust or lassitude in getting out of them as imprudently as we might first engage in them to have no other measure in judging of those great objects than our momentary opinions and desires is to throw us back upon that very democracy which in this part our constitution was formed to avoid  it is no excuse at all for a minister who at our desire takes a measure contrary to our safety that it is our own act he who does not stay the hand of suicide is guilty of murder on our part i say that to be instructed is not to be degraded or enslaved information is an advantage to us and we have a right to demand it he that is bound to act in the dark cannot be said to act freely when it appears evident to our governors that our desires and our interests are at variance they ought not to gratify the former at the expense of the latter statesmen are placed on an eminence that they may have a larger horizon than we can possibly command they have a whole before them which we can contemplate only in the parts and often without the necessary relations ministers are not only our natural rulers but our natural guides reason clearly and manfully delivered has in itself a mighty force but reason in the mouth of legal authority is i may fairly say irresistible  i admit that reason of state will not in many circumstances permit the disclosure of the true ground of a public proceeding in that case silence is manly and it is wise it is fair to call for trust when the principle of reason itself suspends its public use i take the distinction to be this the ground of a particular measure making a part of a plan it is rarely proper to divulge all the broader grounds of policy on which the general plan is to be adopted ought as rarely to be concealed they who have not the whole cause before them call them politicians call them people call them what you will are no judges the difficulties of the case as well as its fair side ought to be presented this ought to be done and it is all that can be done when we have our true situation distinctly presented to us if then we resolve with a blind and headlong violence to resist the admonitions of our friends and to cast ourselves into the hands of our potent and irreconcilable foes then and not till then the ministers stand acquitted before god and man for whatever may come  lamenting as i do that the matter has not had so full and free a discussion as it requires i mean to omit none of the points which seem to me necessary for consideration previous to an arrangement which is forever to decide the form and the fate of europe in the course therefore of what i shall have the honor to address to you i propose the following questions to your serious thoughts1 whether the present system which stands for a government in france be such as in peace and war affects the neighboring states in a manner different from the internal government that formerly prevailed in that country2 whether that system supposing its views hostile to other nations possesses any means of being hurtful to them peculiar to itself3 whether there has been lately such a change in france as to alter the nature of its system or its effect upon other powers4 whether any public declarations or engagements exist on the part of the allied powers which stand in the way of a treaty of peace which supposes the right and confirms the power of the regicide faction in france5 what the state of the other powers of europe will be with respect to each other and their colonies on the conclusion of a regicide peace6 whether we are driven to the absolute necessity of making that kind of peace  these heads of inquiry will enable us to make the application of the several matters of fact and topics of argument that occur in this vast discussion to certain fixed principles i do not mean to confine myself to the order in which they stand i shall discuss them in such a manner as shall appear to me the best adapted for showing their mutual bearings and relations here then i close the public matter of my letter but before i have done let me say one word in apology for myself  in wishing this nominal peace not to be precipitated i am sure no man living is less disposed to blame the present ministry than i am some of my oldest friends and i wish i could say it of more of them make a part in that ministry there are some indeed whom my dim eyes in vain explore in my mind a greater calamity could not have fallen on the public than the exclusion of one of them but i drive away that with other melancholy thoughts a great deal ought to be said upon that subject or nothing as to the distinguished persons to whom my friends who remain are joined if benefits nobly and generously conferred ought to procure good wishes they are entitled to my best vows and they have them all they have administered to me the only consolation i am capable of receiving which is to know that no individual will suffer by my thirty years service to the public if things should give us the comparative happiness of a struggle i shall be found i was going to say fighting that would be foolish but dying by the side of mr pitt i must add that if anything defensive in our domestic system can possibly save us from the disasters of a regicide peace he is the man to save us if the finances in such a case can be repaired he is the man to repair them if i should lament any of his acts it is only when they appear to me to have no resemblance to acts of his but let him not have a confidence in himself which no human abilities can warrant his abilities are fully equal and that is to say much for any man to those which are opposed to him but if we look to him as our security against the consequences of a regicide peace let us be assured that a regicide peace and a constitutional ministry are terms that will not agree with a regicide peace the king cannot long have a minister to serve him nor the minister a king to serve if the great disposer in reward of the royal and the private virtues of our sovereign should call him from the calamitous spectacles which will attend a state of amity with regicide his successor will surely see them unless the same providence greatly anticipates the course of nature thinking thus and not as i conceive on light grounds i dare not flatter the reigning sovereign nor any minister he has or can have nor his successor apparent nor any of those who may be called to serve him with what appears to me a false state of their situation we cannot have them and that peace together  i do not forget that there had been a considerable difference between several of our friends with my insignificant self and the great man at the head of ministry in an early stage of these discussions but i am sure there was a period in which we agreed better in the danger of a jacobin existence in france at one time he and all europe seemed to feel it but why am not i converted with so many great powers and so many great ministers it is because i am old and slow i am in this year 1796 only where all the powers of europe were in 1793 i cannot move with this precession of the equinoxes which is preparing for us the return of some very old i am afraid no golden era or the commencement of some new era that must be denominated from some new metal in this crisis i must hold my tongue or i must speak with freedom falsehood and delusion are allowed in no case whatever but as in the exercise of all the virtues there is an economy of truth it is a sort of temperance by which a man speaks truth with measure that he may speak it the longer but as the same rules do not hold in all cases what would be right for you who may presume on a series of years before you would have no sense for me who cannot without absurdity calculate on six months of life what i say i must say at once whatever i write is in its nature testamentary it may have the weakness but it has the sincerity of a dying declaration for the few days i have to linger here i am removed completely from the busy scene of the world but i hold myself to be still responsible for everything that i have done whilst i continued on the place of action if the rawest tyro in politics has been influenced by the authority of my gray hairs and led by anything in my speeches or my writings to enter into this war he has a right to call upon me to know why i have changed my opinions or why when those i voted with have adopted better notions i persevere in exploded error  when i seem not to acquiesce in the acts of those i respect in every degree short of superstition i am obliged to give my reasons fully i cannot set my authority against their authority but to exert reason is not to revolt against authority reason and authority do not move in the same parallel that reason is an amicus curiæ who speaks de plano not pro tribunali it is a friend who makes an useful suggestion to the court without questioning its jurisdiction whilst he acknowledges its competence he promotes its efficiency i shall pursue the plan i have chalked out in my letters that follow this  footnotes  22 mussabat tacito medicina timore  23 mr bird sent to state the real situation of the duc de choiseul  24 boissy danglas  25 this court has seen with regret how far the tone and spirit of that answer the nature and extent of the demands which it contains and the manner of announcing them are remote from any disposition for peace  the inadmissible pretension is there avowed of appropriating to france all that the laws actually existing there may have comprised under the denomination of french territory to a demand such as this is added an express declaration that no proposal contrary to it will be made or even listened to and this under the pretence of an internal regulation the provisions of which are wholly foreign to all other nations  while these dispositions shall be persisted in nothing is left for the king but to prosecute a war equally just and necessary  whenever his enemies shall manifest more pacific sentiments his majesty will at all times be eager to concur in them by lending himself in concert with his allies to all such measures as shall be best calculated to reëstablish general tranquillity on conditions just honorable and permanent either by the establishment of a congress which has been so often and so happily the means of restoring peace to europe or by a preliminary discussion of the principles which may be proposed on either side as a foundation of a general pacification or lastly by an impartial examination of any other way which may be pointed out to him for arriving at the same salutary end  downing street april 10th 1796  26 official note extracted from the journal of the defenders of the country   executive directory   different journals have advanced that an english  plenipotentiary had reached paris and had presented himself to  the executive directory but that his propositions not having  appeared satisfactory he had received orders instantly to quit  france   all these assertions are equally false   the notices given in the english papers of a minister having  been sent to paris there to treat of peace bring to  recollection the overtures of mr wickham to the ambassador of  the republic at basle and the rumors circulated relative to the  mission of mr hammond to the court of prussia the  insignificance or rather the subtle duplicity the punic  style of mr wickhams note is not forgotten according to  the partisans of the english ministry it was to paris that mr  hammond was to come to speak for peace when his destination  became public and it was known that he went to prussia the  same writer repeated that it was to accelerate a peace and not  withstanding the object now well known of this negotiation was  to engage prussia to break her treaties with the republic and  to return into the coalition the court of berlin faithful to  its engagements repulsed these perfidious propositions but  in converting this intrigue into a mission for peace the  english ministry joined to the hope of giving a new enemy to  france that of justifying the continuance of the war in the  eyes of the english nation and of throwing all the odium of it  on the french government such was also the aim of mr  wickhams note such is still that of the notices given at  this time in the english papers   this aim will appear evident if we reflect how difficult it is  that the ambitious government of england should sincerely wish  for a peace that would snatch from it its maritime  preponderancy would reëstablish the freedom of the seas would  give a new impulse to the spanish dutch and french marines  and would carry to the highest degree of prosperity the industry  and commerce of those nations in which it has always found  rivals and which it has considered as enemies of its  commerce when they were tired of being its dupes   but there will no longer be any credit given to the pacific  intentions of the english ministry when it is known that its  gold and its intrigues its open practices and its insinuations  besiege more than ever the cabinet of vienna and are one of the  principal obstacles to the negotiation which that cabinet would  of itself be induced to enter on for peace   they will no longer be credited finally when the moment of  the rumor of these overtures being circulated is considered  the english nation supports impatiently the continuance of the  war a reply must be made to its complaints its reproaches  the parliament is about to reopen its sittings the mouths of  the orators who will declaim against the war must be shut the  demand of new taxes must be justified and to obtain these  results it is necessary to be enabled to advance that the  french government refuses every reasonable proposition of  peace    27 in their place has succeeded a system destructive of all public order maintained by

my dear siri closed my first letter with serious matter and i hope it has employed your thoughts the system of peace must have a reference to the system of the war on that ground i must therefore again recall your mind to our original opinions which time and events have not taught me to vary  my ideas and my principles led me in this contest to encounter france not as a state but as a faction the vast territorial extent of that country its immense population its riches of production its riches of commerce and convention the whole aggregate mass of what in ordinary cases constitutes the force of a state to me were but objects of secondary consideration they might be balanced and they have been often more than balanced great as these things are they are not what make the faction formidable it is the faction that makes them truly dreadful that faction is the evil spirit that possesses the body of francethat informs it as a soulthat stamps upon its ambition and upon all its pursuits a characteristic mark which strongly distinguishes them from the same general passions and the same general views in other men and in other communities it is that spirit which inspires into them a new a pernicious a desolating activity constituted as france was ten years ago it was not in that france to shake to shatter and to overwhelm europe in the manner that we behold a sure destruction impends over those infatuated princes who in the conflict with this new and unheardof power proceed as if they were engaged in a war that bore a resemblance to their former contests or that they can make peace in the spirit of their former arrangements of pacification here the beaten path is the very reverse of the safe road  as to me i was always steadily of opinion that this disorder was not in its nature intermittent i conceived that the contest once begun could not be laid down again to be resumed at our discretion but that our first struggle with this evil would also be our last i never thought we could make peace with the system because it was not for the sake of an object we pursued in rivalry with each other but with the system itself that we were at war as i understood the matter we were at war not with its conduct but with its existenceconvinced that its existence and its hostility were the same  the faction is not local or territorial it is a general evil where it least appears in action it is still full of life in its sleep it recruits its strength and prepares its exertion its spirit lies deep in the corruptions of our common nature the social order which restrains it feeds it it exists in every country in europe and among all orders of men in every country who look up to france as to a common head the centre is there the circumference is the world of europe wherever the race of europe may be settled everywhere else the faction is militant in france it is triumphant in france is the bank of deposit and the bank of circulation of all the pernicious principles that are forming in every state it will be a folly scarcely deserving of pity and too mischievous for contempt to think of restraining it in any other country whilst it is predominant there war instead of being the cause of its force has suspended its operation it has given a reprieve at least to the christian world  the true nature of a jacobin war in the beginning was by most of the christian powers felt acknowledged and even in the most precise manner declared in the joint manifesto published by the emperor and the king of prussia on the 4th of august 1792 it is expressed in the clearest terms and on principles which could not fail if they had adhered to them of classing those monarchs with the first benefactors of mankind this manifesto was published as they themselves express it to lay open to the present generation as well as to posterity their motives their intentions and the disinterestedness of their personal views taking up arms for the purpose of preserving social and political order amongst all civilized nations and to secure to each state its religion happiness independence territories and real constitutionon this ground they hoped that all empires and all states would be unanimous and becoming the firm guardians of the happiness of mankind that they could not fail to unite their efforts to rescue a numerous nation from its own fury to preserve europe from the return of barbarism and the universe from the subversion and anarchy with which it was threatened the whole of that noble performance ought to be read at the first meeting of any congress which may assemble for the purpose of pacification in that piece these powers expressly renounce all views of personal aggrandizement and confine themselves to objects worthy of so generous so heroic and so perfectly wise and politic an enterprise it was to the principles of this confederation and to no other that we wished our sovereign and our country to accede as a part of the commonwealth of europe to these principles with some trifling exceptions and limitations they did fully accede34 and all our friends who took office acceded to the ministry whether wisely or not as i always understood the matter on the faith and on the principles of that declaration  as long as these powers flattered themselves that the menace of force would produce the effect of force they acted on those declarations but when their menaces failed of success their efforts took a new direction it did not appear to them that virtue and heroism ought to be purchased by millions of rixdollars it is a dreadful truth but it is a truth that cannot be concealed in ability in dexterity in the distinctness of their views the jacobins are our superiors they saw the thing right from the very beginning whatever were the first motives to the war among politicians they saw that in its spirit and for its objects it was a civil war and as such they pursued it it is a war between the partisans of the ancient civil moral and political order of europe against a sect of fanatical and ambitious atheists which means to change them all it is not france extending a foreign empire over other nations it is a sect aiming at universal empire and beginning with the conquest of france the leaders of that sect secured the centre of europe and that secured they knew that whatever might be the event of battles and sieges their cause was victorious whether its territory had a little more or a little less peeled from its surface or whether an island or two was detached from its commerce to them was of little moment the conquest of france was a glorious acquisition that once well laid as a basis of empire opportunities never could be wanting to regain or to replace what had been lost and dreadfully to avenge themselves on the faction of their adversaries  they saw it was a civil war it was their business to persuade their adversaries that it ought to be a foreign war the jacobins everywhere set up a cry against the new crusade and they intrigued with effect in the cabinet in the field and in every private society in europe their task was not difficult the condition of princes and sometimes of first ministers too is to be pitied the creatures of the desk and the creatures of favor had no relish for the principles of the manifestoes they promised no governments no regiments no revenues from whence emoluments might arise by perquisite or by grant in truth the tribe of vulgar politicians are the lowest of our species there is no trade so vile and mechanical as government in their hands virtue is not their habit they are out of themselves in any course of conduct recommended only by conscience and glory a large liberal and prospective view of the interests of states passes with them for romance and the principles that recommend it for the wanderings of a disordered imagination the calculators compute them out of their senses the jesters and buffoons shame them out of everything grand and elevated littleness in object and in means to them appears soundness and sobriety they think there is nothing worth pursuit but that which they can handle which they can measure with a twofoot rule which they can tell upon ten fingers  without the principles of the jacobins perhaps without any principles at all they played the game of that faction there was a beaten road before them the powers of europe were armed france had always appeared dangerous the war was easily diverted from france as a faction to france as a state the princes were easily taught to slide back into their old habitual course of politics they were easily led to consider the flames that were consuming france not as a warning to protect their own buildings which were without any partywall and linked by a contignation into the edifice of france but as an happy occasion for pillaging the goods and for carrying off the materials of their neighbors house their provident fears were changed into avaricious hopes they carried on their new designs without seeming to abandon the principles of their old policy they pretended to seek or they flattered themselves that they sought in the accession of new fortresses and new territories a defensive security but the security wanted was against a kind of power which was not so truly dangerous in its fortresses nor in its territories as in its spirit and its principles they aimed or pretended to aim at defending themselves against a danger from which there can be no security in any defensive plan if armies and fortresses were a defence against jacobinism louis the sixteenth would this day reign a powerful monarch over an happy people  this error obliged them even in their offensive operations to adopt a plan of war against the success of which there was something little short of mathematical demonstration they refused to take any step which might strike at the heart of affairs they seemed unwilling to wound the enemy in any vital part they acted through the whole as if they really wished the conservation of the jacobin power as what might be more favorable than the lawful government to the attainment of the petty objects they looked for they always kept on the circumference and the wider and remoter the circle was the more eagerly they chose it as their sphere of action in this centrifugal war the plan they pursued in its nature demanded great length of time in its execution they who went the nearest way to work were obliged to cover an incredible extent of country it left to the enemy every means of destroying this extended line of weakness ill success in any part was sure to defeat the effect of the whole this is true of austria it is still more true of england on this false plan even good fortune by further weakening the victor put him but the further off from his object  as long as there was any appearance of success the spirit of aggrandizement and consequently the spirit of mutual jealousy seized upon all the coalesced powers some sought an accession of territory at the expense of france some at the expense of each other some at the expense of third parties and when the vicissitude of disaster took its turn they found common distress a treacherous bond of faith and friendship  the greatest skill conducting the greatest military apparatus has been employed but it has been worse than uselessly employed through the false policy of the war the operations of the field suffered by the errors of the cabinet if the same spirit continues when peace is made the peace will fix and perpetuate all the errors of the war because it will be made upon the same false principle what has been lost in the field in the field may be regained an arrangement of peace in its nature is a permanent settlement it is the effect of counsel and deliberation and not of fortuitous events if built upon a basis fundamentally erroneous it can only be retrieved by some of those unforeseen dispensations which the allwise but mysterious governor of the world sometimes interposes to snatch nations from ruin it would not be pious error but mad and impious presumption for any one to trust in an unknown order of dispensations in defiance of the rules of prudence which are formed upon the known march of the ordinary providence of god  it was not of that sort of war that i was amongst the least considerable but amongst the most zealous advisers and it is not by the sort of peace now talked of that i wish it concluded it would answer no great purpose to enter into the particular errors of the war the whole has been but one error it was but nominally a war of alliance as the combined powers pursued it there was nothing to hold an alliance together there could be no tie of honor in a society for pillage there could be no tie of a common interest where the object did not offer such a division amongst the parties as could well give them a warm concern in the gains of each other or could indeed form such a body of equivalents as might make one of them willing to abandon a separate object of his ambition for the gratification of any other member of the alliance the partition of poland offered an object of spoil in which the parties might agree they were circumjacent and each might take a portion convenient to his own territory they might dispute about the value of their several shares but the contiguity to each of the demandants always furnished the means of an adjustment though hereafter the world will have cause to rue this iniquitous measure and they most who were most concerned in it for the moment there was wherewithal in the object to preserve peace amongst confederates in wrong but the spoil of france did not afford the same facilities for accommodation what might satisfy the house of austria in a flemish frontier afforded no equivalent to tempt the cupidity of the king of prussia what might be desired by great britain in the west indies must be coldly and remotely if at all felt as an interest at vienna and it would be felt as something worse than a negative interest at madrid austria long possessed with unwise and dangerous designs on italy could not be very much in earnest about the conservation of the old patrimony of the house of savoy and sardinia who owed to an italian force all her means of shutting out france from italy of which she has been supposed to hold the key would not purchase the means of strength upon one side by yielding it on the other she would not readily give the possession of novara for the hope of savoy no continental power was willing to lose any of its continental objects for the increase of the naval power of great britain and great britain would not give up any of the objects she sought for as the means of an increase to her naval power to further their aggrandizement  the moment this war came to be considered as a war merely of profit the actual circumstances are such that it never could become really a war of alliance nor can the peace be a peace of alliance until things are put upon their right bottom  i dont find it denied that when a treaty is entered into for peace a demand will be made on the regicides to surrender a great part of their conquests on the continent will they in the present state of the war make that surrender without an equivalent this continental cession must of course be made in favor of that party in the alliance that has suffered losses that party has nothing to furnish towards an equivalent what equivalent for instance has holland to offer who has lost her all what equivalent can come from the emperor every part of whose territories contiguous to france is already within the pale of the regicide dominion what equivalent has sardinia to offer for savoy and for nicei may say for her whole being what has she taken from the faction of france she has lost very near her all and she has gained nothing what equivalent has spain to give alas she has already paid for her own ransom the fund of equivalentand a dreadful equivalent it is to england and to herself but i put spain out of the question she is a province of the jacobin empire and she must make peace or war according to the orders she receives from the directory of assassins in effect and substance her crown is a fief of regicide  whence then can the compensation be demanded undoubtedly from that power which alone has made some conquests that power is england will the allies then give away their ancient patrimony that england may keep islands in the west indies they never can protract the war in good earnest for that object nor can they act in concert with us in our refusal to grant anything towards their redemption in that case we are thus situated either we must give europe bound hand and foot to france or we must quit the west indies without any one object great or small towards indemnity and security i repeat it without any advantage whatever because supposing that our conquest could comprise all that france ever possessed in the tropical america it never can amount in any fair estimation to a fair equivalent for holland for the austrian netherlands for the lower germanythat is for the whole ancient kingdom or circle of burgundy now under the yoke of regicide to say nothing of almost all italy under the same barbarous domination if we treat in the present situation of things we have nothing in our hands that can redeem europe nor is the emperor as i have observed more rich in the fund of equivalents  if we look to our stock in the eastern world our most valuable and systematic acquisitions are made in that quarter is it from france they are made france has but one or two contemptible factories subsisting by the offal of the private fortunes of english individuals to support them in any part of india i look on the taking of the cape of good hope as the securing of a post of great moment it does honor to those who planned and to those who executed that enterprise but i speak of it always as comparatively goodas good as anything can be in a scheme of war that repels us from a centre and employs all our forces where nothing can be finally decisive but giving as i freely give every possible credit to these eastern conquests i ask one questionon whom are they made it is evident that if we can keep our eastern conquests we keep them not at the expense of france but at the expense of holland our allyof holland the immediate cause of the war the nation whom we had undertaken to protect and not of the republic which it was our business to destroy if we return the african and the asiatic conquests we put them into the hands of a nominal state to that holland is reduced unable to retain them and which will virtually leave them under the direction of france if we withhold them holland declines still more as a state she loses so much carrying trade and that means of keeping up the small degree of naval power she holds for which policy alone and not for any commercial gain she maintains the cape or any settlement beyond it in that case resentment faction and even necessity will throw her more and more into the power of the new mischievous republic but on the probable state of holland i shall say more when in this correspondence i come to talk over with you the state in which any sort of jacobin peace will leave all europe  so far as to the east indies  as to the west indiesindeed as to either if we look for matter of exchange in order to ransom europeit is easy to show that we have taken a terribly roundabout road i cannot conceive even if for the sake of holding conquests there we should refuse to redeem holland and the austrian netherlands and the hither germany that spain merely as she is spain and forgetting that the regicide ambassador governs at madrid will see with perfect satisfaction great britain sole mistress of the isles in truth it appears to me that when we come to balance our account we shall find in the proposed peace only the pure simple and unendowed charms of jacobin amity we shall have the satisfaction of knowing that no blood or treasure has been spared by the allies for support of the regicide system we shall reflect at leisure on one great truth that it was ten times more easy totally to destroy the system itself than when established it would be to reduce its powerand that this republic most formidable abroad was of all things the weakest at home that her frontier was terrible her interior feeble that it was matter of choice to attack her where she is invincible and to spare her where she was ready to dissolve by her own internal disorders we shall reflect that our plan was good neither for offence nor defence  it would not be at all difficult to prove that an army of an hundred thousand men horse foot and artillery might have been employed against the enemy on the very soil which he has usurped at a far less expense than has been squandered away upon tropical adventures in these adventures it was not an enemy we had to vanquish but a cemetery to conquer in carrying on the war in the west indies the hostile sword is merciful the country in which we engage is the dreadful enemy there the european conqueror finds a cruel defeat in the very fruits of his success every advantage is but a new demand on england for recruits to the west indian grave in a west india war the regicides have for their troops a race of fierce barbarians to whom the poisoned air in which our youth inhale certain death is salubrity and life to them the climate is the surest and most faithful of allies  had we carried on the war on the side of france which looks towards the channel or the atlantic we should have attacked our enemy on his weak and unarmed side we should not have to reckon on the loss of a man who did not fall in battle we should have an ally in the heart of the country who to our hundred thousand would at one time have added eighty thousand men at the least and all animated by principle by enthusiasm and by vengeance motives which secured them to the cause in a very different manner from some of those allies whom we subsidized with millions this ally or rather this principal in the war by the confession of the regicide himself was more formidable to him than all his other foes united warring there we should have led our arms to the capital of wrong defeated we could not fail proper precautions taken of a sure retreat stationary and only supporting the royalists an impenetrable barrier an impregnable rampart would have been formed between the enemy and his naval power we are probably the only nation who have declined to act against an enemy when it might have been done in his own country and who having an armed a powerful and a long victorious ally in that country declined all effectual coöperation and suffered him to perish for want of support on the plan of a war in france every advantage that our allies might obtain would be doubled in its effect disasters on the one side might have a fair chance of being compensated by victories on the other had we brought the main of our force to bear upon that quarter all the operations of the british and imperial crowns would have been combined the war would have had system correspondence and a certain direction but as the war has been pursued the operations of the two crowns have not the smallest degree of mutual bearing or relation  had acquisitions in the west indies been our object on success in france everything reasonable in those remote parts might be demanded with decorum and justice and a sure effect well might we call for a recompense in america for those services to which europe owed its safety having abandoned this obvious policy connected with principle we have seen the regicide power taking the reverse course and making real conquests in the west indies to which all our dearbought advantages if we could hold them are mean and contemptible the noblest island within the tropics worth all that we possess put together is by the vassal spaniard delivered into her hands the island of hispaniola of which we have but one poor corner by a slippery hold is perhaps equal to england in extent and in fertility is far superior the part possessed by spain of that great island made for the seat and centre of a tropical empire was not improved to be sure as the french division had been before it was systematically destroyed by the cannibal republic but it is not only the far larger but the far more salubrious and more fertile part  it was delivered into the hands of the barbarians without as i can find any public reclamation on our part not only in contravention to one of the fundamental treaties that compose the public law of europe but in defiance of the fundamental colonial policy of spain herself this part of the treaty of utrecht was made for great general ends unquestionably but whilst it provided for those general ends it was in affirmance of that particular policy it was not to injure but to save spain by making a settlement of her estate which prohibited her to alienate to france it is her policy not to see the balance of west indian power overturned by france or by great britain whilst the monarchies subsisted this unprincipled cession was what the influence of the elder branch of the house of bourbon never dared to attempt on the younger but cannibal terror has been more powerful than family influence the bourbon monarchy of spain is united to the republic of france by what may be truly called the ties of blood  by this measure the balance of power in the west indies is totally destroyed it has followed the balance of power in europe it is not alone what shall be left nominally to the assassins that is theirs theirs is the whole empire of spain in america that stroke finishes all i should be glad to see our suppliant negotiator in the act of putting his feather to the ear of the directory to make it unclench the fist and by his tickling to charm that rich prize out of the iron gripe of robbery and ambition it does not require much sagacity to discern that no power wholly baffled and defeated in europe can flatter itself with conquests in the west indies in that state of things it can neither keep nor hold no it cannot even long make war if the grand bank and deposit of its force is at all in the west indies but here a scene opens to my view too important to pass by perhaps too critical to touch is it possible that it should not present itself in all its relations to a mind habituated to consider either war or peace on a large scale or as one whole  unfortunately other ideas have prevailed a remote an expensive a murderous and in the end an unproductive adventure carried on upon ideas of mercantile knighterrantry without any of the generous wildness of quixotism is considered as sound solid sense and a war in a wholesome climate a war at our door a war directly on the enemy a war in the heart of his country a war in concert with an internal ally and in combination with the external is regarded as folly and romance  my dear friend i hold it impossible that these considerations should have escaped the statesmen on both sides of the water and on both sides of the house of commons how a question of peace can be discussed without having them in view i cannot imagine if you or others see a way out of these difficulties i am happy i see indeed a fund from whence equivalents will be proposed i see it but i cannot just now touch it it is a question of high moment it opens another iliad of woes to europe  such is the time proposed for making a common political peace to which no one circumstance is propitious as to the grand principle of the peace it is left as if by common consent wholly out of the question  viewing things in this light i have frequently sunk into a degree of despondency and dejection hardly to be described yet out of the profoundest depths of this despair an impulse which i have in vain endeavored to resist has urged me to raise one feeble cry against this unfortunate coalition which is formed at home in order to make a coalition with france subversive of the whole ancient order of the world no disaster of war no calamity of season could ever strike me with half the horror which i felt from what is introduced to us by this junction of parties under the soothing name of peace we are apt to speak of a low and pusillanimous spirit as the ordinary cause by which dubious wars terminate in humiliating treaties it is here the direct contrary i am perfectly astonished at the boldness of character at the intrepidity of mind the firmness of nerve in those who are able with deliberation to face the perils of jacobin fraternity  this fraternity is indeed so terrible in its nature and in its manifest consequences that there is no way of quieting our apprehensions about it but by totally putting it out of sight by substituting for it through a sort of periphrasis something of an ambiguous quality and describing such a connection under the terms of the usual relations of peace and amity by this means the proposed fraternity is hustled in the crowd of those treaties which imply no change in the public law of europe and which do not upon system affect the interior condition of nations it is confounded with those conventions in which matters of dispute among sovereign powers are compromised by the taking off a duty more or less by the surrender of a frontier town or a disputed district on the one side or the other by pactions in which the pretensions of families are settled as by a conveyancer making family substitutions and successions without any alteration in the laws manners religion privileges and customs of the cities or territories which are the subject of such arrangements  all this body of old conventions composing the vast and voluminous collection called the corps diplomatique forms the code or statute law as the methodized reasonings of the great publicists and jurists form the digest and jurisprudence of the christian world in these treasures are to be found the usual relations of peace and amity in civilized europe and there the relations of ancient france were to be found amongst the rest  the present system in france is not the ancient france it is not the ancient france with ordinary ambition and ordinary means it is not a new power of an old kind it is a new power of a new species when such a questionable shape is to be admitted for the first time into the brotherhood of christendom it is not a mere matter of idle curiosity to consider how far it is in its nature alliable with the rest or whether the relations of peace and amity with this new state are likely to be of the same nature with the usual relations of the states of europe  the revolution in france had the relation of france to other nations as one of its principal objects the changes made by that revolution were not the better to accommodate her to the old and usual relations but to produce new ones the revolution was made not to make france free but to make her formidablenot to make her a neighbor but a mistressnot to make her more observant of laws but to put her in a condition to impose them to make france truly formidable it was necessary that france should be newmodelled they who have not followed the train of the late proceedings have been led by deceitful representations which deceit made a part in the plan to conceive that this totally new model of a state in which nothing escaped a change was made with a view to its internal relations only  in the revolution of france two sorts of men were principally concerned in giving a character and determination to its pursuits the philosophers and the politicians they took different ways but they met in the same end  the philosophers had one predominant object which they pursued with a fanatical furythat is the utter extirpation of religion to that every question of empire was subordinate they had rather domineer in a parish of atheists than rule over a christian world their temporal ambition was wholly subservient to their proselytizing spirit in which they were not exceeded by mahomet himself  they who have made but superficial studies in the natural history of the human mind have been taught to look on religious opinions as the only cause of enthusiastic zeal and sectarian propagation but there is no doctrine whatever on which men can warm that is not capable of the very same effect the social nature of man impels him to propagate his principles as much as physical impulses urge him to propagate his kind the passions give zeal and vehemence the understanding bestows design and system the whole man moves under the discipline of his opinions religion is among the most powerful causes of enthusiasm when anything concerning it becomes an object of much meditation it cannot be indifferent to the mind they who do not love religion hate it the rebels to god perfectly abhor the author of their being they hate him with all their heart with all their mind with all their soul and with all their strength he never presents himself to their thoughts but to menace and alarm them they cannot strike the sun out of heaven but they are able to raise a smouldering smoke that obscures him from their own eyes not being able to revenge themselves on god they have a delight in vicariously defacing degrading torturing and tearing in pieces his image in man let no one judge of them by what he has conceived of them when they were not incorporated and had no lead they were then only passengers in a common vehicle they were then carried along with the general motion of religion in the community and without being aware of it partook of its influence in that situation at worst their nature was left free to counterwork their principles they despaired of giving any very general currency to their opinions they considered them as a reserved privilege for the chosen few but when the possibility of dominion lead and propagation presented themselves and that the ambition which before had so often made them hypocrites might rather gain than lose by a daring avowal of their sentiments then the nature of this infernal spirit which has evil for its good appeared in its full perfection nothing indeed but the possession of some power can with any certainty discover what at the bottom is the true character of any man without reading the speeches of vergniaud français of nantes isnard and some others of that sort it would not be easy to conceive the passion rancor and malice of their tongues and hearts they worked themselves up to a perfect frenzy against religion and all its professors they tore the reputation of the clergy to pieces by their infuriated declamations and invectives before they lacerated their bodies by their massacres this fanatical atheism left out we omit the principal feature in the french revolution and a principal consideration with regard to the effects to be expected from a peace with it  the other sort of men were the politicians to them who had little or not at all reflected on the subject religion was in itself no object of love or hatred they disbelieved it and that was all neutral with regard to that object they took the side which in the present state of things might best answer their purposes they soon found that they could not do without the philosophers and the philosophers soon made them sensible that the destruction of religion was to supply them with means of conquest first at home and then abroad the philosophers were the active internal agitators and supplied the spirit and principles the second gave the practical direction sometimes the one predominated in the composition sometimes the other the only difference between them was in the necessity of concealing the general design for a time and in their dealing with foreign nations the fanatics going straight forward and openly the politicians by the surer mode of zigzag in the course of events this among other causes produced fierce and bloody contentions between them but at the bottom they thoroughly agreed in all the objects of ambition and irreligion and substantially in all the means of promoting these ends  without question to bring about the unexampled event of the french revolution the concurrence of a very great number of views and passions was necessary in that stupendous work no one principle by which the human mind may have its faculties at once invigorated and depraved was left unemployed but i can speak it to a certainty and support it by undoubted proofs that the ruling principle of those who acted in the revolution as statesmen had the exterior aggrandizement of france as their ultimate end in the most minute part of the internal changes that were made we who of late years have been drawn from an attention to foreign affairs by the importance of our domestic discussions cannot easily form a conception of the general eagerness of the active and energetic part of the french nation itself the most active and energetic of all nations previous to its revolution upon that subject i am convinced that the foreign speculators in france under the old government were twenty to one of the same description then or now in england and few of that description there were who did not emulously set forward the revolution the whole official system particularly in the diplomatic part the regulars the irregulars down to the clerks in office a corps without all comparison more numerous than the same amongst us coöperated in it all the intriguers in foreign politics all the spies all the intelligencers actually or late in function all the candidates for that sort of employment acted solely upon that principle  on that system of aggrandizement there was but one mind but two violent factions arose about the means the first wished france diverted from the politics of the continent to attend solely to her marine to feed it by an increase of commerce and thereby to overpower england on her own element they contended that if england were disabled the powers on the continent would fall into their proper subordination that it was england which deranged the whole continental system of europe the others who were by far the more numerous though not the most outwardly prevalent at court considered this plan for france as contrary to her genius her situation and her natural means they agreed as to the ultimate object the reduction of the british power and if possible its naval power but they considered an ascendancy on the continent as a necessary preliminary to that undertaking they argued that the proceedings of england herself had proved the soundness of this policy that her greatest and ablest statesmen had not considered the support of a continental balance against france as a deviation from the principle of her naval power but as one of the most effectual modes of carrying it into effect that such had been her policy ever since the revolution during which period the naval strength of great britain had gone on increasing in the direct ratio of her interference in the politics of the continent with much stronger reason ought the politics of france to take the same directionas well for pursuing objects which her situation would dictate to her though england had no existence as for counteracting the politics of that nation to france continental politics are primary they looked on them only of secondary consideration to england and however necessary but as means necessary to an end  what is truly astonishing the partisans of those two opposite systems were at once prevalent and at once employed and in the very same transactions the one ostensibly the other secretly during the latter part of the reign of louis the fifteenth nor was there one court in which an ambassador resided on the part of the ministers in which another as a spy on him did not also reside on the part of the king they who pursued the scheme for keeping peace on the continent and particularly with austria acting officially and publicly the other faction counteracting and opposing them these private agents were continually going from their function to the bastile and from the bastile to employment and favor again an inextricable cabal was formed some of persons of rank others of subordinates but by this means the corps of politicians was augmented in number and the whole formed a body of active adventuring ambitious discontented people despising the regular ministry despising the courts at which they were employed despising the court which employed them  the unfortunate louis the sixteenth35 was not the first cause of the evil by which he suffered he came to it as to a sort of inheritance by the false politics of his immediate predecessor this system of dark and perplexed intrigue had come to its perfection before he came to the throne and even then the revolution strongly operated in all its causes  there was no point on which the discontented diplomatic politicians so bitterly arraigned their cabinet as for the decay of french influence in all others from quarrelling with the court they began to complain of monarchy itself as a system of government too variable for any regular plan of national aggrandizement they observed that in that sort of regimen too much depended on the personal character of the prince that the vicissitudes produced by the succession of princes of a different character and even the vicissitudes produced in the same man by the different views and inclinations belonging to youth manhood and age disturbed and distracted the policy of a country made by nature for extensive empire or what was still more to their taste for that sort of general overruling influence which prepared empire or supplied the place of it they had continually in their hands the observations of machiavel on livy they had montesquieus grandeur et décadence des romains as a manual and they compared with mortification the systematic proceedings of a roman senate with the fluctuations of a monarchy they observed the very small additions of territory which all the power of prance actuated by all the ambition of france had acquired in two centuries the romans had frequently acquired more in a single year they severely and in every part of it criticized the reign of louis the fourteenth whose irregular and desultory ambition had more provoked than endangered europe indeed they who will be at the pains of seriously considering the history of that period will see that those french politicians had some reason they who will not take the trouble of reviewing it through all its wars and all its negotiations will consult the short but judicious criticism of the marquis de montalembert on that subject it may be read separately from his ingenious system of fortification and military defence on the practical merit of which i am unable to form a judgment  the diplomatic politicians of whom i speak and who formed by far the majority in that class made disadvantageous comparisons even between their more legal and formalizing monarchy and the monarchies of other states as a system of power and influence they observed that france not only lost ground herself but through the languor and unsteadiness of her pursuits and from her aiming through commerce at naval force which she never could attain without losing more on one side than she could gain on the other three great powers each of them as military states capable of balancing her had grown up on the continent russia and prussia had been created almost within memory and austria though not a new power and even curtailed in territory was by the very collision in which she lost that territory greatly improved in her military discipline and force during the reign of maria theresa the interior economy of the country was made more to correspond with the support of great armies than formerly it had been as to prussia a merely military power they observed that one war had enriched her with as considerable a conquest as france had acquired in centuries russia had broken the turkish power by which austria might be as formerly she had been balanced in favor of france they felt it with pain that the two northern powers of sweden and denmark were in general under the sway of russiaor that at best france kept up a very doubtful conflict with many fluctuations of fortune and at an enormous expense in sweden in holland the french party seemed if not extinguished at least utterly obscured and kept under by a stadtholder leaning for support sometimes on great britain sometimes on prussia sometimes on both never on france even the spreading of the bourbon family had become merely a family accommodation and had little effect oh the national politics this alliance they said extinguished spain by destroying all its energy without adding anything to the real power of france in the accession of the forces of its great rival in italy the same family accommodation the same national insignificance were equally visible what cure for the radical weakness of the french monarchy to which all the means which wit could devise or nature and fortune could bestow towards universal empire was not of force to give life or vigor or consistency but in a republic out the word came and it never went back  whether they reasoned right or wrong or that there was some mixture of right and wrong in their reasoning i am sure that in this manner they felt and reasoned the different effects of a great military and ambitious republic and of a monarchy of the same description were constantly in their mouths the principle was ready to operate when opportunities should offer which few of them indeed foresaw in the extent in which they were afterwards presented but these opportunities in some degree or other they all ardently wished for  when i was in paris in 1773 the treaty of 1756 between austria and france was deplored as a national calamity because it united france in friendship with a power at whose expense alone they could hope any continental aggrandizement when the first partition of poland was made in which france had no share and which had farther aggrandized every one of the three powers of which they were most jealous i found them in a perfect frenzy of rage and indignation not that they were hurt at the shocking and uncolored violence and injustice of that partition but at the debility improvidence and want of activity in their government in not preventing it as a means of aggrandizement to their rivals or in not contriving by exchanges of some kind or other to obtain their share of advantage from that robbery  in that or nearly in that state of things and of opinions came the austrian match which promised to draw the knot as afterwards in effect it did still more closely between the old rival houses this added exceedingly to their hatred and contempt of their monarchy it was for this reason that the late glorious queen who on all accounts was formed to produce general love and admiration and whose life was as mild and beneficent as her death was beyond example great and heroic became so very soon and so very much the object of an implacable rancor never to be extinguished but in her blood when i wrote my letter in answer to m de menonville in the beginning of january 1791 i had good reason for thinking that this description of revolutionists did not so early nor so steadily point their murderous designs at the martyr king as at the royal heroine it was accident and the momentary depression of that part of the faction that gave to the husband the happy priority in death  from this their restless desire of an overruling influence they bent a very great part of their designs and efforts to revive the old french party which was a democratic party in holland and to make a revolution there they were happy at the troubles which the singular imprudence of joseph the second had stirred up in the austrian netherlands they rejoiced when they saw him irritate his subjects profess philosophy send away the dutch garrisons and dismantle his fortifications as to holland they never forgave either the king or the ministry for suffering that object which they justly looked on as principal in their design of reducing the power of england to escape out of their hands this was the true secret of the commercial treaty made on their part against all the old rules and principles of commerce with a view of diverting the english nation by a pursuit of immediate profit from an attention to the progress of france in its designs upon that republic the system of the economists which led to the general opening of commerce facilitated that treaty but did not produce it they were in despair when they found that by the vigor of mr pitt supported in this point by mr fox and the opposition the object to which they had sacrificed their manufactures was lost to their ambition  this eager desire of raising france from the condition into which she had fallen as they conceived from her monarchical imbecility had been the main spring of their precedent interference in that unhappy american quarrel the bad effects of which to this nation have not as yet fully disclosed themselves these sentiments had been long lurking in their breasts though their views were only discovered now and then in heat and as by escapes but on this occasion they exploded suddenly they were professed with ostentation and propagated with zeal these sentiments were not produced as some think by their american alliance the american alliance was produced by their republican principles and republican policy this new relation undoubtedly did much the discourses and cabals that it produced the intercourse that it established and above all the example which made it seem practicable to establish a republic in a great extent of country finished the work and gave to that part of the revolutionary faction a degree of strength which required other energies than the late king possessed to resist or even to restrain it spread everywhere but it was nowhere more prevalent than in the heart of the court the palace of versailles by its language seemed a forum of democracy to have pointed out to most of those politicians from their dispositions and movements what has since happened the fall of their own monarchy of their own laws of their own religion would have been to furnish a motive the more for pushing forward a system on which they considered all these things as incumbrances such in truth they were and we have seen them succeed not only in the destruction of their monarchy but in all the objects of ambition that they proposed from that destruction  when i contemplate the scheme on which france is formed and when i compare it with these systems with which it is and ever must be in conflict those things which seem as defects in her polity are the very things which make me tremble the states of the christian world have grown up to their present magnitude in a great length of time and by a great variety of accidents they have been improved to what we see them with greater or less degrees of felicity and skill not one of them has been formed upon a regular plan or with any unity of design as their constitutions are not systematical they have not been directed to any peculiar end eminently distinguished and superseding every other the objects which they embrace are of the greatest possible variety and have become in a manner infinite in all these old countries the state has been made to the people and not the people conformed to the state every state has pursued not only every sort of social advantage but it has cultivated the welfare of every individual his wants his wishes even his tastes have been consulted this comprehensive scheme virtually produced a degree of personal liberty in forms the most adverse to it that liberty was found under monarchies styled absolute in a degree unknown to the ancient commonwealths from hence the powers of all our modern states meet in all their movements with some obstruction it is therefore no wonder that when these states are to be considered as machines to operate for some one great end that this dissipated and balanced force is not easily concentred or made to bear with the whole force of the nation upon one point  the british state is without question that which pursues the greatest variety of ends and is the least disposed to sacrifice any one of them to another or to the whole it aims at taking in the entire circle of human desires and securing for them their fair enjoyment our legislature has been ever closely connected in its most efficient part with individual feeling and individual interest personal liberty the most lively of these feelings and the most important of these interests which in other european countries has rather arisen from the system of manners and the habitudes of life than from the laws of the state in which it flourished more from neglect than attention in england has been a direct object of government  on this principle england would be the weakest power in the whole system fortunately however the great riches of this kingdom arising from a variety of causes and the disposition of the people which is as great to spend as to accumulate has easily afforded a disposable surplus that gives a mighty momentum to the state this difficulty with these advantages to overcome it has called forth the talents of the english financiers who by the surplus of industry poured out by prodigality have outdone everything which has been accomplished in other nations the present minister has outdone his predecessors and as a minister of revenue is far above my power of praise but still there are cases in which england feels more than several others though they all feel the perplexity of an immense body of balanced advantages and of individual demands and of some irregularity in the whole mass  france differs essentially from all those governments which are formed without system which exist by habit and which are confused with the multitude and with the complexity of their pursuits what now stands as government in france is struck out at a heat the design is wicked immoral impious oppressive but it is spirited and daring it is systematic it is simple in its principle it has unity and consistency in perfection in that country entirely to cut off a branch of commerce to extinguish a manufacture to destroy the circulation of money to violate credit to suspend the course of agriculture even to burn a city or to lay waste a province of their own does not cost them a moments anxiety to them the will the wish the want the liberty the toil the blood of individuals is as nothing individuality is left out of their scheme of government the state is all in all everything is referred to the production of force afterwards everything is trusted to the use of it it is military in its principle in its maxims in its spirit and in all its movements the state has dominion and conquest for its sole objectsdominion over minds by proselytism over bodies by arms  thus constituted with an immense body of natural means which are lessened in their amount only to be increased in their effect france has since the accomplishment of the revolution a complete unity in its direction it has destroyed every resource of the state which depends upon opinion and the goodwill of individuals the riches of convention disappear the advantages of nature in some measure remain even these i admit are astonishingly lessened the command over what remains is complete and absolute we go about asking when assignats will expire and we laugh at the last price of them but what signifies the fate of those tickets of despotism the despotism will find despotic means of supply they have found the short cut to the productions of nature while others in pursuit of them are obliged to wind through the labyrinth of a very intricate state of society they seize upon the fruit of the labor they seize upon the laborer himself were france but half of what it is in population in compactness in applicability of its force situated as it is and being what it is it would be too strong for most of the states of europe constituted as they are and proceeding as they proceed would it be wise to estimate what the world of europe as well as the world of asia had to dread from genghiz khân upon a contemplation of the resources of the cold and barren spot in the remotest tartary from whence first issued that scourge of the human race ought we to judge from the excise and stamp duties of the rocks or from the paper circulation of the sands of arabia the power by which mahomet and his tribes laid hold at once on the two most powerful empires of the world beat one of them totally to the ground broke to pieces the other and in not much longer space of time than i have lived overturned governments laws manners religion and extended an empire from the indus to the pyrenees  material resources never have supplied nor ever can supply the want of unity in design and constancy in pursuit but unity in design and perseverance and boldness in pursuit have never wanted resources and never will we have not considered as we ought the dreadful energy of a state in which the property has nothing to do with the government reflect my dear sir reflect again and again on a government in which the property is in complete subjection and where nothing roles but the mind of desperate men the condition of a commonwealth not governed by its property was a combination of things which the learned and ingenious speculator harrington who has tossed about society into all forms never could imagine to be possible we have seen it the world has felt it and if the world will shut their eyes to this state of things they will feel it more the rulers there have found their resources in crimes the discovery is dreadful the mine exhaustless they have everything to gain and they have nothing to lose they have a boundless inheritance in hope and there is no medium for them betwixt the highest elevation and death with infamy never can they who from the miserable servitude of the desk have been raised to empire again submit to the bondage of a starving bureau or the profit of copying music or writing plaidoyers by the sheet it has made me often smile in bitterness when i have heard talk of an indemnity to such men provided they returned to their allegiance  from all this what is my inference it is that this new system of robbery in france cannot be rendered safe by any art that it must be destroyed or that it will destroy all europe that to destroy that enemy by some means or other the force opposed to it should be made to bear some analogy and resemblance to the force and spirit which that system exerts that war ought to be made against it in its vulnerable parts these are my inferences in one word with this republic nothing independent can coexist the errors of louis the sixteenth were more pardonable to prudence than any of those of the same kind into which the allied courts may fall they have the benefit of his dreadful example  the unhappy louis the sixteenth was a man of the best intentions that probably ever reigned he was by no means deficient in talents he had a most laudable desire to supply by general reading and even by the acquisition of elemental knowledge an education in all points originally defective but nobody told him and it was no wonder he should not himself divine it that the world of which he read and the world in which he lived were no longer the same desirous of doing everything for the best fearful of cabal distrusting his own judgment he sought his ministers of all kinds upon public testimony but as courts are the field for caballers the public is the theatre for mountebanks and impostors the cure for both those evils is in the discernment of the prince but an accurate and penetrating discernment is what in a young prince could not be looked for  his conduct in its principle was not unwise but like most other of his wellmeant designs it failed in his hands it failed partly from mere ill fortune to which speculators are rarely pleased to assign that very large share to which she is justly entitled in all human affairs the failure perhaps in part was owing to his suffering his system to be vitiated and disturbed by those intrigues which it is humanly speaking impossible wholly to prevent in courts or indeed under any form of government however with these aberrations he gave himself over to a succession of the statesmen of public opinion in other things he thought that he might be a king on the terms of his predecessors he was conscious of the purity of his heart and the general good tendency of his government he flattered himself as most men in his situation will that he might consult his ease without danger to his safety it is not at all wonderful that both he and his ministers giving way abundantly in other respects to innovation should take up in policy with the tradition of their monarchy under his ancestors the monarchy had subsisted and even been strengthened by the generation or support of republics first the swiss republics grew under the guardianship of the french monarchy the dutch republics were hatched and cherished under the same incubation afterwards a republican constitution was under the influence of france established in the empire against the pretensions of its chief even whilst the monarchy of france by a series of wars and negotiations and lastly by the treaties of westphalia had obtained the establishment of the protestants in germany as a law of the empire the same monarchy under louis the thirteenth had force enough to destroy the republican system of the protestants at home  louis the sixteenth was a diligent reader of history but the very lamp of prudence blinded him the guide of human life led him astray a silent revolution in the moral world preceded the political and prepared it it became of more importance than ever what examples were given and what measures wore adopted their causes no longer lurked in the recesses of cabinets or in the private conspiracies of the factious they were no longer to be controlled by the force and influence of the grandees who formerly had been able to stir up troubles by their discontents and to quiet them by their corruption the chain of subordination even in cabal and sedition was broken in its most important links it was no longer the great and the populace other interests were formed other dependencies other connections other communications the middle classes had swelled far beyond their former proportion like whatever is the most effectively rich and great in society these classes became the seat of all the active politics and the preponderating weight to decide on them there were all the energies by which fortune is acquired there the consequence of their success there were all the talents which assert their pretensions and are impatient of the place which settled society prescribes to them these descriptions had got between the great and the populace and the influence on the lower classes was with them the spirit of ambition had taken possession of this class as violently as ever it had done of any other they felt the importance of this situation the correspondence of the moneyed and the mercantile world the literary intercourse of academies but above all the press of which they had in a manner entire possession made a kind of electric communication everywhere the press in reality has made every government in its spirit almost democratic without the great the first movements in this revolution could not perhaps have been given but the spirit of ambition now for the first time connected with the spirit of speculation was not to be restrained at will there was no longer any means of arresting a principle in its course when louis the sixteenth under the influence of the enemies to monarchy meant to found but one republic he set up two when he meant to take away half the crown of his neighbor he lost the whole of his own louis the sixteenth could not with impunity countenance a new republic yet between his throne and that dangerous lodgment for an enemy which he had erected he had the whole atlantic for a ditch he had for an outwork the english nation itself friendly to liberty adverse to that mode of it he was surrounded by a rampart of monarchies most of them allied to him and generally under his influence yet even thus secured a republic erected under his auspices and dependent on his power became fatal to his throne the very money which he had lent to support this republic by a good faith which to him operated as perfidy was punctually paid to his enemies and became a resource in the hands of his assassins  with this example before their eyes do any ministers in england do any ministers in austria really flatter themselves that they can erect not on the remote shores of the atlantic but in their view in their vicinity in absolute contact with one of them not a commercial but a martial republica republic not of simple husbandmen or fishermen but of intriguers and of warriorsa republic of a character the most restless the most enterprising the most impious the most fierce and bloody the most hypocritical and perfidious the most bold and daring that ever has been seen or indeed that can be conceived to exist without bringing on their own certain ruin  such is the republic to which we are going to give a place in civilized fellowshipthe republic which with joint consent we are going to establish in the centre of europe in a post that overlooks and commands every other state and which eminently confronts and menaces this kingdom  you cannot fail to observe that i speak as if the allied powers were actually consenting and not compelled by events to the establishment of this faction in france the words have not escaped me you will hereafter naturally expect that i should make them good but whether in adopting this measure we are madly active or weakly passive or pusillanimously panicstruck the effects will be the same you may call this faction which has eradicated the monarchy expelled the proprietary persecuted religion and trampled upon law36you may call this prance if you please but of the ancient france nothing remains but its central geography its iron frontier its spirit of ambition its audacity of enterprise its perplexing intrigue these and these alone remain and they remain heightened in their principle and augmented in their means all the former correctives whether of virtue or of weakness which existed in the old monarchy are gone no single new corrective is to be found in the whole body of the new institutions how should such a thing be found there when everything has been chosen with care and selection to forward all those ambitious designs and dispositions not to control them the whole is a body of ways and means for the supply of dominion without one heterogeneous particle in it  here i suffer you to breathe and leave to your meditation what has occurred to me on the genius and character of the french revolution from having this before us we may be better able to determine on the first question i proposedthat is how far nations called foreign are likely to be affected with the system established within that territory i intended to proceed next on the question of her facilities from the internal state of other nations and particularly of this for obtaining her ends but i ought to be aware that my notions are controverted i mean therefore in my next letter to take notice of what in that way has been recommended to me as the most deserving of notice in the examination of those pieces i shall have occasion to discuss some others of the topics to which i have called your attention you know that the letters which i now send to the press as well as a part of what is to follow have been in their substance long since written a circumstance which your partiality alone could make of importance to you but which to the public is of no importance at all retarded their appearance the late events which press upon us obliged me to make some additions but no substantial change in the matter  this discussion my friend will be long but the matter is serious and if ever the fate of the world could be truly said to depend on a particular measure it is upon this peace for the present farewell  footnotes  34 see declaration whitehall oct 29 1793  35 it may be right to do justice to louis the sixteenth he did what he could to destroy the double diplomacy of france he had all the secret correspondence burnt except one piece which was called conjectures raisonnées sur la situation actuelle de la france dans le système politique de leurope a work executed by m favier under the direction of count broglie a single copy of this was said to have been found in the cabinet of louis the sixteenth it was published with some subsequent statepapers of vergennes turgot and others as a new benefit of the revolution and the advertisement to the publication ends with the following words il sera facile de se convaincre quy compris mÊme la rÉvolution en grande partie on trouve dans ces memoires et ces conjectures le germe de tout ce qui arrive aujourdhui et quon ne peut sans les avoir lus être bien au fait des intérêts et même des vues actuelles des diverses puissances de leurope the book is entitled politique de tous les cabinets de leurope pendant la règnes de louis xv et de louis xvi it is altogether very curious and worth reading  36 see our declaration     letter iii  on the rupture of the negotiation the terms of peace proposed and the resources of the country for the continuance of the war   dear siri thank you for the bundle of statepapers which i received yesterday i have travelled through the negotiationand a sad founderous road it is there is a sort of standing jest against my countrymenthat one of them on his journey having found a piece of pleasant road he proposed to his companion to go over it again this proposal with regard to the worthy travellers final destination was certainly a blunder it was no blunder as to his immediate satisfaction for the way was pleasant in the irksome journey of the regicide negotiations it is otherwise our paths are not paths of pleasantness nor our ways the ways to peace all our mistakes if such they are like those of our hibernian traveller are mistakes of repetition and they will be full as far from bringing us to our place of rest as his wellconsidered project was from forwarding him to his inn yet i see we persevere fatigued with our former course too listless to explore a new one kept in action by inertness moving only because we have been in motion with a sort of plodding perseverance we resolve to measure back again the very same joyless hopeless and inglorious track backward and forwardoscillation spacethe travels of a postilion miles enough to circle the globe in one short stagewe have been and we are yet to be jolted and rattled over the loose misplaced stones and the treacherous hollows of this rough illkept brokenup treacherous french causeway  the declaration which brings up the rear of the papers laid before parliament contains a review and a reasoned summary of all our attempts and all our failuresa concise but correct narrative of the painful steps taken to bring on the essay of a treaty at parisa clear exposure of all the rebuffs we received in the progress of that experimentan honest confession of our departure from all the rules and all the principles of political negotiation and of common prudence in the conduct of itand to crown the whole a fair account of the atrocious manner in which the regicide enemies had broken up what had been so inauspiciously begun and so feebly carried on by finally and with all scorn driving our suppliant ambassador out of the limits of their usurpation  even after all that i have lately seen i was a little surprised at this exposure a minute display of hopes formed without foundation and of labors pursued without fruit is a thing not very flattering to selfestimation but truth has its rights and it will assert them the declaration after doing all this with a mortifying candor concludes the whole recapitulation with an engagement still more extraordinary than all the unusual matter it contains it says that his majesty who had entered into the negotiation with good faith who had suffered no impediment to prevent his prosecuting it with earnestness and sincerity has now only to lament its abrupt termination and to renew in the face of all europe the solemn declaration that whenever his enemies shall be disposed to enter on the work of general pacification in a spirit of conciliation and equity nothing shall be wanting on his part to contribute to the accomplishment of that great object  if the disgusting detail of the accumulated insults we have received in what we have very properly called our solicitation to a gang of felons and murderers had been produced as a proof of the utter inefficacy of that mode of proceeding with that description of persons i should have nothing at all to object to it it might furnish matter conclusive in argument and instructive in policy but with all due submission to high authority and with all decent deference to superior lights it does not seem quite clear to a discernment no better than mine that the premises in that piece conduct irresistibly to the conclusion a labored display of the ill consequences which have attended an uniform course of submission to every mode of contumelious insult with which the despotism of a proud capricious insulting and implacable foe has chosen to buffet our patience does not appear to my poor thoughts to be properly brought forth as a preliminary to justify a resolution of persevering in the very same kind of conduct towards the very same sort of person and on the very same principles we state our experience and then we come to the manly resolution of acting in contradiction to it all that has passed at paris to the moment of our being shamefully hissed off that stage has been nothing but a more solemn representation on the theatre of the nation of what had been before in rehearsal at basle as it is not only confessed by us but made a matter of charge on the enemy that he had given us no encouragement to believe there was a change in his disposition or in his policy at any time subsequent to the period of his rejecting our first overtures there seems to have been no assignable motive for sending lord malmesbury to paris except to expose his humbled country to the worst indignities and the first of the kind as the declaration very truly observes that have been known in the world of negotiation  an honest neighbor of mine is not altogether unhappy in the application of an old common story to a present occasion it may be said of my friend what horace says of a neighbor of his garrit aniles ex re fabellas conversing on this strange subject he told me a current story of a simple english country squire who was persuaded by certain dilettanti of his acquaintance to see the world and to become knowing in men and manners among other celebrated places it was recommended to him to visit constantinople he took their advice after various adventures not to our purpose to dwell upon he happily arrived at that famous city as soon as he had a little reposed himself from his fatigue he took a walk into the streets but he had not gone far before a malignant and a turbaned turk had his choler roused by the careless and assured air with which this infidel strutted about in the metropolis of true believers in this temper he lost no time in doing to our traveller the honors of the place the turk crossed over the way and with perfect goodwill gave him two or three lusty kicks on the seat of honor to resent or to return the compliment in turkey was quite out of the question our traveller since he could not otherwise acknowledge this kind of favor received it with the best grace in the world he made one of his most ceremonious bows and begged the kicking mussulman to accept his perfect assurances of high consideration our countryman was too wise to imitate othello in the use of the dagger he thought it better as better it was to assuage his bruised dignity with half a yard square of balmy diplomatic diachylon in the disasters of their friends people are seldom wanting in a laudable patience when they are such as do not threaten to end fatally they become even matter of pleasantry the english fellowtravellers of our sufferer finding him a little out of spirits entreated him not to take so slight a business so very seriously they told him it was the custom of the country that every country had its customs that the turkish manners were a little rough but that in the main the turks were a goodnatured people that what would have been a deadly affront anywhere else was only a little freedom there in short they told him to think no more of the matter and to try his fortune in another promenade but the squire though a little clownish had some homebred sense what have i come at all this expense and trouble all the way to constantinople only to be kicked without going beyond my own stable my groom for half a crown would have kicked me to my hearts content i dont mean to stay in constantinople eightandforty hours nor ever to return to this rough goodnatured people that have their own customs  in my opinion the squire was in the right he was satisfied with his first ramble and his first injuries but reason of state and common sense are two things if it were not for this difference it might not appear of absolute necessity after having received a certain quantity of buffetings by advance that we should send a peer of the realm to the scum of the earth to collect the debt to the last farthing and to receive with infinite aggravation the same scorns which had been paid to our supplication through a commoner but it was proper i suppose that the whole of our country in all its orders should have a share of the indignity and as in reason that the higher orders should touch the larger proportion  this business was not ended because our dignity was wounded or because our patience was worn out with contumely and scorn we had not disgorged one particle of the nauseous doses with which we were so liberally crammed by the mountebanks of paris in order to drug and diet us into perfect tameness nowe waited till the morbid strength of our boulimia for their physic had exhausted the wellstored dispensary of their empiricism it is impossible to guess at the term to which our forbearance would have extended the regicides were more fatigued with giving blows than the callous cheek of british diplomacy was hurt in receiving them they had no way left for getting rid of this mendicant perseverance but by sending for the beadle and forcibly driving our embassy of shreds and patches with all its mumping cant from the inhospitable door of cannibal castle      where the gaunt mastiff growling at the gate     affrights the beggar whom he longs to eat  i think we might have found before the rude hand of insolent office was on our shoulder and the staff of usurped authority brandished over our heads that contempt of the suppliant is not the best forwarder of a suitthat national disgrace is not the highroad to security much less to power and greatness patience indeed strongly indicates the lore of peace but mere love does not always lead to enjoyment it is the power of winning that palm which insures our wearing it virtues have their place and out of their place they hardly deserve the namethey pass into the neighboring vice the patience of fortitude and the endurance of pusillanimity are things very different as in their principle so in their effects  in truth this declaration containing a narrative of the first transaction of the kind and i hope it will be the last in the intercourse of nations as a composition is ably drawn it does credit to our official style the report of the speech of the minister in a great assembly which i have read is a comment upon the declaration without inquiry how far that report is exact inferior i believe it may be to what it would represent yet still it reads as a most eloquent and finished performance hardly one galling circumstance of the indignities offered by the directory of regicide to the supplications made to that junto in his majestys name has been spared every one of the aggravations attendant on these acts of outrage is with wonderful perspicuity and order brought forward in its place and in the manner most fitted to produce its effect they are turned to every point of view in which they can be seen to the best advantage all the parts are so arranged as to point out their relation and to furnish a true idea of the spirit of the whole transaction  this speech may stand for a model never for the triumphal decoration of any theatre not for the decoration of those of athens and rome or even of this theatre of paris from the embroideries of babylon or from the loom of the gobelins has there been sent any historic tissue so truly drawn so closely and so finely wrought or in which the forms are brought out in the rich purple of such glowing and blushing colors it puts me in mind of the piece of tapestry with which virgil proposed to adorn the theatre he was to erect to augustus upon the banks of the mincio who now hides his head in his reeds and leads his slow and melancholy windings through banks wasted by the barbarians of gaul he supposes that the artifice is such that the figures of the conquered nations in his tapestry are made to play their part and are confounded in the machine                                       utque     purpurea intexti tollant aulæa britanni  or as dryden translates it somewhat paraphrastically but not less in the spirit of the prophet than of the poet      where the proud theatres disclose the scene     which interwoven britons seem to raise     and show the triumph which their shame displays  it is something wonderful that the sagacity shown in the declaration and the speech and so far as it goes greater was never shown should have failed to discover to the writer and to the speaker the inseparable relation between the parties to this transaction and that nothing can be said to display the imperious arrogance of a base enemy which does not describe with equal force and equal truth the contemptible figure of an abject embassy to that imperious power  it is no less striking that the same obvious reflection should not occur to those gentlemen who conducted the opposition to government but their thoughts were turned another way they seem to have been so entirely occupied with the defence of the french directory so very eager in finding recriminatory precedents to justify every act of its intolerable insolence so animated in their accusations of ministry for not having at the very outset made concessions proportioned to the dignity of the great victorious power we had offended that everything concerning the sacrifice in this business of national honor and of the most fundamental principles in the policy of negotiation seemed wholly to have escaped them to this fatal hour the contention in parliament appeared in another form and was animated by another spirit for three hundred years and more we have had wars with what stood as government in france in all that period the language of ministers whether of boast or of apology was that they had left nothing undone for the assertion of the national honorthe opposition whether patriotically or factiously contending that the ministers had been oblivious of the national glory and had made improper sacrifices of that public interest which they were bound not only to preserve but by all fair methods to augment this total change of tone on both sides of your house forms itself no inconsiderable revolution and i am afraid it prognosticates others of still greater importance the ministers exhausted the stores of their eloquence in demonstrating that they had quitted the safe beaten highway of treaty between independent powersthat to pacify the enemy they had made every sacrifice of the national dignityand that they had offered to immolate at the same shrine the most valuable of the national acquisitions the opposition insisted that the victims were not fat nor fair enough to be offered on the altars of blasphemed regicide and it was inferred from thence that the sacrifical ministers who were a sort of intruders in the worship of the new divinity in their schismatical devotion had discovered more of hypocrisy than zeal they charged them with a concealed resolution to persevere in what these gentlemen have in perfect consistency indeed with themselves but most irreconcilably with fact and reason called an unjust and impolitic war  that day was i fear the fatal term of local patriotism on that day i fear there was an end of that narrow scheme of relations called our country with all its pride its prejudices and its partial affections all the little quiet rivulets that watered an humble a contracted but not an unfruitful field are to be lost in the waste expanse and boundless barren ocean of the homicide philanthropy of france it is no longer an object of terror the aggrandizement of a new power which teaches as a professor that philanthropy in the chair whilst it propagates by arms and establishes by conquest the comprehensive system of universal fraternity in what light is all this viewed in a great assembly the party which takes the lead there has no longer any apprehensions except those that arise from not being admitted to the closest and most confidential connections with the metropolis of that fraternity that reigning party no longer touches on its favorite subject the display of those horrors that must attend the existence of a power with such dispositions and principles seated in the heart of europe it is satisfied to find some loose ambiguous expressions in its former declarations which may set it free from its professions and engagements it always speaks of peace with the regicides as a great and an undoubted blessing and such a blessing as if obtained promises as much as any human disposition of things can promise security and permanence it holds out nothing at all definite towards this security it only seeks by a restoration to some of their former owners of some fragments of the general wreck of europe to find a plausible plea for a present retreat from an embarrassing position as to the future that party is content to leave it covered in a night of the most palpable obscurity it never once has entered into a particle of detail of what our own situation or that of other powers must be under the blessings of the peace we seek this defect to my power i mean to supplythat if any persons should still continue to think an attempt at foresight is any part of the duty of a statesman i may contribute my trifle to the materials of his speculation  as to the other party the minority of today possibly the majority of tomorrow small in number but full of talents and every species of energy which upon the avowed ground of being more acceptable to france is a candidate for the helm of this kingdom it has never changed from the beginning it has preserved a perennial consistency this would be a never failing source of true glory if springing from just and right but it is truly dreadful if it be an arm of styx which springs out of the profoundest depths of a poisoned soil the french maxims were by these gentlemen at no time condemned i speak of their language in the most moderate terms there are many who think that they have gone much furtherthat they have always magnified and extolled the french maximsthat not in the least disgusted or discouraged by the monstrous evils which have attended these maxims from the moment of their adoption both at home and abroad they still continue to predict that in due time they must produce the greatest good to the poor human race they obstinately persist in stating those evils as matter of accident as things wholly collateral to the system  it is observed that this party has never spoken of an ally of great britain with the smallest degree of respect or regard on the contrary it has generally mentioned them under opprobrious appellations and in such terms of contempt or execration as never had been heard beforebecause no such would have formerly been permitted in our public assemblies the moment however that any of those allies quitted this obnoxious connection the party has instantly passed an act of indemnity and oblivion in their favor after this no sort of censure on their conduct no imputation on their character from that moment their pardon was sealed in a reverential and mysterious silence with the gentlemen of this minority there is no ally from one end of europe to the other with whom we ought not to be ashamed to act the whole college of the states of europe is no better than a gang of tyrants with them all our connections were broken off at once we ought to have cultivated france and france alone from the moment of her revolution on that happy change all our dread of that nation as a power was to cease she became in an instant dear to our affections and one with our interests all other nations we ought to have commanded not to trouble her sacred throes whilst in labor to bring into an happy birth her abundant litter of constitutions we ought to have acted under her auspices in extending her salutary influence upon every side from that moment england and france were become natural allies and all the other states natural enemies the whole face of the world was changed what was it to us if she acquired holland and the austrian netherlands by her conquests she only enlarged the sphere of her beneficence she only extended the blessings of liberty to so many more foolishly reluctant nations what was it to england if by adding these among the richest and most peopled countries of the world to her territories she thereby left no possible link of communication between us and any other power with whom we could act against her on this new system of optimism it is so much the better so much the further are we removed from the contact with infectious despotism no longer a thought of a barrier in the netherlands to holland against france all that is obsolete policy it is fit that france should have both holland and the austrian netherlands too as a barrier to her against the attacks of despotism she cannot multiply her securities too much and as to our security it is to be found in hers had we cherished her from the beginning and felt for her when attacked she poor good soul would never have invaded any foreign nation never murdered her sovereign and his family never proscribed never exiled never imprisoned never been guilty of extrajudicial massacre or of legal murder all would have been a golden age full of peace order and libertyand philosophy raying out from europe would have warmed and enlightened the universe but unluckily irritable philosophy the most irritable of all things was pat into a passion and provoked into ambition abroad and tyranny at home they find all this very natural and very justifiable they choose to forget that other nations struggling for freedom have been attacked by their neighbors or that their neighbors have otherwise interfered in their affairs often have neighbors interfered in favor of princes against their rebellious subjects and often in favor of subjects against their prince such cases fill half the pages of history yet never were they used as an apology much less as a justification for atrocious cruelty in princes or for general massacre and confiscation on the part of revolted subjectsnever as a politic cause for suffering any such powers to aggrandize themselves without limit and without measure a thousand times have we seen it asserted in public prints and pamphlets that if the nobility and priesthood of france had stayed at home their property never would have been confiscated one would think that none of the clergy had been robbed previous to their deportation or that their deportation had on their part been a voluntary act one would think that the nobility and gentry and merchants and bankers who stayed at home had enjoyed their property in security and repose the assertors of these positions well know that the lot of thousands who remained at home was far more terrible that the most cruel imprisonment was only a harbinger of a cruel and ignominious death and that in this mother country of freedom there were no less than three hundred thousand at one time in prison i go no further i instance only these representations of the party as staring indications of partiality to that sect to whose dominion they would have left this country nothing to oppose but her own naked force and consequently subjected us on every reverse of fortune to the imminent danger of falling under those very evils in that very system which are attributed not to its own nature but to the perverseness of others there is nothing in the world so difficult as to put men in a state of judicial neutrality a leaning there must ever be and it is of the first importance to any nation to observe to what side that leaning inclineswhether to our own community or to one with which it is in a state of hostility  men are rarely without some sympathy in the sufferings of others but in the immense and diversified mass of human misery which may be pitied but cannot be relieved in the gross the mind must make a choice our sympathy is always more forcibly attracted towards the misfortunes of certain persons and in certain descriptions and this sympathetic attraction discovers beyond a possibility of mistake our mental affinities and elective affections it is a much surer proof than the strongest declaration of a real connection and of an overruling bias in the mind i am told that the active sympathies of this party have been chiefly if not wholly attracted to the sufferings of the patriarchal rebels who were amongst the promulgators of the maxims of the french revolution and who have suffered from their apt and forward scholars some part of the evils which they had themselves so liberally distributed to all the other parts of the community some of these men flying from the knives which they had sharpened against their country and its laws rebelling against the very powers they had set over themselves by their rebellion against their sovereign given up by those very armies to whose faithful attachment they trusted for their safety and support after they had completely debauched all military fidelity in its sourcesome of these men i say had fallen into the hands of the head of that family the most illustrious person of which they had three times cruelly imprisoned and delivered in that state of captivity to those hands from which they were able to relieve neither her nor their own nearest and most venerable kindred one of these men connected with this country by no circumstance of birthnot related to any distinguished families hererecommended by no serviceendeared to this nation by no act or even expression of kindnesscomprehended in no league or common causeembraced by no laws of public hospitalitythis man was the only one to be found in europe in whose favor the british nation passing judgment without hearing on its almost only ally was to force and that not by soothing interposition but with every reproach for inhumanity cruelty and breach of the laws of war from prison we were to release him from that prison out of which in abuse of the lenity of government amidst its rigor and in violation of at least an understood parole he had attempted an escapean escape excusable if you will but naturally productive of strict and vigilant confinement the earnestness of gentlemen to free this person was the more extraordinary because there was full as little in him to raise admiration from any eminent qualities he possessed as there was to excite an interest from any that were amiable a person not only of no real civil or literary talents but of no specious appearance of eitherand in his military profession not marked as a leader in any one act of able or successful enterprise unless his leading on or his following the allied army of amazonian and male cannibal parisians to versailles on the famous 6th of october 1789 is to make his glory any otter exploit of his as a general i never heard of but the triumph of general fraternity was but the more signalized by the total want of particular claims in that caseand by postponing all such claims in a case where they really existed where they stood embossed and in a manner forced themselves on the view of common shortsighted benevolence whilst for its improvement the humanity of these gentlemen was thus on its travels and had got as far off as olmütz they never thought of a place and a person much nearer to them or of moving an instruction to lord malmesbury in favor of their own suffering countryman sir sydney smith  this officer having attempted with great gallantry to cut out a vessel from one of the enemys harbors was taken after an obstinate resistancesuch as obtained him the marked respect of those who were witnesses of his valor and knew the circumstances in which it was displayed upon his arrival at paris he was instantly thrown into prison where the nature of his situation will best be understood by knowing that amongst its mitigations was the permission to walk occasionally in the court and to enjoy the privilege of shaving himself on the old system of feelings and principles his sufferings might have been entitled to consideration and even in a comparison with those of citizen la fayette to a priority in the order of compassion if the ministers had neglected to take any steps in his favor a declaration of the sense of the house of commons would have stimulated them to their duty if they had caused a representation to be made such a proceeding would have added force to it if reprisal should be thought advisable the address of the house would have given an additional sanction to a measure which would have been indeed justifiable without any other sanction than its own reason but no nothing at all like it in fact the merit of sir sydney smith and his claim on british compassion was of a kind altogether different from that which interested so deeply the authors of the motion in favor of citizen la fayette in my humble opinion captain sir sydney smith has another sort of merit with the british nation and something of a higher claim on british humanity than citizen la fayette faithful zealous and ardent in the service of his king and countryfull of spiritfull of resourcesgoing out of the beaten road but going right because his uncommon enterprise was not conducted by a vulgar judgmentin his profession sir sydney smith might be considered as a distinguished person if any person could well be distinguished in a service in which scarce a commander can be named without putting you in mind of some action of intrepidity skill and vigilance that has given them a fair title to contend with any men and in any age but i will say nothing farther of the merits of sir sydney smith the mortal animosity of the regicide enemy supersedes all other panegyric their hatred is a judgment in his favor without appeal at present he is lodged in the tower of the temple the last prison of louis the sixteenth and the last but one of marie antoinette of austriathe prison of louis the seventeenththe prison of elizabeth of bourbon there he lies unpitied by the grand philanthropy to meditate upon the fate of those who are faithful to their king and country whilst this prisoner secluded from intercourse was indulging in these cheering reflections he might possibly have had the further consolation of learning by means of the insolent exultation of his guards that there was an english ambassador at paris he might have had the proud comfort of hearing that this ambassador had the honor of passing his mornings in respectful attendance at the office of a regicide pettifogger and that in the evening he relaxed in the amusements of the opera and in the spectacle of an audience totally newan audience in which he had the pleasure of seeing about him not a single face that he could formerly have known in paris but in the place of that company one indeed more than equal to it in display of gayety splendor and luxurya set of abandoned wretches squandering in insolent riot the spoils of their bleeding country a subject of profound reflection both to the prisoner and to the ambassador  whether all the matter upon which i have grounded my opinion of this last party be fully authenticated or not must be left to those who have had the opportunity of a nearer view of its conduct and who have been more attentive in their perusal of the writings which have appeared in its favor but for my part i have never heard the gross facts on which i ground my idea of their marked partiality to the reigning tyranny in france in any part denied i am not surprised at all this opinions as they sometimes follow so they frequently guide and direct the affections and men may become more attached to the country of their principles than to the country of their birth what i have stated here is only to mark the spirit which seems to me though in somewhat different ways to actuate our great partyleaders and to trace this first pattern of a negotiation to its true source  such is the present state of our public councils well might i be ashamed of what seems to be a censure of two great factions with the two most eloquent men which this country ever saw at the head of them if i had found that either of them could support their conduct by any example in the history of their country i should very much prefer their judgment to my own if i were not obliged by an infinitely overbalancing weight of authority to prefer the collected wisdom of ages to the abilities of any two men livingi return to the declaration with which the history of the abortion of a treaty with the regicides is closed  after such an elaborate display had been made of the injustice and insolence of an enemy who seems to have been irritated by every one of the means which had been commonly used with effect to soothe the rage of intemperate power the natural result would be that the scabbard in which we in vain attempted to plunge our sword should have been thrown away with scorn it would have been natural that rising in the fulness of their might insulted majesty despised dignity violated justice rejected supplication patience goaded into fury would have poured out all the length of the reins upon all the wrath which they had so long restrained it might have been expected that emulous of the glory of the youthful hero37 in alliance with him touched by the example of what one man well formed and well placed may do in the most desperate state of affairs convinced there is a courage of the cabinet full as powerful and far less vulgar than that of the field our minister would have changed the whole line of that unprosperous prudence which hitherto had produced all the effects of the blindest temerity if he found his situation full of danger and i do not deny that it is perilous in the extreme he must feel that it is also full of glory and that he is placed on a stage than which no muse of fire that had ascended the highest heaven of invention could imagine anything more awful and august it was hoped that in this swelling scene in which he moved with some of the first potentates of europe for his fellowactors and with so many of the rest for the anxious spectators of a part which as he plays it determines forever their destiny and his own like ulysses in the unravelling point of the epic story he would have thrown off his patience and his rags together and stripped of unworthy disguises he would have stood forth in the form and in the attitude of an hero on that day it was thought he would have assumed the port of mars that he would bid to be brought forth from their hideous kennel where his scrupulous tenderness had too long immured them those impatient dogs of war whose fierce regards affright even the minister of vengeance that feeds them that he would let them loose in famine fever plagues and death upon a guilty race to whose frame and to all whose habit order peace religion and virtue are alien and abhorrent it was expected that he would at last have thought of active and effectual war that he would no longer amuse the british lion in the chase of mice and rats that he would no longer employ the whole naval power of great britain once the terror of the world to prey upon the miserable remains of a peddling commerce which the enemy did not regard and from which none could profit it was expected that he would have reasserted the justice of his cause that he would have reanimated whatever remained to him of his allies and endeavored to recover those whom their fears had led astray that he would have rekindled the martial ardor of his citizens that he would have held out to them the example of their ancestry the assertor of europe and the scourge of french ambition that he would have reminded them of a posterity which if this nefarious robbery under the fraudulent name and false color of a government should in full power be seated in the heart of europe must forever be consigned to vice impiety barbarism and the most ignominious slavery of body and mind in so holy a cause it was presumed that he would as in the beginning of the war he did have opened all the temples and with prayer with fasting and with supplication better directed than to the grim moloch of regicide in france have called upon us to raise that united cry which has so often stormed heaven and with a pious violence forced down blessings upon a repentant people it was hoped that when he had invoked upon his endeavors the favorable regard of the protector of the human race it would be seen that his menaces to the enemy and his prayers to the almighty were not followed but accompanied with correspondent action it was hoped that his shrilling trumpet should be heard not to announce a show but to sound a charge  such a conclusion to such a declaration and such a speech would have been a thing of courseso much a thing of course that i will be bold to say if in any ancient history the roman for instance supposing that in rome the matter of such a detail could have been furnished a consul had gone through such a long train of proceedings and that there was a chasm in the manuscripts by which we had lost the conclusion of the speech and the subsequent part of the narrative all critics would agree that a freinshemius would have been thought to have managed the supplementary business of a continuator most unskillfully and to have supplied the hiatus most improbably if he had not filled up the gaping space in a manner somewhat similar though better executed to what i have imagined but too often different is rational conjecture from melancholy fact this exordium as contrary to all the rules of rhetoric as to those more essential rules of policy which our situation would dictate is intended as a prelude to a deadening and disheartening proposition as if all that a minister had to fear in a war of his own conducting was that the people should pursue it with too ardent a zeal such a tone as i guessed the minister would have taken i am very sure is the true unsuborned unsophisticated language of genuine natural feeling under the smart of patience exhausted and abused such a conduct as the facts stated in the declaration gave room to expect is that which true wisdom would have dictated under the impression of those genuine feelings never was there a jar or discord between genuine sentiment and sound policy never no never did nature say one thing and wisdom say another nor are sentiments of elevation in themselves turgid and unnatural nature is never more truly herself than in her grandest forms the apollo of belvedere if the universal robber has yet left him at belvedere is as much in nature as any figure from the pencil of rembrandt or any clown in the rustic revels of téniers indeed it is when a great nation is in great difficulties that minds must exalt themselves to the occasion or all is lost strong passion under the direction of a feeble reason feeds a low fever which serves only to destroy the body that entertains it but vehement passion does not always indicate an infirm judgment it often accompanies and actuates and is even auxiliary to a powerful understanding and when they both conspire and act harmoniously their force is great to destroy disorder within and to repel injury from abroad if ever there was a time that calls on us for no vulgar conception of things and for exertions in no vulgar strain it is the awful hour that providence has now appointed to this nation every little measure is a great error and every great error will bring on no small ruin nothing can be directed above the mark that we must aim at everything below it is absolutely thrown away  except with the addition of the unheardof insult offered to our ambassador by his rude expulsion we are never to forget that the point on which the negotiation with de la croix broke off was exactly that which had stifled in its cradle the negotiation we had attempted with barthélemy each of these transactions concluded with a manifesto upon our part but the last of our manifestoes very materially differed from the first the first declaration stated that nothing was left but to prosecute a war equally just and necessary in the second the justice and necessity of the war is dropped the sentence importing that nothing was left but the prosecution of such a war disappears also instead of this resolution to prosecute the war we sink into a whining lamentation on the abrupt termination of the treaty we have nothing left but the last resource of female weakness of helpless infancy of doting decrepitudewailing and lamentation we cannot even utter a sentiment of vigorhis majesty has only to lament a poor possession to be left to a great monarch mark the effect produced on our councils by continued insolence and inveterate hostility we grow more malleable under their blows in reverential silence we smother the cause and origin of the war on that fundamental article of faith we leave every one to abound in his own sense in the ministers speech glossing on the declaration it is indeed mentioned but very feebly the lines are so faintly drawn as hardly to be traced they only make a part of our consolation in the circumstances which we so dolefully lament we rest our merits on the humility the earnestness of solicitation and the perfect good faith of those submissions which have been used to persuade our regicide enemies to grant us some sort of peace not a word is said which might not have been full as well said and much better too if the british nation had appeared in the simple character of a penitent convinced of his errors and offences and offering by penances by pilgrimages and by all the modes of expiation ever devised by anxious restless guilt to make all the atonement in his miserable power  the declaration ends as i have before quoted it with a solemn voluntary pledge the most full and the most solemn that ever was given of our resolution if so it may be called to enter again into the very same course it requires nothing more of the regicides than to famish some sort of excuse some sort of colorable pretest for our renewing the supplications of innocence at the feet of guilt it leaves the moment of negotiation a most important moment to the choice of the enemy he is to regulate it according to the convenience of his affairs he is to bring it forward at that time when it may best serve to establish his authority at home and to extend his power abroad a dangerous assurance for this nation to give whether it is broken or whether it is kept as all treaty was broken off and broken off in the manner we have seen the field of future conduct ought to be reserved free and unincumbered to our future discretion as to the sort of condition prefixed to the pledge namely that the enemy should be disposed to enter into the work of general pacification with the spirit of reconciliation and equity this phraseology cannot possibly be considered otherwise than as so many words thrown in to fill the sentence and to round it to the ear we prefixed the same plausible conditions to any renewal of the negotiation in our manifesto on the rejection of our proposals at basle we did not consider those conditions as binding we opened a much more serious negotiation without any sort of regard to them and there is no new negotiation which we can possibly open upon fewer indications of conciliation and equity than were to be discovered when we entered into our last at paris any of the slightest pretences any of the most loose formal equivocating expressions would justify us under the peroration of this piece in again sending the last or some other lord malmesbury to paris  i hope i misunderstand this pledgeor that we shall show no more regard to it than we have done to all the faith that we have plighted to vigor and resolution in our former declaration if i am to understand the conclusion of the declaration to be what unfortunately it seems to me we make an engagement with the enemy without any correspondent engagement on his side we seem to have cut ourselves off from any benefit which an intermediate state of things might furnish to enable us totally to overturn that power so little connected with moderation and justice by holding out no hope either to the justly discontented in france or to any foreign power and leaving the recommencement of all treaty to this identical junto of assassins we do in effect assure and guaranty to them the full possession of the rich fruits of their confiscations of their murders of men women and children and of all the multiplied endless nameless iniquities by which they have obtained their power we guaranty to them the possession of a country such and so situated as france round entire immensely perhaps augmented  well some will say in this case we have only submitted to the nature of things the nature of things is i admit a sturdy adversary this might be alleged as a plea for our attempt at a treaty but what plea of that kind can be alleged after the treaty was dead and gone in favor of this posthumous declaration no necessity has driven us to that pledge it is without a counterpart even in expectation and what can be stated to obviate the evil which that solitary engagement must produce on the understandings or the fears of men i ask what have the regicides promised you in return in case you should show what they would call dispositions to conciliation and equity whilst you are giving that pledge from the throne and engaging parliament to countersecure it it is an awful consideration it was on the very day of the date of this wonderful pledge38 in which we assumed the directorial government as lawful and in which we engaged ourselves to treat with them whenever they pleasedit was on that very day the regicide fleet was weighing anchor from one of your harbors where it had remained four days in perfect quiet these harbors of the british dominions are the ports of france they are of no use but to protect an enemy from your best allies the storms of heaven and his own rashness had the west of ireland been an unportuous coast the french naval power would have been undone the enemy uses the moment for hostility without the least regard to your future dispositions of equity and conciliation they go out of what were once your harbors and they return to them at their pleasure eleven days they had the full use of bantry bay and at length their fleet returns from their harbor of bantry to their harbor of brest whilst you are invoking the propitious spirit of regicide equity and conciliation they answer you with an attack they turn out the pacific bearer of your how do you dos lord malmesbury and they return your visit and their thanks for your obliging inquiries by their old practised assassin hoche they come to attackwhat a town a fort a naval station they come to attack your king your constitution and the very being of that parliament which was holding out to them these pledges together with the entireness of the empire the laws liberties and properties of all the people we know that they meditated the very same invasion and for the very same purposes upon this kingdom and had the coast been as opportune would have effected it  whilst you are in vain torturing your invention to assure them of your sincerity and good faith they have left no doubt concerning their good faith and their sincerity towards those to whom they have engaged their honor to their power they have been true to the only pledge they have ever yet given to you or to any of yours i mean the solemn engagement which they entered into with the deputation of traitors who appeared at their bar from england and from ireland in 1792 they have been true and faithful to the engagement which they had made more largelythat is their engagement to give effectual aid to insurrection and treason wherever they might appear in the world we have seen the british declaration this is the counter declaration of the directory this is the reciprocal pledge which regicide amity gives to the conciliatory pledges of kings but thank god such pledges cannot exist single they have no counterpart and if they had the enemys conduct cancels such declarationsand i trust along with them cancels everything of mischief and dishonor that they contain  there is one thing in this business which appears to be wholly unaccountable or accountable on a supposition i dare not entertain for a moment i cannot help asking why all this pains to clear the british nation of ambition perfidy and the insatiate thirst of war at what period of time was it that our country has deserved that load of infamy of which nothing but preternatural humiliation in language and conduct can serve to clear us if we have deserved this kind of evil fame from anything we have done in a state of prosperity i am sure that it is not an abject conduct in adversity that can clear our reputation well is it known that ambition can creep as well as soar the pride of no person in a flourishing condition is more justly to be dreaded than that of him who is mean and cringing under a doubtful and unprosperous fortune but it seems it was thought necessary to give some outoftheway proofs of our sincerity as well as of our freedom from ambition is then fraud and falsehood become the distinctive character of englishmen whenever your enemy chooses to accuse you of perfidy and ill faith will you put it into his power to throw you into the purgatory of selfhumiliation is his charge equal to the finding of the grand jury of europe and sufficient to put you upon your trial but on that trial i will defend the english ministry i am sorry that on some points i have on the principles i have always opposed so good a defence to make they were not the first to begin the war they did not excite the general confederacy in europe which was so properly formed on the alarm given by the jacobinism of france they did not begin with an hostile aggression on the regicides or any of their allies these parricides of their own country disciplining themselves for foreign by domestic violence were the first to attack a power that was our ally by nature by habit and by the sanction of multiplied treaties is it not true that they were the first to declare war upon this kingdom is every word in the declaration from downing street concerning their conduct and concerning ours and that of our allies so obviously false that it is necessary to give some newinvented proofs of our good faith in order to expunge the memory of all this perfidy  we know that overlaboring a point of this kind has the direct contrary effect from what we wish we know that there is a legal presumption against men quando se nimis purgitant and if a charge of ambition is not refuted by an affected humility certainly the character of fraud and perfidy is still less to be washed away by indications of meanness fraud and prevarication are servile vices they sometimes grow out of the necessities always out of the habits of slavish and degenerate spirits and on the theatre of the world it is not by assuming the mask of a davus or a geta that an actor will obtain credit for manly simplicity and a liberal openness of proceeding it is an erect countenance it is a firm adherence to principle it is a power of resisting false shame and frivolous fear that assert our good faith and honor and assure to us the confidence of mankind therefore all these negotiations and all the declarations with which they were preceded and followed can only serve to raise presumptions against that good faith and public integrity the fame of which to preserve inviolate is so much the interest and duty of every nation  the pledge is an engagement to all europe this is the more extraordinary because it is a pledge which no power in europe whom i have yet heard of has thought proper to require at our hands i am not in the secrets of office and therefore i may be excused for proceeding upon probabilities and exterior indications i have surveyed all europe from the east to the west from the north to the south in search of this call upon us to purge ourselves of subtle duplicity and a punic style in our proceedings i have not heard that his excellency the ottoman ambassador has expressed his doubts of the british sincerity in our negotiation with the most unchristian republic lately set up at our door what sympathy in that quarter may have introduced a remonstrance upon the want of faith in this nation i cannot positively say if it exists it is in turkish or arabic and possibly is not yet translated but none of the nations which compose the old christian world have i yet heard as calling upon us for those judicial purgations and ordeals by fire and water which we have chosen to go throughfor the other great proof by battle we seem to decline  for whose use entertainment or instruction are all those overstrained and overlabored proceedings in council in negotiation and in speeches in parliament intended what royal cabinet is to be enriched with these highfinished pictures of the arrogance of the sworn enemies of kings and the meek patience of a british administration in what heart is it intended to kindle pity towards our multiplied mortifications and disgraces at best it is superfluous what nation is unacquainted with the haughty disposition of the common enemy of all nations it has been more than seen it has been feltnot only by those who have been the victims of their imperious rapacity but in a degree by those very powers who have consented to establish this robbery that they might be able to copy it and with impunity to make new usurpations of their own  the king of prussia has hypothecated in trust to the regicides his rich and fertile territories on the rhine as a pledge of his zeal and affection to the cause of liberty and equality he has seen them robbed with unbounded liberty and with the most levelling equality the woods are wasted the country is ravaged property is confiscated and the people are put to bear a double yoke in the exactions of a tyrannical government and in the contributions of an hostile irruption is it to satisfy the court of berlin that the court of london is to give the same sort of pledge of its sincerity and good faith to the french directory it is not that heart full of sensibility it is not lucchesini the minister of his prussian majesty the late ally of england and the present ally of its enemy who has demanded this pledge of our sincerity as the price of the renewal of the long lease of his sincere friendship to this kingdom  it is not to our enemy the now faithful ally of regicide late the faithful ally of great britain the catholic king that we address our doleful lamentation it is not to the prince of peace whose declaration of war was one of the first auspicious omens of general tranquillity which our dovelike ambassador with the olivebranch in his beak was saluted with at his entrance into the ark of clean birds at paris  surely it is not to the tetrarch of sardinia now the faithful ally of a power who has seized upon all his fortresses and confiscated the oldest dominions of his houseit is not to this once powerful once respected and once cherished ally of great britain that we mean to prove the sincerity of the peace which we offered to make at his expense or is it to him we are to prove the arrogance of the power who under the name of friend oppresses him and the poor remains of his subjects with all the ferocity of the most cruel enemy  it is not to holland under the name of an ally laid under a permanent military contribution filled with their double garrison of barbarous jacobin troops and ten times more barbarous jacobin clubs and assemblies that we find ourselves obliged to give this pledge  is it to genoa that we make this kind promisea state which the regicides were to defend in a favorable neutrality but whose neutrality has been by the gentle influence of jacobin authority forced into the trammels of an alliancewhose alliance has been secured by the admission of french garrisonsand whose peace has been forever ratified by a forced declaration of war against ourselves  it is not the grand duke of tuscany who claims this declarationnot the grand duke who for his early sincerity for his love of peace and for his entire confidence in the amity of the assassins of his house has been complimented in the british parliament with the name of the wisest sovereign in europe it is not this pacific solomon or his philosophic cudgelled ministry cudgelled by english and by french whose wisdom and philosophy between them have placed leghorn in the hands of the enemy of the austrian family and driven the only profitable commerce of tuscany from its only port it is not this sovereign a far more able statesman than any of the medici in whose chair he sits it is not the philosopher carletti more ably speculative than galileo more profoundly politic than machiavel that call upon us so loudly to give the same happy proofs of the same good faith to the republic always the same always one and indivisible  it is not venice whose principal cities the enemy has appropriated to himself and scornfully desired the state to indemnify itself from the emperor that we wish to convince of the pride and the despotism of an enemy who loads us with his scoffs and buffets  it is not for his holiness we intend this consolatory declaration of our own weakness and of the tyrannous temper of his grand enemy that prince has known both the one and the other from the beginning the artists of the french revolution had given their very first essays and sketches of robbery and desolation against his territories in a far more cruel murdering piece than had over entered into the imagination of painter or poet without ceremony they tore from his cherishing arms the possessions which he held for five hundred years undisturbed by all the ambition of all the ambitious monarchs who during that period have reigned in france is it to him in whose wrong we have in our late negotiation ceded his now unhappy countries near the rhone lately amongst the most flourishing perhaps the most flourishing for their extent of all the countries upon earth that we are to prove the sincerity of our resolution to make peace with the republic of barbarism that venerable potentate and pontiff is sunk deep into the vale of years he is half disarmed by his peaceful character his dominions are more than half disarmed by a peace of two hundred years defended as they were not by force but by reverence yet in all these straits we see him display amidst the recent ruins and the new defacements of his plundered capital along with the mild and decorated piety of the modern all the spirit and magnanimity of ancient rome does he who though himself unable to defend them nobly refused to receive pecuniary compensations for the protection he owed to his people of avignon carpentras and the venaissindoes he want proofs of our good disposition to deliver over that people without any security for them or any compensation to their sovereign to this cruel enemy does he want to be satisfied of the sincerity of our humiliation to france who has seen his free fertile and happy city and state of bologna the cradle of regenerated law the seat of sciences and of arts so hideously metamorphosed whilst he was crying to great britain for aid and offering to purchase that aid at any price is it him who sees that chosen spot of plenty and delight converted into a jacobin ferocious republic dependent on the homicides of franceis it him who from the miracles of his beneficent industry has done a work which defied the power of the roman emperors though with an enthralled world to labor for themis it him who has drained and cultivated the pontine marshes that we are to satisfy of our cordial spirit of conciliation with those who in their equity are restoring holland again to the seas whose maxims poison more than the exhalations of the most deadly fens and who turn all the fertilities of nature and of art into an howling desert is it to him that we are to demonstrate the good faith of our submissions to the cannibal republicto him who is commanded to deliver up into their hands ancona and civita vecchia seats of commerce raised by the wise and liberal labors and expenses of the present and late pontiffs ports not more belonging to the ecclesiastical state than to the commerce of great britain thus wresting from his hands the power of the keys of the centre of italy as before they had taken possession of the keys of the northern part from the hands of the unhappy king of sardinia the natural ally of england is it to him we are to prove our good faith in the peace which we are soliciting to receive from the hands of his and our robbers the enemies of all arts all sciences all civilization and all commerce  is it to the cispadane or to the transpadane republics which have been forced to bow under the galling yoke of french liberty that we address all these pledges of our sincerity and love of peace with their unnatural parents  are we by this declaration to satisfy the king of naples whom we have left to struggle as he can after our abdication of corsica and the flight of the whole naval force of england out of the whole circuit of the mediterranean abandoning our allies our commerce and the honor of a nation once the protectress of all other nations because strengthened by the independence and enriched by the commerce of them all by the express provisions of a recent treaty we had engaged with the king of naples to keep a naval force in the mediterranean but good god was a treaty at all necessary for this the uniform policy of this kingdom as a state and eminently so as a commercial state has at all times led us to keep a powerful squadron and a commodious naval station in that central sea which borders upon and which connects a far greater number and variety of states european asiatic and african than any other without such a naval force france must become despotic mistress of that sea and of all the countries whose shores it washes our commerce must become vassal to her and dependent on her will since we are come no longer to trust to our force in arms but to our dexterity in negotiation and begin to pay a desperate court to a proud and coy usurpation and have finally sent an ambassador to the bourbon regicides at paris the king of naples who saw that no reliance was to be placed on our engagements or on any pledge of our adherence to our nearest and dearest interests has been obliged to send his ambassador also to join the rest of the squalid tribe of the representatives of degraded kings this monarch surely does not want any proof of the sincerity of our amicable dispositions to that amicable republic into whose arms he has been given by our desertion of him  to look to the powers of the northit is not to the danish ambassador insolently treated in his own character and in ours that we are to give proofs of the regicide arrogance and of our disposition to submit to it  with regard to sweden i cannot say much the french influence is struggling with her independence and they who consider the manner in which the ambassador of that power was treated not long since at paris and the manner in which the father of the present king of sweden himself the victim of regicide principles and passions would have looked on the present assassins of france will not be very prompt to believe that the young king of sweden has made this kind of requisition to the king of great britain and has given this kind of auspice of his new government  i speak last of the most important of all it certainly was not the late empress of russia at whose instance we have given this pledge it is not the new emperor the inheritor of so much glory and placed in a situation of so much delicacy and difficulty for the preservation of that inheritance who calls on england the natural ally of his dominions to deprive herself of her power of action and to bind herself to france france at no time and in none of its fashions least of all in its last has been ever looked upon as the friend either of russia or of great britain everything good i trust is to be expected from this princewhatever may be without authority given out of an influence over his mind possessed by that only potentate from whom he has anything to apprehend or with whom he has much even to discuss  this sovereign knows i have no doubt and feels on what sort of bottom is to be laid the foundation of a russian throne he knows what a rock of native granite is to form the pedestal of his statue who is to emulate peter the great his renown will be in continuing with ease and safety what his predecessor was obliged to achieve through mighty struggles he is sensible that his business is not to innovate out to secure and to establishthat reformations at this day are attempts at best of ambiguous utility he will revere his father with the piety of a son but in his government he will imitate the policy of his mother his father with many excellent qualities had a short reignbecause being a native russian he was unfortunately advised to act in the spirit of a foreigner his mother reigned over russia threeandthirty years with the greatest glorybecause with the disadvantage of being a foreigner born she made herself a russian a wise prince like the present will improve his country but it will be cautiously and progressively upon its own native groundwork of religion manners habitudes and alliances if i prognosticate right it is not the emperor of russia that ever will call for extravagant proofs of our desire to reconcile ourselves to the irreconcilable enemy of all thrones  i do not know why i should not include america among the european powersbecause she is of european origin and has not yet like france destroyed all traces of manners laws opinions and usages which she drew from europe as long as that europe shall have any possessions either in the southern or the northern parts of that america even separated as it is by the ocean it must be considered as a part of the european system it is not america menaced with internal ruin from the attempts to plant jacobinism instead of liberty in that countryit is not america whose independence is directly attacked by the french the enemies of the independence of all nations that calls upon us to give security by disarming ourselves in a treacherous peace by such a peace we shall deliver the americans their liberty and their order without resource to the mercy of their imperious allies who will have peace or neutrality with no state which is not ready to join her in war against england  having run round the whole circle of the european system wherever it acts i must affirm that all the foreign powers who are not leagued with france for the utter destruction of all balance through europe and throughout the world demand other assurances from this kingdom than are given in that declaration they require assurances not of the sincerity of our good dispositions towards the usurpation in france but of our affection towards the college of the ancient states of europe and pledges of our constancy our fidelity and of our fortitude in resisting to the last the power that menaces them all the apprehension from which they wish to be delivered cannot be from anything they dread in the ambition of england our power must be their strength they hope more from us than they fear i am sure the only ground of their hope and of our hope is in the greatness of mind hitherto shown by the people of this nation and its adherence to the unalterable principles of its ancient policy whatever government may finally prevail in france i have entered into this detail of the wishes and expectations of the european powers in order to point out more clearly not so much what their disposition as a consideration of far greater importance what their situation demands according as that situation is related to the regicide republic and to this kingdom  then if it is not to satisfy the foreign powers we make this assurance to what power at home is it that we pay all this humiliating court not to the old whigs or to the ancient tories of this kingdomif any memory of such ancient divisions still exists amongst us to which of the principles of these parties is this assurance agreeable is it to the whigs we are to recommend the aggrandizement of france and the subversion of the balance of power is it to the tories we are to recommend our eagerness to cement ourselves with the enemies of royalty and religion but if these parties which by their dissensions have so often distracted the kingdom which by their union have once saved it and which by their collision and mutual resistance have preserved the variety of this constitution in its unity be as i believe they are nearly extinct by the growth of new ones which have their roots in the present circumstances of the times i wish to know to which of these new descriptions this declaration is addressed it can hardly be to those persons who in the new distribution of parties consider the conservation in england of the ancient order of things as necessary to preserve order everywhere else and who regard the general conservation of order in other countries as reciprocally necessary to preserve the same state of things in these islands that party never can wish to see great britain pledge herself to give the lead and the ground of advantage and superiority to the france of today in any treaty which is to settle europe i insist upon it that so far from expecting such an engagement they are generally stupefied and confounded with it that the other party which demands great changes here and is so pleased to see them everywhere else which party i call jacobin that this faction does from the bottom of its heart approve the declaration and does erect its crest upon the engagement there can be little doubt to them it may be addressed with propriety for it answers their purposes in every point  the party in opposition within the house of lords and commons it is irreverent and half a breach of privilege far from my thoughts to consider as jacobin this party has always denied the existence of such a faction and has treated the machinations of those whom you and i call jacobins as so many forgeries and fictions of the minister and his adherents to find a pretext for destroying freedom and setting up an arbitrary power in this kingdom however whether this minority has a leaning towards the french system or only a charitable toleration of those who lean that way it is certain that they have always attacked the sincerity of the minister in the same modes and on the very same grounds and nearly in the same terms with the directory it must therefore be at the tribunal of the minority from the whole tenor of the speech that the minister appeared to consider himself obliged to purge himself of duplicity it was at their bar that he held up his hand it was on their sellette that he seemed to answer interrogatories it was on their principles that he defended his whole conduct they certainly take what the french call the haut du pavé they have loudly called for the negotiation it was accorded to them they engaged their support of the war with vigor in case peace was not granted on honorable terms peace was not granted on any terms honorable or shameful whether these judges few in number but powerful in jurisdiction are satisfiedwhether they to whom this new pledge is hypothecated have redeemed their ownwhether they have given one particle more of their support to ministry or even favored them with their good opinion or their candid construction i leave it to those who recollect that memorable debate to determine  the fact is that neither this declaration nor the negotiation which is its subject could serve any one good purpose foreign or domestic it could conduce to no end either with regard to allies or neutrals it tends neither to bring back the misled nor to give courage to the fearful nor to animate and confirm those who are hearty and zealous in the cause  i hear it has been said though i can scarcely believe it by a distinguished person in an assembly where if there be less of the torrent and tempest of eloquence more guarded expression is to be expected that indeed there was no just ground of hope in this business from the beginning  it is plain that this noble person however conversant in negotiation having been employed in no less than four embassies and in two hemispheres and in one of those negotiations having fully experienced what it was to proceed to treaty without previous encouragement was not at all consulted in this experiment for his majestys principal minister declared on the very same day in another house his majestys deep and sincere regret at its unfortunate and abrupt termination so different from the wishes and hopes that were entertainedand in other parts of the speech speaks of this abrupt termination as a great disappointment and as a fall from sincere endeavors and sanguine expectation here are indeed sentiments diametrically opposite as to the hopes with which the negotiation was commenced and carried on and what is curious is the grounds of the hopes on the one side and the despair on the other are exactly the same the logical conclusion from the common premises is indeed in favor of the noble lord for they are agreed that the enemy was far from giving the least degree of countenance to any such hopes and that they proceeded in spite of every discouragement which the enemy had thrown in their way but there is another material point in which they do not seem to differ that is to say the result of the desperate experiment of the noble lord and of the promising attempt of the great minister in satisfying the people of england and in causing discontent to the people of franceor as the minister expresses it in uniting england and in dividing france  for my own part though i perfectly agreed with the noble lord that the attempt was desperate so desperate indeed as to deserve his name of an experiment yet no fair man can possibly doubt that the minister was perfectly sincere in his proceeding and that from his ardent wishes for peace with the regicides he was led to conceive hopes which were founded rather in his vehement desires than in any rational ground of political speculation convinced as i am of this it had been better in my humble opinion that persons of great name and authority had abstained from those topics which had been used to call the ministers sincerity into doubt and had not adopted the sentiments of the directory upon the subject of all our negotiations for the noble lord expressly says that the experiment was made for the satisfaction of the country the directory says exactly the same thing upon granting in consequence of our supplications the passport to lord malmesbury in order to remove all sort of hope from its success they charged all our previous steps even to that moment of submissive demand to be admitted to their presence on duplicity and perfidy and assumed that the object of all the steps we had taken was that of justifying the continuance of the war in the eyes of the english nation and of throwing all the odium of it upon the french the english nation said they supports impatiently the continuance of the war and a reply must be made to its complaints and its reproaches the parliament is about to be opened and the mouths of the orators who will declaim against the war must be shut the demands for new taxes must be justified and to obtain these results it is necessary to be able to advance that the french government refuses every reasonable proposition for peace i am sorry that the language of the friends to ministry and the enemies to mankind should be so much in unison  as to the fact in which these parties are so well agreed that the experiment ought to have been made for the satisfaction of this country meaning the country of england it were well to be wished that persons of eminence would cease to make themselves representatives of the people of england without a letter of attorney or any other act of procuration in legal construction the sense of the people of england is to be collected from the house of commons and though i do not deny the possibility of an abuse of this trust as well as any other yet i think without the most weighty reasons and in the most urgent exigencies it is highly dangerous to suppose that the house speaks anything contrary to the sense of the people or that the representative is silent when the sense of the constituent strongly decidedly and upon long deliberation speaks audibly upon any topic of moment if there is a doubt whether the house of commons represents perfectly the whole commons of great britain i think there is none there can be no question but that the lords and the commons together represent the sense of the whole people to the crown and to the world thus it is when we speak legally and constitutionally in a great measure it is equally true when we speak prudentially but i do not pretend to assert that there are no other principles to guide discretion than those which are or can be fixed by some law or some constitution yet before the legally presumed sense of the people should be superseded by a supposition of one more real as in all cases where a legal presumption is to be ascertained some strong proofs ought to exist of a contrary disposition in the people at large and some decisive indications of their desire upon this subject there can be no question that previously to a direct message from the crown neither house of parliament did indicate anything like a wish for such advances as we have made or such negotiations as we have carried on the parliament has assented to ministry it is not ministry that has obeyed the impulse of parliament the people at large have their organs through which they can speak to parliament and to the crown by a respectful petition and though not with absolute authority yet with weight they can instruct their representatives the freeholders and other electors in this kingdom have another and a surer mode of expressing their sentiments concerning the conduct which is held by members of parliament in the middle of these transactions this last opportunity has been held out to them in all these points of view i positively assert that the people have nowhere and in no way expressed their wish of throwing themselves and their sovereign at the feet of a wicked and rancorous foe to supplicate mercy which from the nature of that foe and from the circumstances of affairs we had no sort of ground to expect it is undoubtedly the business of ministers very much to consult the inclinations of the people but they ought to take great care that they do not receive that inclination from the few persons who may happen to approach them the petty interests of such gentlemen their low conceptions of things their fears arising from the danger to which the very arduous and critical situation of public affairs may expose their places their apprehensions from the hazards to which the discontents of a few popular men at elections may expose their seats in parliamentall these causes trouble and confuse the representations which they make to ministers of the real temper of the nation if ministers instead of following the great indications of the constitution proceed on such reports they will take the whispers of a cabal for the voice of the people and the counsels of imprudent timidity for the wisdom of a nation  i well remember that when the fortune of the war began and it began pretty early to turn as it is common and natural we were dejected by the losses that had been sustained and with the doubtful issue of the contests that were foreseen but not a word was uttered that supposed peace upon any proper terms was in our power or therefore that it should be in our desire as usual with or without reason we criticized the conduct of the war and compared our fortunes with our measures the mass of the nation went no further for i suppose that you always understood me as speaking of that very preponderating part of the nation which had always been equally adverse to the french principles and to the general progress of their revolution throughout europeconsidering the final success of their arms and the triumph of their principles as one and the same thing  the first means that were used by any one professing our principles to change the minds of this party upon that subject appeared in a small pamphlet circulated with considerable industry it was commonly given to the noble person himself who has passed judgment upon all hopes from negotiation and justified our late abortive attempt only as an experiment made to satisfy the country and yet that pamphlet led the way in endeavoring to dissatisfy that very country with the continuance of the war and to raise in the people the most sanguine expectations from some such course of negotiation as has been fatally pursued this leads me to suppose and i am glad to have reason for supposing that there was no foundation for attributing the performance in question to that author but without mentioning his name in the titlepage it passed for his and does still pass uncontradicted it was entitled some remarks on the apparent circumstances of the war in the fourth week of october 1795  this sanguine little kingsfisher not prescient of the storm as by his instinct he ought to be appearing at that uncertain season before the rigs of old michaelmas were yet well composed and when the inclement storms of winter were approaching began to flicker over the seas and was busy in building its halcyon nest as if the angry ocean had been soothed by the genial breath of may very unfortunately this auspice was instantly followed by a speech from the throne in the very spirit and principles of that pamphlet  i say nothing of the newspapers which are undoubtedly in the interest and which are supposed by some to be directly or indirectly under the influence of ministers and which with less authority than the pamphlet i speak of had indeed for some time before held a similar language in direct contradiction to their more early tone insomuch that i can speak it with a certain assurance that very many who wished to administration as well as you and i do thought that in giving their opinion in favor of this peace they followed the opinion of ministrythey were conscious that they did not lead it my inference therefore is this that the negotiation whatever its merits may be in the general principle and policy of undertaking it is what every political measure in general ought to be the sole work of administration and that if it was an experiment to satisfy anybody it was to satisfy those whom the ministers were in the daily habit of condemning and by whom they were daily condemnedi mean the leaders of the opposition in parliament i am certain that the ministers were then and are now invested with the fullest confidence of the major part of the nation to pursue such measures of peace or war as the nature of things shall suggest as most adapted to the public safety it is in this light therefore as a measure which ought to have been avoided and ought not to be repeated that i take the liberty of discussing the merits of this system of regicide negotiations it is not a matter of light experiment that leaves us where it found us peace or war are the great hinges upon which the very being of nations turns negotiations are the means of making peace or preventing war and are therefore of more serious importance than almost any single event of war can possibly be  at the very outset i do not hesitate to affirm that this country in particular and the public law in general have suffered more by this negotiation of experiment than by all the battles together that we have lost from the commencement of this century to this time when it touches so nearly to its close i therefore have the misfortune not to coincide in opinion with the great statesman who set on foot a negotiation as he said in spite of the constant opposition he had met with from prance he admits that the difficulty in this negotiation became most seriously increased indeed by the situation in which we were placed and the manner in which alone the enemy would admit of a negotiation this situation so described and so truly described rendered our solicitation not only degrading but from the very outset evidently hopeless  i find it asserted and even a merit taken for it that this country surmounted every difficulty of form and etiquette which the enemy had thrown in our way an odd way of surmounting a difficulty by cowering under it i find it asserted that an heroic resolution had been taken and avowed in parliament previous to this negotiation that no consideration of etiquette should stand in the way of it  etiquette if i understand rightly the term which in any extent is of modern usage had its original application to those ceremonial and formal observances practised at courts which had been established by long usage in order to preserve the sovereign power from the rude intrusion of licentious familiarity as well as to preserve majesty itself from a disposition to consult its ease at the expense of its dignity the term came afterwards to have a greater latitude and to be employed to signify certain formal methods used in the transactions between sovereign states  in the more limited as well as in the larger sense of the term without knowing what the etiquette is it is impossible to determine whether it is a vain and captious punctilio or a form necessary to preserve decorum in character and order in business i readily admit that nothing tends to facilitate the issue of all public transactions more than a mutual disposition in the parties treating to waive all ceremony but the use of this temporary suspension of the recognized modes of respect consists in its being mutual and in the spirit of conciliation in which all ceremony is laid aside on the contrary when one of the parties to a treaty intrenches himself up to the chin in these ceremonies and will not on his side abate a single punctilio and that all the concessions are upon one side only the party so conceding does by this act place himself in a relation of inferiority and thereby fundamentally subverts that equality which is of the very essence of all treaty  after this formal act of degradation it was but a matter of course that gross insult should be offered to our ambassador and that he should tamely submit to it he found himself provoked to complain of the atrocious libels against his public character and his person which appeared in a paper under the avowed patronage of that government the regicide directory on this complaint did not recognize the paper and that was all they did not punish they did not dismiss they did not even reprimand the writer as to our ambassador this total want of reparation for the injury was passed by under the pretence of despising it  in this but too serious business it is not possible here to avoid a smile contempt is not a thing to be despised it may be borne with a calm and equal mind but no man by lifting his head high can pretend that he does not perceive the scorns that are poured down upon him from above all these sudden complaints of injury and all these deliberate submissions to it are the inevitable consequences of the situation in which we had placed ourselves a situation wherein the insults were such as nature would not enable us to bear and circumstances would not permit us to resent  it was not long however after this contempt of contempt upon the part of our ambassador who by the way represented his sovereign that a new object was furnished for displaying sentiments of the same kind though the case was infinitely aggravated not the ambassador but the king himself was libelled and insultedlibelled not by a creature of the directory but by the directory itself at least so lord malmesbury understood it and so he answered it in his note of the 12th november 1796 in which he sayswith regard to the offensive and injurious insinuations which are contained in that paper and which are only calculated to throw new obstacles in the way of the accommodation which the french government professes to desire the king has deemed it far beneath his dignity to permit an answer to be made to them on his part in any manner whatsoever  i am of opinion that if his majesty had kept aloof from that wash and offscouring of everything that is low and barbarous in the world it might be well thought unworthy of his dignity to take notice of such scurrilities they must be considered as much the natural expression of that kind of animal as it is the expression of the feelings of a dog to bark but when the king had been advised to recognize not only the monstrous composition as a sovereign power but in conduct to admit something in it like a superioritywhen the bench of regicide was made at least coordinate with his throne and raised upon a platform full as elevated this treatment could not be passed by under the appearance of despising it it would not indeed have been proper to keep up a war of the same kind but an immediate manly and decided resentment ought to have been the consequence we ought not to have waited for the disgraceful dismissal of our ambassador there are cases in which we may pretend to sleep but the wittol rule has some sense in it non omnibus dormio we might however have seemed ignorant of the affront but what was the fact did we dissemble or pass it by in silence when dignity is talked of a language which i did not expect to hear in such a transaction i must say what all the world must feel that it was not for the kings dignity to notice this insult and not to resent it this mode of proceeding is formed on new ideas of the correspondence between sovereign powers  this was far from the only ill effect of the policy of degradation the state of inferiority in which we were placed in this vain attempt at treaty drove us headlong from error into error and led us to wander far away not only from all the paths which have been beaten in the old course of political communication between mankind but out of the ways even of the most common prudence against all rules after we had met nothing but rebuffs in return to all our proposals we made two confidential communications to those in whom we had no confidence and who reposed no confidence in us what was worse we were fully aware of the madness of the step we were taking ambassadors are not sent to a hostile power persevering in sentiments of hostility to make candid confidential and amicable communications hitherto the world has considered it as the duty of an ambassador in such a situation to be cautious guarded dexterous and circumspect it is true that mutual confidence and common interest dispense with all rules smooth the rugged way remove every obstacle and make all things plain and level when in the last century temple and de witt negotiated the famous triple alliance their candor their freedom and the most confidential disclosures were the result of true policy accordingly in spite of all the dilatory forms of the complex government of the united provinces the treaty was concluded in three days it did not take a much longer time to bring the same state that of holland through a still more complicated transactionthat of the grand alliance but in the present case this unparalleled candor this unpardonable want of reserve produced what might have been expected from it the most serious evils it instructed the enemy in the whole plan of our demands and concessions it made the most fatal discoveries  and first it induced us to lay down the basis of a treaty which itself had nothing to rest upon it seems we thought we had gained a great point in getting this basis admittedthat is a basis of mutual compensation and exchange of conquests if a disposition to peace and with any reasonable assurance had been previously indicated such a plan of arrangement might with propriety and safety be proposed because these arrangements were not in effect to make the basis but a part of the superstructure of the fabric of pacification the order of things would thus be reversed the mutual disposition to peace would form the reasonable base upon which the scheme of compensation upon one side or the other might be constructed this truly fundamental base being once laid all differences arising from the spirit of huckstering and barter might be easily adjusted if the restoration of peace with a view to the establishment of a fair balance of power in europe had been made the real basis of the treaty the reciprocal value of the compensations could not be estimated according to their proportion to each other but according to their proportionate relation to that end to that great end the whole would be subservient the effect of the treaty would be in a manner secured before the detail of particulars was begun and for a plain reasonbecause the hostile spirit on both sides had been conjured down but if in the full fury and unappeased rancor of war a little traffic is attempted it is easy to divine what must be the consequence to those who endeavor to open that kind of petty commerce  to illustrate what i have said i go back no further than to the two last treaties of paris and to the treaty of aixlachapelle which preceded the first of these two treaties of paris by about fourteen or fifteen years i do not mean here to criticize any of them my opinions upon some particulars of the treaty of paris in 1763 are published in a pamphlet39 which your recollection will readily bring into your view i recur to them only to show that their basis had not been and never could have been a mere dealing of truck and barter but that the parties being willing from common fatigue or common suffering to put an end to a war the first object of which had either been obtained or despaired of the lesser objects were not thought worth the price of further contest the parties understanding one another so much was given away without considering from whose budget it came not as the value of the objects but as the value of peace to the parties might require  at the last treaty of paris the subjugation of america being despaired of on the part of great britain and the independence of america being looked upon as secure on the part of france the main cause of the war was removed and then the conquests which france had made upon us for we had made none of importance upon her were surrendered with sufficient facility peace was restored as peace in america the parties stood as they were possessed a limit was to be settled but settled as a limit to secure that peace and not at all on a system of equivalents for which as we then stood with the united states there were little or no materials  at the preceding treaty of paris i mean that of 1763 there was nothing at all on which to fix a basis of compensation from reciprocal cession of conquests they were all on one side the question with us was not what we were to receive and on what consideration but what we were to keep for indemnity or to cede for peace accordingly no place being left for barter sacrifices were made on our side to peace and we surrendered to the french their most valuable possessions in the west indies without any equivalent the rest of europe fell soon after into its ancient order and the german war ended exactly where it had begun  the treaty of aixlachapelle was built upon a similar basis all the conquests in europe had been made by france she had subdued the austrian netherlands and broken open the gates of holland we had taken nothing in the west indies and cape breton was a trifling business indeed france gave up all for peace the allies had given up all that was ceded at utrecht louis the fourteenth made all or nearly all the cessions at ryswick and at nimeguen in all those treaties and in all the preceding as well as in the others which intervened the question never had been that of barter the balance of power had been ever assumed as the known common law of europe at all times and by all powers the question had only been as it must happen on the more or less inclination of that balance  this general balance was regarded in four principal points of view the great middle balance which comprehended great britain france and spain the balance of the north the balance external and internal of germany and the balance of italy in all those systems of balance england was the power to whose custody it was thought it might be most safely committed  france as she happened to stand secured the balance or endangered it without question she had been long the security for the balance of germany and under her auspices the system if not formed had been at least perfected she was so in some measure with regard to italy more than occasionally she had a clear interest in the balance of the north and had endeavored to preserve it but when we began to treat with the present france or more properly to prostrate ourselves to her and to try if we should be admitted to ransom our allies upon a system of mutual concession and compensation we had not one of the usual facilities for first we had not the smallest indication of a desire for peace on the part of the enemy but rather the direct contrary men do not make sacrifices to obtain what they do not desire and as for the balance of power it was so far from being admitted by france either on the general system or with regard to the particular systems that i have mentioned that in the whole body of their authorized or encouraged reports and discussions upon the theory of the diplomatic system they constantly rejected the very idea of the balance of power and treated it as the true cause of all the wars and calamities that had afflicted europe and their practice was correspondent to the dogmatic positions they had laid down the empire and the papacy it was their great object to destroy and this now openly avowed and steadfastly acted upon might have been discerned with very little acuteness of sight from the very first dawnings of the revolution to be the main drift of their policy for they professed a resolution to destroy everything which can hold states together by the tie of opinion  exploding therefore all sorts of balances they avow their design to erect themselves into a new description of empire which is not grounded on any balance but forms a sort of impious hierarchy of which france is to be the head and the guardian the law of this their empire is anything rather than the public law of europe the ancient conventions of its several states or the ancient opinions which assign to them superiority or preëminence of any sort or any other kind of connection in virtue of ancient relations they permit and that is all the temporary existence of some of the old communities but whilst they give to these tolerated states this temporary respite in order to secure them in a condition of real dependence on themselves they invest them on every side by a body of republics formed on the model and dependent ostensibly as well as substantially on the will of the mother republic to which they owe their origin these are to be so many garrisons to check and control the states which are to be permitted to remain on the old model until they are ripe for a change it is in this manner that france on her new system means to form an universal empire by producing an universal revolution by this means forming a new code of communities according to what she calls the natural rights of man and of states she pretends to secure eternal peace to the world guarantied by her generosity and justice which are to grow with the extent of her power to talk of the balance of power to the governors of such a country was a jargon which they could not understand even through an interpreter before men can transact any affair they must have a common language to speak and some common recognized principles on which they can argue otherwise all is cross purpose and confusion it was therefore an essential preliminary to the whole proceeding to fix whether the balance of power the liberties and laws of the empire and the treaties of different belligerent powers in past times when they put an end to hostilities were to be considered as the basis of the present negotiation  the whole of the enemys plan was known when lord malmesbury was sent with his scrap of equivalents to paris yet in this unfortunate attempt at negotiation instead of fixing these points and assuming the balance of power and the peace of europe as the basis to which all cessions on all sides were to be subservient our solicitor for peace was directed to reverse that order he was directed to make mutual concessions on a mere comparison of their marketable value the base of treaty the balance of power was to be thrown in as an inducement and a sort of makeweight to supply the manifest deficiency which must stare him and the world in the face between those objects which he was to require the enemy to surrender and those which he had to offer as a fair equivalent  to give any force to this inducement and to make it answer even the secondary purpose of equalizing equivalents having in themselves no natural proportionate value it supposed that the enemy contrary to the most notorious fact did admit this balance of power to be of some value great or small whereas it is plain that in the enemys estimate of things the consideration of the balance of power as we have said before was so far from going in diminution of the value of what the directory was desired to surrender or of giving an additional price to our objects offered in exchange that the hope of the utter destruction of that balance became a new motive to the junto of regicides for preserving as a means for realizing that hope what we wished them to abandon  thus stood the basis of the treaty on laying the first stone of the foundation at the very best upon our side the question stood upon a mere naked bargain and sale unthinking people here triumphed when they thought they had obtained it whereas when obtained as a basis of a treaty it was just the worst we could possibly have chosen as to our offer to cede a most unprofitable and indeed beggarly chargeable countinghouse or two in the east indies we ought not to presume that they would consider this as anything else than a mockery as to anything of real value we had nothing under heaven to offer for which we were not ourselves in a very dubious struggle except the island of martinico only when this object was to be weighed against the directorial conquests merely as an object of a value at market the principle of barter became perfectly ridiculous a single quarter in the single city of amsterdam was worth ten martinicos and would have sold for many more years purchase in any market overt in europe how was this gross and glaring defect in the objects of exchange to be supplied it was to be made up by argument and what was that argument the extreme utility of possessions in the west indies to the augmentation of the naval power of france a very curious topic of argument to be proposed and insisted on by an ambassador of great britain it is directly and plainly thiscome we know that of all things you wish a naval power and it is natural you should who wish to destroy the very sources of the british greatness to overpower our marine to destroy our commerce to eradicate our foreign influence and to lay us open to an invasion which at one stroke may complete our servitude and ruin and expunge us from among the nations of the earth here i have it in my budget the infallible arcanum for that purpose you are but novices in the art of naval resources let you have the west indies back and your maritime preponderance is secured for which you would do well to be moderate in your demands upon the austrian netherlands  under any circumstances this is a most extraordinary topic of argument but it is rendered by much the more unaccountable when we are told that if the war has been diverted from the great object of establishing society and good order in europe by destroying the usurpation in france this diversion was made to increase the naval resources and power of great britain and to lower if not annihilate those of the marine of france i leave all this to the very serious reflection of every englishman  this basis was no sooner admitted than the rejection of a treaty upon that sole foundation was a thing of course the enemy did not think it worthy of a discussion as in truth it was not and immediately as usual they began in the most opprobrious and most insolent manner to question our sincerity and good faith whereas in truth there was no one symptom wanting of openness and fair dealing what could be more fair than to lay open to an enemy all that you wished to obtain and the price you meant to pay for it and to desire him to imitate your ingenuous proceeding and in the same manner to open his honest heart to you here was no want of fair dealing but there was too evidently a fault of another kind there was much weaknessthere was an eager and impotent desire of associating with this unsocial power and of attempting the connection by any means however manifestly feeble and ineffectual the event was committed to chancethat is to such a manifestation of the desire of france for peace as would induce the directory to forget the advantages they had in the system of barter accordingly the general desire for such a peace was triumphantly reported from the moment that lord malmesbury had set his foot on shore at calais  it has been said that the directory was compelled against its will to accept the basis of barter as if that had tended to accelerate the work of pacification by the voice of all france had this been the case the directors would have continued to listen to that voice to which it seems they were so obedient they would have proceeded with the negotiation upon that basis but the fact is that they instantly broke up the negotiation as soon as they had obliged our ambassador to violate all the principles of treaty and weakly rashly and unguardedly to expose without any counter proposition the whole of our project with regard to ourselves and our allies and without holding out the smallest hope that they would admit the smallest part of our pretensions  when they had thus drawn from us all that they could draw out they expelled lord malmesbury and they appealed for the propriety of their conduct to that very france which we thought proper to suppose had driven them to this fine concession and i do not find that in either division of the family of thieves the younger branch or the elder or in any other body whatsoever there was any indignation excited or any tumult raised or anything like the virulence of opposition which was shown to the kings ministers here on account of that transaction  notwithstanding all this it seems a hope is still entertained that the directory will have that tenderness for the carcass of their country by whose very distemper and on whose festering wounds like vermin they are fed that these pious patriots will of themselves come into a more moderate and reasonable way of thinking and acting in the name of wonder what has inspired our ministry with this hope any more than with their former expectations  do these hopes only arise from continual disappointment do they grow out of the usual grounds of despair what is there to encourage them in the conduct or even in the declarations of the ruling powers in france from the first formation of their mischievous republic to the hour in which i write is not the directory composed of the same junto are they not the identical men who from the base and sordid vices which belonged to their original place and situation aspired to the dignity of crimesand from the dirtiest lowest most fraudulent and most knavish of chicaners ascended in the scale of robbery sacrilege and assassination in all its forms till at last they had imbrued their impious hands in the blood of their sovereign is it from these men that we are to hope for this paternal tenderness to their country and this sacred regard for the peace and happiness of all nations  but it seems there is still another lurking hope akin to that which duped us so egregiously before when our delightful basis was accepted we still flatter ourselves that the public voice of france will compel this directory to more moderation whence does this hope arise what public voice is there in france there are indeed some writers who since this monster of a directory has obtained a great regular military force to guard them are indulged in a sufficient liberty of writing and some of them write well undoubtedly but the world knows that in france there is no publicthat the country is composed but of two descriptions audacious tyrants and trembling slaves the contests between the tyrants is the only vital principle that can be discerned in france the only thing which there appears like spirit is amongst their late associates and fastest friends of the directorythe more furious and untamable part of the jacobins this discontented member of the faction does almost balance the reigning divisions and it threatens every moment to predominate for the present however the dread of their fury forms some sort of security to their fellows who now exercise a more regular and therefore a somewhat less ferocious tyranny most of the slaves choose a quiet however reluctant submission to those who are somewhat satiated with blood and who like wolves are a little more tame from being a little less hungry in preference to an irruption of the famished devourers who are prowling and howling about the fold  this circumstance assures some degree of permanence to the power of those whom we know to be permanently our rancorous and implacable enemies but to those very enemies who have sworn our destruction we have ourselves given a further and far better security by rendering the cause of the royalists desperate those brave and virtuous but unfortunate adherents to the ancient constitution of their country after the miserable slaughters which have been made in that body after all their losses by emigration are still numerous but unable to exert themselves against the force of the usurpation evidently countenanced and upheld by those very princes who had called them to arm for the support of the legal monarchy where then after chasing these fleeting hopes of ours from point to point of the political horizon are they at last really found not where under providence the hopes of englishmen used to be placed in our own courage and in our own virtues but in the moderation and virtue of the most atrocious monsters that have ever disgraced and plagued mankind  the only excuse to be made for all our mendicant diplomacy is the same as in the case of all other mendicancy namely that it has been founded on absolute necessity this deserves consideration necessity as it has no law so it has no shame but moral necessity is not like metaphysical or even physical in that category it is a word of loose signification and conveys different ideas to different minds to the lowminded the slightest necessity becomes an invincible necessity the slothful man saith there is a lion in the way and i shall be devoured in the streets but when the necessity pleaded is not in the nature of things but in the vices of him who alleges it the whining tones of commonplace beggarly rhetoric produce nothing but indignation because they indicate a desire of keeping up a dishonorable existence without utility to others and without dignity to itself because they aim at obtaining the dues of labor without industry and by frauds would draw from the compassion of others what men ought to owe to their own spirit and their own exertions  i am thoroughly satisfied that if we degrade ourselves it is the degradation which will subject us to the yoke of necessity and not that it is necessity which has brought on our degradation in this same chaos where light and darkness are struggling together the open subscription of last year with all its circumstances must have given us no little glimmering of hope not as i have heard it was vainly discoursed that the loan could prove a crutch to a lame negotiation abroad and that the whiff and wind of it must at once have disposed the enemies of all tranquillity to a desire for peace judging on the face of facts if on them it had any effect at all it had the direct contrary effect for very soon after the loan became public at paris the negotiation ended and our ambassador was ignominiously expelled my view of this was different i liked the loan not from the influence which it might have on the enemy but on account of the temper which it indicated in our own people this alone is a consideration of any importance because all calculation formed upon a supposed relation of the habitudes of others to our own under the present circumstances is weak and fallacious the adversary must be judged not by what we are or by what we wish him to be but by what we must know he actually is unless we choose to shut our eyes and our ears to the uniform tenor of all his discourses and to his uniform course in all his actions we may be deluded but we cannot pretend that we have been disappointed the old rule of ne te quæsiveris extra is a precept as available in policy as it is in morals let us leave off speculating upon the disposition and the wants of the enemy let us descend into our own bosoms let us ask ourselves what are our duties and what are our means of discharging them in what heart are you at home how far may an english minister confide in the affections in the confidence in the force of an english people what does he find us when he puts us to the proof of what english interest and english honor demand it is as furnishing an answer to these questions that i consider the circumstances of the loan the effect on the enemy is not in what he may speculate on our resources but in what he shall feel from our arms  the circumstances of the loan have proved beyond a doubt three capital points which if they are properly used may be advantageous to the future liberty and happiness of mankind in the first place the loan demonstrates in regard to instrumental resources the competency of this kingdom to the assertion of the common cause and to the maintenance and superintendence of that which it is its duty and its glory to hold and to watch overthe balance of power throughout the christian world secondly it brings to light what under the most discouraging appearances i always reckoned on that with its ancient physical force not only unimpaired but augmented its ancient spirit is still alive in the british nation it proves that for their application there is a spirit equal to the resources for its energy above them it proves that there exists though not always visible a spirit which never fails to come forth whenever it is ritually invokeda spirit which will give no equivocal response but such as will hearten the timidity and fix the irresolution of hesitating prudencea spirit which will be ready to perform all the tasks that shall be imposed upon it by public honor thirdly the loan displays an abundant confidence in his majestys government as administered by his present servants in the prosecution of a war which the people consider not as a war made on the suggestion of ministers and to answer the purposes of the ambition or pride of statesmen but as a war of their own and in defence of that very property which they expend for its supporta war for that order of things from which everything valuable that they possess is derived and in which order alone it can possibly be maintained  i hear in derogation of the value of the fact from which i draw inferences so favorable to the spirit of the people and to its just expectation from ministers that the eighteen million loan is to be considered in no other light than as taking advantage of a very lucrative bargain held out to the subscribers i do not in truth believe it all the circumstances which attended the subscription strongly spoke a different language be it however as these detractors say this with me derogates little or rather nothing at all from the political value and importance of the fact i should be very sorry if the transaction was not such a bargain otherwise it would not have been a fair one a corrupt and improvident loan like everything else corrupt or prodigal cannot be too much condemned but there is a shortsighted parsimony still more fatal than an unforeseeing expense the value of money must be judged like everything else from its rate at market to force that market or any market is of all things the most dangerous for a small temporary benefit the spring of all public credit might be relaxed forever the moneyed men have a right to look to advantage in the investment of their property to advance their money they risk it and the risk is to be included in the price if they were to incur a loss that loss would amount to a tax on that peculiar species of property in effect it would be the most unjust and impolitic of all thingsunequal taxation it would throw upon one description of persons in the community that burden which ought by fair and equitable distribution to rest upon the whole none on account of their dignity should be exempt none preserving due proportion on account of the scantiness of their means the moment a man is exempted from the maintenance of the community he is in a sort separated from ithe loses the place of a citizen  so it is in all taxation but in a bargain when terms of loss are looked for by the borrower from the lender compulsion or what virtually is compulsion introduces itself into the place of treaty when compulsion may be at all used by a state in borrowing the occasion must determine but the compulsion ought to be known and well defined and well distinguished for otherwise treaty only weakens the energy of compulsion while compulsion destroys the freedom of a bargain the advantage of both is lost by the confusion of things in their nature utterly unsociable it would be to introduce compulsion into that in which freedom and existence are the same i mean credit the moment that shame or fear or force are directly or indirectly applied to a loan credit perishes  there must be some impulse besides public spirit to put private interest into motion along with it moneyed men ought to be allowed to set a value on their money if they did not there could be no moneyed men this desire of accumulation is a principle without which the means of their service to the state could not exist the love of lucre though sometimes carried to a ridiculous sometimes to a vicious excess is the grand cause of prosperity to all states in this natural this reasonable this powerful this prolific principle it is for the satirist to expose the ridiculousit is for the moralist to censure the viciousit is for the sympathetic heart to reprobate the hard and cruelit is for the judge to animadvert on the fraud the extortion and the oppression but it is for the statesman to employ it as he finds it with all its concomitant excellencies with all its imperfections on its head it is his part in this case as it is in all other cases where he is to make use of the general energies of nature to take them as he finds them  after all it is a great mistake to imagine as too commonly almost indeed generally it is imagined that the public borrower and the private lender are two adverse parties with different and contending interests and that what is given to the one is wholly taken from the other constituted as our system of finance and taxation is the interests of the contracting parties cannot well be separated whatever they may reciprocally intend he who is the hard lender of today tomorrow is the generous contributor to his own payment for example the last loan is raised on public taxes which are designed to produce annually two millions sterling at first view this is an annuity of two millions dead charge upon the public in favor of certain moneyed men but inspect the thing more nearly follow the stream in its meanders and you will find that there is a good deal of fallacy in this state of things  i take it that whoever considers any mans expenditure of his income old or new i speak of certain classes in life will find a full third of it to go in taxes direct or indirect if so this newcreated income of two millions will probably furnish 665000l i avoid broken numbers towards the payment of its own interest or to the sinking of its own capital so it is with the whole of the public debt suppose it any given sum it is a fallacious estimate of the affairs of a nation to consider it as a mere burden to a degree it is so without question but not wholly so nor anything like it if the income from the interest be spent the above proportion returns again into the public stock insomuch that taking the interest of the whole debt to be twelve million three hundred thousand pound it is something more not less than a sum of four million one hundred thousand pound comes back again to the public through the channel of imposition if the whole or any part of that income be saved so much new capital is generatedthe infallible operation of which is to lower the value of money and consequently to conduce towards the improvement of public credit  i take the expenditure of the capitalist not the value of the capital as my standard because it is the standard upon which amongst us property as an object of taxation is rated in this country land and offices only excepted we raise no faculty tax we preserve the faculty from the expense our taxes for the far greater portion fly over the heads of the lowest classes they escape too who with better ability voluntarily subject themselves to the harsh discipline of a rigid necessity with us labor and frugality the parents of riches are spared and wisely too the moment men cease to augment the common stock the moment they no longer enrich it by their industry or their selfdenial their luxury and even their ease are obliged to pay contribution to the public not because they are vicious principles but because they are unproductive if in fact the interest paid by the public had not thus revolved again into its own fund if this secretion had not again been absorbed into the mass of blood it would have been impossible for the nation to have existed to this time under such a debt but under the debt it does exist and flourish and this flourishing state of existence in no small degree is owing to the contribution from the debt to the payment whatever therefore is taken from that capital by too close a bargain is but a delusive advantage it is so much lost to the public in another way this matter cannot on the one side or the other be metaphysically pursued to the extreme but it is a consideration of which in all discussions of this kind we ought never wholly to lose sight  it is never therefore wise to quarrel with the interested views of men whilst they are combined with the public interest and promote it it is our business to tie the knot if possible closer resources that are derived from extraordinary virtues as such virtues are rare so they must be unproductive it is a good thing for a moneyed man to pledge his property on the welfare of his country he shows that he places his treasure where his heart is and revolving in this circle we know that wherever a mans treasure is there his heart will be also for these reasons and on these principles i have been sorry to see the attempts which have been made with more good meaning than foresight and consideration towards raising the annual interest of this loan by private contributions wherever a regular revenue is established there voluntary contribution can answer no purpose but to disorder and disturb it in its course to recur to such aids is for so much to dissolve the community and to return to a state of unconnected nature and even if such a supply should be productive in a degree commensurate to its object it must also be productive of much vexation and much oppression either the citizens by the proposed duties pay their proportion according to some rate made by public authority or they do not if the law be well made and the contributions founded on just proportions everything superadded by something that is not as regular as law and as uniform in its operation will become more or less out of proportion if on the contrary the law be not made upon proper calculation it is a disgrace to the public wisdom which fails in skill to assess the citizen in just measure and according to his means but the hand of authority is not always the most heavy hand it is obvious that men may be oppressed by many ways besides those which take their course from the supreme power of the state suppose the payment to be wholly discretionary whatever has its origin in caprice is sure not to improve in its progress nor to end in reason it is impossible for each private individual to have any measure conformable to the particular condition of each of his fellowcitizens or to the general exigencies of his country tis a random shot at best  when men proceed in this irregular mode the first contributor is apt to grow peevish with his neighbors he is but too well disposed to measure their means by his own envy and not by the real state of their fortunes which he can rarely know and which it may in them be an act of the grossest imprudence to reveal hence the odium and lassitude with which people will look upon a provision for the public which is bought by discord at the expense of social quiet hence the bitter heartburnings and the war of tongues which is so often the prelude to other wars nor is it every contribution called voluntary which is according to the free will of the giver a false shame or a false glory against his feelings and his judgment may tax an individual to the detriment of his family and in wrong of his creditors a pretence of public spirit may disable him from the performance of his private duties it may disable him even from paying the legitimate contributions which he is to furnish according to the prescript of law but what is the most dangerous of all is that malignant disposition to which this mode of contribution evidently tends and which at length leaves the comparatively indigent to judge of the wealth and to prescribe to the opulent or those whom they conceive to be such the use they are to make of their fortunes from thence it is but one step to the subversion of all property  far very far am i from supposing that such things enter into the purposes of those excellent persons whose zeal has led them to this kind of measure but the measure itself will lead them beyond their intention and what is begun with the best designs bad men will perversely improve to the worst of their purposes an illfounded plausibility in great affairs is a real evil in france we have seen the wickedest and most foolish of men the constitutionmongers of 1789 pursuing this very course and ending in this very event these projectors of deception set on foot two modes of voluntary contribution to the state the first they called patriotic gifts these for the greater part were not more ridiculous in the mode than contemptible in the project the other which they called the patriotic contribution was expected to amount to a fourth of the fortunes of individuals but at their own will and on their own estimate but this contribution threatening to fall infinitely short of their hopes they soon made it compulsory both in the rate and in the levy beginning in fraud and ending as all the frauds of power end in plain violence all these devices to produce an involuntary will were under the pretext of relieving the more indigent classes but the principle of voluntary contribution however delusive being once established these lower classes first and then all classes were encouraged to throw off the regular methodical payments to the state as so many badges of slavery thus all regular revenue failing these impostors raising the superstructure on the same cheats with which they had laid the foundation of their greatness and not content with a portion of the possessions of the rich confiscated the whole and to prevent them from reclaiming their rights murdered the proprietors the whole of the process has passed before our eyes and been conducted indeed with a greater degree of rapidity than could be expected  my opinion then is that public contributions ought only to be raised by the public will by the judicious form of our constitution the public contribution is in its name and substance a grant in its origin it is truly voluntary not voluntary according to the irregular unsteady capricious will of individuals but according to the will and wisdom of the whole popular mass in the only way in which will and wisdom can go together this voluntary grant obtaining in its progress the force of a law a general necessity which takes away all merit and consequently all jealousy from individuals compresses equalizes and satisfies the whole suffering no man to judge of his neighbor or to arrogate anything to himself if their will complies with their obligation the great end is answered in the happiest mode if the will resists the burden every one loses a great part of his own will as a common lot after all perhaps contributions raised by a charge on luxury or that degree of convenience which approaches so near as to be confounded with luxury is the only mode of contribution which may be with truth termed voluntary  i might rest here and take the loan i speak of as leading to a solution of that question which i proposed in my first letter whether the inability of the country to prosecute the war did necessitate a submission to the indignities and the calamities of a peace with the regicide power but give me leave to pursue this point a little further  i know that it has been a cry usual on this occasion as it has been upon occasions where such a cry could have less apparent justification that great distress and misery have been the consequence of this war by the burdens brought and laid upon the people but to know where the burden really lies and where it presses we must divide the people as to the common people their stock is in their persons and in their earnings i deny that the stock of their persons is diminished in a greater proportion than the common sources of populousness abundantly fill up i mean constant employment proportioned pay according to the produce of the soil and where the soil fails according to the operation of the general capital plentiful nourishment to vigorous labor comfortable provision to decrepit age to orphan infancy and to accidental malady i say nothing to the policy of the provision for the poor in all the variety of faces under which it presents itself this is the matter of another inquiry i only just speak of it as of a fact taken with others to support me in my denial that hitherto any one of the ordinary sources of the increase of mankind is dried up by this war i affirm what i can well prove that the waste has been less than the supply to say that in war no man must be killed is to say that there ought to be no war this they may say who wish to talk idly and who would display their humanity at the expense of their honesty or their understanding if more lives are lost in this war than necessity requires they are lost by misconduct or mistake but if the hostility be just the error is to be corrected the war is not to be abandoned  that the stock of the common people in numbers is not lessened any more than the causes are impaired is manifest without being at the pains of an actual numeration an improved and improving agriculture which implies a great augmentation of labor has not yet found itself at a stand no not for a single moment for want of the necessary hands either in the settled progress of husbandry or in the occasional pressure of harvests i have even reason to believe that there has been a much smaller importation or the demand of it from a neighboring kingdom than in former times when agriculture was more limited in its extent and its means and when the time was a season of profound peace on the contrary the prolific fertility of country life has poured its superfluity of population into the canals and into other public works which of late years have been undertaken to so amazing an extent and which have not only not been discontinued but beyond all expectation pushed on with redoubled vigor in a war that calls for so many of our men and so much of our riches an increasing capital calls for labor and an increasing population answers to the call our manufactures augmented both for the supply of foreign and domestic consumption reproducing with the means of life the multitudes which they use and waste and which many of them devour much more surely and much more largely than the war have always found the laborious hand ready for the liberal pay that the price of the soldier is highly raised is true in part this rise may be owing to some measures not so well considered in the beginning of this war but the grand cause has been the reluctance of that class of people from whom the soldiery is taken to enter into a military lifenot that but once entered into it has its conveniences and even its pleasures i have seldom known a soldier who at the intercession of his friends and at their no small charge had been redeemed from that discipline that in a short time was not eager to return to it again but the true reason is the abundant occupation and the augmented stipend found in towns and villages and farms which leaves a smaller number of persons to be disposed of the price of men for new and untried ways of life must bear a proportion to the profits of that mode of existence from whence they are to be bought  so far as to the stock of the common people as it consists in their persons as to the other part which consists in their earnings i have to say that the rates of wages are very greatly augmented almost through the kingdom in the parish where i live it has been raised from seven to nine shillings in the week for the same laborer performing the same task and no greater except something in the malt taxes and the duties upon sugars i do not know any one tax imposed for very many years past which affects the laborer in any degree whatsoever while on the other hand the tax upon houses not having more than seven windows that is upon cottages was repealed the very year before the commencement of the present war on the whole i am satisfied that the humblest class and that class which touches the most nearly on the lowest out of which it is continually emerging and to which it is continually falling receives far more from public impositions than it pays that class receives two million sterling annually from the classes above it it pays to no such amount towards any public contribution  i hope it is not necessary for me to take notice of that language so ill suited to the persons to whom it has been attributed and so unbecoming the place in which it is said to have been uttered concerning the present war as the cause of the high price of provisions during the greater part of the year 1796 i presume it is only to be ascribed to the intolerable license with which the newspapers break not only the rules of decorum in real life but even the dramatic decorum when they personate great men and like bad poets make the heroes of the piece talk more like us grubstreet scribblers than in a style consonant to persons of gravity and importance in the state it was easy to demonstrate the cause and the sole cause of that rise in the grand article and first necessary of life it would appear that it had no more connection with the war than the moderate price to which all sorts of grain were reduced soon after the return of lord malmesbury had with the state of politics and the fate of his lordships treaty i have quite as good reason that is no reason at all to attribute this abundance to the longer continuance of the war as the gentlemen who personate leading members of parliament have had for giving the enhanced price to that war at a more early period of its duration oh the folly of us poor creatures who in the midst of our distresses or our escapes are ready to claw or caress one another upon matters that so seldom depend on our wisdom or our weakness on our good or evil conduct towards each other  an untimely shower or an unseasonable drought a frost too long continued or too suddenly broken up with rain and tempest the blight of the spring or the smut of the harvest will do more to cause the distress of the belly than all the contrivances of all statesmen can do to relieve it let government protect and encourage industry secure property repress violence and discountenance fraud it is all that they have to do in other respects the less they meddle in these affairs the better the rest is in the hands of our master and theirs we are in a constitution of things wherein modo sol nimius modo corripit imberbut i will push this matter no further as i have said a good deal upon it at various times during my public service and have lately written something on it which may yet see the light i shall content myself now with observing that the vigorous and laborious class of life has lately got from the bonton of the humanity of this day the name of the laboring poor we have heard many plans for the relief of the laboring poor this puling jargon is not as innocent as it is foolish in meddling with great affairs weakness is never innoxious hitherto the name of poor in the sense in which it is used to excite compassion has not been used for those who can but for those who cannot laborfor the sick and infirm for orphan infancy for languishing and decrepit age but when we affect to pity as poor those who must labor or the world cannot exist we are trifling with the condition of mankind it is the common doom of man that he must eat his bread by the sweat of his browthat is by the sweat of his body or the sweat of his mind if this toil was inflicted as a curse it is as might be expected from the curses of the father of all blessings it is tempered with many alleviations many comforts every attempt to fly from it and to refuse the very terms of our existence becomes much more truly a curse and heavier pains and penalties fall upon those who would elude the tasks which are put upon them by the great master workman of the world who in his dealings with his creatures sympathizes with their weakness and speaking of a creation wrought by mere will out of nothing speaks of six days of labor and one of rest i do not call a healthy young man cheerful in his mind and vigorous in his arms i cannot call such a man poor i cannot pity my kind as a kind merely because they are men this affected pity only tends to dissatisfy them with their condition and to teach them to seek resources where no resources are to be found in something else than their own industry and frugality and sobriety whatever may be the intention which because i do not know i cannot dispute of those who would discontent mankind by this strange pity they act towards us in the consequences as if they were our worst enemies  in turning our view from the lower to the higher classes it will not be necessary for me to show at any length that the stock of the latter as it consists in their numbers has not yet suffered any material diminution i have not seen or heard it asserted i have no reason to believe it there is no want of officers that i have ever understood for the new ships which we commission or the new regiments which we raise in the nature of things it is not with their persons that the higher classes principally pay their contingent to the demands of war there is another and not less important part which rests with almost exclusive weight upon them they furnish the means          how war may best upheld     move by her two main nerves iron and gold     in all her equipage  not that they are exempt from contributing also by their personal service in the fleets and armies of their country they do contribute and in their full and fair proportion according to the relative proportion of their numbers in the community they contribute all the mind that actuates the whole machine the fortitude required of them is very different from the unthinking alacrity of the common soldier or common sailor in the face of danger and death it is not a passion it is not an impulse it is not a sentiment it is a cool steady deliberate principle always present always equablehaving no connection with angertempering honor with prudenceincited invigorated and sustained by a generous love of fameinformed moderated and directed by an enlarged knowledge of its own great public endsflowing in one blended stream from the opposite sources of the heart and the headcarrying in itself its own commission and proving its title to every other command by the first and most difficult command that of the bosom in which it resides it is a fortitude which unites with the courage of the field the more exalted and refined courage of the councilwhich knows as well to retreat as to advancewhich can conquer as well by delay as by the rapidity of a march or the impetuosity of an attackwhich can be with fabius the black cloud that lowers on the tops of the mountains or with scipio the thunderbolt of warwhich undismayed by false shame can patiently endure the severest trial that a gallant spirit can undergo in the taunts and provocations of the enemy the suspicions the cold respect and mouth honor of those from whom it should meet a cheerful obediencewhich undisturbed by false humanity can calmly assume that most awful moral responsibility of deciding when victory may be too dearly purchased by the loss of a single life and when the safety and glory of their country may demand the certain sacrifice of thousands different stations of command may call for different modifications of this fortitude but the character ought to be the same in all and never in the most palmy state of our martial renown did it shine with brighter lustre than in the present sanguinary and ferocious hostilities wherever the british arms have been carried but in this most arduous and momentous conflict which from its nature should have roused us to new and unexampled efforts i know not how it has been that we have never put forth half the strength which we have exerted in ordinary wars in the fatal battles which have drenched the continent with blood and shaken the system of europe to pieces we have never had any considerable army of a magnitude to be compared to the least of those by which in former times we so gloriously asserted our place as protectors not oppressors at the head of the great commonwealth of europe we have never manfully met the danger in front and when the enemy resigning to us our natural dominion of the ocean and abandoning the defence of his distant possessions to the infernal energy of the destroying principles which he had planted there for the subversion of the neighboring colonies drove forth by one sweeping law of unprecedented despotism his armed multitudes on every side to overwhelm the countries and states which had for centuries stood the firm barriers against the ambition of france we drew back the arm of our military force which had never been more than half raised to oppose him from that time we have been combating only with the other arm of our naval powerthe right arm of england i admitbut which struck almost unresisted with blows that could never reach the heart of the hostile mischief from that time without a single effort to regain those outworks which ever till now we so strenuously maintained as the strong frontier of our own dignity and safety no less than the liberties of europewith but one feeble attempt to succor those brave faithful and numerous allies whom for the first time since the days of our edwards and henrys we now have in the bosom of france itselfwe have been intrenching and fortifying and garrisoning ourselves at home we have been redoubling security on security to protect ourselves from invasion which has now first become to us a serious object of alarm and terror alas the few of us who have protracted life in any measure near to the extreme limits of our short period have been condemned to see strange thingsnew systems of policy new principles and not only new men but what might appear a new species of men i believe that any person who was of age to take a part in public affairs forty years ago if the intermediate space of time were expunged from his memory would hardly credit his senses when he should hear from the highest authority that an army of two hundred thousand men was kept up in this island and that in the neighboring island there were at least fourscore thousand more but when he had recovered from his surprise on being told of this army which has not its parallel what must be his astonishment to be told again that this mighty force was kept up for the mere purpose of an inert and passive defence and that in its far greater part it was disabled by its constitution and very essence from defending us against an enemy by any one preventive stroke or any one operation of active hostility what must his reflections be on learning further that a fleet of five hundred men of war the best appointed and to the full as ably commanded as this country ever had upon the sea was for the greater part employed in carrying on the same system of unenterprising defence what must be the sentiments and feelings of one who remembers the former energy of england when he is given to understand that these two islands with their extensive and everywhere vulnerable coast should be considered as a garrisoned seatown what would such a man what would any man think if the garrison of so strange a fortress should be such and so feebly commanded as never to make a sallyand that contrary to all which has hitherto been seen in war an infinitely inferior army with the shattered relics of an almost annihilated navy illfound and illmanned may with safety besiege this superior garrison and without hazarding the life of a man ruin the place merely by the menaces and false appearances of an attack indeed indeed my dear friend i look upon this matter of our defensive system as much the most important of all considerations at this moment it has oppressed me with many anxious thoughts which more than any bodily distemper have sunk me to the condition in which you know that i am should it please providence to restore to me even the late weak remains of my strength i propose to make this matter the subject of a particular discussion i only mean here to argue that the mode of conducting the war on our part be it good or bad has prevented even the common havoc of war in our population and especially among that class whose duty and privilege of superiority it is to lead the way amidst the perils and slaughter of the field of battle  the other causes which sometimes affect the numbers of the lower classes but which i have shown not to have existed to any such degree during this warpenury cold hunger nakednessdo not easily reach the higher orders of society i do not dread for them the slightest taste of these calamities from the distress and pressure of the war they have much more to dread in that way from the confiscations the rapines the burnings and the massacres that may follow in the train of a peace which shall establish the devastating and depopulating principles and example of the french regicides in security and triumph and dominion in the ordinary course of human affairs any check to population among men in ease and opulence is less to be apprehended from what they may suffer than from what they enjoy peace is more likely to be injurious to them in that respect than war the excesses of delicacy repose and satiety are as unfavorable as the extremes of hardship toil and want to the increase and multiplication of our kind indeed the abuse of the bounties of nature much more surely than any partial privation of them tends to intercept that precious boon of a second and dearer life in our progeny which was bestowed in the first great command to man from the allgracious giver of allwhose name be blessed whether he gives or takes away his hand in every page of his book has written the lesson of moderation our physical wellbeing our moral worth our social happiness our political tranquillity all depend on that control of all our appetites and passions which the ancients designed by the cardinal virtue of temperance  the only real question to our present purpose with regard to the higher classes is how stands the account of their stock as it consists in wealth of every description have the burdens of the war compelled them to curtail any part of their former expenditurewhich i have before observed affords the only standard of estimating property as an object of taxation do they enjoy all the same conveniences the same comforts the same elegancies the same luxuries in the same or in as many different modes as they did before the war  in the last eleven years there have been no less than three solemn inquiries into the finances of the kingdom by three different committees of your house the first was in the year 1786 on that occasion i remember the report of the committee was examined and sifted and bolted to the bran by a gentleman whose keen and powerful talents i have ever admired he thought there was not sufficient evidence to warrant the pleasing representation which the committee had made of our national prosperity he did not believe that our public revenue could continue to be so productive as they had assumed he even went the length of recording his own inferences of doubt in a set of resolutions which now stand upon your journals and perhaps the retrospect on which the report proceeded did not go far enough back to allow any sure and satisfactory average for a ground of solid calculation but what was the event when the next committee sat in 1791 they found that on an average of the last four years their predecessors had fallen short in their estimate of the permanent taxes by more than three hundred and forty thousand pounds a year surely then if i can show that in the produce of those same taxes and more particularly of such as affect articles of luxurious use and consumption the four years of the war have equalled those four years of peace flourishing as they were beyond the most sanguine speculations i may expect to hear no more of the distress occasioned by the war  the additional burdens which have been laid on some of those same articles might reasonably claim some allowance to be made every new advance of the price to the consumer is a new incentive to him to retrench the quantity of his consumption and if upon the whole he pays the same his property computed by the standard of what he voluntarily pays must remain the same but i am willing to forego that fair advantage in the inquiry i am willing that the receipts of the permanent taxes which existed before january 1793 should be compared during the war and during the period of peace which i have mentioned i will go further complete accounts of the year 1791 were separately laid before your house i am ready to stand by a comparison of the produce of four years up to the beginning of the year 1792 with that of the war of the year immediately previous to hostilities i have not been able to obtain any perfect documents but i have seen enough to satisfy me that although a comparison including that year might be less favorable yet it would not essentially injure my argument  you will always bear in mind my dear sir that i am not considering whether if the common enemy of the quiet of europe had not forced us to take up arms in our own defence the springtide of our prosperity might not have flowed higher than the mark at which it now stands that consideration is connected with the question of the justice and the necessity of the war it is a question which i have long since discussed i am now endeavoring to ascertain whether there exists in fact any such necessity as we hear every day asserted to furnish a miserable pretext for counselling us to surrender at discretion our conquests our honor our dignity our very independence and with it all that is dear to man it will be more than sufficient for that purpose if i can make it appear that we have been stationary during the war what then will be said if in reality it shall be proved that there is every indication of increased and increasing wealth not only poured into the grand reservoir of the national capital but diffused through all the channels of all the higher classes and giving life and activity as it passes to the agriculture the manufactures the commerce and the navigation of the country  the finance committee which has been appointed in this session has already made two reports every conclusion that i had before drawn as you know from my own observation i have the satisfaction of seeing there confirmed by that great public authority large as was the sum by which the committee of 1791 found the estimate of 1786 to have been exceeded in the actual produce of four years of peace their own estimate has been exceeded during the war by a sum more than one third larger the same taxes have yielded more than half a million beyond their calculation they yielded this notwithstanding the stoppage of the distilleries against which you may remember i privately remonstrated with an allowance for that defalcation they have yielded sixty thousand pounds annually above the actual average of the preceding four years of peace i believe this to have been without parallel in all former wars if regard be had to the great and unavoidable burdens of the present war i am confident of the fact  but let us descend to particulars the taxes which go by the general name of assessed taxes comprehend the whole or nearly the whole domestic establishment of the rich they include some things which belong to the middling and even to all but the very lowest classes they now consist of the duties on houses and windows on male servants horses and carriages they did also extend to cottages to female servants wagons and carts used in husbandry previous to the year 1792when with more enlightened policy at the moment that the possibility of war could not be out of the contemplation of any statesman the wisdom of parliament confined them to their present objects i shall give the gross assessment for five years as i find it in the appendix to the second report of your committee  1791 ending 5th april 1792  £1706334 1792                  1793   1585991 1793                  1794   1597623 1794                  1795   1608196 1795                  1796   1625874  here will be seen a gradual increase during the whole progress of the war and if i am correctly informed the rise in the last year after every deduction that can be made affords the most consoling and encouraging prospect it is enormously out of all proportion  there are some other taxes which seem to have a reference to the same general head the present minister many years ago subjected bricks and tiles to a duty under the excise it is of little consequence to our present consideration whether these materials have been employed in building more commodious more elegant and more magnificent habitations or in enlarging decorating and remodelling those which sufficed for our plainer ancestors during the first two years of the war they paid so largely to the public revenue that in 1794 a new duty was laid upon them which was equal to one half of the old and which has produced upwards of 165000l in the last three years yet notwithstanding the pressure of this additional weight40 there has been an actual augmentation in the consumption the only two other articles which come under this description are the stampduty on gold and silver plate and the customs on glass plates this latter is now i believe the single instance of costly furniture to be found in the catalogue of our imports if it were wholly to vanish i should not think we were ruined both the duties have risen during the war very considerably in proportion to the total of their produce  we have no tax among us on the most necessary articles of food the receipts of our customhouse under the head of groceries afford us however some means of calculating our luxuries of the table the articles of tea coffee and cocoanuts i would propose to omit and to take them instead from the excise as best showing what is consumed at home upon this principle adding them all together with the exception of sugar for a reason which i shall afterwards mention i find that they have produced in one mode of comparison upwards of 272000l and in the other mode upwards of 165000l more during the war than in peace41 an additional duty was also laid in 1795 on tea another on coffee and a third on raisinsan article together with currants of much more extensive use than would readily be imagined the balance in favor of our argument would have been much enhanced if our coffee and fruit ships from the mediterranean had arrived last year at their usual season they do not appear in these accounts this was one consequence arising would to god that none more afflicting to italy to europe and the whole civilized world had arisen from our impolitic and precipitate desertion of that important maritime station as to sugar42 i have excluded it from the groceries because the account of the customs is not a perfect criterion of the consumption much having been reëxported to the north of europe which used to be supplied by france and in the official papers which i have followed there are no materials to furnish grounds for computing this reëxportation the increase on the face of our entries is immense during the four years of warlittle short of thirteen hundred thousand pounds  the increase of the duties on beer has been regularly progressive or nearly so to a very large amount43 it is a good deal above a million and is more than equal to one eighth of the whole produce under this general head some other liquors are includedcider perry and mead as well as vinegar and verjuice but these are of very trifling consideration the excise duties on wine having sunk a little during the first two years of the war were rapidly recovering their level again in 1795 a heavy additional duty was imposed upon them and a second in the following year yet being compared with four years of peace to 1790 they actually exhibit a small gain to the revenue and low as the importation may seem in 1796 when contrasted with any year since the french treaty in 1787 it is still more than 3000 tuns above the average importation for three years previous to that period i have added sweets from which our factitious wines are made and i would have added spirits but that the total alteration of the duties in 1789 and the recent interruption of our distilleries rendered any comparison impracticable  the ancient staple of our island in which we are clothed is very imperfectly to be traced on the books of the customhouse but i know that our woollen manufactures flourish i recollect to have seen that fact very fully established last year from the registers kept in the west riding of yorkshire this year in the west of england i received a similar account on the authority of a respectable clothier in that quarter whose testimony can less be questioned because in his political opinions he is adverse as i understand to the continuance of the war the principal articles of female dress for some time past have been muslins and calicoes44 these elegant fabrics of our own looms in the east which serve for the remittance of our own revenues have lately been imitated at home with improving success by the ingenious and enterprising manufacturers of manchester paisley and glasgow at the same time the importation from bengal has kept pace with the extension of our own dexterity and industry while the sale of our printed goods45 of both kinds has been with equal steadiness advanced by the taste and execution of our designers and artists our woollens and cottons it is true are not all for the home market they do not distinctly prove what is my present point our own wealth by our own expense i admit it we export them in great and growing quantities and they who croak themselves hoarse about the decay of our trade may put as much of this account as they choose to the creditor side of money received from other countries in payment for british skill and labor they may settle the items to their own liking where all goes to demonstrate our riches i shall be contented here with whatever they will have the goodness to leave me and pass to another entry which is less ambiguousi mean that of silk46 the manufactory itself is a forced plant we have been obliged to guard it from foreign competition by very strict prohibitory laws what we import is the raw and prepared material which is worked up in various ways and worn in various shapes by both sexes after what we have just seen you will probably be surprised to learn that the quantity of silk imported during the war has been much greater than it was previously in peace and yet we must all remember to our mortification that several of our silk ships fell a prey to citizen admiral richery you will hardly expect me to go through the tape and thread and all the other small wares of haberdashery and millinery to be gleaned up among our imports but i shall make one observation and with great satisfaction respecting them they gradually diminish as our own manufactures of the same description spread into their places while the account of ornamental articles which our country does not produce and we cannot wish it to produce continues upon the whole to rise in spite of all the caprices of fancy and fashion of this kind are the different furs47 used for muffs trimmings and linings which as the chief of the kind i shall particularize you will find them below  the diversions of the higher classes form another and the only remaining head of inquiry into their expenses i mean those diversions which distinguish the country and the town lifewhich are visible and tangible to the statesmanwhich have some public measure and standard and here when i look to the report of your committee i for the first time perceive a failure it is clearly so whichever way i reckon the four years of peace the old tax on the sports of the field has certainly proved deficient since the war the same money however or nearly the same has been paid to governmentthough the same number of individuals have not contributed to the payment an additional tax was laid in 1791 and during the war has produced upwards of 61000l which is about 4000l more than the decrease of the old tax in one scheme of comparison and about 4000l less in the other scheme i might remark that the amount of the new tax in the several years of the war by no means bears the proportion which it ought to the old there seems to be some great irregularity or other in the receipt but i do not think it worth while to examine into the argument i am willing to suppose that many who in the idleness of peace made war upon partridges hares and pheasants may now carry more noble arms against the enemies of their country our political adversaries may do what they please with that concession they are welcome to make the most of it i am sure of a very handsome setoff in the other branch of expensethe amusements of a town life  there is much gayety and dissipation and profusion which must escape and disappoint all the arithmetic of political economy but the theatres are a prominent feature they are established through every part of the kingdom at a cost unknown till our days there is hardly a provincial capital which does not possess or which does not aspire to possess a theatreroyal most of them engage for a short time at a vast price every actor or actress of name in the metropolis a distinction which in the reign of my old friend garrick was confined to very few the dresses the scenes the decorations of every kind i am told are in a new style of splendor and magnificence whether to the advantage of our dramatic taste upon the whole i very much doubt it is a show and a spectacle not a play that is exhibited this is undoubtedly in the genuine manner of the augustan age but in a manner which was censured by one of the best poets and critics of that or any age              migravit ab aure voluptas     omnis ad incertos oculos et gaudia vana     quatuor aut plures aulæa premuntur in horas     dum fugiunt equitum turmæ peditumque catervæ  i must interrupt the passage most fervently to deprecate and abominate the sequel      mox trahitur manibus regum fortuna retortis  i hope that no french fraternization which the relations of peace and amity with systematized regicide would assuredly sooner or later draw after them even if it should overturn our happy constitution itself could so change the hearts of englishmen as to make them delight in representations and processions which have no other merit than that of degrading and insulting the name of royalty but good taste manners morals religion all fly wherever the principles of jacobinism enter and we have no safety against them but in arms  the proprietors whether in this they follow or lead what is called the town to furnish out these gaudy and pompous entertainments must collect so much more from the public it was but just before the breaking out of hostilities that they levied for themselves the very tax which at the close of the american war they represented to lord north as certain ruin to their affairs to demand for the state the example has since been imitated by the managers of our italian opera once during the war if not twice i would not willingly misstate anything but i am not very accurate on these subjects they have raised the price of their subscription yet i have never heard that any lasting dissatisfaction has been manifested or that their houses have been unusually and constantly thin on the contrary all the three theatres have been repeatedly altered and refitted and enlarged to make them capacious of the crowds that nightly flock to them and one of those huge and lofty piles which lifts its broad shoulders in gigantic pride almost emulous of the temples of god has been reared from the foundation at a charge of more than fourscore thousand pounds and yet remains a naked rough unsightly heap  i am afraid my dear sir that i have tired you with these dull though important details but we are upon a subject which like some of a higher nature refuses ornament and is contented with conveying instruction i know too the obstinacy of unbelief in those perverted minds which have no delight but in contemplating the supposed distress and predicting the immediate ruin of their country these birds of evil presage at all times have grated our ears with their melancholy song and by some strange fatality or other it has generally happened that they have poured forth their loudest and deepest lamentations at the periods of our most abundant prosperity very early in my public life i had occasion to make myself a little acquainted with their natural history my first political tract in the collection which a friend has made of my publications is an answer to a very gloomy picture of the state of the nation which was thought to have been drawn by a statesman of some eminence in his time that was no more than the common spleen of disappointed ambition in the present day i fear that too many are actuated by a more malignant and dangerous spirit they hope by depressing our minds with a despair of our means and resources to drive us trembling and unresisting into the toils of our enemies with whom from the beginning of the revolution in france they have ever moved in strict concert and coöperation if with the report of your finance committee in their hands they can still affect to despond and can still succeed as they do in spreading the contagion of their pretended fears among welldisposed though weak men there is no way of counteracting them but by fixing them down to particulars nor must we forget that they are unwearied agitators bold assertors dexterous sophisters proof must be accumulated upon proof to silence them with this view i shall now direct your attention to some other striking and unerring indications of our flourishing condition and they will in general be derived from other sources but equally authentic from other reports and proceedings of both houses of parliament all which unite with wonderful force of consent in the same general result hitherto we have seen the superfluity of our capital discovering itself only in procuring superfluous accommodation and enjoyment in our houses in our furniture in our establishments in our eating and drinking our clothing and our public diversions we shall now see it more beneficially employed in improving our territory itself we shall see part of our present opulence with provident care put out to usury for posterity  to what ultimate extent it may be wise or practicable to push inclosures of common and waste lands may be a question of doubt in some points of view but no person thinks them already carried to excess and the relative magnitude of the sums laid out upon them gives us a standard of estimating the comparative situation of the landed interest your house this session appointed a committee on waste lands and they have made a report by their chairman an honorable baronet for whom the minister the other day with very good intentions i believe but with little real profit to the public thought fit to erect a board of agriculture the account as it stands there appears sufficiently favorable the greatest number of inclosing bills passed in any one year of the last peace does not equal the smallest annual number in the war and those of the last year exceed by more than one half the highest year of peace but what was my surprise on looking into the late report of the secret committee of the lords to find a list of these bills during the war differing in every year and48 larger on the whole by nearly one third i have checked this account by the statutebook and find it to be correct what new brilliancy then does it throw over the prospect bright as it was before the number during the last four years has more than doubled that of the four years immediately preceding it has surpassed the five years of peace beyond which the lords committees have not gone it has even surpassed i have verified the fact the whole ten years of peace i cannot stop here i cannot advance a single step in this inquiry without being obliged to cast my eyes back to the period when i first knew the country these bills which had begun in the reign of queen anne had passed every year in greater or less numbers from the year 1723 yet in all that space of time they had not reached the amount of any two years during the present war and though soon after that time they rapidly increased still at the accession of his present majesty they were far short of the number passed in the four years of hostilities  in my first letter i mentioned the state of our inland navigation neglected as it had been from the reign of king william to the time of my observation it was not till the present reign that the duke of bridgewaters canal first excited a spirit of speculation and adventure in this way this spirit showed itself but necessarily made no great progress in the american war when peace was restored it began of course to work with more sensible effect yet in ten years from that event the bills passed on that subject were not so many as from the year 1793 to the present session of parliament from what i can trace on the statutebook i am confident that all the capital expended in these projects during the peace bore no degree of proportion i doubt on very grave consideration whether all that was ever so expended was equal to the money which has been raised for the same purposes since the war49 i know that in the last four years of peace when they rose regularly and rapidly the sums specified in the acts were not near one third of the subsequent amount in the last session of parliament the grand junction company as it is called having sunk half a million of which i feel the good effects at my own door applied to your house for permission to subscribe half as much more among themselves this grand junction is an inosculation of the grand trunk and in the present session the latter company has obtained the authority of parliament to float two hundred acres of land for the purpose of forming a reservoir thirty feet deep two hundred yards wide at the head and two miles in length a lake which may almost vie with that which once fed the now obliterated canal of languedoc  the present war is above all others of which we have heard or read a war against landed property that description of property is in its nature the firm base of every stable governmentand has been so considered by all the wisest writers of the old philosophy from the time of the stagyrite who observes that the agricultural class of all others is the least inclined to sedition we find it to have been so regarded in the practical politics of antiquity where they are brought more directly homo to our understandings and bosoms in the history of borne and above all in the writings of cicero the country tribes were always thought more respectable than those of the city and if in our own history there is any one circumstance to which under god are to be attributed the steady resistance the fortunate issue and sober settlement of all our struggles for liberty it is that while the landed interest instead of forming a separate body as in other countries has at all times been in close connection and union with the other great interests of the country it has been spontaneously allowed to lead and direct and moderate all the rest i cannot therefore but see with singular gratification that during a war which has been eminently made for the destruction of the lauded proprietors as well as of priests and kings as much has been done by public works for the permanent benefit of their stake in this country as in all the rest of the current century which now touches to its close perhaps after this it may not be necessary to refer to private observation but i am satisfied that in general the rents of lands have been considerably increased they are increased very considerably indeed if i may draw any conclusion from my own little property of that kind i am not ignorant however where our public burdens are most galling but all of this class will consider who they are that are principally menacedhow little the men of their description in other countries where this revolutionary fury has but touched have been found equal to their own protectionhow tardy and unprovided and full of anguish is their flight chained down as they are by every tie to the soilhow helpless they are above all other men in exile in poverty in need in all the varieties of wretchedness and then let them well weigh what are the burdens to which they ought not to submit for their own salvation  many of the authorities which i have already adduced or to which i have referred may convey a competent notion of some of our principal manufactures their general state will be clear from that of our external and internal commerce through which they circulate and of which they are at once the cause and effect but the communication of the several parts of the kingdom with each other and with foreign countries has always been regarded as one of the most certain tests to evince the prosperous or adverse state of our trade in all its branches recourse has usually been had to the revenue of the postoffice with this view i shall include the product of the tax which was laid in the last war and which will make the evidence more conclusive if it shall afford the same inference i allude to the posthorse duty which shows the personal intercourse within the kingdom as the postoffice shows the intercourse by letters both within and without the first of these standards then exhibits an increase according to my former schemes of comparison from an eleventh to a twentieth part of the whole duty50 the postoffice gives still less consolation to those who are miserable in proportion as the country feels no misery from the commencement of the war to the month of april 1796 the gross produce had increased by nearly one sixth of the whole sum which the state now derives from that fund i find that the year ending 5th of april 1793 gave 627592l and the year ending at the same quarter in 1796 750637l after a fair deduction having been made for the alteration which you know on grounds of policy i never approved in your privilege of franking i have seen no formal document subsequent to that period but i have been credibly informed there is very good ground to believe that the revenue of the postoffice51 still continues to be regularly and largely upon the rise  what is the true inference to be drawn from the annual number of bankruptcies has been the occasion of much dispute on one side it has been confidently urged as a sure symptom of a decaying trade on the other side it has been insisted that it is a circumstance attendant upon a thriving trade for that the greater is the whole quantity of trade the greater of course must be the positive number of failures while the aggregate success is still in the same proportion in truth the increase of the number may arise from either of those causes but all must agree in one conclusionthat if the number diminishes and at the same time every other sort of evidence tends to show an augmentation of trade there can be no better indication we have already had very ample means of gathering that the year 1796 was a very favorable year of trade and in that year the number of bankruptcies was at least one fifth below the usual average i take this from the declaration of the lord chancellor in the house of lords52 he professed to speak from the records of chancery and he added another very striking factthat on the property actually paid into his court a very small part indeed of the whole property of the kingdom there had accrued in that year a net surplus of eight hundred thousand pounds which was so much new capital  but the real situation of our trade during the whole of this war deserves more minute investigation i shall begin with that which though the least in consequence makes perhaps the most impression on our senses because it meets our eyes in our daily walks i mean our retail trade the exuberant display of wealth in our shops was the sight which most amazed a learned foreigner of distinction who lately resided among us his expression i remember was that they seemed to be bursting with opulence into the streets the documents which throw light on this subject are not many but they all meet in the same point all concur in exhibiting an increase the most material are the general licenses53 which the law requires to be taken out by all dealers in excisable commodities these seem to be subject to considerable fluctuations they have not been so low in any year of the war as in the years 1788 and 1789 nor ever so high in peace as in the first year of the war i should next state the licenses to dealers in spirits and wine but the change in them which took place in 1789 would give an unfair advantage to my argument i shall therefore content myself with remarking that from the date of that change the spirit licenses kept nearly the same level till the stoppage of the distilleries in 1795 if they dropped a little and it was but little the wine licenses during the same time more than countervailed that loss to the revenue and it is remarkable with regard to the latter that in the year 1796 which was the lowest in the excise duties on wine itself as well as in the quantity imported more dealers in wine appear to have been licensed than in any former year excepting the first year of the war this fact may raise some doubt whether the consumption has been lessened so much as i believe is commonly imagined the only other retailtraders whom i found so entered as to admit of being selected are teadealers and sellers of gold and silver plate both of whom seem to have multiplied very much in proportion to their aggregate number54 i have kept apart one set of licensed sellers because i am aware that our antagonists may be inclined to triumph a little when i name auctioneers and auctions they may be disposed to consider it as a sort of trade which thrives by the distress of others but if they will look at it a little more attentively they will find their gloomy comfort vanish the public income from these licenses has risen with very great regularity through a series of years which all must admit to have been years of prosperity it is remarkable too that in the year 1793 which was the great year of bankruptcies these duties on auctioneers and auctions55 fell below the mark of 1791 and in 1796 which year had one fifth less than the accustomed average of bankruptcies they mounted at once beyond all former examples in concluding this general head will you permit me my dear sir to bring to your notice an humble but industrious and laborious set of chapmen against whom the vengeance of your house has sometimes been levelled with what policy i need not stay to inquire as they have escaped without much injury the hawkers and peddlers56 i am assured are still doing well though from some new arrangements respecting them made in 1789 it would be difficult to trace their proceedings in any satisfactory manner  when such is the vigor of our traffic in its minutest ramifications we may be persuaded that the root and the trunk are sound when we see the lifeblood of the state circulate so freely through the capillary vessels of the system we scarcely need inquire if the heart performs its functions aright but let us approach it let us lay it bare and watch the systole and diastole as it now receives and now pours forth the vital stream through all the members the port of london has always supplied the main evidence of the state of our commerce i know that amidst all the difficulties and embarrassments of the year 1793 from causes unconnected with and prior to the war the tonnage of ships in the thames actually rose but i shall not go through a detail of official papers on this point there is evidence which has appeared this very session before your house infinitely more forcible and impressive to my apprehension than all the journals and ledgers of all the inspectorsgeneral from the days of davenant it is such as cannot carry with it any sort of fallacy it comes not from one set but from many opposite sets of witnesses who all agree in nothing else witnesses of the gravest and most unexceptionable character and who confirm what they say in the surest manner by their conduct two different bills have been brought in for improving the port of london i have it from very good intelligence that when the project was first suggested from necessity there were no less than eight different plans supported by eight different bodies of subscribers the cost of the least was estimated at two hundred thousand pounds and of the most extensive at twelve hundred thousand the two between which the contest now lies substantially agree as all the others must have done in the motives and reasons of the preamble but i shall confine myself to that bill which is proposed on the part of the mayor aldermen and common council because i regard them as the best authority and their language in itself is fuller and more precise i certainly see them complain of the great delays accidents damages losses and extraordinary expenses which are almost continually sustained to the hindrance and discouragement of commerce and the great injury of the public revenue but what are the causes to which they attribute their complaints the first is that from the very great and progressive increase of the number and size of ships and other vessels trading to the port of london the river thames in and near the said port is in general so much crowded with shipping lighters and other craft that the navigation of a considerable part of the river is thereby rendered tedious and dangerous and there is great want of room in the said port for the safe and convenient mooring of vessels and constant access to them the second is of the same nature it is the want of regulations and arrangements never before found necessary for expedition and facility the third is of another kind but to the same effect that the legal quays are too confined and there is not sufficient accommodation for the landing and shipping of cargoes and the fourth and last is still different they describe the avenues to the legal quays which little more than a century since the great fire of london opened and dilated beyond the measure of our then circumstances to be now incommodious and much too narrow for the great concourse of carts and other carriages usually passing and repassing therein thus our trade has grown too big for the ancient limits of art and nature our streets our lanes our shores the river itself which has so long been our pride are impeded and obstructed and choked up by our riches they are like our shops bursting with opulence to these misfortunes to these distresses and grievances alone we are told it is to be imputed that still more of our capital has not been pushed into the channel of our commerce to roll back in its reflux still more abundant capital and fructify the national treasury in its course indeed my dear sir when i have before my eyes this consentient testimony of the corporation of the city of london the west india merchants and all the other merchants who promoted the other plans struggling and contending which of them shall be permitted to lay out their money in consonance with their testimony i cannot turn aside to examine what one or two violent petitions tumultuously voted by real or pretended liverymen of london may have said of the utter destruction and annihilation of trade  this opens a subject on which every true lover of his country and at this crisis every friend to the liberties of europe and of social order in every country must dwell and expatiate with delight i mean to wind up all my proofs of our astonishing and almost incredible prosperity with the valuable information given to the secret committee of the lords by the inspectorgeneral and here i am happy that i can administer an antidote to all despondence from the same dispensary from which the first dose of poison was supposed to have come the report of that committee is generally believed to have derived much benefit from the labors of the same noble lord who was said as the author of the pamphlet of 1795 to have led the way in teaching us to place all our hope on that very experiment which he afterwards declared in his place to have been from the beginning utterly without hope we have now his authority to say that as far as our resources were concerned the experiment was equally without necessity  it appears as the committee has very justly and satisfactorily observed by the accounts of the value of the imports and exports for the last twenty years produced by mr irving inspectorgeneral of imports and exports that the demands for cash to be sent abroad which by the way including the loan to the emperor was nearly one third less sent to the continent of europe than in the seven years war  was greatly compensated by a very large balance of commerce in favor of this kingdomgreater than was ever known in any preceding period the value of the exports of the last year amounted according to the valuation on which the accounts of the inspectorgeneral are founded to 30424184l which is more than double what it was in any year of the american war and one third more than it was on an average during the last peace previous to the year 1792 and though the value of the imports to this country has during the same period greatly increased the excess of the value of the exports above that of the imports which constitutes the balance of trade has augmented even in a greater proportion these observations might perhaps be branched out into other points of view but i shall leave them to your own active and ingenious mind there is another and still more important light in which the inspectorgenerals information may be seenand that is as affording a comparison of some circumstances in this war with the commercial history of all our other wars in the present century  in all former hostilities our exports gradually declined in value and then with one single exception ascended again till they reached and passed the level of the preceding peace but this was a work of time sometimes more sometimes less slow in queen annes war which began in 1702 it was an interval of ten years before this was effected nine years only were necessary in the war of 1739 for the same operation the seven years war saw the period much shortened hostilities began in 1755 and in 1758 the fourth year of the war the exports mounted above the peacemark there was however a distinguishing feature of that warthat our tonnage to the very last moment was in a state of great depression while our commerce was chiefly carried on by foreign vessels the american war was darkened with singular and peculiar adversity our exports never came near to their peaceful elevation and our tonnage continued with very little fluctuation to subside lower and lower57 on the other hand the present war with regard to our commerce has the white mark of as singular felicity if from internal causes as well as the consequence of hostilities the tide ebbed in 1793 it rushed back again with a bore in the following year and from that time has continued to swell and run every successive year higher and higher into all our ports the value of our exports last year above the year 1792 the mere increase of our commerce during the war is equal to the average value of all the exports during the wars of william and anne  it has been already pointed out that our imports have not kept pace with our exports of course on the face of the account the balance of trade both positively and comparatively considered must have been much more than ever in our favor in that early little tract of mine to which i have already more than once referred i made many observations on the usual method of computing that balance as well as the usual objection to it that the entries at the customhouse were not always true as you probably remember them i shall not repeat them here on the one hand i am not surprised that the same trite objection is perpetually renewed by the detractors of our national affluence and on the other hand i am gratified in perceiving that the balance of trade seems to be now computed in a manner much clearer than it used to be from those errors which i formerly noticed the inspectorgeneral appears to have made his estimate with every possible guard and caution his opinion is entitled to the greatest respect it was in substance i shall again use the words of the report as much better than my own that the true balance of our trade amounted on a medium of the four years preceding january 1796 to upwards of 650000l per annum exclusive of the profits arising from our east and west india trade which he estimates at upwards of 4000000l per annum exclusive of the profits derived from our fisheries so that including the fisheries and making a moderate allowance for the exceedings which mr irving himself supposes beyond his calculation without reckoning what the public creditors themselves pay to themselves and without taking one shilling from the stock of the landed interest our colonies our oriental possessions our skill and industry our commerce and navigation at the commencement of this year were pouring a new annual capital into the kingdom hardly half a million short of the whole interest of that tremendous debt from which we are taught to shrink in dismay as from an overwhelming and intolerable oppression  if then the real state of this nation is such as i have described and i am only apprehensive that you may think i have taken too much pains to exclude all doubt on this questionif no class is lessened in its numbers or in its stock or in its conveniences or even its luxuriesif they build as many habitations and as elegant and as commodious as ever and furnish them with every chargeable decoration and every prodigality of ingenious invention that can be thought of by those who even incumber their necessities with superfluous accommodationif they are as numerously attendedif their equipages are as splendidif they regale at table with as much or more variety of plenty than everif they are clad in as expensive and changeful a diversity according to their tastes and modesif they are not deterred from the pleasures of the field by the charges which government has wisely turned from the culture to the sports of the fieldif the theatres are as rich and as well filled and greater and at a higher price than everand what is more important than all if it is plain from the treasures which are spread over the soil or confided to the winds and the seas that there are as many who are indulgent to their propensities of parsimony as others to their voluptuous desires and that the pecuniary capital grows instead of diminishingon what ground are we authorized to say that a nation gambolling in an ocean of superfluity is undone by want with what face can we pretend that they who have not denied any one gratification to any one appetite have a right to plead poverty in order to famish their virtues and to put their duties on short allowance that they are to take the law from an imperious enemy and can contribute no longer to the honor of their king to the support of the independence of their country to the salvation of that europe which if it falls must crush them with its gigantic ruins how can they affect to sweat and stagger and groan under their burdens to whom the mines of newfoundland richer than those of mexico and peru are now thrown in as a makeweight in the scale of their exorbitant opulence what excuse can they have to faint and creep and cringe and prostrate themselves at the footstool of ambition and crime who during a short though violent struggle which they have never supported with the energy of men have amassed more to their annual accumulation than all the wellhusbanded capital that enabled their ancestors by long and doubtful and obstinate conflicts to defend and liberate and vindicate the civilized world but i do not accuse the people of england as to the great majority of the nation they have done whatever in their several ranks and conditions and descriptions was required of them by their relative situations in society and from those the great mass of mankind cannot depart without the subversion of all public order they look up to that government which they obey that they may be protected they ask to be led and directed by those rulers whom providence and the laws of their country have set over them and under their guidance to walk in the ways of safety and honor they have again delegated the greatest trust which they have to bestow to those faithful representatives who made their true voice heard against the disturbers and destroyers of europe they suffered with unapproving acquiescence solicitations which they had in no shape desired to an unjust and usurping power whom they had never provoked and whose hostile menaces they did not dread when the exigencies of the public service could only be met by their voluntary zeal they started forth with an ardor which outstripped the wishes of those who had injured them by doubting whether it might not be necessary to have recourse to compulsion they have in all things reposed an enduring but not an unreflecting confidence that confidence demands a full return and fixes a responsibility on the ministers entire and undivided the people stands acquitted if the war is not carried on in a manner suited to its objects if the public honor is tarnished if the public safety suffers any detriment the ministers not the people are to answer it and they alone its armies its navies are given to them without stint or restriction its treasures are poured out at their feet its constancy is ready to second all their efforts they are not to fear a responsibility for acts of manly adventure the responsibility which they are to dread is lest they should show themselves unequal to the expectation of a brave people the more doubtful may be the constitutional and economical questions upon which they have received so marked a support the more loudly they are called upon to support this great war for the success of which their country is willing to supersede considerations of no slight importance where i speak of responsibility i do not mean to exclude that species of it which the legal powers of the country have a right finally to exact from those who abuse a public trust but high as this is there is a responsibility which attaches on them from which the whole legitimate power of the kingdom cannot absolve them there is a responsibility to conscience and to glory a responsibility to the existing world and to that posterity which men of their eminence cannot avoid for glory or for shamea responsibility to a tribunal at which not only ministers but kings and parliaments but even nations themselves must one day answer  footnotes  37 the archduke charles of austria  38 dec 27 1790  39
