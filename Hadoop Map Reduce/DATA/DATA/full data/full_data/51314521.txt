commons  on  the affairs of india  june 25 1783     ninth report      from the select committee of the house of commons appointed     to take into consideration the state of the administration of     justice in the provinces of bengal bahar and orissa and to     report the same as it shall appear to them to the house     with their observations thereupon and who were instructed to     consider how the british possessions in the east indies may     be held and governed with the greatest security and advantage     to this country and by what means the happiness of the     native inhabitants may be best promoted   iobservations on the state of the companys affairs in india   in order to enable the house to adopt the most proper means for regulating the british government in india and for promoting the happiness of the natives who live under its authority or influence your committee hold it expedient to collect into distinct points of view the circumstances by which that government appears to them to be most essentially disordered and to explain fully the principles of policy and the course of conduct by which the natives of all ranks and orders have been reduced to their present state of depression and misery  your committee have endeavored to perform this task in plain and popular language knowing that nothing has alienated the house from inquiries absolutely necessary for the performance of one of the most essential of all its duties so much as the technical language of the companys records as the indian names of persons of offices of the tenure and qualities of estates and of all the varied branches of their intricate revenue this language is indeed of necessary use in the executive departments of the companys affairs but it is not necessary to parliament a language so foreign from all the ideas and habits of the far greater part of the members of this house has a tendency to disgust them with all sorts of inquiry concerning this subject they are fatigued into such a despair of ever obtaining a competent knowledge of the transactions in india that they are easily persuaded to remand them back to that obscurity mystery and intrigue out of which they have been forced upon public notice by the calamities arising from their extreme mismanagement this mismanagement has itself as your committee conceive in a great measure arisen from dark cabals and secret suggestions to persons in power without a regular public inquiry into the good or evil tendency of any measure or into the merit or demerit of any person intrusted with the companys concerns  sidenote present laws relating to the east india company and internal and external policy  the plan adopted by your committee is first to consider the law regulating the east india company as it now standsand secondly to inquire into the circumstances of the two great links of connection by which the territorial possessions in india are united to this kingdom namely the companys commerce and the government exercised under the charter and under acts of parliament the last first of these objects the commerce is taken in two points of view the external or the direct trade between india and europe and the internal that is to say the trade of bengal in all the articles of produce and manufacture which furnish the companys investment  the government is considered by your committee under the like descriptions of internal and external the internal regards the communication between the court of directors and their servants in india the management of the revenue the expenditure of public money the civil administration the administration of justice and the state of the army the external regards first the conduct and maxims of the companys government with respect to the native princes and people dependent on the british authorityand next the proceedings with regard to those native powers which are wholly independent of the company but your committees observations on the last division extend to those matters only which are not comprehended in the report of the committee of secrecy under these heads your committee refer to the most leading particulars of abuse which prevail in the administration of indiadeviating only from this order where the abuses are of a complicated nature and where one cannot be well considered independently of several others  sidenote second attempt made by parliament for a reformation  your committee observe that this is the second attempt made by parliament for the reformation of abuses in the companys government it appears therefore to them a necessary preliminary to this second undertaking to consider the causes which in their opinion have produced the failure of the firstthat the defects of the original plan may be supplied its errors corrected and such useful regulations as were then adopted may be further explained enlarged and enforced  sidenote proceedings of session 1773  the first design of this kind was formed in the session of the year 1773 in that year parliament taking up the consideration of the affairs of india through two of its committees collected a very great body of details concerning the interior economy of the companys possessions and concerning many particulars of abuse which prevailed at the time when those committees made their ample and instructive reports but it does not appear that the body of regulations enacted in that year that is in the east india act of the thirteenth of his majestys reign were altogether grounded on that information but were adopted rather on probable speculations and general ideas of good policy and good government new establishments civil and judicial were therefore formed at a very great expense and with much complexity of constitution checks and counterchecks of all kinds were contrived in the execution as well as in the formation of this system in which all the existing authorities of this kingdom had a share for parliament appointed the members of the presiding part of the new establishment the crown appointed the judicial and the company preserved the nomination of the other officers so that if the act has not fully answered its purposes the failure cannot be attributed to any want of officers of every description or to the deficiency of any mode of patronage in their appointment the cause must be sought elsewhere  sidenote powers and objects of act of 1773 and the effects thereof  the act had in its view independently of several detached regulations five fundamental objects  1st the reformation of the court of proprietors of the east india company  2ndly a new model of the court of directors and an enforcement of their authority over the servants abroad  3rdly the establishment of a court of justice capable of protecting the natives from the oppressions of british subjects  4thly the establishment of a general council to be seated in bengal whose authority should in many particulars extend over all the british settlements in india  5thly to furnish the ministers of the crown with constant information concerning the whole of the companys correspondence with india in order that they might be enabled to inspect the conduct of the directors and servants and to watch over the execution of all parts of the act that they might be furnished with matter to lay before parliament from time to time according as the state of things should render regulation or animadversion necessary  sidenote court of proprietors  sidenote new qualification  the first object of the policy of this act was to improve the constitution of the court of proprietors in this case as in almost all the rest the remedy was not applied directly to the disease the complaint was that factions in the court of proprietors had shown in several instances a disposition to support the servants of the company against the just coercion and legal prosecution of the directors instead of applying a corrective to the distemper a change was proposed in the constitution by this reform it was presumed that an interest would arise in the general court more independent in itself and more connected with the commercial prosperity of the company under the new constitution no proprietor not possessed of a thousand pounds capital stock was permitted to vote in the general court before the act five hundred pounds was a sufficient qualification for one vote and no value gave more but as the lower classes were disabled the power was increased in the higher proprietors of three thousand pounds were allowed two votes those of six thousand were entitled to three ten thousand pounds was made the qualification for four the votes were thus regulated in the scale and gradation of property on this scale and on some provisions to prevent occasional qualifications and splitting of votes the whole reformation rested  sidenote the ballot  sidenote indian interest  several essential points however seem to have been omitted or misunderstood no regulation was made to abolish the pernicious custom of voting by ballot by means of which acts of the highest concern to the company and to the state might be done by individuals with perfect impunity and even the body itself might be subjected to a forfeiture of all its privileges for defaults of persons who so far from being under control could not be so much as known in any mode of legal cognizance nothing was done or attempted to prevent the operation of the interest of delinquent servants of the company in the general court by which they might even come to be their own judges and in effect under another description to become the masters in that body which ought to govern them nor was anything provided to secure the independency of the proprietary body from the various exterior interests by which it might be disturbed and diverted from the conservation of that pecuniary concern which the act laid down as the sole security for preventing a collusion between the general court and the powerful delinquent servants in india the whole of the regulations concerning the court of proprietors relied upon two principles which have often proved fallacious namely that small numbers were a security against faction and disorder and that integrity of conduct would follow the greater property in no case could these principles be less depended upon than in the affairs of the east india company however by wholly cutting off the lower and adding to the power of the higher classes it was supposed that the higher would keep their money in that fund to make profitthat the vote would be a secondary consideration and no more than a guard to the propertyand that therefore any abuse which tended to depreciate the value of their stock would be warmly resented by such proprietors  if the ill effects of every misdemeanor in the companys servants were to be immediate and had a tendency to lower the value of the stock something might justly be expected from the pecuniary security taken by the act but from the then state of things it was more than probable that proceedings ruinous to the permanent interest of the company might commence in great lucrative advantages against this evil large pecuniary interests were rather the reverse of a remedy accordingly the companys servants have ever since covered over the worst oppressions of the people under their government and the most cruel and wanton ravages of all the neighboring countries by holding out and for a time actually realizing additions of revenue to the territorial funds of the company and great quantities of valuable goods to their investment  sidenote proprietors  but this consideration of mere income whatever weight it might have could not be the first object of a proprietor in a body so circumstanced the east india company is not like the bank of england a mere moneyed society for the sole purpose of the preservation or improvement of their capital and therefore every attempt to regulate it upon the same principles must inevitably fail when it is considered that a certain share in the stock gives a share in the government of so vast an empire with such a boundless patronage civil military marine commercial and financial in every department of which such fortunes have been made as could be made nowhere else it is impossible not to perceive that capitals far superior to any qualifications appointed to proprietors or even to directors would readily be laid out for a participation in that power the india proprietor therefore will always be in the first instance a politician and the bolder his enterprise and the more corrupt his views the less will be his consideration of the price to be paid for compassing them the new regulations did not reduce the number so low as not to leave the assembly still liable to all the disorder which might be supposed to arise from multitude but if the principle had been well established and well executed a much greater inconveniency grew out of the reform than that which had attended the old abuse for if tumult and disorder be lessened by reducing the number of proprietors private cabal and intrigue are facilitated at least in an equal degree and it is cabal and corruption rather than disorder and confusion that was most to be dreaded in transacting the affairs of india whilst the votes of the smaller proprietors continued a door was left open for the public sense to enter into that society since that door has been closed the proprietary has become even more than formerly an aggregate of private interests which subsist at the expense of the collective body at the moment of this revolution in the proprietary as it might naturally be expected those who had either no very particular interest in their vote or but a petty object to pursue immediately disqualified but those who were deeply interested in the companys patronage those who were concerned in the supply of ships and of the other innumerable objects required for their immense establishments those who were engaged in contracts with the treasury admiralty and ordnance together with the clerks in public offices found means of securing qualifications at the enlarged standard all these composed a much greater proportion than formerly they had done of the proprietary body  against the great predominant radical corruption of the court of proprietors the raising the qualification proved no sort of remedy the return of the companys servants into europe poured in a constant supply of proprietors whose ability to purchase the highest qualifications for themselves their agents and dependants could not be dubious and this latter description form a very considerable and by far the most active and efficient part of that body to add to the votes which is adding to the power in proportion to the wealth of men whose very offences were supposed to consist in acts which lead to the acquisition of enormous riches appears by no means a wellconsidered method of checking rapacity and oppression in proportion as these interests prevailed the means of cabal of concealment and of corrupt confederacy became far more easy than before accordingly there was no fault with respect to the companys government over its servants charged or chargeable on the general court as it originally stood of which since the reform it has not been notoriously guilty it was not therefore a matter of surprise to your committee that the general court so composed has at length grown to such a degree of contempt both of its duty and of the permanent interest of the whole corporation as to put itself into open defiance of the salutary admonitions of this house given for the purpose of asserting and enforcing the legal authority of their own body over their own servants  the failure in this part of the reform of 1773 is not stated by your committee as recommending a return to the ancient constitution of the company which was nearly as far as the new from containing any principle tending to the prevention or remedy of abusesbut to point out the probable failure of any future regulations which do not apply directly to the grievance but which may be taken up as experiments to ascertain theories of the operation of councils formed of greater or lesser numbers or such as shall be composed of men of more or less opulence or of interests of newer or longer standing or concerning the distribution of power to various descriptions or professions of men or of the election to office by one authority rather than another  sidenote court of directors  the second object of the act was the court of directors under the arrangement of the year 1773 that court appeared to have its authority much strengthened it was made less dependent than formerly upon its constituents the proprietary the duration of the directors in office was rendered more permanent and the tenure itself diversified by a varied and intricate rotation at the same time their authority was held high over their servants of all descriptions and the only rule prescribed to the councilgeneral of bengal in the exercise of the large and illdefined powers given to them was that they were to yield obedience to the orders of the court of directors as to the court of directors itself it was left with very little regulation the custom of ballot infinitely the most mischievous in a body possessed of all the ordinary executive powers was still left and your committee have found the ill effects of this practice in the course of their inquiries nothing was done to oblige the directors to attend to the promotion of their servants according to their rank and merits in judging of those merits nothing was done to bind them to any observation of what appeared on their records nothing was done to compel them to prosecution or complaint where delinquency became visible the act indeed prescribed that no servant of the company abroad should be eligible into the direction until two years after his return to england but as this regulation rather presumes than provides for an inquiry into their conduct a very ordinary neglect in the court of directors might easily defeat it and a short remission might in this particular operate as a total indemnity in fact however the servants have of late seldom attempted a seat in the directionan attempt which might possibly rouse a dormant spirit of inquiry but satisfied with an interest in the proprietary they have through that name brought the direction very much under their own control  as to the general authority of the court of directors there is reason to apprehend that on the whole it was somewhat degraded by the act whose professed purpose was to exalt it and that the only effect of the parliamentary sanction to their orders has been that along with those orders the law of the land has been despised and trampled under foot the directors were not suffered either to nominate or to remove those whom they were empowered to instruct from masters they were reduced to the situation of complainantsa situation the imbecility of which no laws or regulations could wholly alter and when the directors were afterwards restored in some degree to their ancient power on the expiration of the lease given to their principal servants it became impossible for them to recover any degree of their ancient respect even if they had not in the mean time been so modelled as to be entirely free from all ambition of that sort  from that period the orders of the court of directors became to be so habitually despised by their servants abroad and at length to be so little regarded even by themselves that this contempt of orders forms almost the whole subjectmatter of the voluminous reports of two of your committees if any doubt however remains concerning the cause of this fatal decline of the authority of the court of directors no doubt whatsoever can remain of the fact itself nor of the total failure of one of the great leading regulations of the act of 1773  sidenote supreme court of judicature  the third object was a new judicial arrangement the chief purpose of which was to form a strong and solid security for the natives against the wrongs and oppressions of british subjects resident in bengal an operose and expensive establishment of a supreme court was made and charged upon the revenues of the country the charter of justice was by the act left to the crown as well as the appointment of the magistrates the defect in the institution seemed to be thisthat no rule was laid down either in the act or the charter by which the court was to judge no descriptions of offenders or species of delinquency were properly ascertained according to the nature of the place or to the prevalent mode of abuse provision was made for the administration of justice in the remotest part of hindostan as if it were a province in great britain your committee have long had the constitution and conduct of this court before them and they have not yet been able to discover very few instances not one that appears to them of leading importance of relief given to the natives against the corruptions or oppressions of british subjects in powerthough they do find one very strong and marked instance of the judges having employed an unwarrantable extension or application of the municipal law of england to destroy a person of the highest rank among those natives whom they were sent to protect one circumstance rendered the proceeding in this case fatal to all the good purposes for which the court had been established the sufferer the rajah nundcomar appears at the very time of this extraordinary prosecution a discoverer of some particulars of illicit gain then charged upon mr hastings the governorgeneral although in ordinary cases and in some lesser instances of grievance it is very probable that this court has done its duty and has been as every court must be of some service yet one example of this kind must do more towards deterring the natives from complaint and consequently from the means of redress than many decisions favorable to them in the ordinary course of proceeding can do for their encouragement and relief so far as your committee has been able to discover the court has been generally terrible to the natives and has distracted the government of the company without substantially reforming any one of its abuses  this court which in its constitution seems not to have had sufficiently in view the necessities of the people for whose relief it was intended and was or thought itself bound in some instances to too strict an adherence to the forms and rules of english practice in others was framed upon principles perhaps too remote from the constitution of english tribunals by the usual course of english practice the far greater part of the redress to be obtained against oppressions of power is by process in the nature of civil actions in these a trial by jury is a necessary part with regard to the finding the offence and to the assessment of the damages both these were in the charter of justice left entirely to the judges it was presumed and not wholly without reason that the british subjects were liable to fall into factions and combinations in order to support themselves in the abuses of an authority of which every man might in his turn become a sharer and with regard to the natives it was presumed perhaps a little too hastily that they were not capable of sharing in the functions of jurors but it was not foreseen that the judges were also liable to be engaged in the factions of the settlementand if they should ever happen to be so engaged that the native people were then without that remedy which obviously lay in the chance that the court and jury though both liable to bias might not easily unite in the same identical act of injustice your committee on full inquiry are of opinion that the use of juries is neither impracticable nor dangerous in bengal  your committee refer to their report made in the year 1781 for the manner in which this court attempting to extend its jurisdiction and falling with extreme severity on the native magistrates a violent contest arose between the english judges and the english civil authority this authority calling in the military arm by a most dangerous example overpowered and for a while suspended the functions of the court but at length those functions which were suspended by the quarrel of the parties were destroyed by their reconciliation and by the arrangements made in consequence of it by these the court was virtually annihilated or if substantially it exists it is to be apprehended it exists only for purposes very different from those of its institution  the fourth object of the act of 1773 was the councilgeneral this institution was intended to produce uniformity consistency and the effective coöperation of all the settlements in their common defence by the ancient constitution of the companys foreign settlements they were each of them under the orders of a president or chief and a council more or fewer according to the discretion of the company among those parliament probably on account of the largeness of the territorial acquisitions rather than the conveniency of the situation chose bengal for the residence of the controlling power and dissolving the presidency appointed a new establishment upon a plan somewhat similar to that which had prevailed before but the number was smaller this establishment was composed of a governorgeneral and four counsellors all named in the act of parliament they were to hold their offices for five years after which term the patronage was to revert to the court of directors in the mean time such vacancies as should happen were to be filled by that court with the concurrence of the crown the first governorgeneral and one of the counsellors had been old servants of the company the others were new men  on this new arrangement the courts of proprietors and directors considered the details of commerce as not perfectly consistent with the enlarged sphere of duty and the reduced number of the council therefore to relieve them from this burden they instituted a new office called the board of trade for the subordinate management of their commercial concerns and appointed eleven of the senior servants to fill the commission  sidenote object of powers to governorgeneral and council  the powers given by the act to the new governorgeneral and council had for their direct object the kingdom of bengal and its dependencies within that sphere and it is not a small one their authority extended over all the companys concerns of whatever description in matters of peace and war it seems to have been meant that the other presidencies should be subordinate to their board but the law is loose and defective where it professes to restrain the subordinate presidencies from making war without the consent and approbation of the supreme council they are left free to act without it in cases of imminent necessity or where they shall have received special orders from the company the first exception leaves it open to the subordinate to judge of the necessity of measures which when taken bind or involve the superior the second refers a question of peace or war to two jurisdictions which may give different judgments in both instances cases in point have occurred1 with regard to their local administration their powers were exceedingly and dangerously loose and undetermined their powers were not given directly but in words of reference in which neither the objects related to nor the mode of the relation were sufficiently expressed their legislative and executive capacities were not so accurately drawn and marked by such strong and penal lines of distinction as to keep these capacities separate where legislative and merely executive powers were lodged in the same hands the legislative which is the larger and the more ready for all occasions was constantly resorted to the governorgeneral and council therefore immediately gave constructions to their illdefined authority which rendered it perfectly despoticconstructions which if they were allowed no action of theirs ought to be regarded as criminal  armed as they were with an authority in itself so ample and by abuse so capable of an unlimited extent very few and these very insufficient correctives were administered ample salaries were provided for them which indeed removed the necessity but by no means the inducements to corruption and oppression nor was any barrier whatsoever opposed on the part of the natives against their injustice except the supreme court of judicature which never could be capable of controlling a government with such powers without becoming such a government itself  there was indeed a prohibition against all concerns in trade to the whole council and against all taking of presents by any in authority a right of prosecution in the kings bench was also established but it was a right the exercise of which is difficult and in many and those the most weighty cases impracticable no considerable facilities were given to prosecution in parliament nothing was done to prevent complaint from being far more dangerous to the sufferer than injustice to the oppressor no overt acts were fixed upon which corruption should be presumed in transactions of which secrecy and collusion formed the very basis no rules of evidence nor authentic mode of transmission were settled in conformity to the unalterable circumstances of the country and the people  sidenote removal of servants  one provision indeed was made for restraining the servants in itself very wise and substantial a delinquent once dismissed could not be restored but by the votes of three fourths of the directors and three fourths of the proprietors this was well aimed but no method was settled for bringing delinquents to the question of removal and if they should be brought to it a door lay wide open for evasion of the law and for a return into the service in defiance of its plain intentionthat is by resigning to avoid removal by which measure this provision of the act has proved as unoperative as all the rest by this management a mere majority may bring in the greater delinquent whilst the person removed for offences comparatively trivial may remain excluded forever  sidenote councilgeneral  the new council nominated in the act was composed of two totally discordant elements which soon distinguished themselves into permanent parties one of the principal instructions which the three members of the council sent immediately from england namely general clavering colonel monson and mr francis carried out with them was to cause the strictest inquiry to be made into all oppressions and abuses among which the practice of receiving presents from the natives at that time generally charged upon men in power was principally aimed at  presents to any considerable value were justly reputed by the legislature not as marks of attention and respect but as bribes or extortions for which either the beneficial and gratuitous duties of government were sold or they were the price paid for acts of partiality or finally they were sums of money extorted from the givers by the terrors of power against the system of presents therefore the new commission was in general opinion particularly pointed in the commencement of reformation at a period when a rapacious conquest had overpowered and succeeded to a corrupt government an act of indemnity might have been thought advisable perhaps a new account ought to have been opened all retrospect ought to have been forbidden at least to certain periods if this had not been thought advisable none in the higher departments of a suspected and decried government ought to have been kept in their posts until an examination had rendered their proceedings clear or until length of time had obliterated by an even course of irreproachable conduct the errors which so naturally grow out of a new power but the policy adopted was different it was to begin with examples the cry against the abuses was strong and vehement throughout the whole nation and the practice of presents was represented to be as general as it was mischievous in such a case indeed in any case it seemed not to be a measure the most provident without a great deal of previous inquiry to place two persons who from their situation must be the most exposed to such imputations in the commission which was to inquire into their own conductmuch less to place one of them at the head of that commission and with a casting vote in case of an equality the persons who could not be liable to that charge were indeed three to two but any accidental difference of opinion the death of any one of them or his occasional absence or sickness threw the whole power into the hands of the other two who were mr hastings and mr barwell one the president and the other high in the council of that establishment on which the reform was to operate thus those who were liable to process as delinquents were in effect set over the reformers and that did actually happen which might be expected to happen from so preposterous an arrangement a stop was soon put to all inquiries into the capital abuses  nor was the great political end proposed in the formation of a superintending council over all the presidencies better answered than that of an inquiry into corruptions and abuses the several presidencies have acted in a great degree upon their own separate authority and as little of unity concert or regular system has appeared in their conduct as was ever known before this institution india is indeed so vast a country and the settlements are so divided that their intercourse with each other is liable to as many delays and difficulties as the intercourse between distant and separate states but one evil may possibly have arisen from an attempt to produce an union which though undoubtedly to be aimed at is opposed in some degree by the unalterable nature of their situationthat it has taught the servants rather to look to a superior among themselves than to their common superiors this evil growing out of the abuse of the principle of subordination can only be corrected by a very strict enforcement of authority over that part of the chain of dependence which is next to the original power  sidenote powers given to the ministers of the crown  that which your committee considers as the fifth and last of the capital objects of the act and as the binding regulation of the whole is the introduction then for the first time of the ministers of the crown into the affairs of the company the state claiming a concern and share of property in the companys profits the servants of the crown were presumed the more likely to preserve with a scrupulous attention the sources of the great revenues which they were to administer and for the rise and fall of which they were to render an account  the interference of government was introduced by this act in two ways one by a control in effect by a share in the appointment to vacancies in the supreme council the act provided that his majestys approbation should be had to the persons named to that duty partaking thus in the patronage of the company administration was bound to an attention to the characters and capacities of the persons employed in that high trust the other part of their interference was by way of inspection by this right of inspection everything in the companys correspondence from india which related to the civil or military affairs and government of the company was directed by the act to be within fourteen days after the receipt laid before the secretary of state and everything that related to the management of the revenues was to be laid before the commissioners of the treasury in fact both description of these papers have been generally communicated to that board  sidenote defects in the plan  it appears to your committee that there were great and material defects in both parts of the plan with regard to the approbation of persons nominated to the supreme council by the court of directors no sufficient means were provided for carrying to his majesty along with the nomination the particulars in the conduct of those who had been in the service before which might render them proper objects of approbation or rejection the india house possesses an office of record capable of furnishing in almost all cases materials for judging on the behavior of the servants in their progress from the lowest to the highest stations and the whole discipline of the service civil and military must depend upon an examination of these records inseparably attending every application for an appointment to the highest stations but in the present state of the nomination the ministers of the crown are not furnished with the proper means of exercising the power of control intended by the law even if they were scrupulously attentive to the use of it there are modes of proceeding favorable to neglect others excite inquiry and stimulate to vigilance  sidenote proposition to remedy them  your committee therefore are of opinion that for the future prevention of cabal and of private and partial representation whether above or below that whenever any person who has been in the service shall be recommended to the kings ministers to fill a vacancy in the councilgeneral the secretary of the court of directors shall be ordered to make a strict search into the records of the company and shall annex to the recommendation the reasons of the court of directors for their choice together with a faithful copy of whatever shall be found if anything can be found relative to his character and conductas also an account of his standing in the companys service the time of his abode in india the reasons for his return and the stations whether civil or military in which he has been successively placed  with this account ought to be transmitted the names of those who were proposed as candidates for the same office with the correspondent particulars relative to their conduct and situation for not only the separate but the comparative merit probably would and certainly ought to have great influence in the approbation or rejection of the party presented to the ministers of the crown these papers should be laid before the commissioners of the treasury and one of the secretaries of state and entered in books to be kept in the treasury and the secretarys office  sidenote appointment of counsellors c  sidenote macphersons appointment  sidenote stabless  these precautions in case of the nomination of any who have served the company appear to be necessary from the improper nomination and approbation of mr john macpherson notwithstanding the objections which stood against him on the companys records the choice of mr john stables from an inferior military to the highest civil capacity was by no means proper nor an encouraging example to either service his conduct indeed in the subaltern military situation had received and seems to have deserved commendation but no sufficient ground was furnished for confounding the lines and gradations of service this measure was however far less exceptionable than the former because an irregular choice of a less competent person and the preference given to proved delinquency in prejudice to uncensured service are very different things but even this latter appointment would in all likelihood have been avoided if rules of promotion had been established if such rules were settled candidates qualified from ability knowledge and service would not be discouraged by finding that everything was open to every man and that favor alone stood in the place of civil or military experience the elevation from the lowest stations unfaithfully and negligently filled to the highest trusts the total inattention to rank and seniority and much more the combination of this neglect of rank with a confusion unaccompanied with strong and evident reasons of the lines of service cannot operate as useful examples on those who serve the public in india these servants beholding men who have been condemned for improper behavior to the company in inferior civil stations elevated above them or what is less blamable but still mischievous persons without any distinguished civil talents taken from the subordinate situations of another line to their prejudice will despair by any good behavior of ascending to the dignities of their own they will be led to improve to the utmost advantage of their fortune the lower stages of power and will endeavor to make up in lucre what they can never hope to acquire in station  the temporary appointment by parliament of the supreme council of india arose from an opinion that the company at that time at least was not in a condition or not disposed to a proper exercise of the privileges which they held under their charter it therefore behoved the directors to be particularly attentive to their choice of counsellors on the expiration of the period during which their patronage had been suspended the duties of the supreme council had been reputed of so arduous a nature as to require even a legislative interposition they were called upon by all possible care and impartiality to justify parliament at least as fully in the restoration of their privileges as the circumstances of the time had done in their suspension  but interests have lately prevailed in the court of directors which by the violation of every rule seemed to be resolved on the destruction of those privileges of which they were the natural guardians every new power given has been made the source of a new abuse and the acts of parliament themselves which provide but imperfectly for the prevention of the mischief have it is to be feared made provisions contrary without doubt to the intention of the legislature which operate against the possibility of any cure in the ordinary course  in the original institution of the supreme council reasons may have existed against rendering the tenure of the counsellors in their office precarious a plan of reform might have required the permanence of the persons who were just appointed by parliament to execute it but the act of 1780 gave a duration coexistent with the statute itself to a council not appointed by act of parliament nor chosen for any temporary or special purpose by which means the servants in the highest situation let their conduct be never so grossly criminal cannot be removed unless the court of directors and ministers of the crown can be found to concur in the same opinion of it the prevalence of the indian factions in the court of directors and court of proprietors and sometimes in the state itself renders this agreement extremely difficult if the principal members of the direction should be in a conspiracy with any principal servant under censure it will be impracticable because the first act must originate there the reduced state of the authority of this kingdom in bengal may be traced in a great measure to that very natural source of independence in many cases the instant removal of an offender from his power of doing mischief is the only mode of preventing the utter and perhaps irretrievable ruin of public affairs in such a case the process ought to be simple and the power absolute in one or in either hand separately by contriving the balance of interests formed in the act notorious offence gross error or palpable insufficiency have many chances of retaining and abusing authority whilst the variety of representations hearings and conferences and possibly the mere jealousy and competition between rival powers may prevent any decision and at length give time and means for settlements and compromises among parties made at the expense of justice and true policy but this act of 1780 not properly distinguishing judicial process from executive arrangements requires in effect nearly the same degree of solemnity delay and detail for removing a political inconvenience which attends a criminal proceeding for the punishment of offences it goes further and gives the same tenure to all who shall succeed to vacancies which was given to those whom the act found in office  sidenote provisional appointment for vacancies  another regulation was made in the act which has a tendency to render the control of delinquency or the removal of incapacity in the councilgeneral extremely difficult as well as to introduce many other abuses into the original appointment of counsellors the inconveniences of a vacancy in that important office at a great distance from the authority that is to fill it were visible but your committee have doubts whether they balance the mischief which may arise from the power given in this act of a provisional appointment to vacancies not on the event but on foresight this mode of providing for the succession has a tendency to promote cabal and to prevent inquiry into the qualifications of the persons to be appointed an attempt has been actually made in consequence of this power in a very marked manner to confound the whole order and discipline of the companys service means are furnished thereby for perpetuating the powers of some given court of directors they may forestall the patronage of their successors on whom they entail a line of supreme counsellors and governorsgeneral and if the exercise of this power should happen in its outset to fall into bad hands the ordinary chances for mending an ill choice upon death or resignation are cut off  in these provisional arrangements it is to be considered that the appointment is not in consequence of any marked event which calls strongly on the attention of the public but is made at the discretion of those who lead in the court of directors and may therefore be brought forward at times the most favorable to the views of partiality and corruption candidates have not therefore the notice that may be necessary for their claims and as the possession of the office to which the survivors are to succeed seems remote all inquiry into the qualifications and character of those who are to fill it will naturally be dull and languid  your committee are not also without a grounded apprehension of the ill effect on any existing councilgeneral of all strong marks of influence and favor which appear in the subordinates of bengal this previous designation to a great and arduous trust the greatest that can be reposed in subjects when made out of any regular course of succession marks that degree of countenance and support at home which may overshadow the existing government that government may thereby be disturbed by factions and led to corrupt and dangerous compliances at best when these counsellors elect are engaged in no fixed employment and have no lawful intermediate emolument the natural impatience for their situations may bring on a traffic for resignations between them and the persons in possession very unfavorable to the interests of the public and to the duty of their situations  since the act two persons have been nominated to the ministers of the crown by the court of directors for this succession neither has yet been approved but by the description of the persons a judgment may be formed of the principles on which this power is likely to be exercised  sidenote stuart and sulivans appointment to succeed to vacancies  your committee find that in consequence of the abovementioned act the honorable charles stuart and mr sulivan were appointed to succeed to the first vacancies in the supreme council mr stuarts first appointment in the companys service was in the year 1761 he returned to england in 1775 and was permitted to go back to india in 1780 in august 1781 he was nominated by the court of directors mr sulivan and sir william james were chairman and deputychairman to succeed to the first vacancy in the supreme council and on the 19th of september following his majestys approval of such nomination was requested  sidenote mr stuarts situation at the time of his appointment  in the nomination of mr stuart the consideration of rank in the service was not neglected but if the court of directors had thought fit to examine their records they would have found matter at least strongly urging them to a suspension of this appointment until the charges against mr stuart should be fully cleared up that matter remained as it still remains unexplained from the month of may 1775 where on the bengal revenue consultations of the 12th of that month peculations to a large amount are charged upon oath against mr stuart under the following title the particulars of the money unjustly taken by mr stuart during the time he was at burdwan the sum charged against him in this account is 217684 sicca rupees that is 25253l sterling besides which there is another account with the following title the particulars of the money unjustly taken by callypersaud bose banian to the honorable charles stuart esquire at burdwan and amounting to sicca rupees 101675 that is 11785la large sum to be received by a person in that subordinate situation  the minuteness with which these accounts appear to have been kept and the precision with which the date of each particular sometimes of very small sums is stated give them the appearance of authenticity as far as it can be conveyed on the face or in the construction of such accounts and if they were forgeries laid them open to an easy detection but no detection is easy when no inquiry is made it appears an offence of the highest order in the directors concerned in this business when not satisfied with leaving such charges so long unexamined they should venture to present to the kings servants the object of them for the highest trust which they have to bestow if mr stuart was really guilty the possession of this post must furnish him not only with the means of renewing the former evil practices charged upon him and of executing them upon a still larger scale but of oppressing those unhappy persons who under the supposed protection of the faith of the company had appeared to give evidence concerning his former misdemeanors  this attempt in the directors was the more surprising when it is considered that two committees of this house were at that very time sitting upon an inquiry that related directly to their conduct and that of their servants in india  sidenote mr sulivans situation at the time of his appointment  it was in the same spirit of defiance of parliament that at the same time they nominated mr sulivan son to the then chairman of the court of directors to the succession to the same high trust in india on these appointments your committee thought it proper to make those inquiries which the court of directors thought proper to omit they first conceived it fitting to inquire what rank mr sulivan bore in the service and they thought it not unnecessary here to state the gradations in the service according to the established usage of the company  the companys civil servants generally go to india as writers in which capacity they serve the company five years the next step in point of rank is to be a factor and next to that a junior merchant in each of which capacities they serve the company three years they then rise to the rank of senior merchant in which situation they remain till called by rotation to the board of trade until the passing of the regulation act in 1773 seniority entitled them to succeed to the council and finally gave them pretensions to the government of the presidency  the above gradation of the service your committee conceive ought never to be superseded by the court of directors without evident reason in persons or circumstances to justify the breach of an ancient order the names whether taken from civil or commercial gradation are of no moment the order itself is wisely established and tends to provide a natural guard against partiality precipitancy and corruption in patronage it affords means and opportunities for an examination into character and among the servants it secures a strong motive to preserve a fair reputation your committee find that no respect whatsoever was paid to this gradation in the instance of mr sulivan nor is there any reason assigned for departing from it they do not find that mr sulivan had ever served the company in any one of the above capacities but was in the year 1777 abruptly brought into the service and sent to madras to succeed as persian translator and secretary to the council  your committee have found a letter from mr sulivan to george wombwell and william devaynes esquires chairman and deputychairman of the court of directors stating that he trusted his applications would have a place in their deliberations when madras affairs were taken up of what nature those applications were your committee cannot discover as no traces of them appear on the companys recordsnor whether any proofs of his ability even as persian translator which might entitle him to a preference to the many servants in india whose study and opportunities afforded them the means of becoming perfect masters of that language  on the above letter your committee find that the committee of correspondence proceeded and on their recommendation the court of directors unanimously approved of mr sulivan to be appointed to succeed to the posts of secretary and persian translator  sidenote mr sulivans succession of offices  conformably to the orders of the court mr sulivan succeeded to those posts and the president and council acquainted the court of directors that they had been obeyed about five months after it appears that mr sulivan thought fit to resign the office of persian translator to which he had been appointed by the directors in april 1780 mr sulivan is commended for his great diligence as secretary in august following he obtains leave to accompany mrs sulivan to bengal whence she is to proceed to europe on account of her health and he is charged with a commission from the president and council of fort st george to obtain for that settlement supplies of grain troops and money from the governorgeneral and council of bengal in october the governorgeneral requests permission of the council there to employ mr sulivan as his assistant for that he had experienced between his arrival in bengal and that time the abilities of mr sulivan and made choice of him as completely qualified for that trust also requests the board to appoint him judgeadvocategeneral and likewise to apply to the presidency of madras for him to remain in bengal without prejudice to his rank on their establishment which several requests the board at madras readily complied with notwithstanding their natural sensibility to the loss of a secretary of such ability and diligence as they had described mr sulivan to be  on the 5th of december following the president and council received a letter from bengal requesting that mr sulivan might be allowed to keep his rank this request brought on some discussion a mr freeman it seems who had acted under mr sulivan as subsecretary whilst his principal obtained so much praise for his diligence addressed the board on the same day and observed that since mr sulivans arrival he mr freeman had without intermission done almost the whole of the duty allotted to the post of secretary which it was notorious mr sulivan had paid but little attention to and neither his inclination or duty led him to act any longer as mr sulivans deputy  here your committee cannot avoid remarking the direct contradiction which this address of mr freemans gives to the letter from the president and council to the court of directors in april 1780 wherein mr sulivan is praised for his diligence and attention in his office of secretary  the president and council do not show any displeasure at mr freemans representation so contrary to their own the truth of which they thus tacitly admit but agree to write to the governorgeneral and council that it could not be supposed that they could carry on the public business for any length of time without the services of a secretary and clerk of appeals two offices that required personal attendance and which would be a general injury to the servants on their establishment and in particular to the person who acted in those capacities as they learnt that mr sulivan had been appointed judgeadvocategeneral in bengaland to request the governorgeneral and council to inform mr sulivan of their sentiments and to desire him to inform them whether he meant to return to his station or to remain in bengal  on the 5th december as a mark of their approbation of mr freeman who had so plainly contradicted their opinion of mr sulivan the president and council agree to appoint him to act as secretary and clerk of appeals till mr sulivans answer should arrive with the emoluments and to confirm him therein if mr sulivan should remain in bengal  on the 14th february 1781 the president and council received a letter from bengal in reply and stating their request that mr sulivan might reserve the right of returning to his original situation on the madras establishment if the court of directors should disapprove of his being transferred to bengal to this request the board at madras declare they have no objection and here the matter rests the court of directors not having given any tokens of approbation or disapprobation of the transaction  such is the history of mr sulivans service from the time of his appointment such were the qualifications and such the proofs of assiduity and diligence given by him in holding so many incompatible offices as well as being engaged in other dealings which will appear in their place when after three years desultory residence in india he was thought worthy to be nominated to the succession to the supreme council no proof whatsoever of distinguished capacity in any line preceded his original appointment to the service so that the whole of his fitness for the supreme council rested upon his conduct and character since his appointment as persian translator  your committee find that his majesty has not yet given his approbation to the nomination made by the court of directors on the 30th of august 1781 of messrs stuart and sulivan to succeed to the supreme council on the first vacancies though the court applied for the royal approbation so long ago as the 19th of september 1781 and in these instances the kings ministers performed their duty in withholding their countenance from a proceeding so exceptionable and of so dangerous an example  your committee from a full view of the situation and duties of the court of directors are of opinion that effectual means ought to be taken for regulating that court in such a manner as to prevent either rivalship with or subserviency to their servants it might therefore be proper for the house to consider whether it is fit that those who are or have been within some given time directors of the company should be capable of an appointment to any offices in india directors can never properly govern those for whose employments they are or may be themselves candidates they can neither protect nor coerce them with due impartiality or due authority  if such rules as are stated by your committee under this head were observed in the regular service at home and abroad the necessity of superseding the regular service by strangers would be more rare and whenever the servants were so superseded those who put forward other candidates would be obliged to produce a strong plea of merit and ability which in the judgment of mankind ought to overpower pretensions so authentically established and so rigorously guarded from abuse  sidenote deficiency of powers to ministers of government  the second object in this part of the plan of the act of 1773 namely that of inspection by the ministers of the crown appears not to have been provided for so as to draw the timely and productive attention of the state on the grievances of the people of india and on the abuses of its government by the regulating act the ministers were enabled to inspect one part of the correspondence that which was received in england but not that which went outward they might know something but that very imperfectly and unsystematically of the state of affairs but they were neither authorized to advance nor to retard any measure taken by the directors in consequence of that state they were not provided even with sufficient means of knowing what any of these measures were and this imperfect information together with the want of a direct call to any specific duty might have in some degree occasioned that remissness which rendered even the imperfect powers originally given by the act of 1773 the less efficient this defect was in a great measure remedied by a subsequent act but that act was not passed until the year 1780  sidenote disorders increased since 1773  your committee find that during the whole period which elapsed from 1773 to the commencement of 1782 disorders and abuses of every kind multiplied wars contrary to policy and contrary to public faith were carrying on in various parts of india the allies dependants and subjects of the company were everywhere oppressed2 dissensions in the supreme council prevailed and continued for the greater part of that time the contests between the civil and judicial powers threatened that issue to which they came at last an armed resistance to the authority of the kings court of justice the orders which by an act of parliament the servants were bound to obey were avowedly and on principle contemned until at length the fatal effects of accumulated misdemeanors abroad and neglects at home broke out in the alarming manner which your committee have so fully reported to this house3  sidenote proceedings in india not known to parliament  in all this time the true state of the several presidencies and the real conduct of the british government towards the natives was not at all known to parliament it seems to have been very imperfectly known even to ministers indeed it required an unbroken attention and much comparison of facts and reasonings to form a true judgment on that difficult and complicated system of politics revenue and commerce whilst affairs were only in their progress to that state which produced the present inquiries therefore whilst the causes of their ruin were in the height of their operation both the company and the natives were understood by the public as in circumstances the most assured and most flourishing insomuch that whenever the affairs of india were brought before parliament as they were two or three times during that period the only subjectmatter of discussion anywise important was concerning the sums which might be taken out of the companys surplus profits for the advantage of the state little was thought of but the disengagement of the company from their debts in england and to prevent the servants abroad from drawing upon them so as that body might be enabled without exciting clamors here to afford the contribution that was demanded all descriptions of persons either here or in india looking solely to appearances at home the reputation of the directors depended on the keeping the companys sales in a situation to support the dividend that of the ministers depended on the most lucrative bargains for the exchequer and that of the servants abroad on the largest investments until at length there is great reason to apprehend that unless some very substantial reform takes place in the management of the companys affairs nothing will be left for investment for dividend or for bargain and india instead of a resource to the public may itself come in no great length of time to be reckoned amongst the public burdens  sidenote inspection of ministers has failed in effect  in this manner the inspection of the ministers of the crown the great cementing regulation of the whole act of 1773 has along with all the others entirely failed in its effect  sidenote failure in the act  your committee in observing on the failure of this act do not consider the intrinsic defects or mistakes in the law itself as the sole cause of its miscarriage the general policy of the nation with regard to this object has been they conceive erroneous and no remedy by laws under the prevalence of that policy can be effectual before any remedial law can have its just operation the affairs of india must be restored to their natural order the prosperity of the natives must be previously secured before any profit from them whatsoever is attempted for as long as a system prevails which regards the transmission of great wealth to this country either for the company or the state as its principal end so long will it be impossible that those who are the instruments of that scheme should not be actuated by the same spirit for their own private purposes it will be worse they will support the injuries done to the natives for their selfish ends by new injuries done in favor of those before whom they are to account it is not reasonably to be expected that a public rapacious and improvident should be served by any of its subordinates with disinterestedness or foresight   iiconnection of great britain with india  in order to open more fully the tendency of the policy which has hitherto prevailed and that the house may be enabled in any regulations which may be made to follow the tracks of the abuse and to apply an appropriated remedy to a particular distemper your committee think it expedient to consider in some detail the manner in which india is connected with this kingdomwhich is the second head of their plan  the two great links by which this connection is maintained are first the east india companys commerce and next the government set over the natives by that company and by the crown the first of these principles of connection namely the east india companys trade is to be first considered not only as it operates by itself but as having a powerful influence over the general policy and the particular measures of the companys government your committee apprehend that the present state nature and tendency of this trade are not generally understood  sidenote trade to india formerly carried on chiefly in silver  until the acquisition of great territorial revenues by the east india company the trade with india was carried on upon the common principles of commercenamely by sending out such commodities as found a demand in the india market and where that demand was not adequate to the reciprocal call of the european market for indian goods by a large annual exportation of treasure chiefly in silver in some years that export has been as high as six hundred and eighty thousand pounds sterling the other european companies trading to india traded thither on the same footing their export of bullion was probably larger in proportion to the total of their commerce as their commerce itself bore a much larger proportion to the british than it does at this time or has done for many years past but stating it to be equal to the british the whole of the silver sent annually from europe into hindostan could not fall very short of twelve or thirteen hundred thousand pounds a year this influx of money poured into india by an emulation of all the commercial nations of europe encouraged industry and promoted cultivation in a high degree notwithstanding the frequent wars with which that country was harassed and the vices which existed in its internal government on the other hand the export of so much silver was sometimes a subject of grudging and uneasiness in europe and a commerce carried on through such a medium to many appeared in speculation of doubtful advantage but the practical demands of commerce bore down those speculative objections the east india commodities were so essential for animating all other branches of trade and for completing the commercial circle that all nations contended for it with the greatest avidity the english company flourished under this exportation for a very long series of years the nation was considerably benefited both in trade and in revenue and the dividends of the proprietors were often high and always sufficient to keep up the credit of the companys stock in heart and vigor  sidenote how trade carried on since  but at or very soon after the acquisition of the territorial revenues to the english company the period of which may be reckoned as completed about the year 1765 a very great revolution took place in commerce as well as in dominion and it was a revolution which affected the trade of hindostan with all other european nations as well as with that in whose favor and by whose power it was accomplished from that time bullion was no longer regularly exported by the english east india company to bengal or any part of hindostan and it was soon exported in much smaller quantities by any other nation a new way of supplying the market of europe by means of the british power and influence was invented a species of trade if such it may be called by which it is absolutely impossible that india should not be radically and irretrievably ruined although our possessions there were to be ordered and governed upon principles diametrically opposite to those which now prevail in the system and practice of the british companys administration  sidenote investments  a certain portion of the revenues of bengal has been for many years set apart to be employed in the purchase of goods for exportation to england and this is called the investment the greatness of this investment has been the standard by which the merit of the companys principal servants has been too generally estimated and this main cause of the impoverishment of india has been generally taken as a measure of its wealth and prosperity numerous fleets of large ships loaded with the most valuable commodities of the east annually arriving in england in a constant and increasing succession imposed upon the public eye and naturally gave rise to an opinion of the happy condition and growing opulence of a country whose surplus productions occupied so vast a space in the commercial world this export from india seemed to imply also a reciprocal supply by which the trading capital employed in those productions was continually strengthened and enlarged but the payment of a tribute and not a beneficial commerce to that country wore this specious and delusive appearance  sidenote increase of expenses  the fame of a great territorial revenue exaggerated as is usual in such cases beyond even its value and the abundant fortunes of the companys officers military and civil which flowed into europe with a full tide raised in the proprietors of east india stock a premature desire of partaking with their servants in the fruits of that splendid adventure government also thought they could not be too early in their claims for a share of what they considered themselves as entitled to in every foreign acquisition made by the power of this kingdom through whatever hands or by whatever means it was made these two parties after some struggle came to an agreement to divide between them the profits which their speculation proposed to realize in england from the territorial revenue in bengal about two hundred thousand pounds was added to the annual dividends of the proprietors four hundred thousand was given to the state which added to the old dividend brought a constant charge upon the mixed interest of indian trade and revenue of eight hundred thousand pounds a year this was to be provided for at all events  by that vast demand on the territorial fund the correctives and qualifications which might have been gradually applied to the abuses in indian commerce and government were rendered extremely difficult  sidenote progress of investments  the practice of an investment from the revenue began in the year 1766 before arrangements were made for securing and appropriating an assured fund for that purpose in the treasury and for diffusing it from thence upon the manufactures of the country in a just proportion and in the proper season there was indeed for a short time a surplus of cash in the treasury it was in some shape to be sent home to its owners to send it out in silver was subject to two manifest inconveniences first the country would be exhausted of its circulating medium a scarcity of coin was already felt in bengal cossim ali khân the nabob whom the companys servants had lately set up and newly expelled during the short period of his power had exhausted the country by every mode of extortion in his flight he carried off an immense treasure which has been variously computed but by none at less than three millions sterling a country so exhausted of its coin and harassed by three revolutions rapidly succeeding each other was rather an object that stood in need of every kind of refreshment and recruit than one which could subsist under new evacuations the next and equally obvious inconvenience was to the company itself to send silver into europe would be to send it from the best to the worst market when arrived the most profitable use which could be made of it would be to send it back to bengal for the purchase of indian merchandise it was necessary therefore to turn the companys revenue into its commerce the first investment was about five hundred thousand pounds and care was taken afterwards to enlarge it in the years 1767 and 1768 it arose to seven hundred thousand  sidenote consequences of them  this new system of trade carried on through the medium of power and public revenue very soon produced its natural effects the loudest complaints arose among the natives and among all the foreigners who traded to bengal it must unquestionably have thrown the whole mercantile system of the country into the greatest confusion with regard to the natives no expedient was proposed for their relief the case was serious with respect to european powers the presidency plainly represented to the directors that some agreement should be made with foreign nations for providing their investment to a certain amount or that the deficiencies then subsisting must terminate in an open rupture with france the directors pressed by the large payments in england were not free to abandon their system and all possible means of diverting the manufactures into the companys investment were still anxiously sought and pursued until the difficulties of the foreign companies were at length removed by the natural flow of the fortunes of the companys servants into europe in the manner which will be stated hereafter  but with all these endeavors of the presidency the investment sunk in 1769 and they were even obliged to pay for a part of the goods to private merchants in the companys bonds bearing interest it was plain that this course of business could not hold the manufacturers of bengal far from being generally in a condition to give credit have always required advances to be made to them so have the merchants very generallyat least since the prevalence of the english power in india it was necessary therefore and so the presidency of calcutta represented the matter to provide beforehand a years advance this required great efforts and they were made notwithstanding the famine in 1770 which wasted bengal in a manner dreadful beyond all example the investment by a variety of successive expedients many of them of the most dangerous nature and tendency was forcibly kept up and even in that forced and unnatural state it gathered strength almost every year the debts contracted in the infancy of the system were gradually reduced and the advances to contractors and manufacturers were regularly made so that the goods from bengal purchased from the territorial revenues from the sale of european goods and from the produce of the monopolies for the four years which ended with 1780 when the investment from the surplus revenues finally closed were never less than a million sterling and commonly nearer twelve hundred thousand pounds this million is the lowest value of the goods sent to europe for which no satisfaction is made4  sidenote remittances from bengal to china and the presidencies  about an hundred thousand pounds a year is also remitted from bengal on the companys account to china and the whole of the product of that money flows into the direct trade from china to europe besides this bengal sends a regular supply in time of peace to those presidencies which are unequal to their own establishment to bombay the remittance in money bills or goods for none of which there is a return amounts to one hundred and sixty thousand pounds a year at a medium  sidenote exports from england to india  the goods which are exported from europe to india consist chiefly of military and naval stores of clothing for troops and of other objects for the consumption of the europeans residing there and excepting some lead copper utensils and sheet copper woollen cloth and other commodities of little comparative value no sort of merchandise is sent from england that is in demand for the wants or desires of the native inhabitants  sidenote bad effects of investment  when an account is taken of the intercourse for it is not commerce which is carried on between bengal and england the pernicious effects of the system of investment from revenue will appear in the strongest point of view in that view the whole exported produce of the country so far as the company is concerned is not exchanged in the course of barter but is taken away without any return or payment whatsoever in a commercial light therefore england becomes annually bankrupt to bengal to the amount nearly of its whole dealing or rather the country has suffered what is tantamount to an annual plunder of its manufactures and its produce to the value of twelve hundred thousand pounds  sidenote foreign companies  sidenote consequences of their trade  in time of peace three foreign companies appear at first sight to bring their contribution of trade to the supply of this continual drain these are the companies of france holland and denmark but when the object is considered more nearly instead of relief these companies who from their want of authority in the country might seem to trade upon a principle merely commercial will be found to add their full proportion to the calamity brought upon bengal by the destructive system of the ruling power because the greater part of the capital of all these companies and perhaps the whole capital of some of them is furnished exactly as the british is out of the revenues of the country the civil and military servants of the english east india company being restricted in drawing bills upon europe and none of them ever making or proposing an establishment in india a very great part of their fortunes well or ill gotten is in all probability thrown as fast as required into the cash of these companies  in all other countries the revenue following the natural course and order of things arises out of their commerce here by a mischievous inversion of that order the whole foreign maritime trade whether english french dutch or danish arises from the revenues and these are carried out of the country without producing anything to compensate so heavy a loss  sidenote foreign companies investments  your committee have not been able to discover the entire value of the investment made by foreign companies but as the investment which the english east india company derived from its revenues and even from its public credit is for the year 1783 to be wholly stopped it has been proposed to private persons to make a subscription for an investment on their own account this investment is to be equal to the sum of 800000l another loan has been also made for an investment on the companys account to china of 200000l this makes a million and there is no question that much more could be readily had for bills upon europe now as there is no doubt that the whole of the money remitted is the property of british subjects none else having any interest in remitting to europe it is not unfair to suppose that a very great part if not the whole of what may find its way into this new channel is not newly created but only diverted from those channels in which it formerly ran that is the cash of the foreign trading companies  sidenote of the silver sent to china  besides the investment made in goods by foreign companies from the funds of british subjects these subjects have been for some time in the practice of sending very great sums in gold and silver directly to china on their own account in a memorial presented to the governorgeneral and council in march 1782 it appears that the principal money lent by british subjects to one company of merchants in china then amounted to seven millions of dollars about one million seven hundred thousand pounds sterling and not the smallest particle of silver sent to china ever returns to india it is not easy to determine in what proportions this enormous sum of money has been sent from madras or from bengal but it equally exhausts a country belonging to this kingdom whether it comes from the one or from the other  sidenote revenue above the investment how applied  sidenote allowance to nabob of bengal  sidenote how reduced  but that the greatness of all these drains and their effects may be rendered more visible your committee have turned their consideration to the employment of those parts of the bengal revenue which are not employed in the companys own investments for china and for europe what is taken over and above the investment when any investment can be made from the gross revenue either for the charge of collection or for civil and military establishments is in time of peace two millions at the least from the portion of that sum which goes to the support of civil government the natives are almost wholly excluded as they are from the principal collections of revenue with very few exceptions they are only employed as servants and agents to europeans or in the inferior departments of collection when it is absolutely impossible to proceed a step without their assistance for some time after the acquisition of the territorial revenue the sum of 420000l a year was paid according to the stipulation of a treaty to the nabob of bengal for the support of his government this sum however inconsiderable compared to the revenues of the province yet distributed through the various departments of civil administration served in some degree to preserve the natives of the better sort particularly those of the mahomedan profession from being utterly ruined the people of that persuasion not being so generally engaged in trade and not having on their conquest of bengal divested the ancient gentoo proprietors of their lands of inheritance had for their chief if not their sole support the share of a moderate conqueror in all offices civil and military but your committee find that this arrangement was of a short duration without the least regard to the subsistence of this innocent people or to the faith of the agreement on which they were brought under the british government this sum was reduced by a new treaty to 320000l and soon after upon a pretence of the present nabobs minority and a temporary sequestration for the discharge of his debts to 160000l but when he arrived at his majority and when the debts were paid if ever they were paid the sequestration still continued and so far as the late advices may be understood the allowance to the nabob appears still to stand at the reduced sum of 160000l  sidenote native officers  the other resource of the mahomedans and of the gentoos of certain of the higher castes was the army in this army nine tenths of which consists of natives no native of whatever description holds any rank higher than that of a subahdar commandant that is of an officer below the rank of an english subaltern who is appointed to each company of the native soldiery  sidenote all lucrative employments in the hands of the english  your committee here would be understood to state the ordinary establishment for the war may have made some alteration all the honorable all the lucrative situations of the army all the supplies and contracts of whatever species that belong to it are solely in the hands of the english so that whatever is beyond the mere subsistence of a common soldier and some officers of a lower rank together with the immediate expenses of the english officers at their table is sooner or later in one shape or another sent out of the country  such was the state of bengal even in time of profound peace and before the whole weight of the public charge fell upon that unhappy country for the support of other parts of india which have been desolated in such a manner as to contribute little or nothing to their own protection  sidenote former state of trade  your committee have given this short comparative account of the effects of the maritime traffic of bengal when in its natural state and as it has stood since the prevalence of the system of an investment from the revenues but before the formation of that system bengal did by no means depend for its resources on its maritime commerce the inland trade from whence it derived a very great supply of silver and gold and many kinds of merchantable goods was very considerable the higher provinces of the mogul empire were then populous and opulent and intercourse to an immense amount was carried on between them and bengal a great trade also passed through these provinces from all the countries on the frontier of persia and the frontier provinces of tartary as well as from surat and baroach on the western side of india these parts opened to bengal a communication with the persian gulf and with the red sea and through them with the whole turkish and the maritime parts of the persian empire besides the commercial intercourse which it maintained with those and many other countries through its own seaports  sidenote and the trade to turkey  during that period the remittances to the moguls treasury from bengal were never very large at least for any considerable time nor very regularly sent and the impositions of the state were soon repaid with interest through the medium of a lucrative commerce but the disorders of persia since the death of kouli khân have wholly destroyed the trade of that country and the trade to turkey by jidda and bussorah which was the greatest and perhaps best branch of the indian trade is very much diminished the fall of the throne of the mogul emperors has drawn with it that of the great marts of agra and delhi the utmost confusion of the northwestern provinces followed this revolution which was not absolutely complete until it received the last hand from great britain still greater calamities have fallen upon the fine provinces of rohilcund and oude and on the countries of corah and allahabad by the operations of the british arms and influence they are in many places turned to mere deserts or so reduced and decayed as to afford very few materials or means of commerce  sidenote state of trade in the carnatic  such is the actual condition of the trade of bengal since the establishment of the british power there the commerce of the carnatic as far as the inquiries of your committee have extended did not appear with a better aspect even before the invasion of hyder ali khân and the consequent desolation which for many years to come must exclude it from any considerable part of the trading system  it appears on the examination of an intelligent person concerned in trade and who resided at madras for several years that on his arrival there which was in the year 1767 that city was in a flourishing condition and one of the first marts in india but when he left it in 1779 there was little or no trade remaining and but one ship belonging to the whole place the evidence of this gentleman purports that at his first acquaintance with the carnatic it was a wellcultivated and populous country and as such consumed many articles of merchandise that at his departure he left it much circumscribed in trade greatly in the decline as to population and culture and with a correspondent decay of the territorial revenue  your committee find that there has also been from madras an investment on the companys account taking one year with another very nearly on the same principles and with the same effects as that from bengal and they think it is highly probable that besides the large sums remitted directly from madras to china there has likewise been a great deal on a private account for that and other countries invested in the cash of foreign european powers trading on the coast of coromandel but your committee have not extended their inquiries relative to the commerce of the countries dependent on madras so far as they have done with regard to bengal they have reason to apprehend that the condition is rather worse but if the house requires a more minute examination of this important subject your committee is willing to enter into it without delay   iiieffect of the revenue investment on the company  hitherto your committee has considered this system of revenue investment substituted in the place of a commercial link between india and europe so far as it affects india only they are now to consider it as it affects the company so long as that corporation continued to receive a vast quantity of merchantable goods without any disbursement for the purchase so long it possessed wherewithal to continue a dividend to pay debts and to contribute to the state but it must have been always evident to considerate persons that this vast extraction of wealth from a country lessening in its resources in proportion to the increase of its burdens was not calculated for a very long duration for a while the companys servants kept up this investment not by improving commerce manufacture or agriculture but by forcibly raising the landrents on the principles and in the manner hereafter to be described when these extortions disappointed or threatened to disappoint expectation in order to purvey for the avarice which raged in england they sought for expedients in breaches of all the agreements by which they were bound by any payment to the country powers and in exciting disturbances among all the neighboring princes stimulating their ambition and fomenting their mutual animosities they sold to them reciprocally their common servitude and ruin  the governorgeneral mr hastings and the council tell the directors that the supply for the investment has arisen from casual and extraordinary resources which they could not expect always to command in an earlier minute he expresses himself still more distinctly he says if the internal resources of a state fail it or are not equal to its occasional wants whence can it obtain immediate relief but from external means indeed the investment has not been for any long time the natural product of the revenue of bengal when by the vast charge and by the ill return of an evil political and military traffic and by a prodigal increase of establishments and a profuse conduct in distributing agencies and contracts they found themselves under difficulties instead of being cured of their immoral and impolitic delusion they plunged deeper into it and were drawn from expedient to expedient for the supply of the investment into that endless chain of wars which this house by its resolutions has so justly condemned at home these measures were sometimes countenanced sometimes winked at sometimes censured but always with an acceptance of whatever profit they afforded  at length the funds for the investment and for these wars together could no longer be supplied in the year 1778 the provision for the investment from the revenues and from the monopolies stood very high it was estimated at a million four hundred thousand pounds and of this it appears that a great deal was realized but this was the high floodtide of the investment for in that year they announce its probable decline and that such extensive supplies could not be continued the advances to the board of trade became less punctual and many disputes arose about the time of making them however knowing that all their credit at home depended on the investment or upon an opinion of its magnitude whilst they repeat their warning of a probable deficiency and that their finances bore an unfavorable aspect in the year 1779 they rate their investment still higher but their payments becoming less and less regular and the war carrying away all the supplies at length mr hastings in december 1780 denounced sentence of approaching dissolution to this system and tells the directors that he bore too high a respect for their characters to treat them with the management of a preparatory and gradual introduction to an unpleasing report that it is the only substantial information he shall have to convey in that letter in confidence therefore of their fortitude he tells them without ceremony that there will be a necessity of making a large reduction or possibly a total suspension of their investmentthat they had already been reduced to borrow near 700000l this resource says he cannot last it must cease at a certain period and that perhaps not far distant  he was not mistaken in his prognostic loans now becoming the regular resource for retrieving the investment whose ruin was inevitable the council enable the board of trade in april 1781 to grant certificates for government bonds at eight per cent interest for about 650000l the investment was fixed at 900000l  but now another alarming system appeared these new bonds overloaded the market those which had been formerly issued were at a discount the board of trade was obliged to advance therefore a fourth more than usual to the contractors this seemed to satisfy that description of dealers but as those who bought on agency were limited to no terms of mutual advantage and the bonds on the new issue falling from three to eight nine and ten per cent discount the agents were unable to furnish at the usual prices accordingly a discount was settled on such terms as could be made the lowest discount and that at two places only was at four per cent which with the interest on the bonds made besides the earlier advance at the least twelve per cent additional charge upon all goods it was evident that as the investment instead of being supported by the revenues was sunk by the fall of their credit so the net revenues were diminished by the daily accumulation of an interest accruing on account of the investment what was done to alleviate one complaint thus aggravating the other and at length proving pernicious to both this trade on bonds likewise came to its period  your committee has reason to think that the bonds have since that time sunk to a discount much greater even than what is now stated the board of trade justly denominates their resource for that year the sinking credit of a paper currency laboring from the uncommon scarcity of specie under disadvantages scarcely surmountable from this they value themselves on having effected an ostensible provision at least for that investment for 1783 nothing appears even ostensible  by this failure a total revolution ensued of the most extraordinary nature and to which your committee wish to call the particular attention of the house for the councilgeneral in their letter of the 8th of april 1782 after stating that they were disappointed in their expectations how grounded it does not appear thought that they should be able to spare a sum to the board of tradetell the court of directors that they had adopted a new method of keeping up the investment by private subscribers for eighty lacs of rupees which will find cargoes for their ships on the usual terms of privilege at the risk of the individuals and is to be repaid to them according to the produce of the sales in englandand they tell the directors that a copy of the plan makes a number in their separate dispatches over land  it is impossible in reporting this revolution to the house to avoid remarking with what fidelity mr hastings and his council have adhered to the mode of transmitting their accounts which your committee found it necessary to mark and censure in their first report its pernicious tendency is there fully set forth they were peculiarly called on for a most accurate state of their affairs in order to explain the necessity of having recourse to such a scheme as well as for a full and correct account of the scheme itself but they send only the above short minute by one dispatch over land whilst the copy of the plan itself on which the directors must form their judgment is sent separately in another dispatch over land which has never arrived a third dispatch which also contained the plan was sent by a sea conveyance and arrived late the directors have for very obvious reasons ordered by a strict injunction that they should send duplicates of all their dispatches by every ship the spirit of this rule perhaps ought to extend to every mode of conveyance in this case so far from sending a duplicate they do not send even one perfect account they announce a plan by one conveyance and they send it by another conveyance with other delays and other risks  at length at nearly four months distance the plan has been received and appears to be substantially that which had been announced but developing in the particulars many new circumstances of the greatest importance by this plan it appears that the subscription even in idea or pretence is not for the use of the company but that the subscribers are united into a sort of society for the remitting their private fortunes the goods indeed are said to be shipped on the companys account and they are directed to be sold on the same account and at the usual periods of sales but after the payment of duties and such other allowances as they choose to make in the eleventh article they provide that the remainder of the sales shall revert to the subscribers and be declared to be their property and divided in proportion to their respective shares the compensation which they allow in this plan to their masters for their brokerage is that if after deducting all the charges which they impose the amount of the sales should be found to exceed two shillings and twopence for the current rupee of the invoice account it shall be taken by the company for the management of this concern in bengal they choose commissioners by their own authority by the same authority they form them into a body they put them under rules and regulations and they empower them also to make regulations of their own they remit by the like authority the duties to which all private trade is subject and they charge the whole concern with seven per cent to be paid from the net produce of the sales in england as a recompense to the commissioners for this the commissioners contract to bear all the charges on the goods to the time of shipping  the servants having formed this plan of trade and a new commission for the conduct of it on their private account it is a matter of consideration to know who the commissioners are they turn out to be the three senior servants of the companys board of trade who choose to take upon them to be the factors of others for large emoluments whilst they receive salaries of two thousand pounds and fifteen hundred pounds a year from the company as the company have no other fund than the new investment from whence they are to be paid for the care of their servants property this commission and those salaries being to take place of their brokerage they in effect render it very difficult if not impossible for them to derive advantage from their new occupation  as to the benefit of this plan besides preventing the loss which must happen from the companys ships returning empty to europe and the stopping of all trade between india and england the authors of it state that it will open a new channel of remittance and abolish the practice by precluding the necessity of remitting private fortunes by foreign bottoms and that it may lead to some permanent mode for remittance of private fortunes and of combining it with the regular provision of the companys investmentthat it will yield some profit to the company without risk and the national gain will be the same as upon the regular trade  as to the combination of this mode of remittance with the companys investment nothing can be affirmed concerning it until some satisfactory assurance can be held out that such an investment can ever be realized mr hastings and the gentlemen of the council have not afforded any ground for such an expectation that the indian trade may become a permanent vehicle of the private fortunes of the companys servants is very probablethat is as permanent as the means of acquiring fortunes in india but that some profit will accrue to the company is absolutely impossible the company are to bear all the charge outwards and a very great part of that homewards and their only compensation is the surplus commission on the sale of other peoples goods the nation will undoubtedly avoid great loss and detriment which would be the inevitable consequence of the total cessation of the trade with bengal and the ships returning without cargoes but if this temporary expedient should be improved into a system no occasional advantages to be derived from it would be sufficient to balance the mischiefs of finding a great parliamentary corporation turned into a vehicle for remitting to england the private fortunes of those for whose benefit the territorial possessions in india are in effect and substance under this project to be solely held  by this extraordinary scheme the company is totally overturned and all its relations inverted from being a body concerned in trade on their own account and employing their servants as factors the servants have at one stroke taken the whole trade into their own hands on their own capital of 800000l at their own risk and the company are become agents and factors to them to sell by commission their goods for their profit  to enable your committee to form some judgment upon the profit which may accrue to the company from its new relation and employment they directed that an estimate should be made of the probable proceeds of an investment conducted on the principles of that intended to be realized for 1783 by this estimate which is subjoined5 it appears to your committee that so far from any surplus profit from this transaction the bengal adventurers themselves instead of realizing 2s 2d the rupee the standard they fix for their payment will not receive the 1s 9d which is its utmost value in silver at the mint nor probably above 1s 5d with this certain loss before their eyes it is impossible that they can ever complete their subscription unless by management among themselves they should be able to procure the goods for their own account upon other terms than those on which they purchased them for their masters or unless they have for the supply of the company on their hands a quantity of goods which they cannot otherwise dispose of this latter case is not very improbable from their proposing to send ten sixteenths of the whole investment in silkwhich as will be seen hereafter the company has prohibited to be sent on their account as a disadvantageous article nothing but the servants being overloaded can rationally account for their choice of so great a proportion of so dubious a commodity  on the state made by two reports of a committee of the general court in 1782 their affairs were even then reduced to a low ebb but under the arrangement announced by mr hastings and his colleagues it does not appear after this period of the servants investment from what fund the proprietors are to make any dividend at all the objects of the sale from whence the dividend is to arise are not their goods they stand accountable to others for the whole probable produce the state of the companys commerce will therefore become an object of serious consideration an affair as your committee apprehends of as much difficulty as ever tried the faculties of this house for on the one hand it is plain that the system of providing the companys import into europe resting almost wholly by an investment from its territorial revenues has failed during its continuance it was supported on principles fatal to the prosperity of that country on the other hand if the nominal commerce of the company is suffered to be carried on for the account of the servants abroad by investing the emoluments made in their stations these emoluments are therefore inclusively authorized and with them the practices from which they accrue all parliamentary attempts to reform this system will be contradictory to its institution if for instance five hundred thousand pounds sterling annually be necessary for this kind of investment any regulation which may prevent the acquisition of that sum operates against the investment which is the end proposed by the plan  on this new scheme which is neither calculated for a future security nor for a present relief to the company it is not visible in what manner the settlements in india can be at all upheld the gentlemen in employments abroad call for the whole produce of the years investment from bengal but for the payment of the counterinvestment from europe which is for the far greater part sent out for the support of their power no provision at all is made they have not it seems agreed that it should be charged to their account or that any deduction should be made for it from the produce of their sales in leadenhall street how far such a scheme is preferable to the total suspension of trade your committee cannot positively determine in all likelihood extraordinary expedients were necessary but the causes which induced this necessity ought to be more fully inquired into for the last step in a series of conduct may be justifiable upon principles that suppose great blame in those which preceded it  after your committee had made the foregoing observations upon the plan of mr hastings and his colleagues transmitted to the court of directors an extract of the madras consultations was a few days ago laid before us this extract contains a letter from the governorgeneral and council of bengal to the presidency of fort st george which affords a very striking though to your committee by no means an unexpected picture of the instability of their opinions and conduct on the 8th of april the servants had regularly formed and digested the abovementioned plan which was to form the basis for the investment of their own fortunes and to furnish the sole means of the commercial existence of their masters before the 10th of the following may which is the date of their letter to madras they inform lord macartney that they had fundamentally altered the whole scheme instead say they of allowing the subscribers to retain an interest in the goods they are to be provided entirely on account of the company and transported at their risk and the subscribers instead of receiving certificates payable out of the produce of the sales in europe are to be granted receipts on the payment of their advances bearing an interest of eight per cent per annum until exchanged for drafts on the court of directors payable 365 days after sight at the rate of two shillings per current rupeewhich drafts shall be granted in the proper time of three eighths of the amount subscribed on the 31st of december next and the remaining five eighths on the 31st of december 1783  the plan of april divests the company of all property in bengal goods transported to europe but in recompense they are freed from all the risk and expense they are not loaded with interest and they are not embarrassed with bills the plan of may reinstates them in their old relation but in return their revenues in bengal are charged with an interest of eight per cent on the sum subscribed until bills shall be drawn they are made proprietors of cargoes purchased under the disadvantage of that interest at their own hazard they are subjected to all losses and they are involved in europe for payments of bills to the amount of eighty lacs of rupees at two shillings the rupeethat is in bills for eight hundred thousand pounds sterling it is probably on account of the previous interest of eight per cent that the value of the rupee on this scheme is reduced mr hastings and his colleagues announce to lord macartney no other than the foregoing alteration in their plan  it is discouraging to attempt any sort of observation on plans thus shifting their principle whilst their merits are under examination the judgment formed on the scheme of april has nothing to do with the project of may your committee has not suppressed any part of the reflections which occurred to them on the former of these plans first because the company knows of no other by any regular transmissions secondly because it is by no means certain that before the expiration of june the governorgeneral and council may not revert to the plan of april they speak of that plan as likely to be or make a part of one that shall be permanent many reasons are alleged by its authors in its favor grounded on the state of their affairs none whatever are assigned for the alteration it is indeed morally certain that persons who had money to remit must have made the same calculation which has been made by the directions of your committee and the result must have been equally clear to themwhich is that instead of realizing two shillings and twopence the rupee on their subscription as they proposed they could never hope to see more than one shilling and ninepence this calculation probably shook the main pillar of the project of april but on the other hand as the subscribers to the second scheme can have no certain assurance that the company will accept bills so far exceeding their allowance in this particular the necessity of remitting their fortunes may beat them back to their old ground the danish company was the only means of remitting which remained attempts have been made with success to revive a portuguese trade for that purpose it is by no means clear whether mr hastings and his colleagues will adhere to either of the foregoing plans or indeed whether any investment at all to that amount can be realized because nothing but the convenience of remitting the gains of british subjects to london can support any of these projects  the situation of the company under this perpetual variation in the system of their investment is truly perplexing the manner in which they arrive at any knowledge of it is no less so the letter to lord macartney by which the variation is discovered was not intended for transmission to the directors it was merely for the information of those who were admitted to a share of the subscription at madras when mr hastings sent this information to those subscribers he might well enough have presumed an event to happen which did happenthat is that a vessel might be dispatched from madras to europe and indeed by that and by every devisable means he ought not only to have apprised the directors of this most material change in the plan of the investment but to have entered fully into the grounds and reasons of his making it  it appears to your committee that the ships which brought to england the plan of the 8th of april did not sail from bengal until the 1st of may if the change had been in contemplation for any time before the 30th of april two days would have sufficed to send an account of it and it might have arrived along with the plan which it affected if therefore such a change was in agitation before the sailing of the ships and yet was concealed when it might have been communicated the concealment is censurable it is not improbable that some change of the kind was made or meditated before the sailing of the ships for europe for it is hardly to be imagined that reasons wholly unlookedfor should appear for setting aside a plan concerning the success of which the councilgeneral seemed so very confident that a new one should be proposed that its merits should be discussed among the moneyed men that it should be adopted in council and officially ready for transmission to madras in twelve or thirteen days in this perplexity of plan and of transmission the court of directors may have made an arrangement of their affairs on the groundwork of the first scheme which was officially and authentically conveyed to them the fundamental alteration of that plan in india might require another of a very different kind in england which the arrangements taken in consequence of the first might make it difficult if not impossible to execute what must add to the confusion is that the alteration has not the regular and official authority of the original plan and may be presumed to indicate with certainty nothing more than that the business is again afloat and that no scheme is finally determined on thus the company is left without any fixed data upon which they can make a rational disposition of their affairs  the fact is that the principles and economy of the companys trade have been so completely corrupted by turning it into a vehicle for tribute that whenever circumstances require it to be replaced again upon a bottom truly commercial hardly anything but confusion and disasters can be expected as the first results even before the acquisition of the territorial revenues the system of the companys commerce was not formed upon principles the most favorable to its prosperity for whilst on the one hand that body received encouragement by royal and parliamentary charters was invested with several ample privileges and even with a delegation of the most essential prerogatives of the crownon the other its commerce was watched with an insidious jealousy as a species of dealing dangerous to the national interests in that light with regard to the companys imports there was a total prohibition from domestic use of the most considerable articles of their tradethat is of all silk stuffs and stained and painted cottons the british market was in a great measure interdicted to the british trader whatever advantages might arise to the general trading interests of the kingdom by this restraint its east india interest was undoubtedly injured by it the company is also and has been from a very early period obliged to furnish the ordnance with a quantity of saltpetre at a certain price without any reference to the standard of the markets either of purchase or of sale with regard to their export they were put also under difficulties upon very mistaken notions for they were obliged to export annually a certain proportion of british manufactures even though they should find for them in india none or but an unprofitable want this compulsory export might operate and in some instances has operated in a manner more grievous than a tax to the amount of the loss in trade for the payment of a tax is in general divided in unequal portions between the vender and consumer the largest part falling upon the latter in the case before us the tax may be as a dead charge on the trading capital of the company  the spirit of all these regulations naturally tended to weaken in the very original constitution of the company the mainspring of the commercial machine the principles of profit and loss and the mischief arising from an inattention to those principles has constantly increased with the increase of its power for when the company had acquired the rights of sovereignty in india it was not to be expected that the attention to profit and loss would have increased the idea of remitting tribute in goods naturally produced an indifference to their price and qualitythe goods themselves appearing little else than a sort of package to the tribute merchandise taken as tribute or bought in lieu of it can never long be of a kind or of a price fitted to a market which stands solely on its commercial reputation the indifference of the mercantile sovereign to his trading advantages naturally relaxed the diligence of his subordinate factormagistrates through all their gradations and in all their functions it gave rise at least so far as the principal was concerned to much neglect of price and of goodness in their purchases if ever they showed any extraordinary degrees of accuracy and selection it would naturally be in favor of that interest to which they could not be indifferent the company might suffer above the natives might suffer below the intermediate party must profit to the prejudice of both  your committee are of opinion that the company is now arrived at that point when the investment from surplus revenue or from the spoil of war ceasing it is become much more necessary to fix its commerce upon a commercial basis and this opinion led your committee to a detailed review of all the articles of the indian traffic upon which the profit and loss was steady and we have chosen a period of four years during the continuance of the revenue investment and prior to any borrowing or any extraordinary drawing of bills in order to find out how far the trade under circumstances when it will be necessary to carry it on by borrowing or by bills or by exportation of bullion can be sustained in the former course so as to secure the capital and to afford a reasonable dividend and your committee find that in the first four years the investment from bengal amounted to 4176525l upon 2260277l there was a gain of 186337l and upon 1916248l a loss of 705566l so that the excess of loss above gain upon the whole of the foregoing capital was in the four years no less than 519229l  if the trade were confined to bengal and the company were to trade on those terms upon a capital borrowed at eight per cent indian interest their revenues in that province would be soon so overpowered with debt that those revenues instead of supporting the trade would be totally destroyed by it if on the other hand the company traded upon bills with every advantage far from being in a condition to divide the smallest percentage their bankruptcy here would be inevitable  your committee then turned to the trade of the other factories and presidencies and they constantly found that as the power and dominion of the company was less their profit on the goods was greater the investments of madras bombay and bencoolen have in the foregoing four years upon a capital of 1151176l had a gain upon the whole of 329622l the greatest of all is that of bencoolen which on a capital of 76571l produced a profit of 107760l this however is but a small branch of the companys trade the trade to china on a capital of 1717463l produced an excess of gain amounting to 874096l which is about fifty per cent but such was the evil influence of the bengal investment that not only the profits of the chinese trade but of all the lucrative branches taken together were so sunk and ingulfed in it that the whole profit on a capital of 7045164l reached to no more than 684489l that is to 189607l less than the profit on the chinese trade aloneless than the total profits on the gainful trades taken together 520727l  it is very remarkable that in the year 1778 when the bengal investment stood at the highest that is so high as 1223316l though the chinese trade produced an excess of gain in that year of 209243l and that no loss of moment could be added to that of bengal except about 45000l on the bombay trade the whole profit of a capital of 2040787l amounted only to the sum of 9480l  the detail of the articles in which loss was incurred or gain made will be found in the appendix no 24 the circumstances of the time have rendered it necessary to call up a vigorous attention to this state of the trade of the company between europe and india   internal trade of bengal  the internal trade of bengal has next attracted the inquiries of your committee  the great and valuable articles of the companys investment drawn from the articles of internal trade are raw silk and various descriptions of piecegoods made of silk and cotton these articles are not under any formal monopoly nor does the company at present exercise a declared right of preëmption with regard to them but it does not appear that the trade in these particulars is or can be perfectly freenot so much on account of any direct measures taken to prevent it as from the circumstances of the country and the manner of carrying on business there for the present trade even in these articles is built from the ruins of old monopolies and preëmptions and necessarily partakes of the nature of its materials  in order to show in what manner manufactures and trade so constituted contribute to the prosperity of the natives your committee conceives it proper to take in this place a short general view of the progress of the english policy with relation to the commerce of bengal and the several stages and gradations by which it has been brought into its actual state the modes of abuse and the means by which commerce has suffered will be considered in greater detail under the distinct heads of those objects which have chiefly suffered by them  during the time of the mogul government the princes of that race who omitted nothing for the encouragement of commerce in their dominions bestowed very large privileges and immunities on the english east india company exempting them from several duties to which their naturalborn subjects were liable the companys dustuck or passport secured to them this exemption at all the customhouses and tollbars of the country the company not being able or not choosing to make use of their privilege to the full extent to which it might be carried indulged their servants with a qualified use of their passport under which and in the name of the company they carried on a private trade either by themselves or in society with natives and thus found a compensation for the scanty allowances made to them by their masters in england as the country government was at that time in the fulness of its strength and that this immunity existed by a double connivance it was naturally kept within tolerable limits  but by the revolution in 1757 the companys servants obtained a mighty ascendant over the native princes of bengal who owed their elevation to the british arms the company which was new to that kind of power and not yet thoroughly apprised of its real character and situation considered itself still as a trader in the territories of a foreign potentate in the prosperity of whose country it had neither interest nor duty the servants with the same ideas followed their fortune in the channels in which it had hitherto ran only enlarging them with the enlargement of their power for their first ideas of profit were not official nor were their oppressions those of ordinary despotism the first instruments of their power were formed out of evasions of their ancient subjection the passport of the company in the hands of its servants was no longer under any restraint and in a very short time their immunity began to cover all the merchandise of the country cossim ali khân the second of the nabobs whom they had set up was but ill disposed to the instruments of his greatness he bore the yoke of this imperious commerce with the utmost impatience he saw his subjects excluded as aliens from their own trade and the revenues of the prince overwhelmed in the ruin of the commerce of his dominions finding his reiterated remonstrances on the extent and abuse of the passport ineffectual he had recourse to an unexpected expedient which was to declare his resolution at once to annul all the duties on trade setting it equally free to subjects and to foreigners  never was a method of defeating the oppressions of monopoly more forcible more simple or more equitable no sort of plausible objection could be made and it was in vain to think of evading it it was therefore met with the confidence of avowed and determined injustice the presidency of calcutta openly denied to the prince the power of protecting the trade of his subjects by the remission of his own duties it was evident that his authority drew to its period many reasons and motives concurred and his fall was hastened by the odium of the oppressions which he exercised voluntarily as well as of those to which he was obliged to submit  when this example was made jaffier ali khân who had been deposed to make room for the last actor was brought from penury and exile to a station the terms of which he could not misunderstand during his life and in the time of his children who succeeded to him parts of the territorial revenue were assigned to the company and the whole under the name of residency at the nabobs court was brought directly or indirectly under the control of british subjects the companys servants armed with authorities delegated from the nominal government or attended with what was a stronger guard the fame of their own power appeared as magistrates in the markets in which they dealt as traders it was impossible for the natives in general to distinguish in the proceedings of the same persons what was transacted on the companys account from what was done on their own and it will ever be so difficult to draw this line of distinction that as long as the company does directly or indirectly aim at any advantage to itself in the purchase of any commodity whatever so long will it be impracticable to prevent the servants availing themselves of the same privilege  the servants therefore for themselves or for their employers monopolized every article of trade foreign and domestic not only the raw merchantable commodities but the manufactures and not only these but the necessaries of life or what in these countries habit has confounded with themnot only silk cotton piecegoods opium saltpetre but not unfrequently salt tobacco betelnut and the grain of most ordinary consumption in the name of the country government they laid on or took off and at their pleasure heightened or lowered all duties upon goods the whole trade of the country was either destroyed or in shackles the acquisition of the duanné in 1765 bringing the english into the immediate government of the country in its most essential branches extended and confirmed all the former means of monopoly  in the progress of these ruinous measures through all their details innumerable grievances were suffered by the native inhabitants which were represented in the strongest that is their true colors in england whilst the far greater part of the british in india were in eager pursuit of the forced and exorbitant gains of a trade carried on by power contests naturally arose among the competitors those who were overpowered by their rivals became loud in their complaints to the court of directors and were very capable from experience of pointing out every mode of abuse  the court of directors on their part began though very slowly to perceive that the country which was ravaged by this sort of commerce was their own these complaints obliged the directors to a strict examination into the real sources of the mismanagement of their concerns in india and to lay the foundations of a system of restraint on the exorbitancies of their servants accordingly so early as the year 1765 they confine them to a trade only in articles of export and import and strictly prohibit them from all dealing in objects of internal consumption about the same time the presidency of calcutta found it necessary to put a restraint upon themselves or at least to make show of a disposition with which the directors appear much satisfied to keep their own enormous power within bounds  but whatever might have been the intentions either of the directors or the presidency both found themselves unequal to the execution of a plan which went to defeat the projects of almost all the english in indiapossibly comprehending some who were makers of the regulations for as the complaint of the country or as their own interest predominated with the presidency they were always shifting from one course to the other so that it became as impossible for the natives to know upon what principle to ground any commercial speculation from the uncertainty of the law under which they acted as it was when they were oppressed by power without any color of law at all for the directors in a few months after they had given these tokens of approbation to the above regulations in favor of the country trade tell the presidency it is with concern we see in every page of your consultations restrictions limitations prohibitions affecting various articles of trade on their side the presidency freely confess that these monopolies of inland trade were the foundation of all the bloodsheds massacres and confusions which have happened of late in bengal  pressed in this urgent manner the directors came more specifically to the grievance and at once annul all the passports with which their servants traded without duties holding out means of compensation of which it does not appear that any advantage was taken in order that the duties which existed should no longer continue to burden the trade either of the servants or natives they ordered that a number of oppressive tollbars should be taken away and the whole number reduced to nine of the most considerable  when lord clive was sent to bengal to effect a reformation of the many abuses which prevailed there he considered monopoly to be so inveterate and deeply rooted and the just rewards of the companys servants to be so complicated with that injustice to the country that the latter could not easily be removed without taking away the former he adopted therefore a plan for dealing in certain articles which as he conceived rather ought to be called a regulated and restricted trade than a formal monopoly by this plan he intended that the profits should be distributed in an orderly and proportioned manner for the reward of services and not seized by each individual according to the measure of his boldness dexterity or influence  but this scheme of monopoly did not subsist long at least in that mode and for those purposes three of the grand monopolies those of opium salt and saltpetre were successively by the company taken into their own hands the produce of the sale of the two former articles was applied to the purchase of goods for their investment the latter was exported in kind for their sales in europe the senior servants had a certain share of emolument allotted to them from a commission on the revenues the junior servants were rigorously confined to salaries on which they were unable to subsist according to their rank they were strictly ordered to abstain from all dealing in objects of internal commerce those of export and import were left open to young men without mercantile experience and wholly unprovided with mercantile capitals but abundantly furnished with large trusts of the public money and with all the powers of an absolute government in this situation a religious abstinence from all illicit game was prescribed to men at nine thousand miles distance from the seat of the supreme authority  your committee is far from meaning to justify or even to excuse the oppressions and cruelties used by many in supplying the deficiencies of their regular allowances by all manner of extortion but many smaller irregularities may admit some alleviation from thence nor does your committee mean to express any desire of reverting to the mode contrived in india but condemned by the directors of rewarding the servants of an higher class by a regulated monopoly their object is to point out the deficiencies in the system by which restrictions were laid that could have little or no effect whilst want and power were suffered to be united  but the proceedings of the directors at that time though not altogether judicious were in many respects honorable to them and favorable in the intention at least to the country they governed for finding their trading capital employed against themselves and against the natives and struggling in vain against abuses which were inseparably connected with the system of their own preference in trade in the year 1773 they came to the manly resolution of setting an example to their servants and gave up all use of power and influence in the two grand articles of their investment silk and piecegoods they directed that the articles should be bought at an equal and public market from the native merchants and this order they directed to be published in all the principal marts of bengal  your committee are clearly of opinion that no better method of purchase could be adopted but it soon appeared that in deeprooted and inveterate abuses the wisest principles of reform may be made to operate so destructively as wholly to discredit the design and to dishearten all persons from the prosecution of it the presidency who seemed to yield with the utmost reluctance to the execution of these orders soon made the directors feel their evil influence upon their own investment for they found the silk and cotton cloths rose twentyfive per cent above their former price and a further rise of forty per cent was announced to them   silk  what happened with regard to raw silk is still more remarkable and tends still more clearly to illustrate the effects of commercial servitude during its unchecked existence and the consequences which may be made to arise from its sudden reformation on laying open the trade the article of raw silk was instantly enhanced to the company full eighty per cent the contract made for that commodity wound off in the bengal method which used to sell for less than six rupees or thirteen shillings for two pounds weight arose to nine rupees or near twenty shillings and the filature silk was very soon after contracted for at fourteen  the presidency accounted for this rise by observing that the price had before been arbitrary and that the persons who purveyed for the company paid no more than what was judged sufficient for the maintenance of the first providers this fact explains more fully than the most labored description can do the dreadful effects of the monopoly on the cultivators they had the sufficiency of their maintenance measured out by the judgment of those who were to profit by their labor and this measure was not a great deal more by their own account than about two thirds of the value of that labor in all probability it was much less as these dealings rarely passed through intermediate hands without leaving a considerable profit these oppressions it will be observed were not confined to the companys share which however covered a great part of the trade but as this was an article permitted to the servants the same power of arbitrary valuation must have been extended over the whole as the market must be equalized if any authority at all is extended over it by those who have an interest in the restraint the price was not only raised but in the manufactures the quality was debased nearly in an equal proportion the directors conceived with great reason that this rise of price and debasement of quality arose not from the effect of a free market but from the servants having taken that opportunity of throwing upon the market of their masters the refuse goods of their own private trade at such exorbitant prices as by mutual connivance they were pleased to settle the mischief was greatly aggravated by its happening at a time when the company were obliged to pay for their goods with bonds bearing an high interest  the perplexed system of the companys concerns composed of so many opposite movements and contradictory principles appears nowhere in a more clear light if trade continued under restraint their territorial revenues must suffer by checking the general prosperity of the country if they set it free means were taken to raise the price and debase the quality of the goods and this again fell upon the revenues out of which the payment for the goods was to arise the observations of the company on that occasion are just and sagacious and they will not permit the least doubt concerning the policy of these unnatural trades the amount of our bengal cargoes from 1769 to 1773 is 2901194l sterling and if the average increase of price be estimated at twentyfive per cent only the amount of such increase is 725298l sterling the above circumstances are exceedingly alarming to us but what must be our concern to find by the advices of our president and council of 1773 that a further advance of forty per cent on bengal goods was expected and allowed to be the consequence of advertisements then published authorizing a free trade in the service we find the duanné revenues are in general farmed for five years and the aggregate increase estimated at only 183170l sterling on a supposition that such increase will be realized yet if the annual investment be sixty lacs and the advance of price thirty per cent only such advance will exceed the increase of the revenue by no less than 829330l sterling  the indignation which the directors felt at being reduced to this distressing situation was expressed to their servants in very strong terms they attributed the whole to their practices and say we are far from being convinced that the competition which tends to raise the price of goods in bengal is wholly between public european companies or between merchants in general who export to foreign markets we are rather of opinion that the sources of this grand evil have been the extraordinary privileges granted to individuals in our service or under our license to trade without restriction throughout the provinces of bengal and the encouragement they have had to extend their trade to the uttermost even in such goods as were proper for our investment by observing the success of those persons who have from time to time found means to dispose of their merchandise to our governor and council though of so bad a quality as to be sold here with great difficulty after having been frequently refused and put up at the next sale without price to the very great discredit and disadvantage of the company in all probability the directors were not mistaken for upon an inquiry instituted soon after it was found that cantû babû the banian or native steward and manager to mr hastings late president held two of these contracts in his own name and that of his son for considerably more than 150000l this discovery brought on a prohibition from the court of directors of that suspicious and dangerous dealing in the stewards of persons in high office the same man held likewise farms to the amount of 140000l a year of the landed revenue with the same suspicious appearance contrary to the regulations made under mr hastingss own administration  in the mortifying dilemma to which the directors found themselves reduced whereby the ruin of the revenues either by the freedom or the restraint of trade was evident they considered the first as most rapid and urgent and therefore once more revert to the system of their ancient preëmption and destroy that freedom which they had so lately and with so much solemnity proclaimed and that before it could be abused or even enjoyed they declare that unwilling as we are to return to the former coercive system of providing an investment or to abridge that freedom of commerce which has been so lately established in bengal yet at the same time finding it our indispensable duty to strike at the root of an evil which has been so severely felt by the company and which can no longer be supported we hereby direct that all persons whatever in the companys service or under our protection be absolutely prohibited by public advertisement from trading in any of those articles which compose our investment directly or indirectly except on account of and for the east india company until their investment is completed  as soon as this order was received in bengal it was construed as indeed the words seemed directly to warrant to exclude all natives as well as servants from the trade until the company was supplied the companys preëmption was now authoritatively reëstablished and some feeble and ostensible regulations were made to relieve the weavers who might suffer by it the directors imagined that the reëstablishment of their coercive system would remove the evil which fraud and artifice had grafted upon one more rational and liberal but they were mistaken for it only varied if it did so much as vary the abuse the servants might as essentially injure their interest by a direct exercise of their power as by pretexts drawn from the freedom of the nativesbut with this fatal difference that the frauds upon the company must be of shorter duration under a scheme of freedom that state admitted and indeed led to means of discovery and correction whereas the system of coercion was likely to be permanent it carried force further than served the purposes of those who authorized it it tended to cover all frauds with obscurity and to bury all complaint in despair the next year therefore that is in the year 1776 the company who complained that their orders had been extended beyond their intentions made a third revolution in the trade of bengal it was set free againso far at least as regarded the native merchantsbut in so imperfect a manner as evidently to leave the roots of old abuses in the ground the supreme court of judicature about this time 1776 also fulminated a charge against monopolies without any exception of those authorized by the company but it does not appear that anything very material was done in consequence of it  the trade became nominally free but the course of business established in consequence of coercive monopoly was not easily altered in order to render more distinct the principles which led to the establishment of a course and habit of business so very difficult to change as long as those principles exist your committee think it will not be useless here to enter into the history of the regulations made in the first and favorite matter of the companys investment the trade in raw silk from the commencement of these regulations to the companys perhaps finally abandoning all share in the trade which was their object   raw silk  the trade in raw silk was at all times more popular in england than really advantageous to the company in addition to the old jealousy which prevailed between the company and the manufactory interest of england they came to labor under no small odium on account of the distresses of india the public in england perceived and felt with a proper sympathy the sufferings of the eastern provinces in all cases in which they might be attributed to the abuses of power exercised under the companys authority but they were not equally sensible to the evils which arose from a system of sacrificing the being of that country to the advantage of this they entered very readily into the former but with regard to the latter were slow and incredulous it is not therefore extraordinary that the company should endeavor to ingratiate themselves with the public by falling in with its prejudices thus they were led to increase the grievance in order to allay the clamor they continued still upon a larger scale and still more systematically that plan of conduct which was the principal though not the most blamed cause of the decay and depopulation of the country committed to their care  with that view and to furnish a cheap supply of materials to the manufactures of england they formed a scheme which tended to destroy or at least essentially to impair the whole manufacturing interest of bengal a policy of that sort could not fail of being highly popular when the company submitted itself as an instrument for the improvement of british manufactures instead of being their most dangerous rival as heretofore they had been always represented  they accordingly notified to their presidency in bengal in their letter of the 17th of march 1769 that there was no branch of their trade they more ardently wish to extend than that of raw silk they disclaim however all desire of employing compulsory measures for that purpose but recommended every mode of encouragement and particularly by augmented wages in order to induce manufacturers of wrought silk to quit that branch and take to the winding of raw silk  having thus found means to draw hands from the manufacture and confiding in the strength of a capital drawn from the public revenues they pursue their ideas from the purchase of their manufacture to the purchase of the material in its crudest state we recommend you to give an increased price if necessary so as to take that trade out of the hands of other merchants and rival nations a double bounty was thus given against the manufactures both in the labor and in the materials  it is very remarkable in what manner their vehement pursuit of this object led the directors to a speedy oblivion of those equitable correctives before interposed by them in order to prevent the mischiefs which were apparent in the scheme if left to itself they could venture so little to trust to the bounties given from the revenues a trade which had a tendency to dry up their source that by the time they had proceeded to the thirtythird paragraph of their letter they revert to those very compulsory means which they had disclaimed but three paragraphs before to prevent silkwinders from working in their private houses where they might work for private traders and to confine them to the companys factories where they could only be employed for the companys benefit they desire that the newly acquired power of government should be effectually employed should say they this practice through inattention have been suffered to take place again it will be proper to put a stop to it which may now be more effectually done by an absolute prohibition under severe penalties by the authority of government  this letter contains a perfect plan of policy both of compulsion and encouragement which must in a very considerable degree operate destructively to the manufactures of bengal its effect must be so far as it could operate without being eluded to change the whole face of that industrious country in order to render it a field for the produce of crude materials subservient to the manufactures of great britain the manufacturing hands were to be seduced from their looms by high wages in order to prepare a raw produce for our market they were to be locked up in the factories and the commodity acquired by these operations was in this immature state carried out of the country whilst its looms would be left without any material but the debased refuse of a market enhanced in its price and scanted in its supply by the increase of the price of this and other materials manufactures formerly the most flourishing gradually disappeared under the protection of great britain and were seen to rise again and flourish on the opposite coast of india under the dominion of the mahrattas  these restraints and encouragements seem to have had the desired effect in bengal with regard to the diversion of labor from manufacture to materials the trade of raw silk increased rapidly but the company very soon felt in the increase of price and debasement of quality of the wrought goods a loss to themselves which fully counterbalanced all the advantages to be derived to the nation from the increase of the raw commodity the necessary effect on the revenue was also foretold very early for their servants in the principal silkfactories declared that the obstruction to the private trade in silk must in the end prove detrimental to the revenues and that the investment clashes with the collection of these revenues whatsoever by bounties or immunities is encouraged out of a landed revenue has certainly some tendency to lessen the net amount of that revenue and to forward a produce which does not yield to the gross collection rather than one that does  the directors declare themselves unable to understand how this could be perhaps it was not so difficult but pressed as they were by the greatness of the payments which they were compelled to make to government in england the cries of bengal could not be heard among the contending claims of the general court of the treasury and of spitalfields the speculation of the directors was originally fair and plausibleso far as the mere encouragement of the commodity extended situated as they were it was hardly in their power to stop themselves in the course they had begun they were obliged to continue their resolution at any hazard increasing the investment the state of our affairs say they requires the utmost extension of your investments you are not to forbear sending even those sorts which are attended with loss in case such should be necessary to supply an investment to as great an amount as you can provide from your own resources and we have not the least doubt of your being thereby enabled to increase your consignments of this valuable branch of national commerce even to the utmost of your wishes but it is our positive order that no part of such investment be provided with borrowed money which is to be repaid by drafts upon our treasury in london since the license which has already been taken in this respect has involved us in difficulties which we yet know not how we shall surmount  this very instructive paragraph lays open the true origin of the internal decay of bengal the trade and revenues of that country were as the then system must necessarily have been of secondary consideration at best present supplies were to be obtained and present demands in england were to be avoided at every expense to bengal  the spirit of increasing the investment from revenue at any rate and the resolution of driving all competitors europeans or natives out of the market prevailed at a period still more early and prevailed not only in bengal but seems more or less to have diffused itself through the whole sphere of the companys influence in 1768 they gave to the presidency of madras the following memorable instruction strongly declaratory of their general system of policy  we shall depend upon your prudence say they to discourage foreigners and being intent as you have been repeatedly acquainted on bringing home as great a part of the revenues as possible in your manufactures the outbidding them in those parts where they interfere with you would certainly prove an effectual step for answering that end we therefore recommend it to you to offer such increase of price as you shall deem may be consistently giventhat by beating them out of the market the quantities by you to be provided may be proportionally enlarged and if you take this method it is to be so cautiously practised as not to enhance the prices in the places immediately under your control on this subject we must not omit the approval of your prohibiting the weavers of cuddalore from making up any cloth of the same sortments that are provided for us and if such prohibition is not now it should by all means be in future made general and strictly maintained  this system must have an immediate tendency towards disordering the trade of india and must finally end in great detriment to the company itself the effect of the restrictive system on the weaver is evident the authority given to the servants to buy at an advanced price did of necessity furnish means and excuses for every sort of fraud in their purchases the instant the servant of a merchant is admitted on his own judgment to overbid the market or to send goods to his master which shall sell at loss there is no longer any standard upon which his unfair practices can be estimated or any effectual means by which they can be restrained the hope entertained by the directors of confining this destructive practice of giving an enhanced price to a particular spot must ever be found totally delusive speculations will be affected by this artificial price in every quarter in which markets can have the least communication with each other  in a very few years the court of directors began to feel even in leadenhall street the effects of trading to loss upon the revenues especially on those of bengal in the letter of february 1774 they observe that looking back to their accounts for the four preceding years on several of the descriptions of silk there has been an increasing loss instead of any alteration for the better in the last years productions this they say threatens the destruction of that valuable branch of national commerce and then they recommend such regulations as if regulations in that state of things could be of any service as may obtain a profit in future instead of so considerable a loss which we can no longer sustain  your committee thought it necessary to inquire into the losses which had actually been suffered by this unnatural forced trade and find the loss so early as the season of 1776 to be 77650l that in the year 1777 it arose to 168205l this was so great that worse could hardly be apprehended however in the season of 1778 it amounted to 255070l in 1779 it was not so ruinously great because the whole import was not so considerable but it still stood enormously highso high as 141800l in the whole four years it came to 642725l the observations of the directors were found to be fully verified it is remarkable that the same article in the china trade produced a considerable and uniform profit on this circumstance little observation is necessary  during the time of their struggles for enlarging this losing trade which they considered as a national objectwhat in one point of view it was and if it had not been grossly mismanaged might have been in more than onein this part it is impossible to refuse to the directors a very great share of merit no degree of thought of trouble or of reasonable expense was spared by them for the improvement of the commodity they framed with diligence and apparently on very good information a code of manufacturing regulations for that purpose and several persons were sent out conversant in the italian method of preparing and winding silk aided by proper machines for facilitating and perfecting the work this under proper care and in course of time might have produced a real improvement to bengal but in the first instance it naturally drew the business from native management and it caused a revulsion from the trade and manufactures of india which led as naturally and inevitably to an european monopoly in some hands or other as any of the modes of coercion which were or could be employed the evil was present and inherent in the act the means of letting the natives into the benefit of the improved system of produce was likely to be counteracted by the general ill conduct of the companys concerns abroad for a while at least it had an effect still worse for the company purchasing the raw cocoon or silkpod at a fixed rate the first producer who whilst he could wind at his own house employed his family in this labor and could procure a reasonable livelihood by buying up the cocoons for the italian filature now incurred the enormous and ruinous loss of fifty per cent this appears in a letter to the presidency written by mr boughton rouse now a member of your committee but for a long time a considerable quantity of that in the old bengal mode of winding was bought for the company from contractors and it continues to be so bought to the present time but the directors complain in their letter of the 12th of may 1780 that both species and particularly the latter had risen so extravagantly that it was become more than forty per cent dearer than it had been fifteen years ago in that state of price they condemn their servants very justly for entering into contracts for three yearsand that for several kinds of silk of very different goodness upon averages unfairly formed where the commodities averaged at an equal price differed from twenty to thirty per cent on the sale soon after they formed a regular scale of fixed prices above which they found they could not trade without loss  whilst they were continuing these methods to secure themselves against future losses the bengal ships which arrived in that year announced nothing but their continuance some articles by the high price and others from their ill quality were such as never could answer to be sent to europe at any price the directors renew their prohibition of making fresh contracts the present being generally to expire in the year 1781 but this trade whose fundamental policy might have admitted of a doubt as applied to bengal whatever it might have been with regard to england was now itself expiring in the hands of the company so that they were obliged to apply to government for power to enlarge their capacity of receiving bills upon europe the purchase by these bills they entirely divert from raw silk and order to be laid out wholly in piecegoods  thus having found by experience that this trade whilst carried on upon the old principles of whatever advantage it might have been to the british manufacturers or to the individuals who were concerned in it in bengal had proved highly detrimental to the company the directors resolved to expunge the raw silk from their investment they gave up the whole to private traders on condition of paying the freight charges and dutiespermitting them to send it to europe in the companys ships upon their own account  the whole of this history will serve to demonstrate that all attempts which in their original system or in their necessary consequences tend to the distress of india must and in a very short time will make themselves felt even by those in whose favor such attempts have been made india may possibly in some future time bear and support itself under an extraction of measure treasure or of goods but much care ought to be taken that the influx of wealth shall be greater in quantity and prior in time to the waste  on abandoning the trade in silk to private hands the directors issued some prohibitions to prevent monopoly and they gave some directions about the improvement of the trade the prohibitions were proper and the directions prudent but it is much to be feared that whilst all the means instruments and powers remain by which monopolies were made and through which abuses formerly prevailed all verbal orders will be fruitless  this branch of trade being so long principally managed by the companys servants for the company and under its authority cannot be easily taken out of their hands and pass to the natives especially when it is to be carried on without the control naturally inherent in all participation it is not difficult to conceive how this forced preference of traffic in a raw commodity must have injured the manufactures while it was the policy of the company to continue the trade on their own account the servants so far from deviating from their course since they have taken the trade into their own management have gone much further into it the proportion of raw silk in the investment is to be augmented the proportion of the whole cargoes for the year 1783 divided into sixteen parts is ten of raw silk and six only of manufactured goods such is the proportion of this losing article in the scheme for the investment of private fortunes  in the reformed scheme of sending the investment on account of the company to be paid in bills upon europe no mention is made of any change of these proportions indeed some limits are attempted on the article of silk with regard to its price and it is not improbable that the price to the master and the servant will be very different but they cannot make profitable purchases of this article without strongly condemning all the former purchases of the board of trade   cloths or piecegoods  the general system above stated relative to the silk trade must materially have affected the manufactures of bengal merely as it was a system of preference it does by no means satisfactorily appear to your committee that the freedom held out by the companys various orders has been ever fully enjoyed or that the grievances of the native merchants and manufacturers have been redressed for we find on good authority that at that very period at which it might be supposed that these orders had their operation the oppressions were in full vigor they appear to have fallen heaviest on the city of dacca formerly the great staple for the finest goods in indiaa place once full of opulent merchants and dealers of all descriptions  the city and district of dacca before the prevalence of the east india companys influence and authority manufactured annually to about three hundred thousand pounds value in cloths in the year 1776 it had fallen to about two hundred thousand or two thirds of its former produce of this the companys demand amounted only to a fourth part that is about fifty thousand pounds yearly this was at that time provided by agents for the company under the inspection of their commercial servants on pretence of securing an advantage for this fourth part for their masters they exerted a most violent and arbitrary power over the whole it was asserted that they fixed the companys mark to such goods as they thought fit to all goods as stated in one complaint and disposed of them as they thought proper excluding not only all the native dealers but the dutch company and private english merchantsthat they made advances to the weavers often beyond their known ability to repay in goods within the year and by this means having got them in debt held them in perpetual servitude their inability to keep accounts left them at the discretion of the agents of the supreme power to make their balances what they pleased and they recovered them not by legal process but by seizure of their goods and arbitrary imprisonment of their persons one and the same dealer made the advance valued the return stated the account passed the judgment and executed the process  mr rouse chief of the dacca province who struggled against those evils says that in the year 1773 there were no balances due as the trade was then carried on by the native brokers in less than three years these balances amounted to an immense suma sum lost to the company but existing in full force for every purpose of oppression in the amount of these balances almost every weaver in the country bore a part and consequently they were almost all caught in this snare they are in general says mr rouse in a letter to general clavering delivered to your committee a timid helpless people many of them poor to the utmost degree of wretchedness incapable of keeping accounts industrious as it were by instinct unable to defend themselves if oppressed and satisfied if with continual labor they derive from the fair dealing and humanity of their employer a moderate subsistence for their families  such were the people who stood accused by the companys agents as pretending grievances in order to be excused the payment of their balances as to the commercial state of the province in general mr rouse represents it to be for those two years a perpetual scene of complaint and disputationthe companys agents professing to pay higher rates to weavers whilst the leadenhall sales showed an heavy loss to the company the weavers have even travelled in multitudes to prefer their complaints at the presidency the amount of the investment comparatively small with balances comparatively large and as i understand generally contested by the weavers the native merchants called delâls removed from their influence as prejudicial to the companys concerns and european merchants complaining against undue influence of the companys commercial agents in preventing the free purchase even of those goods which the company never takes  the spirit of those agents will be fully comprehended from a state of the proceedings before mr rouse and council on the complaint of a mr cree an english free merchant at dacca who had been twice treated in the same injurious manner by the agents of mr hurst the commercial chief at that place on his complaint to the board of the seizure of the goods and imprisonment of his agents mr hurst was called upon for an explanation in return he informed them that he had sent to one of the villages to inquire concerning the matter of fact alleged the impartial person sent to make this inquiry was the very man accused of the oppressions into which he was sent to examine the answer of mr hurst is in an high and determined tone he does not deny that there are some instances of abuse of power but i ask says he what authority can guard against the conduct of individuals but that a single instance cannot be brought of a general depravity your committee have reason to believe these coercive measures to have been very general though employed according to the degree of resistance opposed to the monopoly for we find at one time the whole trade of the dutch involved in the general servitude but it appears very extraordinary that nothing but the actual proof of a general abuse could affect a practice the very principle of which tends to make the coercion as general as the trade mr hursts reflection concerning the abuse of authority is just but in this case it is altogether inapplicable because the complaint was not of the abuse but of the use of authority in matters of trade which ought to have been free he throws out a variety of invidious reflections against the council as if they wanted zeal for the companys service his justification of his practices and his declaration of his resolution to persevere in them are firm and determinedasserting the right and policy of such restraints and laying down a rule for his conduct at the factory which he says will give no cause of just complaint to private traders he adds i have no doubt but that they have hitherto provided investments and it cannot turn to my interest to preclude them now though i must ever think it my duty to combat the private views of individuals who set themselves up as competitors under that very body under whose license and indulgence only they can derive their privilege of trade all i contend for is the same influence my employers have ever had he ends by declining any reply to any of their future references of this nature  the whole of this extraordinary letter is inserted in the appendix no 51and mr rouses minute of observations upon it in appendix no 52 fully refuting the few pretexts alleged in that extraordinary performance in support of the trade by influence and authority mr hollond one of the council joined mr rouse in opinion that a letter to the purport of that minute should be written but they were overruled by messrs purling hogarth and shakespeare who passed a resolution to defer sending any reply to mr hurst and none was ever sent thus they gave countenance to the doctrine contained in that letter as well as to the mischievous practices which must inevitably arise from the exercise of such power some temporary and partial relief was given by the vigorous exertions of mr rouse but he shortly after removing from that government all complaints were dropped  it is remarkable that during the long and warm contest between the companys agents and the dealers of dacca the board of trade seem to have taken a decided part against the latter they allow some sort of justice in the complaints of the manufacturers with regard to low valuation and other particulars but they say that although during the time of preëmption it appears that the weavers were not allowed the same liberty of selling to individuals they before enjoyed our opinion on the whole is that these complaints have originated upon the premeditated designs of the delâls factors or brokers to thwart the new mode of carrying on the companys business and to render themselves necessary they say in another place that there is no ground for the dissatisfactions and difficulties of the weavers that they are owing to the delâls whose aim it is to be employed  this desire of being employed and of rendering themselves necessary in men whose only business it is to be employed in trade is considered by the gentlemen of the board as no trivial offence and accordingly they declare they have established it as an invariable rule that whatever deficiency there might be in the dacca investment no purchase of the manufactures of that quarter shall be made for account of the company from private merchants we have passed this resolution which we deem of importance from a persuasion that private merchants are often induced to make advances for dacca goods not by the ordinary chance of sale but merely from an expectation of disposing of them at an enhanced price to the company against whom a rivalship is by this manner encouraged and they say that they intend to observe the same rule with respect to the investment of other of the factories from whence similar complaints may come  this positive rule is opposed to the positive directions of the company to employ those obnoxious persons by preference how far this violent use of authority for the purpose of destroying rivalship has succeeded in reducing the price of goods to the company has been made manifest by the facts before stated in their place  the recriminatory charges of the companys agents on the native merchants have made very little impression on your committee we have nothing in favor of them but the assertion of a party powerful and interested in such cases of mutual assertion and denial your committee are led irresistibly to attach abuse to power and to presume that suffering and hardship are more likely to attend on weakness than that any combination of unprotected individuals is of force to prevail over influence power wealth and authority the complaints of the native merchants ought not to have been treated in any of those modes in which they were then treated and when men are in the situation of complainants against unbounded power their abandoning their suit is far from a full and clear proof of their complaints being groundless it is not because redress has been rendered impracticable that oppression does not exist nor is the despair of sufferers any alleviation of their afflictions a review of some of the most remarkable of the complaints made by the native merchants in that province is so essential for laying open the true spirit of the commercial administration and the real condition of those concerned in trade there that your committee observing the records on this subject and at this period full of them they could not think themselves justifiable in not stating them to the house  your committee have found many heavy charges of oppression against mr barwell whilst factory chief at dacca which oppressions are stated to have continued and even to have been aggravated on complaint at calcutta these complaints appear in several memorials presented to the supreme council of calcutta of which mr barwell was a member they appeared yet more fully and more strongly in a bill in chancery filed in the supreme court which was afterwards recorded before the governorgeneral and council and transmitted to the court of directors  your committee struck with the magnitude and importance of these charges and finding that with regard to those before the council no regular investigation has ever taken place and finding also that mr barwell had asserted in a minute of council that he had given a full answer to the allegations in that bill ordered a copy of the answer to be laid before your committee that they might be enabled to state to the house how far it appeared to them to be full how far the charges were denied as to the fact or where the facts might be admitted what justification was set up it appeared necessary in order to determine on the true situation of the trade and the merchants of that great city and district  the secretary to the court of directors has informed your committee that no copy of the answer is to be found in the india house nor has your committee been able to discover that any has been transmitted on this failure your committee ordered an application to be made to mr barwell for a copy of his answer to the bill and any other information with which he might be furnished with regard to that subject  mr barwell after reciting the above letter returned in answer what follows  whether the records of the supreme court of judicature are lodged at the india house i am ignorant but on those records my answer is certainly to be found at this distance of time i am sorry i cannot from memory recover the circumstances of this affair but this i know that the bill did receive a complete answer and the people the fullest satisfaction nor is it necessary for me to remark that in the state of parties at that time in bengal could party have brought forward any particle of that bill supported by any verified fact the principle that introduced it in the proceedings of the governorgeneral and council would likewise have given the verification of that one circumstance whatever that might have been as i generally attend in my place in the house i shall with pleasure answer any invitation of the gentlemen of the committee to attend their investigations up stairs with every information and light in my power to give them  st jamess square 15th april 1783  your committee considered that with regard to the matter charged in the several petitions to the board no sort of specific answer had been given at the time and place where they were made and when and where the parties might be examined and confronted it was considered also that the bill had been transmitted with other papers relating to the same matter to the court of directors with the knowledge and consent of mr barwelland that he states that his answer had been filed and no proceedings had upon it for eighteen months in that situation it was thought something extraordinary that no care was taken by him to transmit so essential a paper as his answer and that he had no copy of it in his hands  your committee in this difficulty thought themselves obliged to decline any verbal explanation from the person who is defendant in the suit relative to matters which on the part of the complainant appear upon record and to leave the whole matter as it is charged to the judgment of the house to determine how far it may be worthy of a further inquiry or how far they may admit such allegations as your committee could not think themselves justified in receiving to this effect your committee ordered a letter to be written mr barwell from whom they received the following answer  sirin consequence of your letter of the 17th i must request the favor of you to inform the select committee that i expect from their justice on any matter of public record in which i am personally to be brought forward to the notice of the house that they will at the same time point out to the house what part of such matter has been verified and what parts have not nor ever were attempted to be verified though introduced in debate and entered on the records of the governorgeneral and council of bengal i am anxious the information should be complete or the house will not be competent to judge and if it is complete it will preclude all explanation as unnecessary    i am sir     your most obedient humble servant       richard barwell    st jamess square 22nd april 1783  ps as i am this moment returned from the country i had it not in my power to be earlier in acknowledging your letter of the 17th  your committee applied to mr barwell to communicate any papers which might tend to the elucidation of matters before them in which he was concerned this he has declined to do your committee conceive that under the orders of the house they are by no means obliged to make a complete state of all the evidence which may tend to criminate or exculpate every person whose transactions they may find it expedient to report this if not specially ordered has not hitherto been as they apprehend the usage of any committee of this house it is not for your committee but for the discretion of the party to call for and for the wisdom of the house to institute such proceedings as may tend finally to condemn or acquit the reports of your committee are no charges though they may possibly furnish matter for charge and no representations or observations of theirs can either clear or convict on any proceeding which may hereafter be grounded on the facts which they produce to the house their opinions are not of a judicial nature your committee has taken abundant care that every important fact in their report should be attended with the authority for it either in the course of their reflections or in the appendix to report everything upon every subject before them which is to be found on the records of the company would be to transcribe and in the event to print almost the whole of those voluminous papers the matter which appears before them is in a summary manner this  the dacca merchants begin by complaining that in november 1773 mr richard barwell then chief of dacca had deprived them of their employment and means of subsistence that he had extorted from them 44224 arcot rupees 4731l by the terror of his threats by long imprisonment and cruel confinement in the stocks that afterwards they were confined in a small room near the factorygate under a guard of sepoys that their food was stopped and they remained starving a whole day that they were not permitted to take their food till next day at noon and were again brought back to the same confinement in which they were continued for six days and were not set at liberty until they had given mr barwells banian a certificate for forty thousand rupees that in july 1774 when mr barwell had left dacca they went to calcutta to seek justice that mr barwell confined them in his house at calcutta and sent them back under a guard of peons to dacca that in december 1774 on the arrival of the gentlemen from europe they returned to calcutta and preferred their complaint to the supreme court of judicature  the bill in chancery filed against richard barwell john shakespeare and others contains a minute specification of the various acts of personal cruelty said to be practised by mr barwells orders to extort money from these people among other acts of a similar nature he is charged with having ordered the appraiser of the companys cloths who was an old man and who asserts that he had faithfully served the company above sixteen years without the least censure on his conduct to be severely flogged without reason  in the manner of confining the delâls with ten of their servants it is charged on him that when he first ordered them to be put into the stocks it was at a time when the weather was exceedingly bad and the rain very heavy without allowing them the least covering for their heads or any part of their body or anything to raise them from the wet ground in which condition they were continued for many hours until the said richard barwell thought proper to remove them into a far worse state if possible as if studying to exercise the most cruel acts of barbarity on them c and that during their imprisonment they were frequently carried to and tortured in the stocks in the middle of the day when the scorching heat of the sun was insupportable notwithstanding which they were denied the least covering these men assert that they had served the company without blame for thirty yearsa period commencing long before the power of the company in india  it was no slight aggravation of this severity that the objects were not young nor of the lowest of the people who might by the vigor of their constitutions or by the habits of hardship be enabled to bear up against treatment so full of rigor they were aged persons they were men of a reputable profession  the account given by these merchants of their first journey to calcutta in july 1774 is circumstantial and remarkable they say that on their arrival to their astonishment they soon learned that the governor who had formerly been violently enraged against the said richard barwell for different improprieties in his conduct was now reconciled to him and that ever since there was a certainty of his majestys appointments taking place in india from being the most inveterate enemies they were now become the most intimate friends and that this account soon taught them to believe they were not any nearer justice from their journey to calcutta than they had been before at dacca  when this bill of complaint was in 1776 laid before the council to be transmitted to the court of directors mr barwell complained of the introduction of such a paper and asserted that he had answered to every particular of it on oath about eighteen months and that during this long period no attempt had been made to controvert refute or even to reply to it  he did not however think it proper to enter his answer on the records along with the bill of whose introduction he complained  on the declarations made by mr barwell in his minute september 1776 your committee observe that considering him only as an individual under prosecution in a court of justice it might be sufficient for him to exhibit his defence in the court where he was accused but that as a member of government specifically charged before that very government with abusing the powers of his office in a very extraordinary manner and for purposes as they allege highly corrupt and criminal it appears to your committee hardly sufficient to say that he had answered elsewhere the matter was to go before the court of directors to whom the question of his conduct in that situation a situation of the highest power and trust was as much at least a question of state as a matter of redress to be solely left to the discretion capacity or perseverance of individuals mr barwell might possibly be generous enough to take no advantage of his eminent situation but these unfortunate people would rather look to his power than his disposition in general a man so circumstanced and so charged though we do not know this to be the case with mr barwell might easily contrive by legal advantages to escape the plaintiffs being at a great distance from the seat of government and possibly affected by fear or fatigue or seeing the impossibility of sustaining with the ruins of fortunes never perhaps very opulent a suit against wealth power and influence a compromise might even take place in which circumstances might make the complainants gladly acquiesce but the public injury is not in the least repaired by the acquiescence of individuals as it touched the honor of the very highest parts of government in the opinion of your committee some means ought to have been taken to bring the bill to a discussion on the merits or supposing that such decree could not be obtained by reason of any failure of proceeding on the part of the plaintiffs that some process official or juridical ought to have been instituted against them which might prove them guilty of slander and defamation in as authentic a manner as they had made their charge before the council as well as the court  by the determination of mr hurst and the resolutions of the board of trade it is much to be apprehended that the native mercantile interest must be exceedingly reduced the abovementioned resolutions of the board of trade if executed in their rigor must almost inevitably accomplish its ruin the subsequent transactions are covered with an obscurity which your committee have not been able to dispel all which they can collect but that by no means distinctly is that as those who trade for the company in the articles of investment may also trade for themselves in the same articles the old opportunities of confounding the capacities must remain and all the oppressions by which this confusion has been attended the companys investments as the general letter from bengal of the 20th of november 1775 par 28 states the matter are never at a stand advances are made and goods are received all the year round balances the grand instrument of oppression naturally accumulate on poor manufacturers who are intrusted with money where there is not a vigorous rivalship not only tolerated but encouraged it is impossible ever to redeem the manufacturers from the servitude induced by those unpaid balances  no such rivalship does exist the policy practised and avowed is directly against it the reason assigned in the board of trades letter of the 28th of november 1778 for its making their advances early in the season is to prevent the foreign merchants and private traders interfering with the purchase of their the companys assortments they also refer to the means taken to prevent this interference in their letter of 26th january 1779 it is impossible that the small part of the trade should not fall into the hands of those who with the name and authority of the governing persons have such extensive contracts in their hands it appears in evidence that natives can hardly trade to the best advantage your committee doubt whether they can trade to any advantage at all if not joined with or countenanced by british subjects the directors were in 1775 so strongly impressed with this notion and conceived the native merchants to have been even then reduced to so low a state that notwithstanding the companys earnest desire of giving them a preference they doubt whether there are at this time in bengal native merchants possessed of property adequate to such undertaking or of credit and responsibility sufficient to make it safe and prudent to trust them with such sums as might be necessary to enable them to fulfil their engagements with the company  the effect which so long continued a monopoly followed by a preëmption and then by partial preferences supported by power must necessarily have in weakening the mercantile capital and disabling the merchants from all undertakings of magnitude is but too visible however a witness of understanding and credit does not believe the capitals of the natives to be yet so reduced as to disable them from partaking in the trade if they were otherwise able to put themselves on an equal footing with europeans  the difficulties at the outset will however be considerable for the long continuance of abuse has in some measure conformed the whole trade of the country to its false principle to make a sudden change therefore might destroy the few advantages which attend any trade without securing those which must flow from one established upon sound mercantile principles whenever such a trade can be established the fact is that the forcible direction which the trade of india has had towards europe to the neglect or rather to the total abandoning of the asiatic has of itself tended to carry even the internal business from the native merchant the revival of trade in the native hands is of absolute necessity but your committee is of opinion that it will rather be the effect of a regular progressive course of endeavors for that purpose than of any one regulation however wisely conceived  after this examination into the condition of the trade and traders in the principal articles provided for the investment to europe your committee proceeded to take into consideration those articles the produce of which after sale in bengal is to form a part of the fund for the purchase of other articles of investment or to make a part of it in kind these are 1st opium2ndly saltpetreand 3rdly salt these are all monopolized   opium  the first of the internal authorized monopolies is that of opium this drug extracted from a species of the poppy is of extensive consumption in most of the eastern markets the best is produced in the province of bahar in bengal it is of an inferior sort though of late it has been improved this monopoly is to be traced to the very origin of our influence in bengal it is stated to have begun at patna so early as the year 1761 but it received no considerable degree of strength or consistence until the year 1765 when the acquisition of the duanné opened a wide field for all projects of this nature it was then adopted and owned as a resource for persons in officewas managed chiefly by the civil servants of the patna factory and for their own benefit the policy was justified on the usual principles on which monopolies are supported and on some peculiar to the commodity to the nature of the trade and to the state of the country the security against adulteration the prevention of the excessive home consumption of a pernicious drug the stopping an excessive competition which by an overproportioned supply would at length destroy the market abroad the inability of the cultivator to proceed in an expensive and precarious culture without a large advance of capital and lastly the incapacity of private merchants to supply that capital on the feeble security of wretched farmers  these were the principal topics on which the monopoly was supported the last topic leads to a serious consideration on the state of the country for in pushing it the gentlemen argued that in case such private merchants should advance the necessary capital the lower cultivators would get money in abundance admitting this fact it seems to be a part of the policy of this monopoly to prevent the cultivator from obtaining the natural fruits of his labor dealing with a private merchant he could not get money in abundance unless his commodity could produce an abundant profit further reasons relative to the peace and good order of the province were assigned for thus preventing the course of trade from the equitable distribution of the advantages of the produce in which the first the poorest and the most laborious producer ought to have his first share the cultivators they add would squander part of the money and not be able to complete their engagements to the full lawsuits and even battles would ensue between the factors contending for a deficient produce and the farmers would discourage the culture of an object which brought so much disturbance into their districts this competition the operation of which they endeavor to prevent is the natural corrective of the abuse and the best remedy which could be applied to the disorder even supposing its probable existence  upon whatever reasons or pretences the monopoly of opium was supported the real motive appears to be the profit of those who were in hopes to be concerned in it as these profits promised to be very considerable at length it engaged the attention of the company and after many discussions and various plans of application it was at length taken for their benefit and the produce of the sale ordered to be employed in the purchase of goods for their investment  in the year 1773 it had been taken out of the hands of the council of patna and leased to two of the nativesbut for a year only the contractors were to supply a certain quantity of opium at a given price half the value was to be paid to those contractors in advance and the other half on the delivery  the proceedings on this contract demonstrated the futility of all the principles on which the monopoly was founded the council as a part of their plan were obliged by heavy duties and by a limitation of the right of emption of foreign opium to the contractors for the home produce to check the influx of that commodity from the territories of the nabob of oude and the rajah of benares in these countries no monopoly existed and yet there the commodity was of such a quality and so abundant as to bear the duty and even with the duty in some degree to rival the monopolist even in his own market there was no complaint in those countries of want of advances to cultivators or of lawsuits and tumults among the factors nor was there any appearance of the multitude of other evils which had been so much dreaded from the vivacity of competition  on the other hand several of the precautions inserted in this contract and repeated in all the subsequent strongly indicated the evils against which it is extremely difficult if not impossible to guard a monopoly of this nature and in that country for in the first contract entered into with the two natives it was strictly forbidden to compel the tenants to the cultivation of this drug indeed very shocking rumors had gone abroad and they were aggravated by an opinion universally prevalent that even in the season immediately following that dreadful famine which swept off one third of the inhabitants of bengal several of the poorer farmers were compelled to plough up the fields they had sown with grain in order to plant them with poppies for the benefit of the engrossers of opium this opinion grew into a strong presumption when it was seen that in the next year the produce of opium contrary to what might be naturally expected in a year following such a dearth was nearly doubled it is true that when the quantity of land necessary for the production of the largest quantity of opium is considered it is not just to attribute that famine to these practices nor to any that were or could be used yet where such practices did prevail they must have been very oppressive to individuals extremely insulting to the feelings of the people and must tend to bring great and deserved discredit on the british government the english are a people who appear in india as a conquering nation all dealing with them is therefore more or less a dealing with power it is such when they trade on a private account and it is much more so in any authorized monopoly where the hand of government which ought never to appear but to protect is felt as the instrument in every act of oppression abuses must exist in a trade and a revenue so constituted and there is no effectual cure for them but to entirely cut off their cause  things continued in this train until the great revolution in the companys government was wrought by the regulating act of the thirteenth of the king in 1775 the new councilgeneral appointed by the act took this troublesome business again into consideration general clavering colonel monson and mr francis expressed such strong doubts of the propriety of this and of all other monopolies that the directors in their letter of the year following left the council at liberty to throw the trade open under a duty if they should find it practicable but general clavering who most severely censured monopoly in general thought that this monopoly ought to be retainedbut for a reason which shows his opinion of the wretched state of the country for he supposed it impossible with the power and influence which must attend british subjects in all their transactions that monopoly could be avoided and he preferred an avowed monopoly which brought benefit to government to a virtual engrossing attended with profit only to individuals but in this opinion he did not seem to be joined by mr francis who thought the suppression of this and of all monopolies to be practicable and strongly recommended their abolition in a plan sent to the court of directors the year following6  the council however submitting to the opinion of this necessity endeavored to render that dubious engagement as beneficial as possible to the company they began by putting up the contract to the highest bidder the proposals were to be sealed when the seals came to be opened a very extraordinary scene appeared every step in this business develops more and more the effect of this junction of public monopoly and private influence four english and eight natives were candidates for the contract three of the english far overbid the eight natives they who consider that the natives from their superior dexterity from their knowledge of the country and of business and from their extreme industry vigilance and parsimony are generally an overmatch for europeans and indeed are and must ultimately be employed by them in all transactions whatsoever will find it very extraordinary that they did not by the best offers secure this dealing to themselves it can be attributed to this cause and this onlythat they were conscious that without power and influence to subdue the cultivators of the land to their own purposes they never could afford to engage on the lowest possible terms those whose power entered into the calculation of their profits could offer as they did offer terms without comparison better and therefore one of the english bidders without partiality secured the preference  the contract to this first bidder mr griffiths was prolonged from year to year and as during that time frequent complaints were made by him to the council board on the principle that the years answered very differently and that the business of one year ran into the other reasons or excuses were furnished for giving the next contract to mr mackenzie for three years this third contract was not put up to auction as the second had been and as this ought to have been the terms were indeed something better for the company and the engagement was subject to qualifications which though they did not remove the objection to the breach of the companys orders prevented the hands of the directors from being tied up a proviso was inserted in the contract that it should not be anyways binding if the company by orders from home should alter the existing practice with regard to such dealing  whilst these things were going on the evils which this monopoly was in show and pretence formed to prevent still existed and those which were naturally to be expected from a monopoly existed too complaints were made of the bad quality of the opium trials were made and on those trials the opium was found faulty an office of inspection at calcutta to ascertain its goodness was established and directions given to the provincial councils at the places of growth to certify the quantity and quality of the commodity transmitted to the presidency  in 1776 notwithstanding an engagement in the contract strictly prohibiting all compulsory culture of the poppy information was given to a member of the councilgeneral that fields green with rice had been forcibly ploughed up to make way for that plantand that this was done in the presence of several english gentlemen who beheld the spectacle with a just and natural indignation the board struck with this representation ordered the council of patna to make an inquiry into the fact but your committee can find no return whatsoever to this order the complaints were not solely on the part of the cultivators against the contractor the contractor for opium made loud complaints against the inferior collectors of the landed revenue stating their undue and vexatious exactions from the cultivators of opiumtheir throwing these unfortunate people into prison upon frivolous pretences by which the tenants were ruined and the contractors advances lost he stated that if the contractor should interfere in favor of the cultivator then a deficiency would be caused to appear in the landed revenues and that deficiency would be charged on his interposition he desired therefore that the cultivators of opium should be taken out of the general system of the landed revenue and put under his protection here the effect naturally to be expected from the clashing of inconsistent revenues appeared in its full light as well as the state of the unfortunate peasants of bengal between such rival protectors where the ploughman flying from the taxgatherer is obliged to take refuge under the wings of the monopolist no dispute arises amongst the english subjects which does not divulge the misery of the natives when the former are in harmony all is well with the latter  this monopoly continuing and gathering strength through a succession of contractors and being probably a most lucrative dealing it grew to be every day a greater object of competition the council of patna endeavored to recover the contract or at least the agency by the most inviting terms and in this eager state of mutual complaint and competition between private men and public bodies things continued until the arrival in bengal of mr stephen sulivan son of mr sulivan chairman of the east india company which soon put an end to all strife and emulation  to form a clear judgment on the decisive step taken at this period it is proper to keep in view the opinion of the court of directors concerning monopolies against which they had uniformly declared in the most precise terms they never submitted to them but as to a present necessity it was therefore not necessary for them to express any particular approbation of a clause in mr mackenzies contract which was made in favor of their own liberty every motive led them to preserve it on the security of that clause they could alone have suffered to pass over in silence for they never approved the grant of the contract which contained it for three years it must also be remembered that they had from the beginning positively directed that the contract should be put up to public auction and this not having been done in mr mackenzies case they severely reprimanded the governorgeneral and council in their letter of the 23rd december 1778  the court of directors were perfectly right in showing themselves tenacious of this regulationnot so much to secure the best practicable revenue from their monopoly whilst it existed but for a much more essential reason that is from the corrective which this method administered to that monopoly itself it prevented the british contractor from becoming doubly terrible to the natives when they should see that his contract was in effect a grant and therefore indicated particular favor and private influence with the ruling members of an absolute government  on the expiration of mr mackenzies term and but a few months after mr sulivans arrival the governorgeneral as if the contract was a matter of patronage and not of dealing pitched upon mr sulivan as the most proper person for the management of this critical concern mr sulivan though a perfect stranger to bengal and to that sort and to all sorts of local commerce made no difficulty of accepting it the governorgeneral was so fearful that his true motives in this business should be mistaken or that the smallest suspicion should arise of his attending to the companys orders that far from putting up the contract which on account of its known profits had become the object of such pursuit to public auction he did not wait for receiving so much as a private proposal from mr sulivan the secretary perceived that in the rough draught of the contract the old recital of a proposal to the board was inserted as a matter of course but was contrary to the fact he therefore remarked it to mr hastings mr hastings with great indifference ordered that recital to be omitted and the omission with the remark that led to it has with the same easy indifference been sent over to his masters  the governorgeneral and council declare themselves apprehensive that mr sulivan might be a loser by his bargain upon account of troubles which they supposed existing in the country which was the object of it this was the more indulgent because the contractor was tolerably secured against all losses he received a certain price for his commodity but he was not obliged to pay any certain price to the cultivator who having no other market than his must sell it to him at his own terms he was to receive half the yearly payment by advance and he was not obliged to advance to the cultivator more than what he thought expedient but if this should not be enough he might if he pleased draw the whole payment before the total delivery such were the terms of the engagement with him he is a contractor of a new species who employs no capital whatsoever of his own and has the market of compulsion at his entire command but all these securities were not sufficient for the anxious attention of the supreme council to mr sulivans welfare mr hastings had before given him the contract without any proposal on his part and to make their gift perfect in a second instance they proceed a step beyond their former ill precedent and they contract with mr sulivan for four years  nothing appears to have been considered but the benefit of the contractor and for this purpose the solicitude shown in all the provisions could not be exceeded one of the first things that struck mr hastings as a blemish on his gift was the largeness of the penalty which he had on former occasions settled as the sanction of the contract this he now discovered to be so great as to be likely to frustrate its end by the impossibility of recovering so large a sum how a large penalty can prevent the recovery of any even the smallest part of it is not quite apparent in so vast a concern as that of opium a fraud which at first view may not appear of much importance and which may be very difficult in the discovery may easily counterbalance the reduced penalty in this contract which was settled in favor of mr sulivan at about 20000l  monopolies were as the house has observed only tolerated evils and at best upon trial a clause therefore was inserted in the contracts to mackenzie annulling the obligation if the court of directors should resolve to abolish the monopoly but at the request of mr sulivan the contract was without difficulty purged of this obnoxious clause the term was made absolute the monopoly rendered irrevocable and the discretion of the directors wholly excluded mr hastings declared the reserved condition to be no longer necessary because the directors had approved the monopoly  the chiefs and councils at the principal factories had been obliged to certify the quantity and quality of the opium before its transport to calcutta and their control over the contractor had been assigned as the reason for not leaving to those factories the management of this monopoly now things were changed orders were sent to discontinue this measure of invidious precaution and the opium was sent to calcutta without anything done to ascertain its quality or even its quantity  an office of inspection had been also appointed to examine the quality of the opium on its delivery at the capital settlement in order to ease mr sulivan from this troublesome formality mr hastings abolished the office so that mr sulivan was then totally freed from all examination or control whatsoever either first or last  these extraordinary changes in favor of mr sulivan were attended with losses to others and seem to have excited much discontent this discontent it was necessary in some manner to appease the venduemaster who was deprived of his accustomed dues on the public sales of the opium by the private dealing made a formal complaint to the board against this as well as other proceedings relative to the same business he attributed the private sale to reasons of state and this strong reflection both on the board of trade and the council board was passed over without observation he was quieted by appointing him to the duty of these very inspectors whose office had been just abolished as useless the house will judge of the efficacy of the revival of this office by the motives to it and by mr hastings giving that to one as a compensation which had been executed by several as a duty however the orders for taking away the precautionary inspection at patna still remained in force  some benefits which had been given to former contractors at the discretion of the board were no longer held under that loose indulgence but were secured to mr sulivan by his contract other indulgences of a lesser nature and to which no considerable objection could be made were on the application of a mr benn calling himself his attorney granted  your committee examining mr higginson late a member of the board of trade on that subject were informed that this contract very soon after the making was generally understood at calcutta to have been sold to this mr benn but he could not particularize the sum for which it had been assignedand that mr benn had afterwards sold it to a mr young by this transaction it appears clearly that the contract was given to mr sulivan for no other purpose than to supply him with a sum of money and the sale and resale seem strongly to indicate that the reduction of the penalty and the other favorable conditions were not granted for his ease in a business which he never was to execute but to heighten the value of the object which he was to sell mr sulivan was at the time in mr hastingss family accompanied him in his progresses and held the office of judgeadvocate  the monopoly given for these purposes thus permanently secured all power of reformation cut off and almost every precaution against fraud and oppression removed the supreme council found or pretended to find that the commodity for which they had just made such a contract was not a salable articleand in consequence of this opinion or pretence entered upon a daring speculation hitherto unthought of that of sending the commodity on the companys account to the market of canton the council alleged that the dutch being driven from bengal and the seas being infested with privateers this commodity had none or a very dull and depreciated demand  had this been true mr hastingss conduct could admit of no excuse he ought not to burden a falling market by long and heavy engagements he ought studiously to have kept in his power the means of proportioning the supply to the demand but his arguments and those of the council on that occasion do not deserve the smallest attention facts to which there is no testimony but the assertion of those who produce them in apology for the ill consequences of their own irregular actions cannot be admitted mr hastings and the council had nothing at all to do with that business the court of directors had wholly taken the management of opium out of his and their hands and by a solemn adjudication fixed it in the board of trade but after it had continued there some years mr hastings a little before his grant of the monopoly to mr sulivan thought proper to reverse the decree of his masters and by his own authority to recall it to the council by this step he became responsible for all the consequences  the board of trade appear indeed to merit reprehension for disposing of the opium by private contract as by that means the unerring standard of the public market cannot be applied to it but they justified themselves by their success and one of their members informed your committee that their last sale had been a good one and though he apprehended a fall in the next it was not such as in the opinion of your committee could justify the councilgeneral in having recourse to untried and hazardous speculations of commerce it appears that there must have been a market and one sufficiently lively they assign as a reason of this assigned alleged dulness of demand that the dutch had been expelled from bengal and could not carry the usual quantity to batavia but the danes were not expelled from bengal and portuguese ships traded there neither of them were interdicted at batavia and the trade to the eastern ports was free to them the danes actually applied for and obtained an increase of the quantity to which their purchases had been limited and as they asked so they received this indulgence as a great favor it does not appear that they were not very ready to supply the place of the dutch on the other hand there is no doubt that the dutch would most gladly receive an article convenient if not necessary to the circulation of their commerce from the danes or under any name nor was it fit that the company should use an extreme strictness in any inquiry concerning the necessary disposal of one of their own staple commodities  the supply of the canton treasury with funds for the provision of the next years china investment was the ground of this plan but the councilgeneral appear still to have the particular advantage of mr sulivan in viewand not satisfied with breaking so many of the companys orders for that purpose to make the contract an object salable to the greatest advantage were obliged to transfer their personal partiality from mr sulivan to the contract itself and to hand it over to the assignees through all their successions when the opium was delivered the duties and emoluments of the contractor ended but it appears from mr williamsons letter 18th october 1781 and it is not denied by the councilgeneral this new scheme furnished them with a pretext of making him broker for the china investment with the profit of a new commissionto what amount does not appear but here their constant and vigilant observer the venduemaster met them againthey seemed to live in no small terror of this gentleman to satisfy him for the loss of his fee to which he was entitled upon the public sale they gave him also a commission of one per cent on the investment thus was this object loaded with a double commission and every act of partiality to one person produced a chargeable compensation to some other for the injustice that such partiality produced nor was this the whole the discontent and envy excited by this act went infinitely further than to those immediately affected and something or other was to be found out to satisfy as many as possible  as soon as it was discovered that the council entertained a design of opening a trade on those principles it immediately engaged the attention of such as had an interest in speculations of freight  a memorial seems to have been drawn early as it is dated on the 29th of march though it was not the first publicly presented to the board this memorial was presented on the 17th of september 1781 by mr wheler conformably as he says to the desire of the governorgeneral and it contained a long and elaborate dissertation on the trade to china tending to prove the advantage of extending the sale of english manufactures and other goods to the north of that country beyond the usual emporium of european nations this ample and not illreasoned theoretical performance though not altogether new either in speculation or attempt ended by a practical proposition very short indeed of the ideas opened in the preliminary discourse but better adapted to the immediate effect it was that the company should undertake the sale of its own opium in china and commit the management of the business to the memorialist who offered to furnish them with a strong armed ship for that purpose the offer was accepted and the agreement made with him for the transport of two thousand chests  a proposal by another person was made the july following the date of this project it appears to have been early in the formal delivery at the board this was for the export of one thousand four hundred and eighty chests this too was accepted but with new conditions and restrictions for in so vast and so new an undertaking great difficulties occurred in the first place all importation of that commodity is rigorously forbidden by the laws of china the impropriety of a political trader who is lord over a great empire being concerned in a contraband trade upon his own account did not seem in the least to affect them but they were struck with the obvious danger of subjecting their goods to seizure by the vastness of the prohibited import to secure the larger adventure they require of the china factory that colonel watsons ship should enter the port of canton as an armed ship they would not say a ship of war though that must be meant that her cargo should not be reported they also ordered that other measures should be adopted to secure this prohibited article from seizure if the cargo should get in safe another danger was in viewthe overloading the chinese market by a supply beyond the demand for it is obvious that contraband trade must exist by small quantities of goods poured in by intervals and not by great importations at one time to guard against this inconvenience they divide their second though the smaller adventure into two parts one of which was to go to the markets of the barbarous natives which inhabit the coast of malacca where the chances of its being disposed of by robbery or sale were at least equal if the opium should be disposed of there the produce was to be invested in merchandise salable in china or in dollars if to be had the other part about one half was to go in kind directly to the port of canton  the dealing at this time seemed closed but the gentlemen who chartered the ships always recollecting something applied anew to the board to be furnished with cannon from the companys ordnance some was delivered to them but the office of ordnance so heavily expensive to the company was not sufficient to spare a few iron guns for a merchant ship orders were given to cast a few cannon and an application made to madras at a thousand miles distance for the rest madras answers that they cannot exactly comply with the requisition but still the board at bengal hopes better things from them than they promise and flatter themselves that with their assistance they shall properly arm a ship of thirtytwo guns  whilst these dispositions were making the first proposer perceiving advantages from the circuitous voyage of the second which had escaped his observation to make amends for his first omission improved both on his own proposal and on that of the person who had improved on him he therefore applied for leave to take two hundred and fifty chests on his own account which he said could be readily disposed of at the several places where it was necessary for the ship to touch for wood and water or intelligence during her intended voyage through the eastern islands as a corrective to this extraordinary request he assured the board that if he should meet with any unexpected delay at these markets he would send their cargo to its destination having secured a swiftsailing sloop for the protection of his ship and this sloop he proposed in such a case to leave behind such an extraordinary eagerness to deal in opium lets in another view of the merits of the alleged dulness of the market on which this trade was undertaken for the companys account  the council who had with great condescension and official facility consented to every demand hitherto made were not reluctant with regard to this last the quantity of opium required by the freighters and the permission of a trading voyage were granted without hesitation the cargo having become far more valuable by this small infusion of private interest the armament which was deemed sufficient to defend the companys large share of the adventure was now discovered to be unequal to the protection of the whole for the convoy of these two ships the council hire and arm another how they were armed or whether in fact they were properly armed at all does not appear it is true that the supreme council proposed that these ships should also convey supplies to madras but this was a secondary consideration their primary object was the adventure of opium to this they were permanently attached and were obliged to attend to its final destination  the difficulty of disposing of the opium according to this project being thus got over a material preliminary difficulty still stood in the way of the whole scheme the contractor or his assignees were to be paid the companys treasure was wholly exhausted and even its credit was exceedingly strained the latter however was the better resource and to this they resolved to apply they therefore at different times opened two loans of one hundred thousand pounds each the first was reserved for the companys servants civil and military to be distributed in shares according to their rank the other was more general the terms of both loans were that the risk of the voyage was to be on account of the company the payment was to be in bills at a rate of exchange settled from the supercargoes at canton upon the same company in whatever proportion the adventure should fail either in the ships not safely arriving in china or otherwise in that proportion the subscribers were to content themselves with the companys bonds for their money bearing eight per cent interest a share in this subscription was thought exceeding desirable for mr hastings writes from benares where he was employed in the manner already reported and hereafter to be observed upon requesting that the subscription should be left open to his officers who were employed in the military operations against cheyt sing and accordingly three majors seven captains twentythree lieutenants the surgeon belonging to the detachment and two civil servants of high rank who attended him were admitted to subscribe  bills upon europe without interest are always preferred to the companys bonds even at the high interest allowed in india they are indeed so greedily sought there and because they tend to bring an immediate and visible distress in leadenhall street so much dreaded here that by an act of parliament the companys servants are restricted from drawing bills beyond a certain amount upon the company in england in bengal they have been restrained to about one hundred and eighty thousand pounds annually the legislature influenced more strongly with the same apprehensions has restrained the directors as the directors have restrained their servants and have gone so far as to call in the power of the lords of the treasury to authorize the acceptance of any bills beyond an amount prescribed in the act  the false principles of this unmercantile transaction to speak of it in the mildest terms were too gross not to be visible to those who contrived it that the company should be made to borrow such a sum as two hundred thousand pounds7 at eight per cent or terms deemed by the company to be worse in order first to buy a commodity represented by themselves as depreciated in its ordinary market in order afterwards to carry one half of it through a circuitous trading voyage depending for its ultimate success on the prudent and fortunate management of two or three sales and purchases and resales of goods and the chance of two or three markets with all the risks of sea and enemy was plainly no undertaking for such a body the activity private interest and the sharp eye of personal superintendency may now and then succeed in such projects but the remote inspection and unwieldy movements of great public bodies can find nothing but loss in them their gains comparatively small ought to be upon sure grounds but here as the council states the matter the private trader actually declines to deal which is a proof more than necessary to demonstrate the extreme imprudence of such an undertaking on the companys account still stronger and equally obvious objections lay to that member of the project which regards the introduction of a contraband commodity into china sent at such a risk of seizure not only of the immediate object to be smuggled in but of all the companys property in canton and possibly at a hazard to the existence of the british factory at that port  it is stated indeed that a monopolizing company in canton called the cohong had reduced commerce there to a deplorable state and had rendered the gains of private merchants either in opium or anything else so small and so precarious that they were no longer able by purchasing that article to furnish the company with money for a china investment for this purpose the person whose proposal is accepted declares his project to be to set up a monopoly on the part of the company against the monopoly of the chinese merchants but as the chinese monopoly is at home and supported as the minute referred to asserts by the country magistrates it is plain it is the chinese company not the english which must prescribe the termsparticularly in a commodity which if withheld from them at their market price they can whenever they please be certain of purchasing as a condemned contraband  there are two further circumstances in this transaction which strongly mark its character the first is that this adventure to china was not recommended to them by the factory of canton it was dangerous to attempt it without their previous advice and an assurance grounded on the state of the market and the dispositions of the government that the measure in a commercial light would be profitable or at least safe neither was that factory applied to on the state of the bills which upon their own account they might be obliged to draw upon europe at a time when the council of bengal direct them to draw bills to so enormous an amount  the second remarkable circumstance is that the board of trade in calcutta the proper administrator of all that relates to the companys investment does not seem to have given its approbation to the project or to have been at all consulted upon it the sale of opium had been adjudged to the board of trade for the express purpose of selling it in bengal not in chinaand of employing the produce of such sale in the manufactures of the country in which the original commodity was produced on the whole it appears a mere trading speculation of the council invading the department of others without lights of its own without authority or information from any other quarter in a commercial view it straitened the companys investment to which it was destined as a measure of finance it is a contrivance by which a monopoly formed for the increase of revenue instead of becoming one of its resources involves the treasury in the first instance in a debt of two hundred thousand pounds  if mr hastings on the expiration of mr mackenzies contract the advantages of which to the company had been long doubtful had put himself in a situation to do his duty some immediate loss to the revenue would have been the worst consequence of the alleged depreciation probably it would not have been considerable mr mackenzies contract which at first was for three years had been only renewed for a year had the same course been pursued with mr sulivan they would have had it in their power to adopt some plan which might have secured them from any loss at all but they pursued another plan they carefully put all remedy still longer out of their reach by giving their contract for four years to cover all these irregularities they interest the settlement in their favor by holding out to them the most tempting of all baits in a chance of bills upon europe  in this manner the servants abroad have conducted themselves with regard to mr sulivans contract for opium and the disposal of the commodity in england the court of directors took it into consideration first as to the contract in a letter dated 12th july 1782 they say that having condemned the contract entered into with mr mackenzie for the provision of opium they cannot but be surprised at your having concluded a new contract for four years relative to that article with mr stephen sulivan without leaving the decision of it to the court of directors  the sentiments of the directors are proper and worthy of persons in public trust their surprise indeed at the disobedience to their orders is not perfectly natural in those who for many years have scarcely been obeyed in a single instance they probably asserted their authority at this time with as much vigor as their condition admitted  they proceed we do not mean say they to convey any censure on mr sulivan respecting the transaction but we cannot withhold our displeasure from the governorgeneral and council at such an instance of contempt of our authority they then proceed justly to censure the removal of the inspection and some other particulars of this gross proceeding as to the criminality of the parties it is undoubtedly true that a breach of duty in servants is highly aggravated by the rank station and trust of the offending party but no party in such conspiracy to break orders appear to us wholly free from fault  the directors did their duty in reprobating this contract but it is the opinion of your committee that further steps ought to be taken to inquire into the legal validity of a transaction which manifestly attempts to prevent the court of directors from applying any remedy to a grievance which has been for years the constant subject of complaints  both mr sulivan and mr hastings are the companys servants bound by their covenants and their oaths to promote the interest of their masters and both equally bound to be obedient to their orders if the governorgeneral had contracted with a stranger not apprised of the companys orders and not bound by any previous engagement the contract might have been good but whether a contract made between two servants contrary to the orders of their common master and to the prejudice of his known interest be a breach of trust on both sides and whether the contract can in equity have force to bind the company whenever they shall be inclined to free themselves and the country they govern from this mischievous monopoly your committee think a subject worthy of further inquiry  with regard to the disposal of the opium the directors very properly condemn the direct contraband but they approve the trading voyage the directors have observed nothing concerning the loans they probably reserved that matter for future consideration  in no affair has the connection between servants abroad and persons in power among the proprietors of the india company been more discernible than in this but if such confederacies cemented by such means are suffered to pass without due animadversion the authority of parliament must become as inefficacious as all other authorities have proved to restrain the growth of disorders either in india or in europe   salt  the reports made by the two committees of the house which sat in the years 1772 and 1773 of the state and conduct of the inland trade of bengal up to that period have assisted the inquiries of your committee with respect to the third and last article of monopoly viz that of salt and made it unnecessary for them to enter into so minute a detail on that subject as they have done on some others  your committee find that the late lord clive constantly asserted that the salt trade in bengal had been a monopoly time immemorialthat it ever was and ever must be a monopolyand that coja wazid and other merchants long before him had given to the nabob and his ministers two hundred thousand pounds per annum for the exclusive privilege the directors in their letter of the 24th december 1776 paragraph 76 say that it has ever been in a great measure an exclusive trade  the secret committee report8 that under the government of the nabobs the duty on salt made in bengal was two and an half per cent paid by mussulmen and five per cent paid by gentoos on the accession of mir cassim in 1760 the claim of the companys servants to trade in salt dutyfree was first avowed mr vansittart made an agreement with him by which the duties should be fixed at nine per cent the council annulled the agreement and reduced the duty to two and an half per cent on this mir cassim ordered that no customs or duties whatsoever should be collected for the future but a majority of the council 22nd march 1763 resolved that the making the exemption general was a breach of the companys privileges and that the nabob should be positively required to recall it and collect duties as before from the country merchants and all other persons who had not the protection of the companys dustuck the directors as the evident reason of the thing and as their duty required disapproved highly of these transactions and ordered 8th february 1764 a final and effectual stop to be put to the inland trade in salt and several other articles of commerce but other politics and other interests prevailed so that in the may following a general court resolved that it should be recommended to the court of directors to reconsider the preceding orders in consequence of which the directors ordered the governor and council to form a plan in concert with the nabob for regulating the inland trade  on these last orders lord clives plan was formed in 1765 for engrossing the sole purchase of salt and dividing the profits among the companys senior servants the directors who had hitherto reluctantly given way to a monopoly under any ideas or for any purposes disapproved of this plan and on the 17th may 1766 ordered it to be abolished but they substituted no other in its room9 in this manner things continued until november 1767 when the directors repeated their orders for excluding all persons whatever excepting the natives only from being concerned in the inland trade in salt and they declared that vide par 90 such trade is hereby abolished and put a final end to in the same letter par 92 they ordered that the salt trade should be laid open to the natives in general subject to such a duty as might produce one hundred and twenty thousand pounds a year this policy was adopted by the legislature in the act of 1773 it was expressly provided that it should not be lawful for any of his majestys subjects to engage intermeddle or be any way concerned directly or indirectly in the inland trade in salt except on the india companys account  under the positive orders of the company the salt trade appears to have continued open from 1768 to 1772 the act indeed contained an exception in favor of the company and left them a liberty of dealing in salt upon their own account but still this policy remained unchanged and their orders unrevoked but in the year 1772 without any instruction from the court of directors indicating a change of opinion or system the whole produce was again monopolized professedly for the use of the company by mr hastings speaking of this plan he says letter to the directors 22d february 1775 no new hardship has been imposed upon the salt manufacturers by taking the management of that article into the hands of government the only difference is that the profit which was before reaped by english gentlemen and by banians is now acquired by the company in may 1766 the directors had condemned the monopoly on any conditions whatsoever at that time they thought it neither consistent with their honor nor their dignity to promote such an exclusive trade10 they considered it too as disgraceful and below the dignity of their present situation to allow of such a monopoly and that were they to allow it under any restrictions they should consider themselves as assenting and subscribing to all the mischiefs which bengal had presented to them for four years past11  notwithstanding this solemn declaration in their letter of 24th december 1776 they approve the plan of mr hastings and say that the monopoly on its present footing can be no considerable grievance to the country c  this however was a rigorous monopoly the account given of it by general clavering colonel monson and mr francis in their minute of 11th january 1775 in which the situation of the molungees or persons employed in the salt manufacture is particularly described is stated at length in the appendix mr hastings himself says the power of obliging molungees to work has been customary from time immemorial  nothing but great and clear advantage to government could account for and nothing at all perhaps could justify the revival of a monopoly thus circumstanced the advantage proposed by its revival was the transferring the profit which was before reaped by english gentlemen and banians to the company the profits of the former were not problematical it was to be seen what the effect would be of a scheme to transfer them to the latter even under the management of the projector himself in the revenue consultations of september 1776 mr hastings said many causes have since combined to reduce this article of revenue almost to nothing the plan which i am now inclined to recommend for the future management of the salt revenue differs widely from that which i adopted under different circumstances  it appears that the ill success of his former scheme did not deter him from recommending another accordingly in july 1777 mr hastings proposed and it was resolved that the salt mahls should be let with the lands to the farmers and zemindars for a readymoney rent including dutiesthe salt to be left to their disposal after some trial of this method mr hastings thought fit to abandon it in september 1780 he changed his plan a third time and proposed the institution of a salt office the salt was to be again engrossed for the benefit of the company and the management conducted by a number of salt agents  from the preceding facts it appears that in this branch of the companys government little regard has been paid to the ease and welfare of the natives and that the directors have nowhere shown greater inconsistency than in their orders on this subject yet salt considering it as a necessary of life was by no means a safe and proper subject for so many experiments and innovations for ten years together the directors reprobated the idea of suffering this necessary of life to be engrossed on any condition whatsoever and strictly prohibited all europeans from trading in it yet as soon as they were made to expect from mr hastings that the profits of the monopoly should be converted to their own use they immediately declared that it could be no considerable grievance to the country and authorized its continuance until he himself finding it produced little or nothing renounced it of his own accord your committee are apprehensive that this will at all times whatever flattering appearance it may wear for a time be the fate of any attempt to monopolize the salt for the profit of government in the first instance it will raise the price on the consumer beyond its just level but that evil will soon be corrected by means ruinous to the company as monopolists viz by the embezzlement of their own salt and by the importation of foreign salt neither of which the government of bengal may have power for any long time to prevent in the end government will probably be undersold and beaten down to a losing price or if they should attempt to force all the advantages from this article of which by every exertion it may be made capable it may distress some other part of their possessions in india and destroy or at least impair the natural intercourse between them ultimately it may hurt bengal itself and the produce of its landed revenue by destroying the vent of that grain which it would otherwise barter for salt  your committee think it hardly necessary to observe that the many changes of plan which have taken place in the management of the salt trade are far from honorable to the companys governmentand that even if the monopoly of this article were a profitable concern it should not be permitted exclusive of the general effect of this and of all monopolies the oppressions which the manufacturers of salt called molungees still suffer under it though perhaps alleviated in some particulars deserve particular attention there is evidence enough on the companys records to satisfy your committee that these people have been treated with great rigor and not only defrauded of the due payment of their labor but delivered over like cattle in succession to different masters who under pretence of buying up the balances due to their preceding employers find means of keeping them in perpetual slavery for evils of this nature there can be no perfect remedy as long as the monopoly continues they are in the nature of the thing and cannot be cured or effectually counteracted even by a just and vigilant administration on the spot many objections occur to the farming of any branch of the public revenue in bengal particularly against farming the salt lands but the dilemma to which government by this system is constantly reduced of authorizing great injustice or suffering great loss is alone sufficient to condemn it either government is expected to support the farmer or contractor in all his pretensions by an exertion of power which tends of necessity to the ruin of the parties subjected to the farmers contract and to the suppression of free tradeor if such assistance be refused him he complains that he is not supported that private persons interfere with his contract that the manufacturers desert their labor and that proportionate deductions must be allowed him  after the result of their examination into the general nature and effect of this monopoly it remains only for your committee to inquire whether there was any valid foundation for that declaration of mr hastings which we conclude must have principally recommended the monopoly of salt to the favor of the court of directors viz that the profit which was before reaped by english gentlemen and by banians was now acquired by the company on the contrary it was proved and acknowledged before the governorgeneral and council when they inquired into this matter in march 1775 that the chiefs and councils of those districts in which there were salt mahls reserved particular salt farms for their own use and divided the profits in certain stated proportions among themselves and their assistants but unless a detail of these transactions and of the persons concerned in them should be called for by the house it is our wish to avoid entering into it on one example only your committee think it just and proper to insist stating first to the house on what principles they have made this selection  in pursuing their inquiries your committee have endeavored chiefly to keep in view the conduct of persons in the highest station particularly of those in whom the legislature as well as the company have placed a special confidencejudging that the conduct of such persons is not only most important in itself but most likely to influence the subordinate ranks of the service your committee have also examined the proceedings of the court of directors on all those instances of the behavior of their servants that seemed to deserve and did sometimes attract their immediate attention they constantly find that the negligence of the court of directors has kept pace with and must naturally have quickened the growth of the practices which they have condemned breach of duty abroad will always go hand in hand with neglect of it at home in general the court of directors though sufficiently severe in censuring offences and sometimes in punishing those whom they have regarded as offenders of a lower rank appear to have suffered the most conspicuous and therefore the most dangerous examples of disobedience and misconduct in the first department of their service to pass with a feeble and ineffectual condemnation in those cases which they have deemed too apparent and too strong to be disregarded even with safety to themselves and against which their heaviest displeasure has been declared it appears to your committee that their interference such as it was had a mischievous rather than a useful tendency a total neglect of duty in this respect however culpable is not to be compared either in its nature or in its consequences with the destructive principles on which they have acted it has been their practice if not system to inquire to censure and not to punish as long as the misconduct of persons in power in bengal was encouraged by nothing but the hopes of concealment it may be presumed that they felt some restraint upon their actions and that they stood in some awe of the power placed over them whereas it is to be apprehended that the late conduct of the court of directors tells them in effect that they have nothing to fear from the certainty of a discovery  on the same principle on which your committee have generally limited their researches to the persons placed by parliament or raised or put in nomination by the court of directors to the highest station in bengal it was also their original wish to limit those inquiries to the period at which parliament interposed its authority between the company and their servants and gave a new constitution to the presidency of fort william if the companys servants had taken a new date from that period and if from thenceforward their conduct had corresponded with the views of the legislature it is probable that a review of the transactions of remoter periods would not have been deemed necessary and that the remembrance of them would have been gradually effaced and finally buried in oblivion but the reports which your committee have already made have shown the house that from the year 1772 when those proceedings commenced in parliament on which the act of the following year was founded abuses of every kind have prevailed and multiplied in bengal to a degree unknown in former times and are perfectly sufficient to account for the present distress of the companys affairs both at home and abroad the affair which your committee now lays before the house occupies too large a space in the companys records and is of too much importance in every point of view to be passed over  your committee find that in march 1775 a petition was presented to the governorgeneral and council by a person called coja kaworke an armenian merchant resident at dacca of which division mr richard barwell had lately been chief setting forth in substance that in november 1772 the petitioner had farmed a certain salt district called savagepoor and had entered into a contract with the committee of circuit for providing and delivering to the india company the salt produced in that district that in 1773 he farmed another called selimabad on similar conditions he alleges that in february 1774 when mr barwell arrived at dacca he charged the petitioner with 125500 rupees equal to 13000l as a contribution and in order to levy it did the same year deduct 20799 rupees from the amount of the advance money which was ordered to be paid to the petitioner on account of the india company for the provision of salt in the two farms and after doing so compelled the petitioner to execute and give him four different bonds for 77627 rupees in the name of one porran paul for the remainder of such contribution or unjust profit  such were the allegations of the petition relative to the unjust exaction the harsh means of compelling the payment make another and very material part for the petitioner asserts that in order to recover the amount of these bonds guards were placed over him and that mr barwell by ill usage and oppressions recovered from him at different times 48656 arcot rupees besides 283 rupees extorted by the guardthat after this payment two of the bonds containing 36313 rupees were restored to him and he was again committed to the charge of four peons or guards to pay the amount of the remaining two bonds the petition further charges that the said gentleman and his people had also extorted from the petitioner other sums of money which taken together amounted to 25000 rupees  but the heaviest grievance alleged by him is that after the sums of money had been extorted on account of the farms the faith usual in such transactions is allowed not to have been kept but after the petitioner had been obliged to buy or compound for the farms that they were taken from himthat the said richard barwell esquire about his departure from dacca in october 1774 for selfinterest wrested from the petitioner the aforesaid two mahls or districts and farmed them to another person notwithstanding he had extorted from the petitioner a considerable sum of money on account of those purgunnahs  to this petition your committee find two accounts annexed in which the sums said to be paid to or taken by mr barwell and the respective dates of the several payments are specified and they find that the account of particulars agrees with and makes up the gross sum charged in the petition  mr barwells immediate answer to the preceding charge is contained in two letters to the board dated 23rd and 24th of march 1775 the answer is remarkable he asserts that the whole of kaworkes relation is a gross misrepresentation of factsthat the simple fact was that in january 1774 the salt mahls of savagepoor and selimabad became his and were relet by him to this man in the names of bussunt roy and kissen deb on condition that he should account with him mr barwell for profits to a certain sum and that he mr barwell engaged for savagepoor in the persuasion of its being a very profitable farm and he concludes with saying if i am mistaken in my reasoning and the wish to add to my fortune has warped my judgment in a transaction that may appear to the board in a light different to what i view it in it is pasti cannot recall itand i rather choose to admit an error than deny a fact in his second letter he says to the honorable court of directors i will submit all my rights in the salt contracts i engaged in and if in their opinion those rights vest in the company i will account to them for the last shilling i have received from such contracts my intentions being upright and as i never did wish to profit myself to the prejudice of my employers by their judgment i will be implicitly directed  the majority of the board desired that kaworkes petition should be transmitted to england by the ship then under dispatch and it was accordingly sent with mr barwells replies mr barwell moved that a committee should be appointed to take into consideration what he had to offer on the subject of kaworkes petition and a committee was accordingly appointed consisting of all the members of the council except the governorgeneral  the committee opened their proceedings with reading a second petition from kaworke containing corrected accounts of cash said to be forcibly taken and of the extraordinary and unwarrantable profits taken or received from him by richard barwell esquire all which are inserted at large in the appendix by these accounts mr barwell is charged with a balance or debt of 22421 rupees to kaworke the principal difference between him and mr barwell arises from a different mode of stating the accounts acknowledged to exist between them in the account current signed by mr barwell he gives kaworke credit for the receipt of 98426 rupees and charges him with a balance of 27073 rupees  the facts stated or admitted by mr barwell are as follow that the salt farms of selimabad and savagepoor were his and relet by him to the two armenian merchants michael and kaworke on condition of their paying him 125000 rupees exclusive of their engagements to the company that the engagement was written in the name of bussunt roy and kissen deb sing and mr barwell says that the reason of its being in these peoples names was because it was not thought consistent with the public regulations that the names of any europeans should appear  it is remarkable that this policy was carried to still greater length means were used to remove such an obnoxious proceeding as far as possible from the public eye and they were such as will strongly impress the house with the facility of abuse and the extreme difficulty of detection in everything which relates to the indian administration for these substituted persons were again represented by the further substitution of another name viz rada churn dey whom mr barwell asserts to be a real person living at dacca and who stood for the factory of dacca whereas the armenian affirms that there was no such person as rada churn and that it was a fictitious name  mr barwell in his justification proceeds to affirm that coja kaworke never had the management of the salt mahls but on condition of accounting to the former chief and to mr barwell for a specified advantage arising from themthat mr barwell determined without he could reconcile the interests of the public with his own private emoluments that he would not engage in this concernand that when he took an interest in it it was for specified benefit in money and every condition in the public engagement to be answered  your committee have stated the preceding facts in the same terms in which they are stated by mr barwell the house is to judge how far they amount to a defence against the charges contained in kaworkes petition or to an admission of the truth of the principal part of it mr barwell does not allow that compulsion was used to extort the money which he received from the petitioner or that the latter was dispossessed of the farms in consequence of an offer made to mr barwell by another person ramsunder paulet to pay him a lac of rupees more for them the truth of these charges has not been ascertained they were declared by mr barwell to be false but no attempt was made by him to invalidate or confute them though it concerned his reputation and it was his duty in the station wherein he was placed that charges of such a nature should have been disprovedat least the accuser should have been pushed to the proof of them nothing of this kind appears to have been done or even attempted  the transaction itself as it stands is clearly collusive the form in which it is conducted is clandestine and mysterious in an extraordinary degree and the acknowledged object of it a great illicit profit to be gained by an agent and trustee of the company at the expense of his employers and of which he confesses he has received a considerable part  the committee of the governorgeneral and council appear to have closed their proceedings with several resolutions which with the answers given by mr barwell as a defence are inserted in the appendix the whole are referred thither together on account of the ample extent of the answer these papers will be found to throw considerable light not only on the points in question but on the general administration of the companys revenues in bengal on some passages in mr barwells defence or account of his conduct your committee offer the following remarks to the judgment of the house  in his letter of the 23rd march 1775 he says that he engaged for savagepoor in the persuasion of its being a very profitable farm in this place your committee think it proper to state the 17th article of the regulations of the committee of circuit formed in may 1772 by the president and council of which mr barwell was a member together with their own observations thereupon      17th that no peshcar banian or other servant of whatever     denomination of the collector or relation or dependant of any such     servant be allowed to farm lands nor directly or indirectly to     hold a concern in any farm nor to be security for any farmer that     the collector be strictly enjoined to prevent such practices and     that if it shall be discovered that any one under a false name     or any kind of collusion hath found means to evade this order he     shall be subject to an heavy fine proportionate to the amount of     the farm and the farm shall be relet or made khas and if it     shall appear that the collector shall have countenanced approved     or connived at a breach of this regulation he shall stand ipso     facto dismissed from his collectorship neither shall any european     directly or indirectly be permitted to rent lands in any part of     the country      remark by the board      17th if the collector or any persons who partake of his     authority are permitted to be the farmers of the country no other     persons will dare to be their competitors of course they will     obtain the farms on their own terms it is not fit that the     servants of the company should be dealers with their masters the     collectors are checks on the farmers if they themselves turn     farmers what checks can be found for them what security will the     company have for their property or where are the ryots to look for     relief against oppressions  the reasons assigned for the preceding regulation seem to your committee to be perfectly just but they can by no means be reconciled to those which induced mr barwell to engage in the salt farms of selimabad and savagepoor in the first place his doing so is at length a direct and avowed though at first a covert violation of the public regulation to which he was himself a party as a member of the government as well as an act of disobedience to the companys positive orders on this subject in their general letter of the 17th may 1766 the court of directors say we positively order that no covenanted servant or englishman residing under our protection shall be suffered to hold any land for his own account directly or indirectly in his own name or that of others or to be concerned in any farms or revenues whatsoever  secondly if instead of letting the companys lands or farms to indifferent persons their agent or trustee be at liberty to hold them himself he will always on principles stated and adhered to in the defence have a sufficient reason for farming them on his own account since he can at all times make them as profitable as he pleases or if he leases them to a third person yet reserves an intermediate profit for himself that profit may be as great as he thinks fit and must be necessarily made at the companys expense if at the same time he be collector of the revenues it will be his interest to recommend remissions in favor of the nominal farmer and he will have it in his power to sink the amount of his collections  these principles and the correspondent practices leave the india company without any security that all the leases of the lands of bengal may not have been disposed of under that administration which made the five years settlement in 1772 in the same manner and for the same purpose  to enable the house to judge how far this apprehension may be founded it will be proper to state that mr nicholas grueber who preceded mr barwell in the chiefship of dacca in a letter dated 29th of april 1775 declares that he paid to the committee of circuit twelve thousand rupees as their profit on a single salt farmwhich sum he says i paid the committee at their request before their departure from dacca and reimbursed myself out of the advances directed to be issued for the provision of the salt thus one illicit and mischievous transaction always leads to another and the irregular farming of revenue brings on the misapplication of the commercial advances  mr barwell professes himself to be sensible that a wish to add to his fortune may possibly have warped his judgment and that he rather chooses to admit an error than deny a fact but your committee are of opinion that the extraordinary caution and the intricate contrivances with which his share in this transaction is wrapped up form a sufficient proof that he was not altogether misled in his judgment and though there might be some merit in acknowledging an error before it was discovered there could be very little in a confession produced by previous detection  the reasons assigned by mr barwell in defence of the clandestine part of this transaction seem to your committee to be insufficient in themselves and not very fit to be urged by a man in his station in one place he says that it was not thought consistent with the public regulations that the names of any europeans should appear in another he says i am aware of the objection that has been made to the english taking farms under the names of natives as prohibited by the companys orders and i must deviate a little upon this it has been generally understood that the scope and tendency of the honorable companys prohibition of farms to europeans was meant only to exclude such as could not possibly in their own persons come under the jurisdiction of the duanné courts of adawlet because upon any failure of engagements upon any complaint of unjust oppression or other cause of discontent whatever it was supposed an european might screen himself from the process of the country judicature but it was never supposed that an european of credit and responsibility was absolutely incapable from holding certain tenures under the sanction and authority of the country laws or from becoming security for such native farmers contractors c c as he might protect and employ  your committee have opposed this construction of mr barwells to the positive order which the conduct it is meant to color has violated europeans of credit and responsibility that is europeans armed with wealth and power and exercising offices of authority and trust instead of being excepted from the spirit of the restriction must be supposed the persons who are chiefly meant to be comprehended in it for abstract the idea of an european from the ideas of power and influence and the restriction is no longer rational  your committee are therefore of opinion that the nature of the evil which was meant to be prevented by the above orders and regulations was not altered or the evil itself diminished by the collusive methods made use of to evade themand that if the regulations were proper as they unquestionably were they ought to have been punctually complied with particularly by the members of the government who formed the plan and who as trustees of the company were especially answerable for their being duly carried into execution your committee have no reason to believe that it could ever have been generally understood that the companys prohibition of farms to europeans was meant only to exclude such as could not possibly in their own persons come under the jurisdiction of the duanné courts no such restriction is so much as hinted at and if it had been so understood mr barwell was one of the persons who from their rank station and influence must have been the principal objects of the prohibition since the establishment of the companys influence in bengal no europeans of any rank whatever have been subject to the process of the country judicature and whether they act avowedly for themselves and take farms in their own name or substitute native indians to act for them the difference is not material the same influence that screened an european from the jurisdiction of the country courts would have equally protected his native agent and representative for many years past the companys servants have presided in those courts and in comparison with their authority the native authority is nothing  the earliest instructions that appear to have been given by the court of directors in consequence of these transactions in bengal are dated the 5th of february 1777 in their letter of that date they applaud the proceedings of the board meaning the majority then consisting of general clavering colonel monson and mr francis as highly meritorious and promise them their firmest support some of the cases they say are so flagrantly corrupt and others attended with circumstances so oppressive to the inhabitants that it would be unjust to suffer the delinquents to go unpunished with this observation their proceedings appear to have ended and paused for more than a year  on the 4th of march 1778 the directors appear to have resumed the subject in their letter of that date they instructed the governor and council forthwith to commence a prosecution in the supreme court of judicature against the persons who composed the committee of circuit or their representatives and also against mr barwell in order to recover for the use of the company the amount of all advantages acquired by them from their several engagements in salt contracts and farms adverting however to the declaration made by mr barwell that he would account to the court of directors for the last shilling he had received and abide implicity by their judgment they thought it probable that on being acquainted with their peremptory orders for commencing a prosecution he might be desirous of paying his share of profits into the companys treasury and they pointed out a precaution to be used in accepting such a tender on his part  on this part of the transaction your committee observe that the court of directors appear blamable in having delayed till february 1777 to take any measure in consequence of advices so interesting and important and on a matter concerning which they had made so strong a declarationconsidering that early in april 1776 they say they had investigated the charges and had then come to certain resolutions concerning them but their delaying to send out positive orders for commencing a prosecution against the parties concerned till march 1778 cannot be accounted for in the former letter they promise if they should find it necessary to return the original covenants of such of their servants as had been any ways concerned in the undue receipt of money in order to enable the governorgeneral and council to recover the same by suits in the supreme court but your committee do not find that the covenants were ever transmitted to bengal to whatever cause these instances of neglect and delay may be attributed they could not fail to create an opinion in bengal that the court of directors were not heartily intent upon the execution of their own orders and to discourage those members of government who were disposed to undertake so invidious a duty  in consequence of these delays even their first orders did not arrive in bengal until some time after the death of colonel monson when the whole power of the board had devolved to mr hastings and mr barwell when they sent what they call their positive orders in march 1778 they had long been apprised of the death of colonel monson and must have been perfectly certain of the effect which that event would have on the subsequent measures and proceedings of the governorgeneral and council their opinion of the principles of those gentlemen appears in their letter of the 28th of november 1777 wherein they say they cannot but express their concern that the power of granting away their property in perpetuity should have devolved upon such persons  but the conduct of the court of directors appears to be open to objections of a nature still more serious and important a recovery of the amount of mr barwells profits seems to be the only purpose which they even professed to have in view but your committee are of opinion that to preserve the reputation and dignity of the government of bengal was a much more important object and ought to have been their first consideration the prosecution was not the pursuit of mean and subordinate persons who might with safety to the public interest remain in their seats during such an inquiry into their conduct it appears very doubtful whether if there were grounds for such a prosecution a proceeding in great britain were not more politic than one in bengal such a prosecution ought not to have been ordered by the directors but upon grounds that would have fully authorized the recall of the gentleman in question this prosecution supposing it to have been seriously undertaken and to have succeeded must have tended to weaken the government and to degrade it in the eyes of all india on the other hand to intrust a man armed as he was with all the powers of his station and indeed of the government with the conduct of a prosecution against himself was altogether inconsistent and absurd the same letter in which they give these orders exhibits an example which sets the inconsistency of their conduct in a stronger light because the case is somewhat of a similar nature but infinitely less pressing in its circumstances observing that the board of trade had commenced a prosecution against mr william barton a member of that board for various acts of peculation committed by him they say we must be of opinion that as prosecutions are actually carrying on against him by our board of trade he is during such prosecution at least an improper person to hold a seat at that board and therefore we direct that he be suspended from the companys service until our further pleasure concerning him be known the principle laid down in this instruction even before their own opinion concerning mr bartons case was declared and merely on the prosecution of others serves to render their conduct not very accountable in the case of mr barwell mr barton was in a subordinate situation and his remaining or not remaining in it was of little or no moment to the prosecution mr barton was but one of seven whereas mr barwell was one of four and with the governorgeneral was in effect the supreme council  in the present state of power and patronage in india and during the relations which are permitted to subsist between the judges the prosecuting officers and the councilgeneral your committee is very doubtful whether the mode of prosecuting the highest members in the bengal government before a court at calcutta could have been almost in any case advisable  it is possible that particular persons in high judicial and political situations may by force of an unusual strain of virtue be placed far above the influence of those circumstances which in ordinary cases are known to make an impression on the human mind but your committee sensible that laws and public proceedings ought to be made for general situations and not for personal dispositions are not inclined to have any confidence in the effect of criminal proceedings where no means are provided for preventing a mutual connection by dependencies agencies and employments between the parties who are to prosecute and to judge and those who are to be prosecuted and to be tried  your committee in a former report have stated the consequences which they apprehended from the dependency of the judges on the governorgeneral and council of bengal and the house has entered into their ideas upon this subject since that time it appears that sir elijah impey has accepted of the guardianship of mr barwells children and was the trustee for his affairs there is no law to prevent this sort of connection and it is possible that it might not at all affect the mind of that judge or upon his account indirectly influence the conduct of his brethren but it must forcibly affect the minds of those who have matter of complaint against government and whose cause the court of directors appear to espouse in a country where the authority of the court of directors has seldom been exerted but to be despised where the operation of laws is but very imperfectly understood but where men are acute sagacious and even suspicious of the effect of all personal connections their suspicions though perhaps not rightly applied to every individual will induce them to take indications from the situations and connections of the prosecuting parties as well as of the judges it cannot fail to be observed that mr naylor the companys attorney lived in mr barwells house the late mr bogle the companys commissioner of lawsuits owed his place to the patronage of mr hastings and mr barwell by whom the office was created for him and sir john day the companys advocate who arrived in bengal in february 1779 had not been four months in calcutta when mr hastings mr barwell and sir eyre coote doubled his salary contrary to the opinion of mr francis and mr wheler  if the directors are known to devolve the whole cognizance of the offences charged on their servants so highly situated upon the supreme court an excuse will be furnished if already it has not been furnished to the directors for declining the use of their own proper political power and authority in examining into and animadverting on the conduct of their servants their true character as strict masters and vigilant governors will merge in that of prosecutors their force and energy will evaporate in tedious and intricate processesin lawsuits which can never end and which are to be carried on by the very dependants of those who are under prosecution on their part these servants will decline giving satisfaction to their masters because they are already before another tribunal and thus by shifting responsibility from hand to hand a confederacy to defeat the whole spirit of the law and to remove all real restraints on their actions may be in time formed between the servants directors prosecutors and court of this great danger your committee will take farther notice in another place  no notice whatever appears to have been taken of the companys orders in bengal till the 11th of january 1779 when mr barwell moved that the claim made upon him by the court of directors should be submitted to the companys lawyers and that they should be perfectly instructed to prosecute upon it in his minute of that date he says that the state of his health had long since rendered it necessary for him to return to europe  your committee observe that he continued in bengal another year he says that he had hitherto waited for the arrival of sir john day the companys advocate but as the season was now far advanced he wished to bring the trial speedily to issue  in this minute he retracts his original engagement to submit himself to the judgment of the court of directors and to account to them for the last shilling he had received he says that no merit had been given him for the offer that a most unjustifiable advantage had been attempted to be made of it by first declining it and descending to abuse and then giving orders upon it as if it had been rejected when called upon by him in the person of his agent to bring home the charge of delinquency  mr barwells reflections on the proceedings of the court of directors are not altogether clearly expressed nor does it appear distinctly to what facts he alludes he asserts that a most unjustifiable advantage had been attempted to be made of his offer the fact is the court of directors have nowhere declined accepting it on the contrary they caution the governorgeneral and council about the manner of receiving the tender of the money which they expect him to make they say nothing of any call made on them by mr barwells agent in england nor does it appear to your committee that they have descended to abuse they have a right and it is their duty to express in distinct and appropriated terms their sense of all blamable conduct in their servants  so far as may be collected from the evidence of the companys records mr barwells assertions do not appear well supported but even if they were more plausible your committee apprehend that he could not be discharged from his solemn recorded promise to abide by the judgment of the court of directors their judgment was declared by their resolution to prosecute which it depended upon himself to satisfy by making good his engagement to excuse his not complying with the companys claims he says that his compliance would be urged as a confession of delinquency and to proceed from conviction of his having usurped on the rights of the company considerations of this nature might properly have induced mr barwell to stand upon his right in the first instance and to appeal to use his own words to the laws of his country in order to vindicate his fame but his performance could not have more weight to infer delinquency than his promise your committee think his observation comes too late  if he had stood a trial when he first acknowledged the facts and submitted himself to the judgment of the court of directors the suit would have been carried on under the direction of general clavering colonel monson and mr francis whereas in the year 1779 his influence at the board gave him the conduct of it himself in an interval of four years it may be presumed that great alterations might have happened in the state of the evidence against him  in the subsequent proceedings of the governorgeneral and council the house will find that mr barwell complained that his instances for carrying on the prosecution were ineffectual owing to the legal difficulties and delays urged by the companys law officers which your committee do not find have yet been removed as far as the latest advices reach no progress appears to have been made in the business in july 1782 the court of directors found it necessary to order an account of all suits against europeans depending in the supreme court of judicature to be transmitted to them and that no time should be lost in bringing them to a determination   saltpetre  the next article of direct monopoly subservient to the companys export is saltpetre this as well as opium is far the greater part the produce of the province of bahar the difference between the management and destination of the two articles has been this until the year 1782 the opium has been sold in the country and the produce of the sale laid out in country merchandise for the companys export a great part of the saltpetre is sent out in kind and never has contributed to the interior circulation and commerce of bengal it is managed by agency on the companys account the price paid to the manufacturer is invariable some of the larger undertakers receive advances to enable them to prosecute their work but as they are not always equally careful or fortunate it happens that large balances accumulate against them orders have been sent from calcutta from time to time to recover their balances with little or no success but with great vexation to all concerned in the manufacture sometimes they have imprisoned the failing contractors in their own housesa severity which answers no useful purpose such persons are so many hands detached from the improvement and added to the burden of the country they are persons of skill drawn from the future supply of that monopoly in favor of which they are prosecuted in case of the death of the debtor this rigorous demand falls upon the ruined houses of widows and orphans and may be easily converted into a means either of cruel oppression or a mercenary indulgence according to the temper of the exactors instead of thus having recourse to imprisonment the old balance is sometimes deducted from the current produce this in these circumstances is a grievous discouragement people must be discouraged from entering into a business when the commodity being fixed to one invariable standard and confined to one market the best success can be attended only with a limited advantage whilst a defective produce can never be compensated by an augmented price accordingly very little of these advances has been recovered and after much vexation the pursuit has generally been abandoned it is plain that there can be no life and vigor in any business under a monopoly so constituted nor can the true productive resources of the country in so large an article of its commerce ever come to be fully known  the supply for the companys demand in england has rarely fallen short of two thousand tons nor much exceeded two thousand five hundred a discretionary allowance of this commodity has been made to the french dutch and danes who purchase their allotted shares at some small advance on the companys price the supply destined for the london market is proportioned to the spare tonnage and to accommodate that tonnage the saltpetre is sometimes sent to madras and sometimes even to bombay and that not unfrequently in vessels expressly employed for the purpose  mr law chief of patna being examined on the effect of that monopoly delivered his opinion that with regard to the companys trade the monopoly was advantageous but as sovereigns of the country they must be losers by it these two capacities in the company are found in perpetual contradiction but much doubt may arise whether this monopoly will be found advantageous to the company either in the one capacity or the other the gross commodity monopolized for sale in london is procured from the revenues in bengal the certain is given for the hazardous the loss of interest on the advances sometimes the loss of the principalthe expense of carriage from patna to calcuttathe various loadings and unloadings and insurance which though borne by the company is still insurancethe engagement for the ordnance limited in price and irregular in paymentthe charge of agency and management through all its gradations and successionswhen all these are taken into consideration it may be found that the gain of the company as traders will be far from compensating their loss as sovereigns a body like the east india company can scarcely in any circumstance hope to carry on the details of such a business from its commencement to its conclusion with any degree of success in the subjoined estimate of profit and loss the value of the commodity is stated at its invoice price at calcutta but this affords no just estimate of the whole effect of a dealing where the companys charge commences in the first rudiments of the manufacture and not at the purchase at the place of sale and valuation for they there may be heavy losses on the value at which the saltpetre is estimated when shipped off on their account without any appearance in the account and the inquiries of your committee to find the charges on the saltpetre previous to the shipping have been fruitless   british government in india  the other link by which india is bound to great britain is the government established there originally by the authority of the east india company and afterwards modified by parliament by the acts of 1773 and 1780 this system of government appears to your committee to be at least as much disordered and as much perverted from every good purpose for which lawful rule is established as the trading system has been from every just principle of commerce your committee in tracing the causes of this disorder through its effects have first considered the government as it is constituted and managed within itself beginning with its most essential and fundamental part the order and discipline by which the supreme authority of this kingdom is maintained  the british government in india being a subordinate and delegated power it ought to be considered as a fundamental principle in such a system that it is to be preserved in the strictest obedience to the government at home administration in india at an immense distance from the seat of the supreme authorityintrusted with the most extensive powersliable to the greatest temptationspossessing the amplest means of abuseruling over a people guarded by no distinct or wellascertained privileges whose language manners and radical prejudices render not only redress but all complaint on their part a matter of extreme difficultysuch an administration it is evident never can be made subservient to the interests of great britain or even tolerable to the natives but by the strictest rigor in exacting obedience to the commands of the authority lawfully set over it  but your committee find that this principle has been for some years very little attended to before the passing the act of 1773 the professed purpose of which was to secure a better subordination in the companys servants such was the firmness with which the court of directors maintained their authority that they displaced governor cartier confessedly a meritorious servant for disobedience of orders although his case was not a great deal more than a question by whom the orders were to be obeyed12 yet the directors were so sensible of the necessity of a punctual and literal obedience that conceiving their orders went to the parties who were to obey as well as to the act to be done they proceeded with a strictness that in all cases except that of their peculiar government might well be considered as rigorous but in proportion as the necessity of enforcing obedience grew stronger and more urgent and in proportion to the magnitude and importance of the objects affected by disobedience this rigor has been relaxed acts of disobedience have not only grown frequent but systematic and they have appeared in such instances and are manifested in such a manner as to amount in the companys servants to little less than absolute independence against which on the part of the directors there is no struggle and hardly so much as a protest to preserve a claim  before your committee proceed to offer to the house their remarks on the most distinguished of these instances the particulars of which they have already reported they deem it necessary to enter into some detail of a transaction equally extraordinary and important though not yet brought into the view of parliament which appears to have laid the foundation of the principal abuses that ensued as well as to have given strength and encouragement to those that existed to this transaction and to the conclusions naturally deducible from it your committee attribute that general spirit of disobedience and independence which has since prevailed in the government of bengal  your committee find that in the year 1775 mr lauchlan macleane was sent into england as agent to the nabob of arcot and to mr hastings the conduct of mr hastings in assisting to extirpate for a sum of money to be paid to the company the innocent nation of the rohillas had drawn upon him the censure of the court of directors and the unanimous censure of the court of proprietors the former had even resolved to prepare an application to his majesty for mr hastingss dismission  another general court was called on this proceeding mr hastings was then openly supported by a majority of the court of proprietors who professed to entertain a good opinion of his general ability and rectitude of intention notwithstanding the unanimous censure passed upon him in that censure they therefore seemed disposed to acquiesce without pushing the matter farther but as the offence was far from trifling and the condemnation of the measure recent they did not directly attack the resolution of the directors to apply to his majesty but voted in the ballot that it should be reconsidered the business therefore remained in suspense or it rather seemed to be dropped for some months when mr macleane took a step of a nature not in the least to be expected from the condition in which the cause of his principal stood which was apparently as favorable as the circumstances could bear hitherto the support of mr hastings in the general court was only by a majority but if on application from the directors he should be removed a mere majority would not have been sufficient for his restoration the door would have been barred against his return to the companys service by one of the strongest and most substantial clauses in the regulating act of 1778 mr macleane probably to prevent the manifest ill consequences of such a step came forward with a letter to the court of directors declaring his provisional powers and offering on the part of mr hastings an immediate resignation of his office  on this occasion the directors showed themselves extremely punctilious with regard to mr macleanes powers they probably dreaded the charge of becoming accomplices to an evasion of the act by which mr hastings resigning the service would escape the consequences attached by law to a dismission they therefore demanded mr macleanes written authority this he declared he could not give into their hands as the letter contained other matters of a nature extremely confidential but that if they would appoint a committee of the directors he would readily communicate to them the necessary parts of the letter and give them perfect satisfaction with regard to his authority a deputation was accordingly named who reported that they had seen mr hastingss instructions contained in a paper in his own handwriting and that the authority for the act now done by mr macleane was clear and sufficient mr vansittart a very particular friend of mr hastings and mr john stewart his most attached and confidential dependant attended on this occasion and proved that directions perfectly correspondent to this written authority had been given by mr hastings in their presence by this means the powers were fully authenticated but the letter remained safe in mr macleanes hands  nothing being now wanting to the satisfaction of the directors the resignation was formally accepted mr wheler was named to fill the vacancy and presented for his majestys approbation which was received the act was complete and the office that mr hastings had resigned was legally filled this proceeding was officially notified in bengal and general clavering as senior in council was in course to succeed to the office of governorgeneral  mr hastings to extricate himself from the difficulties into which this resignation had brought him had recourse to one of those unlookedfor and hardy measures which characterize the whole of his administration he came to a resolution of disowning his agent denying his letter and disavowing his friends he insisted on continuing in the execution of his office and supported himself by such reasons as could be furnished in such a cause an open schism instantly divided the council general clavering claimed the office to which he ought to succeed and mr francis adhered to him mr barwell stuck to mr hastings the two parties assembled separately and everything was running fast into a confusion which suspended government and might very probably have ended in a civil war had not the judges of the supreme court on a reference to them settled the controversy by deciding that the resignation was an invalid act and that mr hastings was still in the legal possession of his place which had been actually filled up in england it was extraordinary that the nullity of this resignation should not have been discovered in england where the act authorizing the resignation then was where the agent was personally present where the witnesses were examined and where there was and could be no want of legal advice either on the part of the company or of the crown the judges took no light matter upon them in superseding and thereby condemning the legality of his majestys appointment for such it became by the royal approbation  on this determination such as it was the division in the meeting but not in the minds of the council ceased general clavering uniformly opposed the conduct of mr hastings to the end of his life but mr hastings showed more temper under much greater provocations in disclaiming his agent and in effect accusing him of an imposture the most deeply injurious to his character and fortune and of the grossest forgery to support it he was so very mild and indulgent as not to show any active resentment against his unfaithful agent nor to complain to the court of directors it was expected in bengal that some strong measures would have immediately been taken to preserve the just rights of the king and of the court of directors as this proceeding unaccompanied with the severest animadversion manifestly struck a decisive blow at the existence of the most essential powers of both but your committee do not find that any measures whatever such as the case seemed to demand were taken the observations made by the court of directors on what they call these extraordinary transactions are just and well applied they conclude with a declaration that the measures which it might be necessary for them to take in order to retrieve the honor of the company and to prevent the like abuse from being practised in future should have their most serious and earliest consideration and with this declaration they appear to have closed the account and to have dismissed the subject forever  a sanction was hereby given to all future defiance of every authority in this kingdom several other matters of complaint against mr hastings particularly the charge of peculation fell to the ground at the same time opinions of counsel had been taken relative to a prosecution at law upon this charge from the then attorney and the then solicitorgeneral and mr dunning now the lords thurlow loughborough and ashburton together with mr adair now recorder of london none of them gave a positive opinion against the grounds of the prosecution the attorneygeneral doubted on the prudence of the proceedings and censured as it well deserved the ill statement of the case three of them mr wedderburn mr dunning and mr adair were clear in favor of the prosecution no prosecution however was had and the directors contented themselves with censuring and admonishing mr hastings  with regard to the supreme council the members who chose for it was choice only to attend to the orders which were issued from the languishing authority of the directors continued to receive unprofitable applauses and no support their correspondence was always filled with complaints the justice of which was always admitted by the court of directors but this admission of the existence of the evil showed only the impotence of those who were to administer the remedy the authority of the court of directors resisted with success in so capital an instance as that of the resignation was not likely to be respected in any other what influence it really had on the conduct of the companys servants may be collected from the facts that followed it  the disobedience of mr hastings has of late not only become uniform and systematical in practice but has been in principle also supported by him and by mr barwell late a member of the supreme council in bengal and now a member of this house  in the consultation of the 20th of july 1778 mr barwell gives it as his solemn and deliberate opinion that while mr hastings is in the government the respect and dignity of his station should be supported in these sentiments i must decline an acquiescence in any order which has a tendency to bring the government into disrepute as the company have the means and power of forming their own administration in india they may at pleasure place whom they please at the head but in my opinion they are not authorized to treat a person in that post with indignity  by treating them with indignity in the particular cases wherein they have declined obedience to orders they must mean those orders which imply a censure on any part of their conduct a reversal of any of their proceedings or as mr barwell expresses himself in words very significant in any orders that have a tendency to bring their government into disrepute the amplitude of this latter description reserving to them the judgment of any orders which have so much as that tendency puts them in possession of a complete independence an independence including a despotic authority over the subordinates and the country the very means taken by the directors for enforcing their authority becomes on this principle a cause of further disobedience it is observable that their principles of disobedience do not refer to any local consideration overlooked by the directors which might supersede their orders or to any change of circumstances which might render another course advisable or even perhaps necessarybut it relates solely to their own interior feelings in matters relative to themselves and their opinion of their own dignity and reputation it is plain that they have wholly forgotten who they are and what the nature of their office is mr hastings and mr barwell are servants of the company and as such by the duty inherent in that relation as well as by their special covenants were obliged to yield obedience to the orders of their masters they have as far as they were able cancelled all the bonds of this relation and all the sanctions of these covenants  but in thus throwing off the authority of the court of directors mr hastings and mr barwell have thrown off the authority of the whole legislative power of great britain for by the regulating act of the thirteenth of his majesty they are expressly directed and required to pay due obedience to all such orders as they shall receive from the court of directors of the said united company such is the declaration of the law but mr barwell declares that he declines obedience to any orders which he shall interpret to be indignities on a governorgeneral to the clear injunctions of the legislature mr hastings and mr barwell have thought proper to oppose their pretended reputation and dignity as if the chief honor of public ministers in every situation was not to yield a cheerful obedience to the laws of their country your committee to render evident to this house the general nature and tendency of this pretended dignity and to illustrate the real principles upon which they appear to have acted think it necessary to make observations on three or four of the cases already reported of marked disobedience to particular and special orders on one of which the above extraordinary doctrine was maintained  these are the cases of mr fowke mr bristow and mahomed reza khân in a few weeks after the death of colonel monson mr hastings having obtained a majority in council by his casting vote mr fowke and mr bristow were called from their respective offices of residents at benares and oude places which have become the scenes of other extraordinary operations under the conduct of mr hastings in person for the recall of mr bristow no reason was assigned the reason assigned for the proceeding with regard to mr fowke was that the purposes for which he was appointed were then fully accomplished  an account of the removal of mr fowke was communicated to the court of directors in a letter of the 22d of december 1776 on this notification the court had nothing to conclude but that mr hastings from a rigid pursuit of economy in the management of the companys affairs had recalled a useless officer but without alleging any variation whatsoever in the circumstances in less than twenty days after the order for the recall of mr fowke and the very day after the dispatch containing an account of the transaction mr hastings recommended mr graham to this very office the end of which he declared to the directors but the day before had been fully accomplished and not thinking this sufficient he appointed mr d barwell as his assistant at a salary of about four hundred pounds a year against this extraordinary act general clavering and mr francis entered a protest  so early as the 6th of the following january the appointment of these gentlemen was communicated in a letter to the court of directors without any sort of color apology or explanation that court found a servant removed from his station without complaint contrary to the tenor of one of their standing injunctions they allow however and with reason that if it were possible to suppose that a saving c had been his motive they would have approved his proceeding but that when immediately afterwards two persons with two salaries had been appointed to execute the office which had been filled with reputation by mr fowke alone and that mr graham enjoys all the emoluments annexed to the office of mr fowkethey properly conclude that mr fowke was removed without just cause to make way for mr graham and strictly enjoin that the former be reinstated in his office of resident as postmaster of benares in the same letter they assert their rights in a tone of becoming firmness and declare that on no account we can permit our orders to be disobeyed or our authority disregarded  it was now to be seen which of the parties was to give way the orders were clear and precise and enforced by a strong declaration of the resolution of the court to make itself obeyed mr hastings fairly joined issue upon this point with his masters and having disobeyed the general instructions of the company determined to pay no obedience to their special order  on the 21st july 1778 he moved and succeeded in his proposition that the execution of these orders should be suspended the reason he assigned for this suspension lets in great light upon the true character of all these proceedings that his consent to the recall of mr graham would be adequate to his own resignation of the service as it would inflict such a wound on his authority and influence that he could not maintain it  if that had been his opinion he ought to have resigned and not disobeyed because it was not necessary that he should hold his office but it was necessary that whilst he hold it he should obey his superiors and submit to the law much more truly was his conduct a virtual resignation of his lawful office and at the same time an usurpation of a situation which did not belong to him to hold a subordinate office and to refuse to act according to its duties had his authority been selforiginated it would have been wounded by his submission but in this case the true nature of his authority was affirmed not injured by his obedience because it was a power derived from others and by its essence to be executed according to their directions  in this determined disobedience he was supported by mr barwell who on that occasion delivered the dangerous doctrine to which your committee have lately adverted mr fowke who had a most material interest in this determination applied by letter to be informed concerning it an answer was sent acquainting him coldly and without any reason assigned of what had been resolved relative to his office this communication was soon followed by another letter from mr fowke with great submission and remarkable decency asserting his right to his office under the authority of the court of directors and for solid reasons grounded on the companys express orders praying to be informed of the charge against him this letter appears to have been received by mr hastings and mr barwell very loftily mr hastings said that such applications were irregular that they are not accountable to mr fowke for their resolution respecting him the reasons for suspending the execution of the orders of the court of directors contain no charge nor the slightest imputation of a charge against mr fowke but i see no reason why the board should condescend to tell him so accordingly the proposition of mr francis and mr wheler to inform mr fowke that they had no reason to be dissatisfied with his conduct on the previous question was rejected  by this resolution mr hastings and mr barwell discovered another principle and no less dangerous than the first namely that persons deriving a valuable interest under the companys orders so far from being heard in favor of their right are not so much as to be informed of the grounds on which they are deprived of it  the arrival soon after of sir eyre coote giving another opportunity of trial the question for obedience to the companys orders was again13 brought on by mr francis and again received a negative sir eyre coote though present and declaring that had he been at the original consultation he should have voted for the immediate execution of the companys orders yet he was resolved to avoid what he called any kind of retrospect his neutrality gained the question in favor of this the third resolution for disobedience to orders  the resolution in bengal being thus decisively taken it came to the turn of the court of directors to act their part they did act their part exactly in their old manner they had recourse to their old remedy of repeating orders which had been disobeyed the directors declare to mr hastings and mr barwell though without any apparent reason that they have read with astonishment their formal resolution to suspend the execution of their orders that they shall take such measures as appear necessary for preserving the authority of the court of directors and for preventing such instances of direct and wilful disobedience in their servants in time to come they then renew their directions concerning mr fowke the event of this sole measure taken to preserve their authority and to prevent instances of direct and wilful disobedience your committee will state in its proper placetaking into consideration for the present the proceedings relative to mr bristow and to mahomed reza khân which were altogether in the same spirit but as they were diversified in the circumstances of disobedience as well from the case of mr fowke as from one another and as these circumstances tend to discover other dangerous principles of abuse and the general prostrate condition of the authority of parliament in bengal your committee proceed first to make some observations upon them  the province of oude enlarged by the accession of several extensive and once flourishing territories that is by the country of the rohillas the district of corah and allahabad and other provinces betwixt the ganges and jumna is under the nominal dominion of one of the princes of the country called asoph ul dowlah but a body of english troops is kept up in his country and the greatest part of his revenues are by one description or another substantially under the administration of english subjects he is to all purposes a dependent prince the person to be employed in his dominions to act for the committee company was therefore of little consequence in his capacity of negotiator but he was vested with a trust great and critical in all pecuniary affairs these provinces of dependence lie out of the system of the companys ordinary administration and transactions there cannot be so readily brought under the cognizance of the court of directors this renders it the more necessary that the residents in such places should be persons not disapproved of by the court of directors they are to manage a permanent interest which is not like a matter of political negotiation variable and which from circumstances might possibly excuse some degree of discretionary latitude in construing their orders during the lifetime of general clavering and colonel monson mr bristow was appointed to this presidency and that appointment being approved and confirmed by the court of directors became in effect their own mr bristow appears to have shown himself a man of talents and activity he had been principally concerned in the negotiations by which the companys interest in the higher provinces had been established and those services were considered by the presidency of calcutta as so meritorious that they voted him ten thousand pounds as a reward with many expressions of esteem and honor  mr bristow however was recalled by mr hastings and mr barwell who had then acquired the majority without any complaint having been assigned as the cause of his removal and mr middleton was sent in his stead to reside at the capital of oude the court of directors as soon as they could be apprised of this extraordinary step in their letter of the 4th of july 1777 express their strongest disapprobation of it they order mr middleton to be recalled and mr bristow to be reinstated in his office in december 1778 they repeat their order of these repeated orders no notice was taken mr bristow fatigued with unsuccessful private applications which met with a constant refusal did at length on the 1st of may 1780 address a letter to the board making his claim of right entitling himself to his offices office under the authority of the court of directors and complaining of the hardships which he suffered by the delay in admitting him to the exercise of it this letter your committee have inserted at large in the fifth report having found nothing whatsoever exceptionable in it although it seems to have excited the warmest resentment in mr hastings  this claim of the party gave no new force to the order of the directors which remained without any attention from the board from mr bristows arrival until the 1st of may and with as little from the 1st of may to the 2nd of october following on that day mr francis after having caused the repeated orders of the court of directors to be first read moved that mr bristow should be reinstated in his office this motion in itself just and proper in the highest degree and in which no fault could be found but that it was not made more early was received by mr hastings with the greatest marks of resentment and indignation he declares in his minute that were the most determined adversary of the british nation to possess by whatever means a share in the administration he could not devise a measure in itself so pernicious or time it so effectually for the ruin of the british interests in india then turning to the object of the motion he says i will ask who is mr bristow that a member of the administration should at such a time hold him forth as an instrument for the degradation of the first executive member of this government what are the professed objects of his appointment what are the merits and services or what the qualifications which entitle him to such uncommon distinction is it for his superior integrity or from his eminent abilities that he is to be dignified at such hazard of every consideration that ought to influence the members of this administration of the former his integrity i know no proofs i am sure it is not an evidence of it that he has been enabled to make himself the principal in such a competition and for the test of his abilities i appeal to the letter which he has dared to write to this board and which i am ashamed to say we have suffered i desire that a copy of it may be inserted in this days proceedings that it may stand before the eyes of every member of the board when he shall give his vote upon a question for giving their confidence to a man their servant who has publicly insulted them his masters and the members of the government to whom he owes his obediencewho assuming an association with the court of directors and erecting himself into a tribunal has arraigned them for disobedience of orders passed judgment upon them and condemned or acquitted them as their magistrate or superior let the board consider whether a man possessed of so independent a spirit who has already shown a contempt of their authority who has shown himself so wretched an advocate for his own cause and negotiator for his own interest is fit to be trusted with the guardianship of their honor the execution of their measures and as their confidential manager and negotiator with the princes of india as the motion has been unaccompanied by any reasons which should induce the board to pass their acquiescence in it i presume the motion which preceded it for reading the orders of the court of directors was intended to serve as an argument for it as well as an introduction to it the last of those was dictated the 23rd december 1778 almost two years past they were dictated at a time when i am sorry to say the court of directors were in the habit of casting reproach upon my conduct and heaping indignities upon my station  had the language and opinions which prevail throughout this part of the minute as well as in all the others to which your committee refer been uttered suddenly and in a passion however unprovoked some sort of apology might be made for the governorgeneral but when it was produced five months after the supposed offence and then delivered in writing which always implies the power of a greater degree of recollection and selfcommand it shows how deeply the principles of disobedience had taken root in his mind and of an assumption to himself of exorbitant powers which he chooses to distinguish by the title of his prerogative in this also will be found an obscure hint of the cause of his disobedience which your committee conceive to allude to the main cause of the disorders in the government of indianamely an underhand communication with europe  mr hastings by his confidence in the support derived from this source or from the habits of independent power is carried to such a length as to consider a motion to obey the court of directors as a degradation of the executive government in his person he looks upon a claim under that authority and a complaint that it has produced no effect as a piece of daring insolence which he is ashamed that the board has suffered the behavior which your committee consider as so intemperate and despotic he regards as a culpable degree of patience and forbearance major scott his agent enters so much into the principles of mr hastingss conduct as to tell your committee that in his opinion lord clive would have sent home mr bristow a prisoner upon such an occasion it is worthy of remark that in the very same breath that mr hastings so heavily condemns a junior officer in the companys service not a servant of the council as he hazards to call him but their fellowservant for merely complaining of a supposed injury and requiring redress he so far forgets his own subordination as to reject the orders of the court of directors even as an argument in favor of appointing a person to an office to presume to censure his undoubted masters and to accuse them of having been in a habit of casting reproaches upon him and heaping indignities on his station and it is to be observed that this censure was not for the purpose of seeking or obtaining redress for any injury but appeared rather as a reason for refusing to obey their lawful commands it is plainly implied in that minute that no servant of the company in mr bristows rank would dare to act in such a manner if he had not by indirect means obtained a premature fortune this alone is sufficient to show the situation of the companys servants in the subordinate situations when the mere claim of a right derived from the sovereign legal power becomes fatal not only to the objects which they pursue but deeply wounds that reputation both for ability and integrity by which alone they are to be qualified for any other  if anything could add to the disagreeable situation of those who are submitted to an authority conducted on such principles it is this the company has ordered that no complaint shall be made in europe against any of the council without being previously communicated to them a regulation formed upon grave reasons and it was certainly made in favor of that board but if a person having ground of complaint against the council by making use of the mode prescribed in favor of that very council and by complaining to themselves commits an offence for which he may be justly punished the directors have not regulated the mode of complaint they have actually forbidden it they have on that supposition renounced their authority and the whole system of their officers is delivered over to the arbitrary will of a few of their chief servants  during the whole day of that deliberation things wore a decided face mr hastings stood to his principles in their full extent and seemed resolved upon unqualified disobedience but as the debate was adjourned to the day following time was given for expedients and such an expedient was hit upon by mr hastings as will no doubt be unexpected by the house but it serves to throw new lights upon the motives of all his struggles with the authority of the legislature  the next day the council met upon the adjournment then mr hastings proposed as a compromise a division of the object in question one half was to be surrendered to the authority of the court of directors the other was reserved for his dignity but the choice he made of his own share in this partition is very worthy of notice he had taken his sole ground of objection against mr bristow on the supposed ill effect that such an appointment would have on the minds of the indian powers he said that these powers could have no dependence on his fulfilling his engagements or maintaining the faith of treaties which he might offer for their acceptance if they saw him treated with such contempt mr bristows appearing in a political character was the whole of his complaint yet when he comes to a voluntary distribution of the duties of the office he gives mr bristow those very political negotiations of which but the day before he had in such strong terms declared him personally incapable whose appointment he considered to be fatal to those negotiations and which he then spoke of as a measure in itself such as the bitterest adversary to great britain would have proposed but having thus yielded his whole ground of ostensible objection he reserved to his own appointment the entire management of the pecuniary trust accordingly he named mr bristow for the former and mr middleton for the latter on his own principles he ought to have done the very reverse on every justifiable principle he ought to have done so for a servant who for a long time resists the orders of his masters and when he reluctantly gives way obeys them by halves ought to be remarkably careful to make his actions correspond with his words and to put himself out of all suspicion with regard to the purity of his motives it was possible that the political reasons which were solely assigned against mr bristows appointment might have been the real motives of mr hastingss opposition but these he totally abandons and holds fast to the pecuniary department now as it is notorious that most of the abuses of india grow out of moneydealing it was peculiarly unfit for a servant delicate with regard to his reputation to require a personal and confidential agent in a situation merely official in which secrecy and personal connections could be of no possible use and could only serve to excite distrust matters of account cannot be made too public and it is not the most confidential agent but the most responsible who is the fittest for the management of pecuniary trusts that man was the fittest at once to do the duty and to remove all suspicions from the governorgenerals character whom by not being of his appointment he could not be supposed to favor for private purposes who must naturally stand in awe of his inspection and whose misconduct could not possibly be imputable to him such an agency in a pecuniary trust was the very last on which mr hastings ought to have risked his disobedience to the orders of the directionor what is even worse for his motives a direct contradiction to all the principles upon which he had attempted to justify that bold measure  the conduct of mr hastings in the affair of mahomed reza khân was an act of disobedience of the same character but wrought by other instruments when the duanné or universal perception and management of the revenues of bengal was acquired to the company together with the command of the army the nabob or governor naturally fell into the rank rather of a subject than that even of a dependent prince yet the preservation of such a power in such a degree of subordination with the criminal jurisdiction and the care of the public order annexed to it was a wise and laudable policy it preserved a portion of the government in the hands of the natives it kept them in respect it rendered them quiet on the change and it prevented that vast kingdom from wearing the dangerous appearance and still more from sinking into the terrible state of a country of conquest your committee has already reported the manner in which the company it must be allowed upon pretences that will not bear the slightest examination diverted from its purposes a great part of the revenues appropriated to the country government but they were very properly anxious that what remained should be well administered in the lifetime of general clavering and colonel monson mahomed reza khân a man of rank among the natives was judged by them the fittest person to conduct the affairs of the nabob as his naib or deputy an office well known in the ancient constitution of these provinces at a time when the principal magistrates by nature and situation were more efficient this appointment was highly approved and in consequence confirmed by the court of directors mr hastings and mr barwell however thought proper to remove him to the authority of the court of directors they opposed the request of the nabob stating that he was arrived at the common age of maturity and stood in no need of a deputy to manage his affairs on former occasions mr hastings conceived a very low opinion of the condition of the person whom he thus set up against the authority of his masters on a former occasion as the directors tell him and to serve a very different purpose he had not scrupled to declare it as visible as the sun that the nabob was a mere pageant without even the shadow of authority but on this occasion he became more substantial mr hastings and mr barwell yielded to his representation that a deputy was not necessary and accordingly mahomed reza khân was removed from his office  however lest any one should so far mistrust their understanding as to conceive them the dupes of this pretext they who had disobeyed the companys orders under color that no deputy was necessary immediately appoint another deputy this independent prince who as mr hastings said had an incontestable right to his situation and that it was his by inheritance suddenly shrunk into his old state of insignificance and was even looked upon in so low a light as to receive a severe reprimand from mr hastings for interposing in the duties of his the deputys office  the companys orders censuring this transaction in the strongest terms and ordering mahomed reza khân to be immediately restored to the office of naib subahdar were received in calcutta in november 1779 mr hastings acted on this with the firmness which he had shown on other occasions but in his principles he went further thinking himself assured of some extraordinary support suitable to the open and determined defiance with which he was resolved to oppose the lawful authority of his superiors and to exercise a despotic power he no longer adhered to mr barwells distinction of the orders which had a tendency to bring his government into disrepute this distinction afforded sufficient latitude to disobedience but here he disdained all sorts of colors and distinctions he directly set up an independent right to administer the government according to his pleasure and he went so far as to bottom his claim to act independently of the court of directors on the very statute which commanded his obedience to them  he declared roundly that he should not yield to the authority of the court of directors in any instance in which it should require his concession of the rights which he held under an act of parliament it is too clear to stand in need of proof that he neither did or could hold any authority that was not subject in every particle of it and in every instance in which it could be exercised to the orders of the court of directors  he therefore refused to back the companys orders with any requisition from himself to the nabob but merely suffered them to be transmitted to him leaving it to him to do just as he thought proper the nabob who called mr hastings his patron and declared he would never do anything without his consent and approbation perfectly understood this kind of signification for the second time the nabob recovered from his trance of pageantry and insignificance and collected courage enough to write to the council in these terms i administer the affairs of the nizamut the government which are the affairs of my own family by my own authority and shall do so and i never can on any account agree to the appointment of the nabob mahomed reza khân to the naib subahship here was a second independent power in bengal this answer from that power proved as satisfactory as it was resolute no further notice was taken of the orders of the court of directors and mahomed reza khân found their protection much more of a shadow than the pageant of power of which he aspired to be the representative  this act of disobedience differs from the others in one particular which in the opinion of your committee rather aggravates than extenuates the offence in the others messrs hastings and barwell took the responsibility on themselves here they held up the pretext of the country government however they obtained thereby one of the objects which they appear to have systematically pursued as they had in the other instances shown to the british servants of the company that the directors were not able to protect them here the same lesson was taught to the natives whilst the matter lay between the native power and the servants the former was considered by mr hastings in the most contemptible light when the question was between the servants and the court of directors the native power was asserted to be a selfderived hereditary uncontrollable authority and encouraged to act as such  in this manner the authority of the british legislature was at that time treated with every mark of reprobation and contempt but soon after a most unexpected change took place by which the persons in whose favor the court of directors had in vain interposed obtained specific objects which had been refused to them things were however so well contrived that legal authority was nearly as much affronted by the apparent compliance with their orders as by the real resistance they had before met with after long and violent controversies an agreement took place between mr hastings and mr francis it appears that mr hastings embarrassed with the complicated wars and ruinous expenses into which his measures had brought him began to think of procuring peace at home the agreement originated in a conversation held on christmasday 1779 between major scott then aidedecamp and now agent to mr hastings and mr ducarrel a gentleman high in the companys service at calcutta mr scott in consequence of this conversation was authorized to make overtures to mr francis through mr ducarrel to declare mr hastings tired of controversy expressing his wish to have the mahratta war entirely left to him that there were certain points he could not give up that he could not for reasons he then assigned submit to the restoration of mr fowke mahomed reza khân and mr bristow that he had not the smallest personal objection to them and would willingly provide for them in any other line mr francis in this treaty insisted on those very points which mr hastings declared he could never give up and that his conditions were the companys ordersthat is the restoration of the persons whom they had directed to be restored the event of this negotiation was that mr hastings at length submitted to mr francis and that mr fowke and mahomed reza khân were reinstated in their situations  your committee observe on this part of the transaction of mr hastings that as long as the question stood upon his obedience to his lawful superiors so long he considered the restoration of these persons as a gross indignity the submitting to which would destroy all his credit and influence in the country but when it was to accommodate his own occasions in a treaty with a fellowservant all these difficulties instantly vanish and he finds it perfectly consistent with his dignity credit and influence to do for mr francis what he had refused to the strict and reiterated injunctions of the court of directors tranquillity was however for a time restored by this measure though it did not continue long in about three months an occasion occurred in which mr francis gave some opposition to a measure proposed by mr hastings which brought on a duel upon the mischievous effects of which your committee have already made their observations  the departure of mr francis soon after for europe opened a new scene and gave rise to a third revolution lest the arrangement with the servants of the company should have the least appearance of being mistaken for obedience to their superiors mr francis was little more than a month gone when mr fowke was again recalled from benares and mr bristow soon after from oude in these measures mr hastings has combined the principles of disobedience which he had used in all the cases hitherto stated in his minute of consultation on this recall he refers to his former minutes and he adds that he has a recent motive in the necessity of removing any circumstance which may contribute to lessen his influence in the effect of any negotiations in which he may be engaged in the prosecution of his intended visit to lucknow he here reverts to his old plea of preserving his influence not content with this as in the case of mahomed reza khân he had called in the aid of the nabob of bengal he here calls in the aid of the nabob of oude who on reasons exactly tallying with those given by mr hastings desires that mr bristow may be removed the true weight of these requisitions will appear if not sufficiently apparent from the known situation of the parties by the following extract of a letter from this nabob of oude to his agent at calcutta desiring him to acquaint mr hastings that if it is proper i will write to the king of great britain and the vizier one of his majestys ministers and the chief of the company in such a manner as he shall direct and in the words that he shall order that mr bristows views may be thwarted there there is no doubt of the entire coöperation of the nabob asoph ul dowlah in all the designs of mr hastings and in thwarting the views of any persons who place their reliance on the authority of this kingdom  as usual the court of directors appear in their proper order in the procession after this third act of disobedience with regard to the same person and the same office and after calling the proceedings unwarrantable in order to vindicate and uphold their own authority and thinking it a duty incumbent on them to maintain the authority of the court of directors they again order mr bristow to be reinstated and mr middleton to be recalled in this circle the whole moves with great regularity  the extraordinary operations of mr hastings that soon after followed in every department which was the subject of all these acts of disobedience have made them appear in a light peculiarly unpropitious to his cause it is but too probable from his own accounts that he meditated some strong measure both at benares and at oude at the very time of the removal of those officers he declares he knew that his conduct in those places was such as to lie very open to malicious representations he must have been sensible that he was open to such representations from the beginning he was therefore impelled by every motive which ought to influence a man of sense by no means to disturb the order which he had last established  of this however he took no care but he was not so inattentive to the satisfaction of the sufferers either in point of honor or of interest this was most strongly marked in the case of mr fowke his reparation to that gentleman in point of honor is as full as possible mr hastings declared that he approved his character and his conduct in office and believed that he might depend upon his exact and literal obedience and fidelity in the execution of the functions annexed to it such is the character of the man whom mr hastings a second time removed from the office to which he told the court of directors in his letter of the 3rd of march 1780 he had appointed him in conformity to their orders on the 14th of january 1781 he again finds it an indispensable obligation in him to exercise powers inherent in the constitution of his government on this principle he claimed the right of nominating the agent of his own choice to the residence of benares that it is a representative situation that speaking for myself alone it may be sufficient to say that mr francis fowke is not my agent that i cannot give him my confidence that while he continues at benares he stands as a screen between the rajah and this government instead of an instrument of control that the rajah himself and every chief in hindostan will regard it as the pledge and foundation of his independence here mr hastings has got back to his old principles where he takes post as on strong ground this he declares to be his objection to mr fowke and that it is insuperable the very line before this paragraph he writes of this person to whom he could not give his confidence that he believed he might depend upon his fidelity and his exact and literal obedience mr scott who is authorized to defend mr hastings supported the same principles before your committee by a comparison that avowedly reduces the court of directors to the state of a party against their servants he declared that in his opinion it would be just as absurd to deprive him of the power of nominating his ambassador at benares as it would be to force on the ministry of this country an ambassador from the opposition such is the opinion entertained in bengal and that but too effectually realized of the relation between the principal servants of the company and the court of directors  so far the reparation in point of honor to mr fowke was complete the reparation in point of interest your committee do not find to have been equally satisfactory but they do find it to be of the most extraordinary nature and of the most mischievous example mr fowke had been deprived of a place of rank and honorthe place of a public vackeel or representative the recompense provided for him is a succession to a contract mr hastings moved that on the expiration of colonel morgans contract he should be appointed agent to all the boats employed for the military service of that establishment with a commission of fifteen per cent on all disbursements in that officepermitting mr fowke at the same time to draw his allowance of an hundred pounds a month as resident until the expiration of the contract and for three months after  mr hastings is himself struck as every one must be with so extraordinary a proceeding the principle of which he observes is liable to one material objection that one is material indeed for no limit being laid down for the expense in which the percentage is to arise it is the direct interest of the person employed to make his department as expensive as possible to this mr hastings answers that he is convinced by experience it will be better performed and yet he immediately after subjoins this defect can only be corrected by the probity of the person intrusted with so important a charge and i am willing to have it understood as a proof of the confidence i repose in mr fowke that i have proposed his appointment in opposition to a general principle to a trust so constituted  in the beginning of this very minute of consultation mr hastings removes mr fowke from the residency of benares because he cannot give him his confidence and yet before the pen is out of his hand he violates one of the soundest general principles in the whole system of dealing in order to give a proof of the confidence he reposes in that gentleman this apparent gross contradiction is to be reconciled but by one waywhich is that confidence with mr hastings comes and goes with his opposition to legal authority where that authority recommends any person his confidence in him vanishes but to show that it is the authority and not the person he opposes when that is out of sight there is no rule so sacred which is not to be violated to manifest his real esteem and perfect trust in the person whom he has rejected however by overturning general principles to compliment mr fowkes integrity he does all in his power to corrupt it at the same time he establishes an example that must either subject all future dealings to the same pernicious clause or which being omitted must become a strong implied charge on the integrity of those who shall hereafter be excluded from a trust so constituted  it is not foreign to the object of your committee in this part of their observations which relates to the obedience to orders to remark upon the manner in which the orders of the court of directors with regard to this kind of dealing in contracts are observed these orders relate to contracts and they contain two standing regulations  1st that all contracts shall be publicly advertised and that the most reasonable proposals shall be accepted  2ndly that two contracts those of provisions and for carriage bullocks shall be only annual  these orders are undoubtedly some correctives to the abuses which may arise in this very critical article of public dealing but the house will remark that if the business usually carried on by contracts can be converted at pleasure into agencies like that of mr fowke all these regulations perish of course and there is no direction whatsoever for restraining the most prodigal and corrupt bargains for the public  your committee have inquired into the observance of these necessary regulations and they find that they have like the rest been entirely contemned and contemned with entire impunity after the period of colonel monsons death and mr hastings and mr barwell obtaining the lead in the council the contracts were disposed of without at all advertising for proposals those in 1777 were given for three years and the gentlemen in question growing by habit and encouragement into more boldness in 1779 the contracts were disposed of for five years and this they did at the eve of the expiration of their own appointment to the government this increase in the length of the contracts though contrary to orders might have admitted some excuse if it had been made even in appearance the means of lessening the expense but the advantages allowed to the contractors instead of being diminished were enlarged and in a manner far beyond the proportion of the enlargement of terms of this abuse and contempt of orders a judgment may be formed by the single contract for supplying the army with draught and carriage bullocks as it stood at the expiration of the contract in 1779 the expense of that service was about one thousand three hundred pounds a month by the new contract given away in september of that year the service was raised to the enormous sum of near six thousand pounds a month the monthly increase therefore being four thousand seven hundred pounds it constitutes a total increase of charges for the company in the five years of the contract of no less a sum than two hundred and thirtyfive thousand pounds now as the former contract was without doubt sufficiently advantageous a judgment may be formed of the extravagance of the present the terms indeed pass the bounds of all allowance for negligence and ignorance of office  the case of mr bellis contract for supplying provisions to the fort is of the same description and what exceedingly increases the suspicion against this profusion in contracts made in direct violation of orders is that they are always found to be given in favor of persons closely connected with mr hastings in his family or even in his actual service  the principles upon which mr hastings and mr barwell justify this disobedience if admitted reduce the companys government so far as it regards the supreme council to a mere patronageto a mere power of nominating persons to or removing them from an authority which is not only despotic with regard to those who are subordinate to it but in all its acts entirely independent of the legal power which is nominally superior these are principles directly leading to the destruction of the companys government a correspondent practice being established as in this case of contracts as well as others it has been the means are furnished of effectuating this purpose for the common superior the company having no power to regulate or to support their own appointments nor to remove those whom they wish to remove nor to prevent the contracts from being made use of against their interest all the english in bengal must naturally look to the next in authority they must depend upon follow and attach themselves to him solely and thus a party may be formed of the whole system of civil and military servants for the support of the subordinate and defiance of the supreme power  your committee being led to attend to the abuse of contracts which are given upon principles fatal to the subordination of the service and in defiance of orders revert to the disobedience of orders in the case of mahomed reza khân  this transaction is of a piece with those that preceded it on the 6th of july 1781 mr hastings announced to the board the arrival of a messenger and introduced a requisition from the young nabob mobarek ul dowlah that he might be permitted to dispose of his own stipend without being made to depend on the will of another in favor of this requisition mr hastings urged various argumentsthat the nabob could no longer be deemed a minorthat he was twentysix years of age and father of many childrenthat his understanding was much improved of late by an attention to his educationthat these circumstances gave him a claim to the uncontrolled exercise of domestic authority and it might reasonably be supposed that he would pay a greater regard to a just economy in his own family than had been observed by those who were aliens to it for these reasons mr hastings recommended to the board that mahomed reza khân should be immediately divested of the office of superintendent of the nabobs household and that the nabob mobarek ul dowlah should be intrusted with the exclusive and entire receipts and disbursements of his stipend and the uncontrolled management and regulation of his household thus far your committee are of opinion that the conclusion corresponds with the premises for supposing the fact to be established or admitted that the nabob in point of age capacity and judgment was qualified to act for himself it seems reasonable that the management of his domestic affairs should not be withheld from him on this part of the proceeding your committee will only observe that if it were strictly true that the nabobs understanding had been much improved of late by an attention to his education which seems an extraordinary way of describing the qualifications of a man of sixandtwenty the father of many children the merit of such improvement must be attributed to mahomed reza khân who was the only person of rank and character connected with him or who could be supposed to have any influence over him mr hastings himself reproaches the nabob with raising mean men to be his companions and tells him plainly that some persons both of bad character and base origin had found the means of insinuating themselves into his company and constant fellowship in such society it is not likely that either the nabobs morals or his understanding could have been much improved nor could it be deemed prudent to leave him without any check upon his conduct mr hastingss opinion on this point may be collected from what he did but by no means from what he said on the occasion  the house will naturally expect to find that the nabobs request was granted and that the resolution of the board was conformable to the terms of mr hastingss recommendation yet the fact is directly the reverse mr hastings after advising that the nabob should be intrusted with the exclusive and entire receipts and disbursements of his stipend immediately corrects that advice being aware that so sudden and unlimited a disposal of a large revenue might at first encourage a spirit of dissipation in the naboband reserves to himself a power of establishing with the nabobs consent such a plan for the regulation and equal distribution of the nabobs expenses as should be adapted to the dissimilar appearances of preserving his interests and his independence at the same time on the same complicated principles the subsequent resolution of the board professes to allow the nabob the management of his stipend and expenseswith an hope however which considering the relative situation of the parties could be nothing less than an injunction that he would submit to such a plan as should be agreed on between him and the governorgeneral  the drift of these contradictions is sufficiently apparent mahomed reza khân was to be divested of his office at all events and the management of the nabobs stipend committed to other hands to accomplish the first the nabob is said to be now arrived at that time of life when a man may be supposed capable if ever of managing his own concerns when this principle has answered the momentary purpose for which it was produced we find it immediately discarded and an opposite resolution formed on an opposite principle viz that he shall not have the management of his own concerns in consideration of his want of experience  mr hastings on his arrival at moorshedabad gives mr wheler an account of his interview with the nabob and of the nabobs implicit submission to his advice the principal if not the sole object of the whole operation appears from the result of it sir john doyly a gentleman in whom mr hastings places particular confidence succeeds to the office of mahomed reza khân and to the same control over the nabobs expenses into the hands of this gentleman the nabobs stipend was to be immediately paid as every intermediate channel would be an unavoidable cause of delay and to his advice the nabob was required to give the same attention as if it were given by mr hastings himself one of the conditions prescribed to the nabob was that he should admit no englishman to his presence without previously consulting sir john doyly and he must forbid any person of that nation to be intruded without his introduction on these arrangements it need only be observed that a measure which sets out with professing to relieve the nabob from a state of perpetual pupilage concludes with delivering not only his fortune but his person to the custody of a particular friend of mr hastings  the instructions given to the nabob contain other passages that merit attention in one place mr hastings tells him you have offered to give up the sum of four lacs of rupees to be allowed the free use of the remainder but this we have refused in another he says that as many matters will occur which cannot be so easily explained by letter as by conversation i desire that you will on such occasions give your orders to sir john doyly respecting such points as you may desire to have imparted to me the offer alluded to in the first passage does not appear in the nabobs letters therefore must have been in conversation and declined by mr hastings without consulting his colleague a refusal of it might have been proper but it supposes a degree of incapacity in the nabob not to be reconciled to the principles on which mahomed reza khân was removed from the management of his affairs of the matters alluded to in the second and which it is said could not be so easily explained by letters as in conversation no explanation is given your committee will therefore leave them as mr hastings has done to the opinion of the house  as soon as the nabobs requisition was communicated to the board it was moved and resolved that mahomed reza khân should be divested of his office and the house have seen in what manner it was disposed of the nabob had stated various complaints against himthat he had dismissed the old established servants of the nizamut and filled their places with his own dependantsthat he had regularly received the stipend of the nizamut from the company yet had kept the nabob involved in debt and distress and exposed to the clamors of his creditors and sometimes even in want of a dinner all these complaints were recorded at large in the proceedings of the council but it does not appear that they were ever communicated to mahomed reza khân or that he was ever called upon in any shape to answer them this circumstance inclines your committee to believe that all of these charges were groundlessespecially as it appears on the face of the proceedings that the chief of them were not well founded mr hastings in his letter to mr wheler urges the absolute necessity of the monthly payment of the nabobs stipend being regularly made and says that to relieve the nabobs present wants he had directed the resident to raise an immediate supply on the credit of the company to be repaid from the first receipts from hence your committee conclude that the monthly payments had not been regularly made and that whatever distresses the nabob might have suffered must have been owing to the governorgeneral and council not to mahomed reza khân who for aught that appears to the contrary paid away the stipend as fast as he received it had it been otherwise that is if mahomed reza khân had reserved a balance of the nabobs money in his hands he should and undoubtedly he would have been called upon to pay it in and then there would have been no necessity for raising an immediate supply by other means  the transaction on the whole speaks very sufficiently for itself it is a gross instance of repeated disobedience to repeated orders and it is rendered particularly offensive to the authority of the court of directors by the frivolous and contradictory reasons assigned for it but whether the nabobs requisition was reasonable or not the governorgeneral and council were precluded by a special instruction from complying with it the directors in their letter of the 14th of february 1779 declare that a resolution of council taken by mr francis and mr wheler in the absence of mr barwell viz that the nabobs letter should be referred to them for their decision and that no resolution should be taken in bengal on his requisitions without their special orders and instructions was very proper they prudently reserved to themselves the right of deciding on such questions but they reserved it to no purpose in england the authority is purely formal in bengal the power is positive and real when they clash their opposition serves only to degrade the authority that ought to predominate and to exalt the power that ought to be dependent                                       since the closing of the above report many material papers have arrived from india and have been laid before your committee that which they think it most immediately necessary to annex to the appendix to this report is the resolution of the councilgeneral to allow to the members of the board of trade resident in calcutta a charge of five per cent on the sale in england of the investment formed upon their second plan namely that plan which had been communicated to lord macartney the investment on this plan is stated to be raised from 800000l to 1000000l sterling  it is on all accounts a very memorable transaction and tends to bring on a heavy burden operating in the nature of a tax laid by their own authority on the goods of their masters in england if such a compensation to the board of trade was necessary on account of their engagement to take no further that is to say no unlawful emolument it implies that the practice of making such unlawful emolument had formerly existed and your committee think it very extraordinary that the first notice the company had received of such a practice should be in taxing them for a compensation for a partial abolition of it secured on the parole of honor of those very persons who are supposed to have been guilty of this unjustifiable conduct your committee consider this engagement if kept as only a partial abolition of the implied corrupt practice because no part of the compensation is given to the members of the board of trade who reside at the several factories though their means of abuse are without all comparison greater and if the corruption was supposed so extensive as to be bought off at that price where the means were fewer the house will judge how far the tax has purchased off the evil     footnotes  1 see the secret committees reports on the mahratta war  2 vide secret committee reports  3 vide select committee reports 1781  4 the sale to the

thereupon and who were instructed to consider     how the british possessions in the east indies may be held     and governed with the greatest security and advantage to this     country and by what means the happiness of the native     inhabitants may be best protected  your committee in the course of their inquiry into the obedience yielded by the companys servants to the orders of the court of directors the authority of which orders had been strengthened by the regulating act of 1773 could not overlook one of the most essential objects of that act and of those orders namely the taking of gifts and presents these pretended free gifts from the natives to the companys servants in power had never been authorized by law they are contrary to the covenants formerly entered into by the president and council they are strictly forbidden by the act of parliament and forbidden upon grounds of the most substantial policy  before the regulating act of 1773 the allowances made by the company to the presidents of bengal were abundantly sufficient to guaranty them against anything like a necessity for giving into that pernicious practice the act of parliament which appointed a governorgeneral in the place of a president as it was extremely particular in enforcing the prohibition of those presents so it was equally careful in making an ample provision for supporting the dignity of the office in order to remove all excuse for a corrupt increase of its emoluments  although evidence on record as well as verbal testimony has appeared before your committee of presents to a large amount having been received by mr hastings and others before the year 1775 they were not able to find distinct traces of that practice in him or any one else for a few years  the inquiries set on foot in bengal by order of the court of directors in 1775 with regard to all corrupt practices and the vigor with which they were for some time pursued might have given a temporary check to the receipt of presents or might have produced a more effectual concealment of them and afterwards the calamities which befell almost all who were concerned in the first discoveries did probably prevent any further complaint upon the subject but towards the close of the last session your committee have received much of new and alarming information concerning that abuse  the first traces appeared though faintly and obscurely in a letter to the court of directors from the governorgeneral mr hastings written on the 29th of november 178014 it has been stated in a former report of your committee15 that on the 26th of june 1780 mr hastings being very earnest in the prosecution of a particular operation in the mahratta war in order to remove objections to that measure which were made on account of the expense of the contingencies he offered to exonerate the company from that charge continuing his minute of council he says that sum a sum of about 23000l i have already deposited within a small amount in the hands of the subtreasurer and i beg that the board will permit it to be accepted for that service here he offers in his own person he deposits or pretends that he deposits in his own person and with the zeal of a man eager to pledge his private fortune in support of his measures he prays that his offer may be accepted not the least hint that he was delivering back to the company money of their own which he had secreted from them indeed no man ever made it a request much less earnestly entreated begged to be permitted to pay to any persons public or private money that was their own  it appeared to your committee that the money offered for that service which was to forward the operations of a detachment under colonel camac in an expedition against one of the mahratta chiefs was not accepted and your committee having directed search to be made for any sums of money paid into the treasury by mr hastings for this service found that notwithstanding his assertion of having deposited two lacs of rupees or within a trifle of that sum in the hands of the subtreasurer no entry whatsoever of that or any other payment by the governorgeneral was made in the treasury accounts at or about that time16 this circumstance appeared very striking to your committee as the nonappearance in the companys books of the article in question must be owing to one or other of these four causesthat the assertion of mr hastings of his having paid in near two lacs of rupees at that time was not true or that the subtreasurer may receive great sums in deposit without entering them in the companys treasury accounts or that the treasury books themselves are records not to be depended on or lastly that faithful copies of these books of accounts are not transmitted to europe the defect of an entry corresponding with mr hastingss declaration in council can be attributed only to one of these four causesof which the want of foundation in his recorded assertion though very blamable is the least alarming  on the 29th of november following mr hastings communicated to the court of directors some sort of notice of this transaction17 in his letter of that date he varies in no small degree the aspect under which the business appeared in his minute of consultation of the 26th of june in his letter he says to the directors the subject is now become obsolete the fair hopes which i had built upon the prosecution of the mahratta war have been blasted by the dreadful calamities which have befallen your presidency of fort st george and changed the object of our pursuit from the aggrandizement of your power to its preservation after thus confessing or rather boasting of his motives to the mahratta war he proceeds my present reason for reverting to my own conduct on the occasion which i have mentioned namely his offering a sum of money for the companys service is to obviate the false conclusions or purposed misrepresentations which may be made of it either as an artifice of ostentation or the effect of corrupt influence by assuring you that the money by whatever means it came into my possession was not my own that i had myself no right to it nor would or could have received it but for the occasion which prompted me to avail myself of the accidental means which were at that instant afforded me of accepting and converting it to the property and use of the company and with this brief apology i shall dismiss the subject  the apology is brief indeed considering the nature of the transaction and what is more material than its length or its shortness it is in all points unsatisfactory the matter becomes if possible more obscure by his explanation here was money received by mr hastings which according to his own judgment he had no right to receive it was money which but for the occasion that prompted him he could not have accepted it was money which came into his and from his into the companys hands by ways and means undescribed and from persons unnamed yet though apprehensive of false conclusions and purposed misrepresentations he gives his employers no insight whatsoever into a matter which of all others stood in the greatest need of a full and clear elucidation  although he chooses to omit this essential point he expresses the most anxious solicitude to clear himself of the charges that might be made against him of the artifices of ostentation and of corrupt influence to discover if possible the ground for apprehending such imputations your committee adverted to the circumstances in which he stood at the time they found that this letter was dispatched about the time that mr francis took his passage for england his fear of misrepresentation may therefore allude to something which passed in conversation between him and that gentleman at the time the offer was made  it was not easy on the mere face of his offer to give an ill turn to it the act as it stands on the minute is not only disinterested but generous and publicspirited if mr hastings apprehended misrepresentation from mr francis or from any other person your committee conceive that he did not employ proper means for defeating the ill designs of his adversaries on the contrary the course he has taken in his letter to the court of directors is calculated to excite doubts and suspicions in minds the most favorably disposed to him some degree of ostentation is not extremely blamable at a time when a man advances largely from his private fortune towards the public service it is human infirmity at the worst and only detracts something from the lustre of an action in itself meritorious the kind of ostentation which is criminal and criminal only because it is fraudulent is where a person makes a show of giving when in reality he does not give this imposition is criminal more or less according to the circumstances but if the money received to furnish such a pretended gift is taken from any third person without right to take it a new guilt and guilt of a much worse quality and description is incurred the governorgeneral in order to keep clear of ostentation on the 29th of november 1780 declares that the sum of money which he offered on the 26th of the preceding june as his own was not his own and that he had no right to it clearing himself of vanity he convicts himself of deceit and of injustice  the other object of this brief apology was to clear himself of corrupt influence of all ostentation he stands completely acquitted in the month of november however he might have been faulty in that respect in the month of june but with regard to the other part of the apprehended charge namely corrupt influence he gives no satisfactory solution a great sum of money not his ownmoney to which he had no rightmoney which came into his possession by whatever meansif this be not money obtained by corrupt influence or by something worse that is by violence or terror it will be difficult to fix upon circumstances which can furnish a presumption of unjustifiable use of power and influence in the acquisition of profit the last part of the apology that he had converted this money which he had no right to receive to the companys use so far as your committee can discover does nowhere appear he speaks in the minute of the 26th of june as having then actually deposited it for the companys service in the letter of november he says that he converted it to the companys property but there is no trace in the companys books of its being ever brought to their credit in the expenditure for any specific service even if any such entry and expenditure could justify him in taking money which he had by his own confession no right to receive  the directors appear to have been deceived by this representation and in their letter of january 178218 consider the money as actually paid into their treasury even under their error concerning the application of the money they appear rather alarmed than satisfied with the brief apology of the governorgeneral they consider the whole proceeding as extraordinary and mysterious they however do not condemn it with any remarkable asperity after admitting that he might be induced to a temporary secrecy respecting the members of the board from a fear of their resisting the proposed application or any application of this money to the companys use yet they write to the governorgeneral and council as followsit does not appear to us that there could be any real necessity for delaying to communicate to us immediate information of the channel by which the money came into mr hastingss possession with a complete illustration of the cause or causes of so extraordinary an event and again the means proposed of defraying the extra expenses are very extraordinary and the money we conceive must have come into his hands by an unusual channel and when more complete information comes before us we shall give our sentiments fully on the transaction and speaking of this and other moneys under a similar description they say we shall suspend our judgment without approving it in the least degree or proceeding to censure our governorgeneral for this transaction the expectations entertained by the directors of a more complete explanation were natural and their expression tender and temperate but the more complete information which they naturally expected they never have to this day received  mr hastings wrote two more letters to the secret committee of the court of directors in which he mentions this transaction the first dated as he asserts and a mr larkins swears on the 22d of may 178219 the last which accompanied it so late as the 16th of december in the same year20 though so long an interval lay between the transaction of the 26th of june 1780 and the middle of december 1782 upwards of two years no further satisfaction is given he has written since the receipt of the above letter of the court of directors which demanded what they had a right to demand a clear explanation of the particulars of this sum of money which he had no right to receive without giving them any further satisfaction instead of explanation or apology he assumes a tone of complaint and reproach to the directors he lays before them a kind of an account of presents received to the amount of upwards of 200000lsome at a considerable distance of time and which had not been hitherto communicated to the company  in the letter which accompanied that very extraordinary account which then for the first time appeared he discovers no small solicitude to clear himself from the imputation of having these discoveries drawn from him by the terrors of the parliamentary inquiries then on foot to remove all suspicion of such a motive for making these discoveries mr larkins swears in an affidavit made before mr justice hyde bearing even date with the letter which accompanies the account that is of the 16th of december 1782 that this letter had been written by him on the 22d of may several months before it was dispatched21 it appears that mr larkins who makes this voluntary affidavit is neither secretary to the board nor mr hastingss private secretary but an officer of the treasury of bengal  mr hastings was conscious that a question would inevitably arise how he came to delay the sending intelligence of so very interesting a nature from may to december he therefore thinks it necessary to account for so suspicious a circumstance he tells the directors that the dispatch of the lively having been protracted from time to time the accompanying address which was originally designed and prepared for that dispatch and no other since occurring has of course been thus long delayed  the governorgenerals letter is dated the 22d may and the resolution was the last ship of the season dispatched for europe the public letters to the directors are dated the 9th may but it appears by the letter of the commander of the ship that he did not receive his dispatches from mr lloyd then at kedgeree until the 26th may and also that the pilot was not discharged from the ship until the 11th june some of these presents now for the first time acknowledged had been received eighteen months preceding the date of this letternone less than four months so that in fact he might have sent this account by all the ships of that season but the governorgeneral chose to write this letter thirteen days after the determination in council for the dispatch of the last ship  it does not appear that he has given any communication whatsoever to his colleagues in office of those extraordinary transactions nothing appears on the records of the council of the receipt of the presents nor is the transmission of this account mentioned in the general letter to the court of directors but in a letter from himself to their secret committee consisting generally of two persons but at most of three it is to be observed that the governorgeneral states that the dispatch of the lively had been protracted from time to time that this delay was of no public consequence but that it produced a situation which with respect to himself he regarded as unfortunate because it exposed him to the meanest imputations from the occasion which the late parliamentary inquiries have since furnished but which were unknown when his letter was written if the governorgeneral thought his silence exposed him to the meanest imputations he had the means in his own power of avoiding those imputations he might have sent this letter dated the 22d may by the resolution for we find that in a letter from captain poynting of the 26th may he states it not possible for him to proceed to sea with the smallest degree of safety without a supply of anchors and cables and most earnestly requests they may be supplied from calcutta and on the 28th may we find a minute from the secretary of the council mr auriol requesting an order of council to the masterattendant to furnish a sloop to carry down those cables which order was accordingly issued on the 30th may there requires no other proof to show that the governorgeneral had the means of sending this letter seven days after he wrote it instead of delaying it for near seven months and because no conveyance had offered your committee must also remark that the conveyance by land to madras was certain and whilst such important operations were carrying on both by sea and land upon the coast that dispatches would be sent to the admiralty or to the company was highly probable  if the letter of the 22d may had been found in the list of packets sent by the resolution the governor general would have established in a satisfactory manner and far beyond the effect of any affidavit that the letter had been written at the time of the date it appears that the resolution being on her voyage to england met with so severe a gale of wind as to be obliged to put back to bengal and to unload her cargo this event makes no difference in the state of the transaction whatever the cause of these new discoveries might have been at the time of sending them the fact of the parliamentary inquiry was publicly known  in the letter of the above date mr hastings laments the mortification of being reduced to take precautions to guard his reputation from dishonorif i had says he at any time possessed that degree of confidence from my immediate employers which they have never withheld from the meanest of my predecessors i should have disdained to use these attentions  who the meanest of mr hastingss predecessors were does not appear to your committee nor are they able to discern the ground of propriety or decency for his assuming to himself a right to call any of them mean persons but if such mean persons have possessed that degree of confidence from his immediate employers which for so many years he had not possessed at any time inferences must be drawn from thence very unfavorable to one or the other of the parties or perhaps to both the attentions which he practises and disdains can in this case be of no service to himself his employers or the public the only attention at all effectual towards extenuating or in some degree atoning for the guilt of having taken money from individuals illegally was to be full and fair in his confession of all the particulars of his offence this might not obtain that confidence which at no time he has enjoyed but still the company and the nation might derive essential benefit from it the directors might be able to afford redress to the sufferers and by his laying open the concealed channels of abuse means might be furnished for the better discovery and possibly for the prevention or at least for the restraint of a practice of the most dangerous naturea practice of which the mere prohibition without the means of detection must ever prove as hitherto it had proved altogether frivolous  your committee considering that so long a time had elapsed without any of that information which the directors expected and perceiving that this receipt of sums of money under color of gift seemed a growing evil ordered the attendance of mr hastingss agent major scott they had found on former occasions that this gentleman was furnished with much more early and more complete intelligence of the companys affairs in india than was thought proper for the court of directors they therefore examined him concerning every particular sum of money the receipt of which mr hastings had confessed in his account it was to their surprise that mr scott professed himself perfectly uninstructed upon almost every part of the subject though the express object of his mission to england was to clear up such matters as might be objected to mr hastings and for that purpose he had early qualified himself by the production to your committee of his powers of agency the ignorance in which mr hastings had left his agent was the more striking because he must have been morally certain that if his conduct in these points should have escaped animadversion from the court of directors it must become an object of parliamentary inquiry for in his letter of the 15th 16th of december 1782 to the court of directors he expressly mentions his fears that those parliamentary inquiries might be thought to have extorted from him the confessions which he had made  your committee however entering on a more strict examination concerning the two lacs of rupees which mr hastings declares he had no right to take but had taken from some person then unknown major scott recollected that mr hastings had in a letter of the 7th of december 1782 in which he refers to some former letter acquainted him with the name of the person from whom he had received these two lacs of rupees mentioned in the minute of june 1780 it turned out to be the rajah of benares the unfortunate cheyt sing  in the single instance in which mr scott seemed to possess intelligence in this matter he is preferred to the court of directors under their censure as mr hastings was and as he felt himself to be for not informing them of the channel in which he received that money he perseveres obstinately and contemptuously to conceal it from them though he thought fit to intrust his agent with the secret  your committee were extremely struck with this intelligence they were totally unacquainted with it when they presented to the house the supplement to their second report on the affairs of cheyt sing a gift received by mr hastings from the rajah of benares gave rise in their minds to serious reflections on the condition of the princes of india subjected to the british authority mr hastings was at the very time of his receiving this gift in the course of making on the rajah of benares a series of demands unfounded and unjustifiable and constantly growing in proportion as they were submitted to to these demands the rajah of benares besides his objections in point of right constantly sat up a plea of poverty presents from persons who hold up poverty as a shield against extortion can scarcely in any case be considered as gratuitous whether the plea of poverty be true or false in this case the presents might have been bestowed if not with an assurance at least with a rational hope of some mitigation in the oppressive requisitions that were made by mr hastings for to give much voluntarily when it is known that much will be taken away forcibly is a thing absurd and impossible on the other one hand the acceptance of that gift by mr hastings must have pledged a tacit faith for some degree of indulgence towards the donor if it was a free gift gratitude if it was a bargain justice obliged him to do it if on the other hand mr hastings originally destined as he says he did this money given to himself secretly and for his private emolument to the use of the company the companys favor to whom he acted as trustee ought to have been purchased by it in honor and justice he bound and pledged himself for that power which was to profit by the gift and to profit too in the success of an expedition which mr hastings thought so necessary to their aggrandizement the unhappy man found his money accepted but no favor acquired on the part either of the company or of mr hastings  your committee have in another report stated to the house that mr hastings attributed the extremity of distress which the detachments under colonel camac had suffered and the great desertions which ensued on that expedition to the want of punctuality of the rajah in making payment of one of the sums which had been extorted from him and this want of punctual payment was afterwards assigned as a principal reason for the ruin of this prince your committee have shown to the house by a comparison of facts and dates that this charge is wholly without foundation but if the cause of colonel camacs failure had been true as to the sum which was the object of the public demand the failure could not be attributed to the rajah when he had on the instant privately furnished at least 23000l to mr hastingsthat is furnished the identical money which he tells us but carefully concealing the name of the giver he had from the beginning destined as he afterwards publicly offered for this very expedition of colonel camacs the complication of fraud and cruelty in the transaction admits of few parallels mr hastings at the council board of bengal displays himself as a zealous servant of the company bountifully giving from his own fortune and in his letter to the directors as he says himself as going out of the ordinary roads for their advantage22 and all this on the credit of supplies derived from the gift of a man whom he treats with the utmost severity and whom he accuses in this particular of disaffection to the companys cause and interests  with 23000l of the rajahs money in his pocket he persecutes him to his destructionassigning for a reason that his reliance on the rajahs faith and his breach of it were the principal causes that no other provision was made for the detachment on the specific expedition to which the rajahs specific money was to be applied the rajah had given it to be disposed of by mr hastings and if it was not disposed of in the best manner for the accomplishing his objects the accuser himself is the criminal  to take money for the forbearance of a just demand would have been corrupt only but to urge unjust public demandsto accept private pecuniary favors in the course of those demandsand on the pretence of delay or refusal without mercy to persecute a benefactorto refuse to hear his remonstrancesto arrest him in his capital in his palace in the face of all the peoplethus to give occasion to an insurrection and on pretext of that insurrection to refuse all treaty or explanationto drive him from his government and his countryto proscribe him in a general amnestyand to send him all over india a fugitive to publish the shame of british government in all the nations to whom he successively fled for refugethese are proceedings to which for the honor of human nature it is hoped few parallels are to be found in history and in which the illegality and corruption of the acts form the smallest part of the mischief  such is the account of the first sum confessed to be taken as a present by mr hastings since the year 1775 and such are its consequences mr hastings apologizes for this action by declaring that he would not have received the money but for the occasion which prompted him to avail himself of the accidental means which were at that instant afforded him of accepting and converting it to the use of the company23 by this account he considers the act as excusable only by the particular occasion by the temptation of accidental means and by the suggestion of the instant how far this is the case appears by the very next paragraph of this letter in which the account is given and in which the apology is made if these were his sentiments in june 1780 they lasted but a very short time his accidental means appear to be growing habitual  to point out in a clear manner the spirit of the second money transaction to which your committee adverted which is represented by mr hastings as having some affinity with the former anecdote24 for in this light kind of phrase he chooses to express himself to his masters your committee think it necessary to state to the house that the business namely this business which was the second object of their inquiry appears in three different papers and in three different lights on comparing of these authorities in every one of which mr hastings is himself the voucher if one of the three be true the other two must necessarily be false  these three authorities which your committee has accurately compared are first his minutes on the consultations25 secondly his letter to the court of directors on the 29th of november 178026 thirdly his account transmitted on the 16th of december 178227  about eight months after the first transaction relative to cheyt sing and which is just reported that is on the 5th of january 1781 mr hastings produced a demand to the council for money of his own expended for the companys service28 here was no occasion for secrecy mr francis was on his passage to europe mr wheler was alone left who no longer dissented from anything mr hastings was in effect himself the whole council he declared that he had disbursed three lacs of rupees that is thirtyfour thousand five hundred pounds in secret serviceswhich having he says been advanced from my own private cash i request that the same may be repaid to me in the following manner he accordingly desires three bonds for a lac of sicca rupees each to be given to him in two of the companys subscriptionsone to bear interest on the eight per cent loan the other two in the four per cent the bonds were antedated to the beginning of the preceding october on the 9th of the same month that is on the 9th of january 1781 the three bonds were accordingly ordered29 so far the whole transaction appears clear and of a piece private money is subscribed and a public security is taken for it when the companys treasury accounts30 are compared with the proceedings of their councilgeneral a perfect correspondence also appears the three bonds are then there entered to mr hastings and he is credited for principal and interest on them in the exact terms of the order so far the official accountswhich because of their perfect harmony are considered as clear and consistent evidence to one body of fact  the second sort of document relative to these bonds though the first in order of time is mr hastingss letter of the 29th of november 178031 it is written between the time of the expenditure of the money for the companys use and the taking of the bonds here for the first time a very material difference appears and the difference is the more striking because mr hastings claimed the whole money as his own and took bonds for it as such after this representation the letter to the company discovers that part of the money the whole of which he had declared on record to be his own and for which he had taken bonds was not his but the property of his masters from whom he had taken the security it is no less remarkable that the letter which represents the money as belonging to the company was written about six weeks before the minute of council in which he claims that money as his own it is this letter on which your committee is to remark  mr hastings after giving his reasons for the application of the three lacs of rupees and for his having for some time concealed the fact says two thirds of that sum i have raised by my own credit and shall charge it in my official account the other third i have supplied from the cash in my hands belonging to the honorable company32  the house will observe that in november he tells the directors that he shall charge only two thirds in his official accounts in the following january he charges the whole33 for the other third although he admitted that to belong to the company we have seen that he takes a bond to himself  it is material that he tells the company in his letter that these two lacs of rupees were raised on his credit his letter to the council says that they were advanced from his private cash what he raises on his credit may on a fair construction be considered as his own but in this too he fails for it is certain he has never transferred these bonds to any creditor nor has he stated any sum he has paid or for which he stands indebted on that account to any specific person indeed it was out of his power for the first two thirds of the money which he formerly stated as raised upon his credit he now confesses to have been from the beginning the companys property and therefore could not have been raised on his private credit or borrowed from any person whatsoever  to these two accounts thus essentially varying he has added a third34 varying at least as essentially from both in his last or third account which is a statement of all the sums he has received in an extraordinary manner and confessed to be the companys property he reverses the items of his first account and instead of allowing the company but one third and claiming two thirds for himself he enters two of the bonds each for a lac of rupees as belonging to the company of the third bond which appears so distinctly in the consultations and in the treasury accounts not one word is said ten thousand pounds is absorbed sinks and disappears at once and no explanation whatsoever concerning it is given mr hastings seems not yet to have decided to whose account it ought to be placed in this manner his debt to the company or the companys to him is just what he thinks fit in a single article he has varied three times in one account he states the whole to be his own in another he claims two thirds in the last he gives up the claim of the two thirds and says nothing to the remaining portion  to make amends however for the suppression of this third bond given with the two others in january 1781 and antedated to the beginning of october mr hastings in the abovementioned general account subjoined to his letter of the 22d may 1782 has brought to the companys credit a new bond35  this bond is for 17000l it was taken from the company and so it appears on their treasury accounts on the 23d of november 1780 he took no notice of this when in january following he called upon his own council for the three others what is more extraordinary he was equally silent with regard to it when only six days after its date he wrote concerning the subject of the three other bonds to the court of directors yet now it comes out that that bond also was taken by mr hastings from the company for money which he declares he had received on the companys account and that he entered himself as creditor when he ought to have made himself debtor  your committee examined major scott concerning this money which mr hastings must have obtained in some clandestine and irregular mode but they could obtain no information of the persons from whom it was taken nor of the occasion or pretence of taking this large sum nor does any minute of council appear for its application to any service the whole of the transaction whatever it was relative to this bond is covered with the thickest obscurity  mr hastings to palliate the blame of his conduct declares that he has not received any interest on these bondsand that he has indorsed them as not belonging to himself but to the company36 as to the first part of this allegation whether he received the interest or let it remain in arrear is a matter of indifference as he entitled himself to it and so far as the legal security he has taken goes he may whenever he pleases dispose both of principal and interest what he has indorsed on the bonds or when he made the indorsement or whether in fact he has made it at all are matters known only to himself for the bonds must be in his possession and are nowhere by him stated to be given up or cancelledwhich is a thing very remarkable when he confesses that he had no right to receive them  these bonds make but a part of the account of private receipts of money by mr hastings formerly paid into the treasury as his own property and now allowed not to be so this account brings into view other very remarkable matters of a similar nature and description37  in the public records a sum of not less than 23871l is set to his credit as a deposit for his private account paid in by him into the treasury in gold and coined at the companys mint38 this appears in the account furnished to the directors under the date of may 1782 not to be lawfully his money and he therefore transfers it to the companys credit it still remains as a deposit39  that the house may be apprised of the nature of this article of deposit it may not be improper to state that the company receive into their treasury the cash of private persons placed there as in a bank on this no interest is paid and the party depositing has a right to receive it upon demand under this head of account no public money is ever entered mr hastings neither at making the deposit as his own nor at the time of his disclosure of the real proprietor which he makes to be the company has given any information of the persons from whom this money had been received mr scott was applied to by your committee but could not give any more satisfaction in this particular than in those relative to the bonds  the title of the account of the 22d of may purports not only that those sums were paid into the companys treasury by mr hastingss order but that they were applied to the companys service no service is specified directly or by any reference to which this great sum of money has been applied  two extraordinary articles follow this in the may account amounting to about 29000l40 these articles are called receipts for durbar charges the general head of durbar charges made by persons in office when analyzed into the particulars contains various expenses including bounties and presents made by government chiefly in the foreign department but in the last account he confesses that this sum also is not his but the companys property but as in all the rest so in this he carefully conceals the means by which he acquired the money the time of his taking it and the persons from whom it was taken this is the more extraordinary because in looking over the journals and ledgers of the treasury the presents received and carried to the account of the company which were generally small and complimental were precisely entered with the name of the giver  your committee on turning to the account of durbar charges in the ledger of that month find the sum as stated in the account of may 22d to be indeed paid in but there is no specific application whatsoever entered  the account of the whole money thus clandestinely received as stated on the 22d of may 1782 and for a great part of which mr hastings to that time took credit for and for the rest has accounted in an extraordinary manner as his own amounts in the whole to upwards of ninetythree thousand pounds sterling a vast sum to be so obtained and so loosely accounted for if the money taken from the rajah of benares be added as it ought it will raise the sum to upwards of 116000l if the 11600l bond in october be added it will be upwards of 128000l received in a secret manner by mr hastings in about one year and five months to all these he adds another sum of one hundred thousand pounds received as a present from the subah of oude total upwards of 228000l  your committee find that this last is the only sum the giver of which mr hastings has thought proper to declare it is to be observed that he did not receive this 100000l in money but in bills on a great native moneydealer resident at benares and who has also an house at calcutta he is called gopâl dâs the negotiation of these bills tended to make a discovery not so difficult as it would have been in other cases  with regard to the application of this last sum of money which is said to be carried to the durbar charges of april 1782 your committee are not enabled to make any observations on it as the account of that period has not yet arrived  your committee have in another report remarked fully upon most of the circumstances of this extraordinary transaction here they only bring so much of these circumstances again into view as may serve to throw light upon the true nature of the sums of money taken by british subjects in power under the name of presents and to show how far they are entitled to that description in any sense which can fairly imply in the pretended donors either willingness or ability to give the condition of the bountiful parties who are not yet discovered may be conjectured from the state of those who have been made known as far as that state anywhere appears their generosity is found in proportion not to the opulence they possess or to the favors they receive but to the indigence they feel and the insults they are exposed to the house will particularly attend to the situation of the principal giver the subah of oude  when the knife says he had penetrated to the bone and i was surrounded with such heavy distresses that i could no longer live in expectations i wrote you an account of my difficulties  the answer which i have received to it is such that it has given me inexpressible grief and affliction i never had the least idea or expectation from you and the council that you would ever have given your orders in so afflicting a manner in which you never before wrote and which i could not have imagined as i am resolved to obey your orders and directions of the council without any delay as long as i live i have agreeably to those orders delivered up all my private papers to him the resident that when he shall have examined my receipts and expenses he may take whatever remains as i know it to be my duty to satisfy you the company and council i have not failed to obey in any instance but requested of him that it might be done so as not to distress me in my necessary expenses there being no other funds but those for the expenses of my mutseddies household expenses and servants c he demanded these in such a manner that being remediless i was obliged to comply with what he required he has accordingly stopped the pensions of my old servants for thirty years whether sepoys mutseddies or household servants and the expenses of my family and kitchen together with the jaghires of my grandmother mother and aunts and of my brothers and dependants which were for their support i had raised thirteen hundred horse and three battalions of sepoys to attend upon me but as i have no resources to support them i have been obliged to remove the people stationed in the mahals districts and to send his people the residents people into the mahals so that i have not now one single servant about me should i mention to what further difficulties i have been reduced it would lay me open to contempt  in other parts of this long remonstrance as well as in other remonstrances no less serious he says that it is difficult for him to save himself alive that in all his affairs mr hastings had given full powers to the gentlemen here meaning the english resident and assistants who have done whatever they chose and still continue to do it i never expected that you would have brought me into such apprehension and into so weak a state without writing to me on any one of those subjects since i have not the smallest connection with anybody except yourself i am in such distress both day and night that i see not the smallest prospect of deliverance from it since you are so displeased with me as not to honor me with a single letter  in another remonstrance he thus expresses himself the affairs of this world are unstable and soon pass away it would therefore be incumbent on the english gentlemen to show some friendship for me in my necessitiesi who have always exerted my very life in the service of the english assigned over to them all the resources left in my country stopped my very household expenses together with the jaghires of my servants and dependants to the amount of 9898375 rupees besides this as to the jaghires of my grandmother mother and uncle which were granted to them for their support agreeable to engagements you are the mastersif the council have sent orders for the stopping their jaghires also stop them i have no resources left in my country and have no friends by me being even distressed in my daily subsistence i have some elephants horses and the houses which i inhabit if they can be of any service to my friends they are ready whenever you can discover any resources seize upon them i shall not interfere to prevent you in my present distress for my daily expenses i was in hopes that they would have excused some part of my debt of what use is it for me to relate my situation which is known to the whole world this much is sufficient  the truth of all these representations is nowhere contested by mr hastings it is indeed admitted in something stronger than words for upon account of the nabobs condition and the no less distressed condition of his dominions he thought it fit to withdraw from him and them a large body of the companys troops together with all the english of a civil description who were found no less burdensome than the military this was done on the declared inability of the country any longer to support thema country not much inferior to england in extent and fertility and till lately at least its equal in population and culture  it was to a prince in a state so far remote from freedom authority and opulence so penetrated with the treatment he had received and the behavior he had met with from mr hastings that mr hastings has chosen to attribute a disposition so very generous and munificent as of his own free grace and mere motion to make him a present at one donation of upwards of one hundred thousand pounds sterling this vast private donation was given at the moment of vast instant demands severely exacted on account of the company and accumulated on immense debts to the same bodyand all taken from a ruined prince and almost desolated territory  mr hastings has had the firmness with all possible ease and apparent unconcern to request permission from the directors to legalize this forbidden present for his own use this he has had the courage to do at a time when he had abundant reason to look for what he has since receivedtheir censure for many material parts of his conduct towards the people from whose wasted substance this pretended free gift was drawn he does not pretend that he has reason to expect the smallest degree of partiality in this or any other point from the court of directors for besides his complaint first stated of having never possessed their confidence in a late letter41 in which notwithstanding the censures of parliament he magnifies his own conduct he says that in all the long period of his service he has almost unremittedly wanted the support which all his predecessors had enjoyed from their constituents from mine says he i have received nothing but reproach hard epithets and indignities instead of rewards and encouragement it must therefore have been from some other source of protection than that which the law had placed over him that he looked for countenance and reward in violating an act of parliament which forbid him from taking gifts or presents on any account whatsoevermuch less a gift of this magnitude which from the distress of the giver must be supposed the effect of the most cruel extortion  the directors did wrong in their orders to appropriate money which they must know could not have been acquired by the consent of the pretended donor to their own use42 they acted more properly in refusing to confirm this grant to mr hastings and in choosing rather to refer him to the law which he had violated than to his own sense of what he thought he was entitled to take from the natives putting him in mind that the regulating act had expressly declared that no governorgeneral or any of the council shall directly or indirectly accept receive or take of or from any person or persons or on any account whatsoever any present gift donation gratuity or reward pecuniary or otherwise or any promise or engagement for any of the aforesaid here is no reserve for the case of a disclosure to the directors and for the legalizing the breach of an act of parliament by their subsequent consent the illegality attached to the action at its very commencement and it could never be afterwards legalized the directors had no such power reserved to them words cannot be devised of a stronger import or studied with more care to these words of the act are opposed the declaration and conduct of mr hastings who in his letter of january 1782 thinks fit to declare that an offer of a very considerable sum of money was made to him both on the part of the nabob and his ministers as a present which he accepted without hesitation the plea of his pretended necessity is of no avail the present was not in ready money nor as your committee conceive applicable to his immediate necessities even his credit was not bettered by bills at long periods he does not pretend that he raised any money upon them nor is it conceivable that a banker at benares would be more willing to honor the drafts of so miserable undone and dependent a person as the nabob of oude than those of the governorgeneral of bengal which might be paid either on the receipt of the benares revenue or at the seat of his power and of the companys exchequer besides it is not explicable upon any grounds that can be avowed why the nabob who could afford to give these bills as a present to mr hastings could not have equally given them in discharge of the debt which he owed to the company it is indeed very much to be feared that the people of india find it sometimes turn more to their account to give presents to the english in authority than to pay their debts to the public and this is a matter of a very serious consideration  no small merit is made by mr hastings and that too in a high and upbraiding style of his having come to a voluntary discovery of this and other unlawful practices of the same kind that honorable court says mr hastings addressing himself to his masters in his letter of december 1782 ought to know whether i possess the integrity and honor which are the first requisites of such a station if i wanted these they have afforded me too powerful incentives to suppress the information which i now convey to them through you and to appropriate to my own use the sums which i have already passed to their credit by their unworthy and pardon me if i add dangerous reflections which they have passed upon me for the first communication of this kind and he immediately adds what is singular and striking and savors of a recriminatory insinuation and your own experience will suggest to you that there are persons who would profit by such a warning43 to what directors in particular this imputation of experience is applied and what other persons they are in whom experience has shown a disposition to profit of such a warning is a matter highly proper to be inquired into what mr hastings says further on this subject is no less worthy of attentionthat he could have concealed these transactions if he had a wrong motive from theirs and the public eye forever44 it is undoubtedly true that whether the observation be applicable to the particular case or not practices of this corrupt nature are extremely difficult of detection anywhere but especially in india but all restraint upon that grand fundamental abuse of presents is gone forever if the servants of the company can derive safety from a defiance of the law when they can no longer hope to screen themselves by an evasion of it all hope of reformation is at an end if confiding in the force of a faction among directors or proprietors to bear them out and possibly to vote them the fruit of their crimes as a reward of their discovery they find that their bold avowal of their offences is not only to produce indemnity but to be rated for merit if once a presumption is admitted that wherever something is divulged nothing is hid the discovering of one offence may become the certain means of concealing a multitude of others the contrivance is easy and trivial and lies open to the meanest proficient in this kind of art it will not only become an effectual cover to such practices but will tend infinitely to increase them in that case sums of money will be taken for the purpose of discovery and making merit with the company and other sums will be taken for the private advantage of the receiver  it must certainly be impossible for the natives to know what presents are for one purpose or what for the other it is not for a gentoo or a mahometan landholder at the foot of the remotest mountains in india who has no access to our records and knows nothing of our language to distinguish what lacs of rupees which he has given eo nomine as a present to a companys servant are to be authorized by his masters in leadenhall street as proper and legal or carried to their public account at their pleasure and what are laid up for his own emolument  the legislature in declaring all presents to be the property of the company could not consider corruption extortion and fraud as any part of their resources the property in such presents was declared to be theirs not as a fund for their benefit but in order to found a legal title to a civil suit it was declared theirs to facilitate the recovery out of corrupt and oppressive hands of money illegally taken but this legal fiction of property could not nor ought by the legislature to be considered in any other light than as a trust held by them for those who suffered the injury upon any other construction the company would have a right first to extract money from the subjects or dependants of this kingdom committed to their care by means of particular conventions or by taxes by rents and by monopolies and when they had exhausted every contrivance of public imposition then they were to be at liberty to let loose upon the people all their servants from the highest rank to the lowest to prey upon them at pleasure and to draw by personal and official authority by influence venality and terror whatever was left to themand that all this was justified provided the product was paid into the companys exchequer  this prohibition and permission of presents with this declaration of property in the company would leave no property to any man in india if however it should be thought that this clause in the act45 should be capable by construction and retrospect of so legalizing and thus appropriating these presents which your committee conceive impossible it is absolutely necessary that it should be very fully explained  the provision in the act was made in favor of the natives if such construction prevails the provision made as their screen from oppression will become the means of increasing and aggravating it without bounds and beyond remedy if presents which when they are given were unlawful can afterwards be legalized by an application of them to the companys service no sufferer can even resort to a remedial process at law for his own relief the moment he attempts to sue the money may be paid into the companys treasury it is then lawfully taken and the party is nonsuited  the company itself must suffer extremely in the whole order and regularity of their public accounts if the idea upon which mr hastings justifies the taking of these presents receives the smallest countenance on his principles the same sum may become private property or public at the pleasure of the receiver it is in his power mr hastings says to conceal it forever46 he certainly has it in his power not only to keep it back and bring it forward at his own times but even to shift and reverse the relations in the accounts as mr hastings has done in what manner and proportion seems good to him and to make himself alternately debtor or creditor for the same sums  of this irregularity mr hastings himself appears in some degree sensible he conceives it possible that his transactions of this nature may to the court of directors seem unsatisfactory he however puts it hypothetically if to you says he who are accustomed to view business in an official and regular light they should appear unprecedented if not improper47 he just conceives it possible that in an official money transaction the directors may expect a proceeding official and regular in what other lights than those which are official and regular matters of public account ought to be regarded by those who have the charge of them either in bengal or in england does not appear to your committee any other is certainly unprecedented and improper and can only serve to cover fraud both in the receipt and in the expenditure the acquisition of 58000 rupees or near 6000l which appears in the sort of unofficial and irregular account that he furnishes of his presents in his letter of may 178248 must appear extraordinary indeed to those who expect from men in office something official and something regular this sum says he i received while i was on my journey to benares49 he tells it with the same careless indifference as if things of this kind were found by accident on the highroad  mr hastings did not indeed he could not doubt that this unprecedented and improper account would produce much discussion he says why these sums were taken by me why they were except the second quietly transferred to the companys account why bonds were taken for the first and not for the rest might were this matter to be exposed to the view of the public furnish a variety of conjectures50  this matter has appeared and has furnished as it ought to do something more serious than conjectures it would in any other case be supposed that mr hastings expecting such inquiries and considering that the questions are even as they are imperfectly stated by himself far from frivolous would condescend to give some information upon them but the conclusion of a sentence so importantly begun and which leads to such expectations is that to these conjectures it would be of little use to reply this is all he says to public conjecture  to the court of directors he is very little more complaisant and not at all more satisfactory he states merely as a supposition their inquiry concerning matters of which he positively knew that they had called for an explanation he knew it because he presumed to censure them for doing so to the hypothesis of a further inquiry he gives a conjectural answer of such a kind as probably in an account of a doubtful transaction and to a superior was never done before  were your honorable court to question me upon these points i would answer that the sums were taken for the companys benefit at times in which the company very much stood in need of them that i either chose to conceal the first receipts from public curiosity by receiving bonds for the amount or possibly acted without any studied design which my memory could at this distance of time verify51  he here professes not to be certain of the motives by which he was himself actuated in so extraordinary a concealment and in the use of such extraordinary means to effect it and as if the acts in question were those of an absolute stranger and not his own he gives various loose conjectures concerning the motive to them he even supposes in taking presents contrary to law and in taking bonds for them as his own contrary to what he admits to be truth and fact that he might have acted without any distinct motive at all or at least such as his memory could reach at that distance of time that immense distance in the faintness of which his recollection is so completely lost as to set him guessing at his motives for his own conduct was from the 15th of january 1781 when the bonds at his own request were given to the date of this letter which is the 22d of may 1782that is to say about one year and four months  as to the other sums for which no bond was taken the ground for the difference in his explanation is still more extraordinary he says i did not think it worth my care to observe the same means with the rest52 the rest of these sums which were not worth his care are stated in his account to be greater than those he was so solicitous for some reason which he cannot guess to cover under bonds these sums amount to near 53000l whereas the others did not much exceed 40000l for these actions attended with these explanations he ventures to appeal to their the directors breasts for a candid interpretation and he assumes the freedom to add that he thinks himself on such a subject and on such an occasion entitled to it53 and then as if he had performed some laudable exploit in the accompanying letter he glories in the integrity of his conduct and anticipating his triumph over injustice and the applauses which at a future time he seems confident he shall receive says he the applause of my own breast is my surest reward your applause and that of my country is my next wish in life54 he declares in that very letter that he had not at any time possessed the confidence with them which they never withheld from the meanest of his predecessors with wishes so near his heart perpetually disappointed and instead of applauses as he tells us receiving nothing but reproaches and disgraceful epithets his steady continuance for so many years in their service in a place obnoxious in the highest degree to suspicion and censure is a thing altogether singular  it appears very necessary to your committee to observe upon the great leading principles which mr hastings assumes to justify the irregular taking of these vast sums of money and all the irregular means he had employed to cover the greater part of it these principles are the more necessary to be inquired into because if admitted they will serve to justify every species of improper conduct his words are that the sources from which these reliefs to the public service have come would never have yielded them to the company publicly and that the exigencies of their service exigencies created by the exposition of their affairs and faction in their divided councils required those supplies55  as to the first of these extraordinary positions your committee cannot conceive what motive could actuate any native of india dependent on the company in assisting them privately and in refusing to assist them publicly if the transaction was fair and honest every native must have been desirous of making merit with the great governing power if he gave his money as a free gift he might value himself upon very honorable and very acceptable service if he lent it on the companys bonds it would still have been of service and he might also receive eight per cent for his money no native could without some interested view give to the governorgeneral what he would refuse to the company as a grant or even as a loan it is plain that the powers of government must in some way or other be understood by the natives to be at sale the governorgeneral says that he took the money with an original destination to the purposes to which he asserts he has since applied it but this original destination was in his own mind onlynot declared nor by him pretended to be declared to the party who gave the presents and who could perceive nothing in it but money paid to the supreme magistrate for his private emolument all that the natives could possibly perceive in such a transaction must be highly dishonorable to the companys government for they must conceive when they gave money to mr hastings that they bought from mr hastings either what was their own right or something that was not so or that they redeemed themselves from some acts of rigor inflicted threatened or apprehended if in the first case mr hastings gave them the object for which they bargained his act however proper was corruptif he did not it was both corrupt and fraudulent if the money was extorted by force or threats it was oppressive and tyrannical the very nature of such transactions has a tendency to teach the natives to pay a corrupt court to the servants of the company and they must thereby be rendered less willing or less able or perhaps both to fulfil their engagements to the state mr scotts evidence asserts that they would rather give to mr hastings than lend to the company it is very probable but it is a demonstration of their opinion of his power and corruption and of the weak and precarious state of the companys authority  the second principle assumed by mr hastings for his justification namely that factious opposition and a divided government might create exigencies requiring such supplies is full as dangerous as the first for if in the divisions which must arise in all councils one member of government when he thinks others factiously disposed shall be entitled to take money privately from the subject for the purposes of his politics and thereby to dispense with an act of parliament pretences for that end cannot be wanting a dispute may always be raised in council in order to cover oppression and peculation elsewhere but these principles of mr hastings tend entirely to destroy the character and functions of a council and to vest them in one of the dissentient members the law has placed the sense of the whole in the majority and it is not a thing to be suffered that any of the members should privately raise money for the avowed purpose of defeating that sense or for promoting designs that are contrary to it a more alarming assumption of power in an individual member of any deliberative or executive body cannot be imagined mr hastings had no right in order to clear himself of peculation to criminate the majority with faction no member of any body outvoted on a question has or can have a right to direct any part of his public conduct by that principle the members of the council had a common superior to whom they might appeal in their mutual charges of faction they did so frequently and the imputation of faction has almost always been laid on mr hastings himself  but there were periods very distinguished periods too in the records of the company in which the clandestine taking of money could not be supported even by this pretence mr hastings has been charged with various acts of peculation perpetrated at a time he could not excuse himself by the plea of any public purpose to be carried on or of any faction in council by which it was traversed it may be necessary here to recall to the recollection of the house that on the cry which prevailed of the ill practices of the companys servants in india which general cry in a great measure produced the regulating act of 1773 the court of directors in their instructions of the 29th of march 1774 gave it as an injunction to the councilgeneral that they immediately cause the strictest inquiry to be made into all oppressions which may have been committed either against natives or europeans and into all abuses which may have prevailed in the collection of the revenues or any part of the civil government of the presidency and that you communicate to us all information which you may be able to obtain relative thereto or any embezzlement or dissipation of the companys money  in this inquiry by far the most important abuse which appeared on any of the above heads was that which was charged relative to the sale in gross by mr hastings of nothing less than the whole authority of the country government in the disposal of the guardianship of the nabob of bengal  the present nabob mobarek ul dowlah was a minor when he succeeded to the title and office of subahdar of the three provinces in 1770 although in a state approaching to subjection still his rank and character were important much was necessarily to depend upon a person who was to preserve the moderation of a sovereign not supported by intrinsic power and yet to maintain the dignity necessary to carry on the representation of political government as well as the substance of the whole criminal justice of a great country a good education conformably to the maxims of his religion and the manners of his people was necessary to enable him to fill that delicate place with reputation either to the mahometan government or to ours he had still to manage a revenue not inconsiderable which remained as the sole resource for the languishing dignity of persons any way distinguished in rank among mussulmen who were all attached and clung to him these considerations rendered it necessary to put his person and affairs into proper hands they ought to have been men who were able by the gravity of their rank and character to preserve his morals from the contagion of low and vicious companymen who by their integrity and firmness might be enabled to resist in some degree the rapacity of europeans as well as to secure the remaining fragments of his property from the attempts of the natives themselves who must lie under strong temptation of taking their share in the last pillage of a decaying house  the directors were fully impressed with the necessity of such an arrangement your committee find that on the 26th of august 1771 they gave instructions to the president and council to appoint a minister to transact the political affairs of the circar governmentand to select for that purpose some person well qualified for the affairs of government to be the minister of the government and guardian of the nabobs minority  the order was so distinct as not to admit of a mistake it was for its matter provident and well considered and the trust which devolved on mr hastings was of such a nature as might well stimulate a man sensible to reputation to fulfil it in a manner agreeably to the directions he had received and not only above just cause of exception but out of the reach of suspicion and malice in that situation it was natural to suppose he would cast his eyes upon men of the first repute and consideration among the mussulmen of high rank  mr hastings instead of directing his eyes to the durbar employed his researches in the seraglio in the inmost recesses of that place he discovered a woman secluded from the intercourse and shut up from the eyes of men whom he found to correspond with the orders he had received from the directors as a person well qualified for the affairs of government fit to be a minister of government and the guardian of the nabobs minority this woman he solemnly invests with these functions he appoints rajah gourdas whom some time after he himself qualified with a description of a young man of mean abilities to be her duan or steward of the household the rest of the arrangement was correspondent to this disposition of the principal offices  it seems not to have been lawful or warrantable in mr hastings to set aside the arrangement positively prescribed by the court of directors which evidently pointed to a man not to any woman whatever as a woman confined in the female apartment the lady he appointed could not be competent to hold or qualified to exercise any active employment she stood in need of guardians for herself and had not the ability for the guardianship of a person circumstanced as the subah was general clavering colonel monson and mr francis declare in their minute that they believe there never was an instance in india of such a trust so disposed of mr hastings has produced no precedent in answer to this objection  it will be proper to state to the house the situation and circumstances of the women principally concerned who were in the seraglio of jaffier ali khân at his death the first of these was called munny begum a person originally born of poor and obscure parents who delivered her over to the conductress of a company of dancing girls in which profession being called to exhibit at a festival the late nabob took a liking to her and after some cohabitation she obtained such influence over him that he took her for one of his wives and she seems to have been the favorite put her at the head of his harem and having a son by her this son succeeded to his authority and estatemunny begum the mother being by his will a devisee of considerable sums of money and other effects on which he left a charge which has since been applied to the service of the east india company the son of this lady dying and a son by another wife succeeding and dying also the present nabob mobarek ul dowlah son by a third wife succeeded this woman was then alive and in the seraglio  it was munny begum that mr hastings chose and not the natural mother of the nabob whether having chosen a woman in defiance of the companys orders and in passing by the natural parent of the minor prince he was influenced by respect for the disposition made by the deceased nabob during his life or by other motives the house will determine upon a view of the facts which follow it will be matter of inquiry when the question is stated upon the appointment of a stepmother in exclusion of the parent whether the usage of the east constantly authorizes the continuance of that same distribution of rank and power which was settled in the seraglio during the life of a deceased prince and which was found so settled at his death and afterwards to the exclusion of the mother of the successor in case of female guardianship her claim seems to be a right of nature and which nothing but a very clear positive law will if that can authorize the departure from the history of munny begum is stated on the records of the councilgeneral and no attempt made by mr hastings to controvert the truth of it  that was charged by the majority of council to have happened which might be expected inevitably to happen the care of the nabobs education was grossly neglected and his fortune as grossly mismanaged and embezzled what connection this waste and embezzlement had with the subsequent events the house will judge  on the 2d of may 1775 mr james grant accountant to the provincial council of moorshedabad produced to the governorgeneral and council certain persian papers which stated nine lacs of rupees upwards of ninety thousand pounds sterling received by munny begum on her appointment to the management of the nabobs household over and above the balance due at that time and not accounted for by her these grant had received from nuned roy who had been a writer in the begums treasury office both mr grant and nuned roy were called before the board and examined respecting the authenticity of the papers among other circumstances tending to establish the credit of these papers it appears that mr grant offered to make oath that the chief eunuch of the begum had come to him on purpose to prevail on him not to send the papers and had declared that the accounts were not to be disputed  on the 9th of may it was resolved by a majority of the board against the opinion and solemn protest of the governorgeneral that a gentleman should be sent up to the city of moorshedabad to demand of munny begum the accounts of the nizamut and household from april 1764 to the latest period to which they could be closed and to divest the begum of the office of guardian to the nabob and mr charles goring was appointed for this purpose  the preceding facts are stated to the house not as the foundation of an inquiry into the conduct of the begum but as they lead to and are therefore necessary to explain by what means a discovery was made of a sum of money given by her to mr hastings  mr gorings first letter from the city dated 17th may 1775 mentions among other particulars the young nabobs joy at being delivered out of the hands of munny begum of the mean and indigent state of confinement in which he was kept by her of the distress of his mother and that he had told mr goring that the begums eunuch had instructed the servants not to suffer him to learn anything by which he might make himself acquainted with business and he adds indeed i believe there is great truth in it as his excellency seems to be ignorant of almost everything a man of his rank ought to knownot from a want of understanding but of being properly educated  on the 21st of may mr goring transmitted to the governorgeneral and council an account of sums given by the begum under her seal delivered to mr goring by the nabob in her apartments the account is as follows      memorandum of disbursements to english gentlemen from the     nabobs sircar in the bengal year 1179                                                                                     seal of munny begum                                          mother of the nabob                                           nudjuf ul dowlah                                             deceased                                                             to the governor mr hastings for an       entertainment                                  150000        to mr middleton on account of an agreement       entered into by baboo begum                    150000                                                                                                   rupees   300000    when this paper was delivered the governorgeneral moved that mr goring might be asked how he came by it and on what account this partial selection was made by him also that the begum should be desired to explain the sum laid to his charge and that he should ask the nabob or the begum their reasons for delivering this separate account  the substance of the governors proposal was agreed to  mr gorings answer to this requisition of the board is as follows  in compliance with your orders to explain the delivery of the paper containing an account of three lacs of rupees i am to inform you it took its rise from a message sent me by the begum requesting i would interest myself with the nabob to have akbar ali khân released to her for a few hours having something of importance to communicate to me on which she wished to consult him thinking the service might be benefited by it i accordingly desired the nabob would be pleased to deliver him to my charge engaging to return him the same nightwhich i did i heard no more till next day when the begum requested to see his excellency and myself desiring akbar ali might attend  on our first meeting she entered into a long detail of her administration endeavoring to represent it in the fairest light at last she came to the point and told me my urgent and repeated remonstrances to her to be informed how the balance arose of which i was to inquire induced her from memory to say what she had herself giventhen mentioning the sum of a lac and a half to the governor to feast him whilst he stayed there and a lac and a half to mr middleton by the hands of baboo begum as i looked on this no more than a matter of conversation i arose to depart but was detained by the begums requesting the nabob to come to her a scene of weeping and complaint then began which made me still more impatient to be gone and i repeatedly sent to his excellency for that purpose he at last came out and delivered me the paper i sent you declaring it was given him by the begum to be delivered me  munny begum also wrote a letter to general clavering in which she directly asserts the same mr goring has pressed me on the subject of the balances in answer to which i informed him that all the particulars being on record would in the course of the inquiry appear from the papers he accordingly received from the nabob mobarek ul dowlah a list of three lacs of rupees given to the governor and mr middleton i now send you inclosed a list of the dates when it was presented and through whose means which you will receive  the governorgeneral then desired that the following questions might be proposed to the begum by mr martin then resident at the durbar  1st was any application made to you for the account which you have delivered of three lacs of rupees said to have been paid to the governor and mr middleton or did you deliver the account of your own free will and unsolicited  2d in what manner was the application made to you and by whom  3d on what account was the sum of one and half lacs given to the governorgeneral which you have laid to his account was it in consequence of any requisition from him or of any previous agreement or of any established usage  the governorgeneral objected strongly to mr gorings being present when the questions were put to the begum but it was insisted on by the majority and it was resolved accordingly that he ought to be present the reasons on both sides will best appear by the copy of the debate inserted in the appendix  the begums answer to the preceding questions addressed to the governorgeneral and council where it touched the substance was as follows  the case is this mr goring on his arrival here seized all the papers and secured them under his seal and all the mutsuddies clerks or accountants attended him and explained to him all the particulars of them mr goring inquired of me concerning the arrears due to the sepoys c observing that the nizamut and bhela money nabobs allowance was received from the company from whence then could the balance arise i made answer that the sum was not adequate to the expenses mr goring then asked what are those expenses which exceed the sum received from the company i replied all the particulars will be found in the papers the affair of the three lacs of rupees on account of entertainment for the governor and mr middleton has been i am told related to you by rajah gourdas besides which there are many other expenses which will appear from the papers as the custom of entertainment is of long standing and accordingly every governor of calcutta who came to moorshedabad received a daily sum of two thousand rupees for entertainment which was in fact instead of provisions and the lac and an half of rupees laid to mr middletons charge was a present on account of an agreement entered into by the bhow begum i therefore affixed my seal to the account and forwarded it to mr goring by means of the nabob  in this answer the accounts given to mr goring she asserts to be genuine they are explained in all the particulars by all the secretaries and clerks in office they are secured under mr gorings seal to them she refers for everything to them she refers for the three lacs of rupees given to mr hastings and mr middleton it is impossible to combine together a clearer body of proof composed of record of office and verbal testimony mutually supporting and illustrating each other  the house will observe that the receipt of the money is indirectly admitted by one of the governors own questions to munny begum  if the money was not received it would have been absurd to ask on what account it was given both the question and the answer relate to some established usage the appeal to which might possibly be used to justify the acceptance of the money if it was accepted but would be superfluous and no way applicable to the charge if the money was never given  on this point your committee will only add that in all the controversy between mr hastings and the majority of the council he nowhere denies the receipt of this money in his letter to the court of directors of the 31st of july 1775 he says that the begum was compelled by the ill treatment of one of her servants which he calls a species of torture to deliver the paper to mr goring but he nowhere affirms that the contents of the paper were false  on this conduct the majority remark we confess it appears very extraordinary that mr hastings should employ so much time and labor to show that the discoveries against him have been obtained by improper means but that he should take no step whatsoever to invalidate the truth of them he does not deny the receipt of the money the begums answers to the questions put to her at his own desire make it impossible that he should deny it it seems he has formed some plan of defence against this and similar charges which he thinks will avail him in a court of justice and which it would be imprudent in him to anticipate at this time if he has not received the money we see no reason for such a guarded and cautious method of proceeding an innocent man would take a shorter and easier course he would voluntarily exculpate himself by his oath  your committee entertain doubts whether the refusal to exculpate by oath can be used as a circumstance to infer any presumption of guilt but where the charge is direct specific circumstantial supported by papers and verbal testimony made before his lawful superiors to whom he was accountable by persons competent to charge if innocent he was obliged at least to oppose to it a clear and formal denial of the fact and to make a demand for inquiry but if he does not deny the fact and eludes inquiry just presumptions will be raised against him  your committee willing to go to the bottom of a mode of corruption deep and dangerous in the act and the example being informed that mr goring was in london resolved to examine him upon the subject mr goring not only agreed with all the foregoing particulars but even produced to your committee what he declared to be the original persian papers in his hands delivered from behind the curtain through the nabob himself who having privilege as a soninlaw to enter the womens apartment received them from munny begum as authenticthe woman all the while lamenting the loss of her power with many tears and much vociferation she appears to have been induced to make discovery of the above practices in order to clear herself of the notorious embezzlement of the nabobs effects  your committee examining mr scott and mr baber on this subject they also produced a persian paper which mr baber said he had received from the hands of a servant of munny begumand along with it a paper purporting to be a translation into english of the persian original in the paper given as the translation munny begum is made to allege many matters of hardship and cruelty against mr goring and an attempt to compel her to make out a false account but does not at all deny the giving the money very far from it she is made to assert indeed that mr goring desired her to put down three lacs of rupees as divided between mr hastings and mr middleton i begged to be excused observing to him that this money had neither been tendered or accepted with any criminal or improper view after some lively expressions in the european manner she says that it had been customary to furnish a table for the governor and his attendants during their stay at court with respect to the sum mentioned to mr middleton it was a free gift from my own privy purse purburam replied he understood this money to be paid to these gentlemen as a gratuity for secret services and as such he should assuredly represent it here the payments to mr hastings are fully admitted and excused as agreeable to usage and for keeping a table the present to mr middleton is justified as a free gift the paper produced by mr scott is not referred to by your committee as of any weight but to show that it does not prove what it is produced to prove  your committee on reading the paper delivered in by mr scott as a translation perceive it to be written in a style which they conceived was little to be expected in a faithful translation from a persian original being full of quaint terms and idiomatic phrases which strongly bespeak english habits in the way of thinking and of english peculiarities and affectations in the expression struck with these strong internal marks of a suspicious piece they turned to the persian manuscript produced by mr scott and mr baber and comparing it with mr gorings papers they found the latter carefully sealed upon every leaf as they believe is the practice universal in all authentic pieces they found on the former no seal or signature whatsoever either at the top or bottom of the scroll this circumstance of a want of signature not only takes away all authority from the piece as evidence but strongly confirmed the suspicions entertained by your committee on reading the translation of unwarrantable practices in the whole conduct of this business even if the translation should be found substantially to agree with the original such an original as it is the persian roll is in the custody of the clerk of your committee for further examination  mr baber and mr scott being examined on these material defects in the authentication of a paper produced by them as authentic could give no sort of account how it happened to be without a signature nor did mr baber explain how he came to accept and use it in that condition  on the whole your committee conceive that all the parts of the transaction as they appear in the companys records are consistent and mutually throw light on each other  the court of directors order the president and council to appoint a minister to transact the political affairs of the government and to select for that purpose some person well qualified for the affairs of government and to be the minister of government mr hastings selects for the minister so described and so qualified a woman locked up in a seraglio he is ordered to appoint a guardian to the nabobs minority mr hastings passes by his natural parent and appoints another woman these acts would of themselves have been liable to suspicion but a great deficiency or embezzlement soon appears in this womans account to exculpate herself she voluntarily declares that she gave a considerable sum to mr hastings who never once denies the receipt the account given by the principal living witness of the transaction in his evidence is perfectly coherent and consistent with the recorded part the original accounts alleged to be delivered by the lady in question were produced by him properly sealed and authenticated nothing is opposed to all this but a paper without signature and therefore of no authority attended with a translation of a very extraordinary appearance and this paper in apologizing for it confirms the facts beyond a doubt  finally your committee examined the principal living witness of the transaction and find his evidence consistent with the record your committee received the original accounts alleged to be delivered by the lady in question properly sealed and authenticated and find opposed to them nothing but a paper without signature and therefore of no authority attended with a translation of a very extraordinary appearance  in europe the directors ordered opinions to be taken on a prosecution they received one doubtful and three positively for it  they write in their letter of 5th february 1777 paragraphs 32 and 33  although it is rather our wish to prevent evils in future than to enter into a severe retrospection of the past and where facts are doubtful or attended with alleviating circumstances to proceed with lenity rather than to prosecute with rigoryet some of the cases are so flagrantly corrupt and others attended with circumstances so oppressive to the inhabitants that it would be unjust to suffer the delinquents to go unpunished the principal facts56 have been communicated to our solicitor whose report confirmed by our standing counsel we send you by the present conveyanceauthorizing you at the same time to take such steps as shall appear proper to be pursued  if we find it necessary we shall return you the original covenants of such of our servants as remain in india and have been anyways concerned in the undue receipt of money in order to enable you to recover the same for the use of the company by a suit or suits at law to be instituted in the supreme court of judicature in bengal  your committee do not find that the covenants have been sent or that any prosecution has been begun  a vast scene of further peculation and corruption as well in this business as in several other instances appears in the evidence of the rajah nundcomar that evidence and all the proceedings relating to it are entered in the appendix it was the last evidence of the kind the informant was hanged an attempt was made by mr hastings to indict him for a conspiracy this failing of effect another prosecutor appeared for an offence not connected with these charges nundcomar the object of that charge was executed at the very crisis of the inquiry for an offence of another nature not capital by the laws of the country as long as it appeared safe several charges were made which are inserted at large in the appendix and mr hastings and mr barwell seemed apprehensive of many more general clavering colonel monson and mr francis declared in a minute entered on the consultations of the 5th may 1775 that in the late proceedings of the revenue board it will appear that there is no species of peculation from which the honorable governorgeneral has thought proper to abstain a charge of offences of so heinous a nature so very extensive so very deliberate made on record by persons of great weight appointed by act of parliament his associates in the highest trusta charge made at his own board to his own face and transmitted to their common superiors to whom they were jointly and severally accountable this was not a thing to be passed over by mr hastings still less ought it to have perished in other hands it ought to have been brought to an immediate and strict discussion general clavering colonel monson and mr francis ought to have been punished for a groundless accusation if such it had been if the accusation were founded mr hastings was very unfit for the high office of governorgeneral or for any office  after this comprehensive account by his colleagues of the governorgenerals conduct these gentlemen proceeded to the particulars and they produced the case of a corrupt bargain of mr hastings concerning the disposition of office this transaction is here stated by your committee in a very concise manner being on this occasion merely intended to point out to the house the absolute necessity which in their opinion exists for another sort of inquiry into the corruptions of men in power in india than hitherto has been pursued the proceedings may be found at large in the appendix  a complaint was made that mr hastings had sold the office of phousdar of hoogly to a person called khân jehan khân on a corrupt agreementwhich was that from his emoluments of seventytwo thousand rupees a year he was to pay to the governorgeneral thirtysix thousand rupees annually and to his banian cantoo baboo four thousand more the complainant offers to pay to the company the forty thousand rupees which were corruptly paid to these gentlemen and to content himself with the allowance of thirtytwo thousand mr hastings was if on any occasion of his life strongly called upon to bring this matter to the most distinct issue and mr barwell who supported his administration and as such ought to have been tender for his honor was bound to help him to get to the bottom of it if his enemies should be ungenerous enough to countenance such an accusation without permitting it to be detected and exposed but the course they held was directly contrary they began by an objection to receive the complaint in which they obstinately persevered as far as their power went mr barwell was of opinion that the companys instructions to inquire into peculation were intended for the public intereststhat it could not forward the public interests to enter into these inquiriesand that he never would be a channel of aspersing any character while it cannot conduce to the good of government here was a new mode of reasoning found out by mr barwell which might subject all inquiry into peculation to the discretion of the very persons charged with it by that reasoning all orders of his superiors were at his mercy and he actually undertook to set aside those commands which by an express act of parliament he was bound to obey on his opinion of what would or would not conduce to the good of government on his principles he either totally annihilates the authority of the act of parliament or he entertains so extravagant a supposition as that the court of directors possessed a more absolute authority when their orders were not intended for the public good than when they were  general clavering was of a different opinion he thought he should be wanting to the legislature and to the court of directors if he was not to receive the complaints of the inhabitants when properly authenticated and to prefer them to the board for investigation as the only means by which these grievances can be redressed and the company informed of the conduct of their servants  to these sentiments colonel monson and mr francis adhered mr hastings thought it more safe on principles similar to those assumed by mr barwell to refuse to hear the charge but he reserved his remarks on this transaction because they will be equally applicable to many others which in the course of this business are likely to be brought before the board there appeared therefore to him a probability that the charge about the corrupt bargain was no more than the commencement of a whole class of such accusations since he was of opinion and what is very extraordinary previous to any examination that the same remarks would be applicable to several of those which were to follow he must suppose this class of charges very uniform as well as very extensive  the majority however pressed their point and notwithstanding his opposition to all inquiry as he was supported only by mr barwell the question for it was carried he was then desired to name a day for the appearance of the accuser and the institution of the inquiry though baffled in his attempt to stop the inquiry in the first stage mr hastings made a second stand he seems here to have recollected something inherent in his own office that put the matter more in his power than at first he had imagined for he speaks in a positive and commanding tone i will not says his minute name a day for mir zin ul ab dien to appear before the board nor will i suffer him to appear before the board  the question for the inquiry had been carried it was declared fit to inquire but there was according to him a power which might prevent the appearance of witnesses on the general policy of obstructing such inquiries mr francis on a motion to that effect made a sound remark which cannot fail of giving rise to very serious thoughts that supposing it agreed among ourselves that the board shall not hear any charges or complaints against a member of it a case or cases may hereafter happen in which by a reciprocal complaisance to each other our respective misconduct may be effectually screened from inquiry and the company whose interest is concerned or the parties who may have reason to complain of any one member individually may be left without remedy  mr barwell was not of the opinion of that gentleman nor of the maker of the motion general clavering nor of mr monson who supported it he entertains sentiments with regard to the orders of the directors in this particular perfectly correspondent with those which he had given against the original inquiry he says though it may in some little degree save the governorgeneral from personal insult where there is no judicial power lodged that of inquisition can never answer any good purpose this is doctrine of a most extraordinary nature and tendency and as your committee conceive contrary to every sound principle to be observed in the constitution of judicatures and inquisitions the power of inquisition ought rather to be wholly separated from the judicial the former being a previous step to the latter which requires other rules and methods and ought not if possible to be lodged in the same hands the rest of his minute contained in the appendix is filled with a censure on the native inhabitants with reflections on the ill consequences which would arise from an attention to their complaints and with an assertion of the authority of the supreme court as superseding the necessity and propriety of such inquiries in council with regard to his principles relative to the natives and their complaints if they are admitted they are of a tendency to cut off the very principle of redress the existence of the supreme court as a means of relief to the natives under all oppressions is held out to qualify a refusal to hear in the council on the same pretence mr hastings holds up the authority of the same tribunal but this and other proceedings show abundantly of what efficacy that court has been for the relief of the unhappy people of bengal a person in delegated authority refuses a satisfaction to his superiors throwing himself on a court of justice and supposes that nothing but what judicially appears against him is a fit subject of inquiry but even in this mr hastings fails in his application of his principle for the majority of the council were undoubtedly competent to order a prosecution against him in the supreme court which they had no ground for without a previous inquiry but their inquiry had other objects no private accuser might choose to appear the party who was the subject of the peculation might be as here is stated the accomplice in it no popular action or popular suit was provided by the charter under whose authority the court was instituted in any event a suit might fail in the court for the punishment of an actor in an abuse for want of the strictest legal proof which might yet furnish matter for the correction of the abuse and even reasons strong enough not only to justify but to require the directors instantly to address for the removal of a governorgeneralthe opposition of mr hastings and mr barwell proved as ineffectual in this stage as the former and a day was named by the majority for the attendance of the party  the day following this deliberation on the assembling of the council the governorgeneral mr hastings said he would not sit to be confronted by such accusers nor to suffer a judicial inquiry into his conduct at the board of which he is the president as on the former occasions he declares the board dissolved as on the former occasions the majority did not admit his claim to this power they proceeded in his absence to examine the accuser and witnesses their proceedings are in appendix k  it is remarkable that during this transaction khân jehan khân the party with whom the corrupt agreement was made declined an attendance under excuses which the majority thought pretences for delay though they used no compulsory methods towards his appearance at length however he did appear and then a step was taken by mr hastings of a very extraordinary nature after the steps which he had taken before and the declarations with which those steps had been accompanied mr hastings who had absolutely refused to be present in the foregoing part of the proceeding appeared with khân jehan khân and now the affair took another turn other obstructions were raised general clavering said that the informations hitherto taken had proceeded upon oath khân jehan khân had previously declared to general clavering his readiness to be so examined but when called upon by the board he changed his mind and alleged a delicacy relative to his rank with regard to the oath in this scruple he was strongly supported by mr hastings he and mr barwell went further they contended that the council had no right to administer an oath they must have been very clear in that opinion when they resisted the examination on oath of the very person who if he could safely swear to mr hastingss innocence owed it as a debt to his patron not to refuse it and of the payment of this debt it was extraordinary in the patron not only to enforce but to support the absolute refusal  although the majority did not acquiesce in this doctrine they appeared to have doubts of the prudence of enforcing it by violent means but construing his refusal into a disposition to screen the peculations of the governorgeneral they treated him as guilty of a contempt of their board dismissed him from the service and recommended another not the accuser to his office  the reasons on both sides appear in the appendix mr hastings accuses them bitterly of injustice to himself in considering the refusal of this person to swear as a charge proved how far they did so and under what qualifications will appear by reference to the papers in the appendix but mr hastings thanks god that they are not his judges his great hold and not without reason is the supreme court and he blesses the wisdom of parliament that constituted a court of judicature at so seasonable a time to check the despotism of the new council it was thought in england that the court had other objects than the protection of the governorgeneral against the examinations of those sent out with instructions to inquire into the peculations of men in power  though mr hastings did at that time and avowedly did everything to prevent any inquiry that was instituted merely for the information of the court of directors yet he did not feel himself thoroughly satisfied with his own proceedings it was evident that to them his and mr barwells reasonings would not appear very respectful or satisfactory he therefore promises to give them full satisfaction at some future time in his letter of the 14th of september 1775 he reiterates a former declaration and assures them of his resolution to this purpose in the strongest terms i now again recur to the declaration which i have before made that it is my fixed determination to carry literally into execution and most fully and liberally explain every circumstance of my conduct on the points upon which i have been injuriously arraignedand to afford you the clearest conviction of my own integrity and of the propriety of my motives for my declining a present defence of it  these motives as far as they can be discovered were the violence of his adversaries the interested character and views of the accuser and the danger of a prosecution in the supreme court which made it prudent to reserve his defence these arguments are applicable to any charge notwithstanding these reasons it is plain by the above letter that he thought himself bound at some time or other to give satisfaction to his masters till he should do this in his own opinion he remained in an unpleasant situation but he bore his misfortune it seems patiently with a confidence in their justice for his future relief he says whatever evil may fill the long interval which may precede it that interval he has taken care to make long enough for near eight years are now elapsed and he has not yet taken the smallest step towards giving to the court of directors any explanation whatever much less that full and liberal explanation which he had so repeatedly and solemnly promised  it is to be observed that though mr hastings talks in these letters much of his integrity and of the purity of his motives and of full explanations he nowhere denies the fact of this corrupt traffic of office though he had adjourned his defence with so much pain to himself to so very long a day he was not so inattentive to the ease of khân jehan khân as he has shown himself to his own he had been accused of corruptly reserving to himself a part of the emoluments of this mans office it was a delicate business to handle whilst his defence stood adjourned yet in a very short time after a majority came into his hands he turned out the person appointed by general clavering c and replaced the very man with whom he stood accused of the corrupt bargain what was worse he had been charged with originally turning out another to make room for this man the whole is put in strong terms by the then majority of the council where after charging him with every species of peculation they add we believe the proofs of his appropriating four parts in seven of the salary with which the company is charged for the phousdar of hoogly are such as whether sufficient or not to convict him in a court of justice will not leave the shadow of a doubt concerning his guilt in the mind of any unprejudiced person the salary is seventytwo thousand rupees a year the governor takes thirtysix thousand and allows cantoo baboo four thousand more for the trouble he submits to in conducting the negotiation with the phousdar this also is the common subject of conversation and derision through the whole settlement it is our firm opinion and belief that the late phousdar of hoogly a relation of mahomed reza khân was turned out of this office merely because his terms were not so favorable as those which the honorable governorgeneral has obtained from the present phousdar the honorable governorgeneral is pleased to assert with a confidential spirit peculiar to himself that his measures hitherto stand unimpeached except by us we know not how this assertion is to be made good unless the most daring and flagrant prostitution in every branch be deemed an honor to his administration  the whole style and tenor of these accusations as well as the nature of them rendered mr hastingss first postponing and afterwards totally declining all denial or even defence or explanation very extraordinary no governor ought to hear in silence such charges and no court of directors ought to have slept upon them  the court of directors were not wholly inattentive to this business they condemned his act as it deserved and they went into the business of his legal right to dissolve the council their opinions seemed against it and they gave precise orders against the use of any such power in future on consulting mr sayer the companys counsel he was of a different opinion with regard to the legal right but he thought very properly that the use of a right and the manner and purposes for which it was used ought not to have been separated what he thought on this occasion appears in his opinion transmitted by the court of directors to mr hastings and the councilgeneral but it was as great a crime to dissolve the council upon base and sinister motives as it would be to assume the power of dissolving if he had it not i believe he is the first governor that ever dissolved a council inquiring into his behavior when he was innocent before he could summon three councils and dissolve them he had time fully to consider what would be the result of such conduct to convince everybody beyond a doubt of his conscious guilt  it was a matter but of small consolation to mr hastings during the painful interval he describes to find that the companys learned counsel admitted that he had legal powers of which he made an use that raised an universal presumption of his guilt  other counsel did not think so favorably of the powers themselves but this matter was of less consequence because a great difference of opinion may arise concerning the extent of official powers even among men professionally educated as in this case such a difference did arise and wellintentioned men may take either part but the use that was made of it in systematical contradiction to the companys orders has been stated in the ninth report as well as in many of the others made by two of your committees     footnotes  14 appendix b no 1  15 vide supplement to the second report page 7  16

  copy of a letter from the governorgeneral to the court of directors  to the honorable the court of directors of the honorable united east india company  fort william 29th november 1780  honorable sirs  you will be informed by our consultations of the 26th of june of a very unusual tender which was made by me to the board on that day for the purpose of indemnifying the company for the extraordinary expense which might be incurred by supplying the detachment under the command of major camac in the invasion of the mahratta dominions which lay beyond the district of gohud and drawing the attention of mahdajee sindia to whom that country immediately appertained from general goddard while his was employed in the reduction of bassein and in securing the conquests made by your arms in guzerat i was desirous to remove the only objection which has been or could be ostensibly made to the measure which i had very much at heart as may be easily conceived from the means which i took to effect it for the reasons at large which induced me to propose that diversion it will be sufficient to refer to my minute recommending it and to the letters received from general goddard near the same period of time the subject is now become obsolete and all the fair hopes which i had built upon the prosecution of the mahratta war of its termination in a speedy honorable and advantageous peace have been blasted by the dreadful calamities which have befallen your arms in the dependencies of your presidency of fort st george and changed the object of our pursuit from the aggrandizement of your power to its preservation my present reason for reverting to my own conduct on the occasion which i have mentioned is to obviate the false conclusions or purposed misrepresentations which may be made of it either as an artifice of ostentation or as the effect of corrupt influence by assuring you that the money by whatever means it came into your possession was not my ownthat i had myself no right to it nor would or could have received it but for the occasion which prompted me to avail myself of the accidental means which were at that instant afforded me of accepting and converting it to the property and use of the company and with this brief apology i shall dismiss the subject  something of affinity to this anecdote may appear in the first aspect of another transaction which i shall proceed to relate and of which it is more immediately my duty to inform you  you will have been advised by repeated addresses of this government of the arrival of an army at cuttack under the command of chimnajee boosla the second son of moodajee boosla the rajah of berar the origin and destination of this force have been largely explained and detailed in the correspondence of the government of berar and in various parts of our consultations the minute relation of these would exceed the bounds of a letter i shall therefore confine myself to the principal fact  about the middle of the last year a plan of confederacy was formed by the nabob nizam ali khân by which it was proposed that while the army of the mahrattas under the command of mahdajee sindia and tuckoojee hoolkar was employed to check the operations of general goddard in the west of india hyder ali khân should invade the carnatic moodajee boosla the provinces of bengal and he himself the circars of rajamundry and chicacole  the government of berar was required to accept the part assigned it in this combination and to march a large body of troops immediately into bengal to enforce the request on the part of the ruling member of the mahratta state menaces of instant hostility by the combined forces were added by mahdajee sindia tuckoojee hoolkar and nizam ali khân in letters written by them to moodajee boosla on the occasion he was not in a state to sustain the brunt of so formidable a league and ostensibly yielded such at least was the turn which he gave to his acquiescence in his letters to me and his subsequent conduct has justified his professions i was early and progressively acquainted by him with the requisition and with the measures which were intended to be taken and which were taken by him upon it the army professedly destined for bengal marched on the dusserra of the last year corresponding with the 7th of october instead of taking the direct course to bahar which had been prescribed it proceeded by varied deviations and studied delays to cuttack where it arrived late in may last having performed a practicable journey of three mouths in seven and concluded it at the instant commencement of the rains which of course would preclude its operations and afford the government of berar a further interval of five months to provide for the part which it would then be compelled to choose  in the mean time letters were continually written by the rajah and his minister to this government explanatory of their situation and motives proposing their mediation and guaranty for a peace and alliance with the peshwa and professing without solicitation on our part the most friendly disposition towards us and the most determined resolution to maintain it conformably to these assurances and the acceptance of a proposal made by moodajee boosla to depute his minister to bengal for the purpose of negotiating and concluding the proposed treaty of peace application had been made to the peshwa for credentials to the same effect  in the mean time the fatal news arrived of the defeat of your army at conjeveram it now became necessary that every other object should give place or be made subservient to the preservation of the carnatic nor would the measures requisite for that end admit an instant of delay peace with the mahrattas was the first object to conciliate their alliance and that of every other power in natural enmity with hyder ali the next instant measures were taken as our general advices will inform you to secure both these points and to employ the government of berar as the channel and instrument of accomplishing them its army still lay on our borders and in distress for a long arrear of pay not less occasioned by the want of pecuniary funds than a stoppage of communication an application had been made to us for a supply of money and the sum specified for the complete relief of the army was sixteen lacs we had neither money to spare nor in the apparent state of that government in its relation to ours would it have been either prudent or consistent with our public credit to have afforded it it was nevertheless my decided opinion that some aid should be givennot less as a necessary relief than as an indication of confidence and a return for the many instances of substantial kindness which we had within the course of the last two years experienced from the government of berar i had an assurance that such a proposal would receive the acquiescence of the board but i knew that it would not pass without opposition and it would have become public which might have defeated its purpose convinced of the necessity of the expedient and assured of the sincerity of the government of berar from evidences of stronger proof to me than i could make them appear to the other members of the board i resolved to adopt it and take the entire responsibility of it upon myself in this mode a less considerable sum would suffice i accordingly caused three lacs of rupees to be delivered to the minister of the rajah of berar resident in calcutta he has transmitted it to cuttack two thirds of this sum i have raised by my own credit and shall charge it in my official accounts the other third i have supplied from the cash in my hands belonging to the honorable company i have given due notice to moodajee boosla of this transaction and explained it to have been a private act of my own unknown to the other members of the council i have given him expectations of the remainder of the amount required for the arrears of his army proportioned to the extent to which he may put it in my power to propose it as a public gratuity by his effectual orders for the recall of these troops or for their junction with ours  i hope i shall receive your approbation of what i have done for your service and your indulgence for the length of this narrative which i could not comprise within a narrower compass    i have the honor to be honorable sirs     your most

in a letter which i have had the honor to address you in duplicate and of which a triplicate accompanies this dated 20th january 1782 i informed you that i had received the offer of a sum of money from the nabob vizier and his ministers to the nominal amount of ten lacs of lucknow siccas and that bills on the house of gopaul doss had been actually given me for the amount which i had accepted for the use of the honorable company and i promised to account with you for the same as soon as it should be in my power after the whole sum had come into my possession this promise i now perform and deeming it consistent with the spirit of it i have added such other sums as have been occasionally converted to the companys property through my means and in consequence of the like original destination of the second of these you have been already advised in a letter which i had the honor to address the honorable court of directors dated 29th november 1780 both this and the third article were paid immediately to the treasury by my order to the subtreasurer to receive them on the companys account but never passed through my hands the three sums for which bonds were granted were in like manner paid to the companys treasury without passing through my hands but their appropriation was not specified the sum of 58000 current rupees was received while i was on my journey to benares and applied as expressed in the account  as to the manner in which these sums have been expended the reference which i have made of it in the accompanying account to the several accounts in which they are credited renders any other specification of it unnecessary besides that those accounts either have or will have received a much stronger authentication than any that i could give to mine  why these sums were taken by mewhy they were except the second quietly transferred to the companys usewhy bonds were taken for the first and not for the restmight were this matter to be exposed to the view of the public furnish a variety of conjectures to which it would be of little use to reply were your honorable court to question me upon these points i would answer that the sums were taken for the companys benefit at times in which the company very much needed themthat i either chose to conceal the first receipts from public curiosity by receiving bonds for the amount or possibly acted without any studied design which my memory could at this distance of time verify and that i did not think it worth my care to observe the same means with the rest i trust honorable sirs to your breasts for a candid interpretation of my actions and assume the freedom to add that i think myself on such a subject and on such an occasion entitled to it    i have the honor to be honorable sirs     your most

causes from time to time the accompanying address which was originally designed and prepared for that dispatch no other conveyance since occurring has of course been thus long detained the delay is of no public consequence but it has produced a situation which with respect to myself i regard as unfortunate because it exposes me to the meanest imputation from the occasion which the late parliamentary inquiries have since furnished but which were unknown when my letter was written and written in the necessary consequence of a promise made to that effect in a former letter to your honorable committee dated 20th january last however to preclude the possibility of such reflections from affecting me i have desired mr larkins who was privy to the whole transaction to affix to the letter his affidavit of the date in which it was written i own i feel most sensibly the mortification of being reduced to the necessity of using such precautions to guard my reputation from dishonor if i had at any time possessed that degree of confidence from my immediate employers which they never withheld from the meanest of my predecessors i should have disdained to use these attentions how i have drawn on me a different treatment i know not it is sufficient that i have not merited it and in the course of a service of thirtytwo years and ten of these employed in maintaining the powers and discharging the duties of the first office of the british government in india that honorable court ought to know whether i possess the integrity and honor which are the first requisites of such a station if i wanted these they have afforded me but too powerful incentives to suppress the information which i now convey to them through you and to appropriate to my own use the sums which i have already passed to their credit by the unworthy and pardon me if i add dangerous reflections which they have passed upon me for the first communication of this kind and your own experience will suggest to you that there are persons who would profit by such a warning  upon the whole of these transactions which to you who are accustomed to view business in an official and regular light may appear unprecedented if not improper i have but a few short remarks to suggest to your consideration  if i appear in any unfavorable light by these transactions i resign the common and legal security of those who commit crimes or errors i am ready to answer every particular question that may be put against myself upon honor or upon oath  the sources from which these reliefs to the public service have come would never have yielded them to the company publicly and the exigencies of your service exigencies created by the exposition of your affairs and faction in your councils required those supplies  i could have concealed them had i had a wrong motive from yours and the public eye forever and i know that the difficulties to which a spirit of injustice may subject me for my candor and avowal are greater than any possible inconvenience that could have attended the concealment except the dissatisfaction of my own mind these difficulties are but a few of those which i have suffered in your service the applause of my own breast is my surest reward and was the support of my mind in meeting them your applause and that of my country are my next wish in life    i have the honor to be honorable sirs     your most faithful most obedient       and most humble servant    warren hastings   b no 7  extract of the companys general letter to bengal dated the 25th january 1782  par 127 we have received a letter from our governorgeneral dated the 29th of november 1780 relative to an unusual tender and advance of money made by him to the council as entered on your consultation of the 26th of june for the purpose of indemnifying the company from the extraordinary charge which might be incurred by supplying the detachment under the command of major camac in the invasion of the mahratta dominions which lay beyond the district of gohud and thereby drawing the attention of mahdajee sindia to whom the country appertained from general goddard while the general was employed in the reduction of bassein and in securing the conquests made in the guzerat country and also respecting the sum of three lacs of rupees advanced by the governorgeneral for the use of the army under the command of chimnajee boosla without the authority or knowledge of the council with the reasons for taking these extraordinary steps under the circumstances stated in his letter  128 in regard to the first of these transactions we readily conceive that in the then state of the council the governorgeneral might be induced to temporary secrecy respecting the members of the board not only because he might be apprehensive of opposition to the proposed application of the money but perhaps because doubts might have arisen concerning the propriety of appropriating it to the companys use on any account but it does not appear to us that there could be any real necessity for delaying to communicate to us immediate information of the channel by which the money came into his possession with a complete illustration of the cause or causes of so extraordinary an event  129 circumstanced as affairs were at the moment it appears that the governorgeneral had the measure much at heart and judged it absolutely necessary the means proposed of defraying the extra expense were very extraordinary and the money as we conceive must have come into his hands by an unusual channel and when more complete information comes before us we shall give our sentiments fully upon the whole transaction  130 in regard to the application of the companys money to the army of chimnajee boosla by the sole authority of the governorgeneral he knew that it was entirely at his own risk and he has taken the responsibility upon himself nothing but the most urgent necessity could warrant the measure nor can anything short of full proof of such necessity and of the propriety and utility of the extraordinary step taken on the occasion entitle the governorgeneral to the approbation of the court of directors and therefore as in the former instance relative to the sum advanced and paid into our treasury we must also for the present suspend our judgment respecting the money sent to the berar army without approving it in the least degree or proceeding to censure our governorgeneral for this transaction   b no 8  extract of bengal secret consultations the 9th january 1781  the following letter from the

irohilla war  that the court of directors of the east india company from a just sense of the danger and odium incident to the extension of their conquests in the east indies and from an experience of the disorders and corrupt practices which intrigues and negotiations to bring about revolutions among the country powers had produced did positively and repeatedly direct their servants in bengal not to engage in any offensive war whatsoever that the said court laid it down as an invariable maxim which ought ever to be maintained that they were to avoid taking part in the political schemes of any of the country princesand did in particular order and direct that they should not engage with a certain prince called sujah ul dowlah nabob of oude and vizier of the empire in any operations beyond certain limits in the said orders specially described  that warren hastings esquire then governor of fort william in bengal did with other members of the council declare his clear understanding of the true intent and meaning of the said positive and repeated orders and injunctionsdid express to the court of directors his approbation of the policy thereofdid declare that he adopted the same with sincerity and satisfaction and that he was too well aware of the ruinous tendency of all schemes of conquest ever to adopt them or ever to depart from the absolute line of selfdefence unless impelled to it by the most obvious necessitydid signify to the nabob of oude the said orders and his obligation to yield punctual obedience theretoand did solemnly engage and promise to the court of directors with the unanimous concurrence of the whole council that no object or consideration should either tempt or compel him to pass the political line which they the directors had laid down for his operations with the vizier assuring the court of directors that he scarce saw a possible advantage which could compensate the hazard and expense to be incurred by a contrary conductthat he did frequently repeat the same declarations or declarations to the same effect particularly in a letter to the nabob himself of the 22d of november 1773 in the following words the commands of my superiors are as i have repeatedly informed you peremptory that i shall not suffer their arms to be carried beyond the line of their own boundaries and those of your excellency their ally  that the said warren hastings in direct contradiction to the said orders and to his own sense of their propriety and coercive authority and in breach of his express promises and engagements did in september 1773 enter into a private engagement with the said nabob of oude who was the special object of the prohibition to furnish him for a stipulated sum of money to be paid to the east india company with a body of troops for the declared purpose of thoroughly extirpating the nation of the rohillas a nation from whom the company had never received or pretended to receive or apprehend any injury whatsoever whose country in the month of february 1773 by an unanimous resolution of the said warren hastings and his council was included in the line of defence against the mahrattas and from whom the nabob never complained of an aggression or act of hostility nor pretended a distinct cause of quarrel other than the nonpayment of a sum of money in dispute between him and that people  that supposing the sum of money in question to have been strictly due to the said nabob by virtue of any engagement between him and the rohilla chiefs the east india company or their representatives were not parties to that engagement or guaranties thereof nor bound by any obligation whatever to enforce the execution of it  that previous to the said warren hastingss entering into the agreement or bargain aforesaid to extirpate the said nation he did not make or cause to be made a due inquiry into the validity of the sole pretext used by the said nabob nor did he give notice of the said claims of debt to the nation of the rohillas in order to receive an explanation on their part of the matter in litigation nor did he offer any mediation nor propose nor afford an opportunity of proposing an agreement or submission by which the calamities of war might be avoided as by the high state in which the east india company stood as a sovereign power in the east and the honor and character it ought to maintain as well as by the principles of equity and humanity and by the true and obvious policy of uniting the power of the mahometan princes against the mahrattas he was bound to do that instead of such previous inquiry or tender of good offices the said warren hastings did stimulate the ambition and ferocity of the nabob of oude to the full completion of the inhuman end of the said unjustifiable enterprise by informing him that it would be absolutely necessary to persevere in it until it should be accomplished pretending that a fear of the companys displeasure was his motive for annexing the accomplishment of the enterprise as a condition of his assistance and asserting that he could not hazard or answer for the displeasure of the company his masters if they should find themselves involved in a fruitless war or in an expense for prosecuting ita pretence tending to the high dishonor of the east india company as if the gain to be acquired was to reconcile that body to the breach of their own orders prohibiting all such enterprisesand in order further to involve the said nabob beyond the power of retreating he did in the course of the proceeding purposely put the said nabob under difficulties in case he should decline that war and did oblige him to accept even the permission to relinquish the execution of this unjust project as a favor and to make concessions for it thereby acting as if the company were principals in the hostility and employing for this purpose much double dealing and divers unworthy artifices to entangle and perplex the said nabob but by means of which he found himself as he has entered it on record hampered and embarrassed in a particular manner  that the said compact for offensive alliance in favor of a great prince against a considerable nation was not carried on by projects and counterprojects in writing nor were the articles and conditions thereof formed into any regular written instrument signed and sealed by the parties but the whole both the negotiation and the compact of offensive alliance against the rohillas was a mere verbal engagement the purport and conventions whereof nowhere appeared except in subsequent correspondence in which certain of the articles as they were stated by the several parties did materially differ a proceeding new and unprecedented and directly leading to mutual misconstruction evasion and ill faith and tending to encourage and protect every species of corrupt clandestine practice that at the time when this private verbal agreement was made by the said warren hastings with the nabob of oude a public ostensible treaty was concluded by him with the said nabob in which there is no mention whatever of such agreement or reference whatever to it in defence of which omission it is asserted by the said warren hastings that the multiplication of treaties weakens their efficacy and therefore they should be reserved only for very important and permanent obligations notwithstanding he had previously declared to the said nabob that the points which he had proposed required much consideration and the previous ratification of a formal agreement before he could consent to them that the whole of the said verbal agreement with the nabob of oude in his own person without any assistance on his part was carried on and concluded by the said warren hastings alone without any person who might witness the same without the intervention even of an interpreter though he confesses that he spoke the hindostan language imperfectly and although he had with him at that time and place several persons high in the companys service and confidence namely the commanderinchief of their forces two members of their council and the secretary to the council who were not otherwise acquainted with the proceedings between him and the said nabob than by such communications as he thought fit to make to them  that the object avowed by the said warren hastings and the motives urged by him for employing the british arms in the utter extirpation of the rohilla nation are stated by himself in the following termsthe acquisition of forty lacs of rupees to the company and of so much specie added to the exhausted currency of our provincesthat it would give wealth to the nabob of oude of which we should participatethat the said warren hastings should always be ready to profess that he did reckon the probable acquisition of wealth among his reasons for taking up arms against his neighborsthat it would ease the company of a considerable part of their military expense and preserve their troops from inaction and relaxation of disciplinethat the weak state of the rohillas promised an easy conquest of themand finally that such was his idea of the companys distress at home added to his knowledge of their wants abroad that he should have been glad of any occasion to employ their forces which saved so much of their pay and expenses  that in the private verbal agreement aforesaid for offensive war the said warren hastings did transgress the bounds of the authority given him by his instructions from the council of fort william which had limited his powers to such compacts as were consistent with the spirit of the companys orders which council he afterwards persuaded and with difficulty drew into an acquiescence in what he had done  that the agreement to the effect aforesaid was settled in the said secret conferences before the 10th of september 1773 but the said warren hastings concealing from the court of directors a matter of which it was his duty to afford them the earliest and fullest information did on the said 10th of september 1773 write to the directors and dispatched his letter over land giving them an account of the public treaty but taking not the least notice of his agreement for a mercenary war against the nation of the rohillas  that in order to conceal the true purport of the said clandestine agreement the more effectually and until he should find means of gaining over the rest of the council to a concurrence in his disobedience of orders he entered a minute in the council books giving a false account of the transaction in which minute he represented that the nabob had indeed proposed the design aforesaid and that he the said warren hastings was pleased that he urged the scheme of this expedition no further when in reality and truth he had absolutely consented to the said enterprise and had engaged to assist him in it which he afterwards admitted and confessed that he did act in consequence of the same  that the said warren hastings and his council were sensible of the true nature of the enterprise in which they had engaged the companys arms and of the heavy responsibility to which it would subject himself and the councilthe personal hazard they the council run in undertaking so uncommon a measure without positive instructions at their own risk with the eyes of the whole nation on the affairs of the company and the passions and prejudices of almost every man in england inflamed against the conduct of the company and the character of its servants yet they engaged in the very practice which had brought such odium on the company and on the character of its servants though they further say that they had continually before their eyes the dread of forfeiting the favor of their employers and becoming the objects of popular invectives the said warren hastings himself says at the very time when he proposed the measure i must confess i entertain some doubts as to its expediency at this time from the circumstances of the company at home exposed to popular clamor and all its measures liable to be canvassed in parliament their charter drawing to a close and his majestys ministers unquestionably ready to take advantage of every unfavorable circumstance in the negotiations of its renewal all these considerations did not prevent the said warren hastings from making and carrying into execution the said mercenary agreement for a sum of money the payment of which the nabob endeavored to evade on a construction of the verbal treaty and was so far from being insisted on as it ought to have been by the said warren hastings that when after the completion of the service the commanderinchief was directed to make a demand of the money the agent of the said warren hastings at the same time assured the nabob that the demand was nothing more than matter of form common and even necessary in all public transactions and that although the board considered the claim of the government literally due it was not the intention of administration to prescribe to his excellency the mode or even limits of payment nor was any part of the money recovered until the establishment of the governorgeneral and council by act of parliament and their determination to withdraw the brigade from the nabobs servicethe resident at his court appointed by the said warren hastings having written that he had experienced much duplicity and deceit in most of his transactions with his excellency and the said nabob and his successors falling back in other payments in the same or greater proportion as he advanced in the payment of this debt the consideration of lucre to the company the declared motive to this shameful transaction totally failed and no money in effect and substance as far as by any account to be depended on appears has been obtained  that the said nabob of oude did in consequence of the said agreement and with the assistance of british troops which were ordered to march and subjected to his disposal by the said warren hastings and the council unjustly enter into and invade the country of the rohillas and did there make war in a barbarous and inhuman manner by an abuse of victory by the unnecessary destruction of the country by a wanton display of violence and oppression of inhumanity and cruelty and by the sudden expulsion and casting down of an whole race of people to whom the slightest benevolence was denied when prayer was made not to dishonor the begum a princess of great rank whose husband had been killed in battle and other women by dragging them about the country to be loaded with the scoffs of the nabobs rabble and otherwise still worse used the nabob refused to listen to the entreaties of a british commanderinchief in their favor and the said women of high rank were exposed not only to the vilest personal indignities but even to absolute want and these transactions being by colonel champion communicated to the said warren hastings instead of commendations for his intelligence and orders to redress the said evils and to prevent the like in future by means which were suggested and which appear to have been proper and feasible he received a reprimand from the said warren hastings who declared that we had no authority to control the conduct of the vizier in the treatment of his subjects and that colonel champion desisted from making further representations on this subject to the said warren hastings being apprehensive of having already run some risk of displeasing by perhaps a too free communication of sentiments that in consequence of the said proceedings not only the eminent families of the chiefs of the rohilla nation were either cut off or banished and their wives and offspring reduced to utter ruin but the country itself heretofore distinguished above all others for the extent of its cultivation as a garden not having one spot in it of uncultivated ground and from being in the most flourishing state that a country could be was by the inhuman mode of carrying on the war and the ill government during the consequent usurpation reduced to a state of great decay and depopulation in which it still remains  that the east india company having had reason to conceive that for the purpose of concealing corrupt transactions their servants in india had made unfair mutilated and garbled communications of correspondence and sometimes had wholly withheld the same made an order in their letter of the 23d of march 1770 in the following tenorthe governor singly shall correspond with the country powers but all letters before they shall be by him sent must be communicated to the other members of the select committee and receive their approbation and also all letters whatsoever which may be received by the governor in answer to or in course of correspondence shall likewise be laid before the said select committee for their information and consideration and that in their instructions to their governorgeneral and council dated 30th march 1774 they did repeat their orders to the same purpose and effect  that the said warren hastings did not obey as in duty he was bound to do the said standing orders nor did communicate all his correspondence with mr middleton the companys agent at the court of the subah of oude or with colonel champion the commanderinchief of the companys forces in the rohilla war to the select committee and when afterwards that is to say on the 25th of october 1774 he was required by the majority of the council appointed by the act of parliament of 1773 whose opinion was by the said act directed to be taken as the act of the whole council to produce all his correspondence with mr middleton and colonel champion for the direction of their future proceedings relative to the obscure intricate and critical transaction aforesaid he did positively and pertinaciously refuse to deliver any other than such parts of the said correspondence as he thought convenient covering his said illegal refusal under general vague pretences of secrecy and danger from the communication although the said order and instruction of the court of directors above mentioned was urged to him and although it was represented to him by the said council that they as well as he were bound by an oath of secrecy which refusal to obey the orders of the court of directors orders specially and on weighty grounds of experience pointed to cases of this very nature gave rise to much jealousy and excited great suspicions relative to the motives and grounds on which the rohilla war had been undertaken  that the said warren hastings in the grounds alleged in his justification of his refusal to communicate to his colleagues in the superior council his correspondence with mr middleton the companys resident at oude was guilty of a new offence arrogating to himself unprecedented and dangerous powers on principles utterly subversive of all order and discipline in service and introductory to corrupt confederacies and disobedience among the companys servants the said warren hastings insisting that mr middleton the companys covenanted servant the public resident for transacting the companys affairs at the court of the subah of oude and as such receiving from the company a salary for his service was no other than the official agent of him the said warren hastings and that being such he was not obliged to communicate his correspondence  that the court of directors and afterwards a general court of the proprietors of the east india company although the latter showed favorable dispositions towards the said warren hastings and expressed but without assigning any ground or reason the highest opinion of his services and integrity did unanimously condemn along with his conduct relative to the rohilla treaty and war his refusal to communicate his whole correspondence with mr middleton to the superior council yet the said warren hastings in defiance of the opinion of the directors and the unanimous opinion of the general court of the said east india company as well as the precedent positive orders of the court of directors and the injunctions of an act of parliament has from that time to the present never made any communication of the whole of his correspondence to the governorgeneral and council or to the court of directors   iishah allum  that in a solemn treaty of peace concluded the 16th of august 1765 between the east india company and the late nabob of oude sujah ul dowlah and highly approved of confirmed and ratified by the said company it is agreed that the king shah allum shall remain in full possession of corah and such part of the province of allahabad as he now possesses which are ceded to his majesty as a royal demesne for the support of his dignity and expenses that in a separate agreement concluded at the same time between the king shah allum and the then subahdar of bengal under the immediate security and guaranty of the english company the faith of the company was pledged to the said king for the annual payment of twentysix lac of rupees for his support out of the revenues of bengal and that the said company did then receive from the said king a grant of the duanné of the provinces of bengal bahar and orissa on the express condition of their being security for the annual payment above mentioned that the east india company have held and continue to hold the duanné so granted and for some years have complied with the conditions on which they accepted of the grant thereof and have at all times acknowledged that they held the duanné in virtue of the moguls grants that the said court of directors in their letter of the 30th june 1769 to bengal declared that they esteemed themselves bound by treaty to protect the kings person and to secure him the possession of the corah and allahabad districts and supposing an agreement should be made respecting these provinces between the king and sujah ul dowlah the directors then said that they should be subject to no further claim or requisition from the king excepting for the stipulated tribute for bengal which they the governor and council were to pay to his agent or remit to him in such manner as he might direct  that in the year 1772 the king shah allum who had hitherto resided at allahabad trusting to engagements which he had entered into with the mahrattas quitted that place and removed to delhi but having soon quarrelled with those people and afterwards being taken prisoner had been treated by them with very great disrespect and cruelty that among other instances of their abuse of their immediate power over him the governor and council of bengal in their letter of the 16th of august 1773 inform the court of directors that he had been compelled while a prisoner in their hands to grant sunnuds for the surrender of corah and allahabad to them and it appears from sundry other minutes of their own that the said governor and council did at all times consider the surrender above mentioned as extorted from the king and unquestionably an act of violence which could not alienate or impair his right to those provinces and that when they took possession thereof it was at the request of the kings naib or viceroy who put them under the councils protection that on this footing they were accepted by the said warren hastings and his council and for some time considered by them as a deposit committed to their care by a prince to whom the possession thereof was particularly guarantied by the east india company in their letter of the 1st of march 1773 they the said warren hastings and his council say in no shape can this compulsatory cession by the king release us from the obligation we are under to defend the provinces which we have so particularly guarantied to him but it appears that they soon adopted other ideas and assumed other principles concerning this object in the instructions dated the 23d of june 1773 which the council of fort william gave to the said warren hastings previous to his interview with the nabob sujah ul dowlah at benares they say that while the king continued at delhi whither he proceeded in opposition to their most strenuous remonstrances they should certainly consider the engagements between him and the company as dissolved by his alienation from them and their interest that the possession of so remote a country could never be expected to yield any profit to the company and the defence of it must require a perpetual aid of their forces yet in the same instructions they declare their opinion that if the king should make overtures to renew his former connection his right to reclaim the districts of corah and allahabad could not with propriety be disputed and they authorize the said warren hastings to restore them to him on condition that he should renounce his claim to the annual tribute of twentysix lac of rupees herein before mentioned and to the arrears which might be due thereby acknowledging the justice of a claim which they determined not to comply with but in return for the surrender of another equally validthat nevertheless in the treaty concluded by the said warren hastings with sujah ul dowlah on the 7th of september 1773 it is asserted that his majesty meaning the king shah allum having abandoned the districts of corah and allahabad and given a sunnud for corah and currah to the mahrattas had thereby forfeited his right to the said districts although it was well known to the said warren hastings and had been so stated by him to the court of directors that this surrender on the part of the king had been extorted from him by violence while he was a prisoner in the hands of the mahrattas and although it was equally well known to the said warren hastings that there was nothing in the original treaty of 1765 which could restrain the king from changing the place of his residence consequently that his removal to delhi could not occasion a forfeiture of his right to the provinces secured to him by that treaty  that the said warren hastings in the report which he made of his interview and negotiations with sujah ul dowlah dated the 4th of october 1773 declared that the administration would have been culpable in the highest degree in retaining possession of corah and allahabad for any other purpose than that of making an advantage by the disposal of them and therefore he had ceded them to the vizier for fifty lac of rupees a measure for which he had no authority whatever from the king shah allum and in the execution of which no reserve whatever was made in favor of the rights of that prince nor any care taken of his interests  that the sale of these provinces to sujah dowlah involved the east india company in a triple breach of justice since by the same act they violated a treaty they sold the property of another and they alienated a deposit committed to their friendship and good faith and as such accepted by them that a measure of this nature is not to be defended on motives of policy and convenience supposing such motives to have existed without a total loss of public honor and shaking all security in the faith of treaties but that in reality the pretences urged by the said warren hastings for selling the kings country to sujah dowlah were false and invalid it could not strengthen our alliance with sujah ul dowlah since paying a price for a purchase he received no favor and incurred no obligation it did not free the company from all the dangers attending either a remote property or a remote connection since the moment the country in question became part of sujah dowlahs dominions it was included in the companys former guaranty of those dominions and in case of invasion the company were obliged to send part of their army to defend it at the requisition of the said sujah dowlah and if the remote situation of those provinces made the defence of them difficult and dangerous much more was it a difficult and dangerous enterprise to engage the companys force in an attack and invasion of the rohillas whose country lay at a much greater distance from the companys frontierwhich nevertheless the said warren hastings agreed to and undertook at the very time when under pretence of the difficulty of defending corah and allahabad he sold those provinces to sujah dowlah it did not relieve the company from the expense of defending the country since the revenues thereof far exceeded the subsidy to be paid by sujah dowlah and these revenues justly belonged to the company as long as the country continued under their protection and would have answered the expense of defending it finally that the sum of fifty lac of rupees stipulated with the said sujah dowlah was inadequate to the value of the country the annual revenues of which were stated at twentyfive lac of rupees which general sir robert barker then commanderinchief of the companys forces affirms was certain and too generally known to admit of a doubt  that the king shah allum received for some years the annual tribute of twentysix lac of rupees above mentioned and was entitled to continue to receive it by virtue of an engagement deliberately and for an adequate consideration entered into with him by the companys servants and approved of and ratified by the company themselvesthat this engagement was absolute and unconditional and did neither express nor suppose any case in which the said king should forfeit or the company should have a right to resume the tributethat nevertheless the said warren hastings and his council immediately after selling the kings country to sujah dowlah resolved to withhold and actually withheld the payment of the said tribute of which the king shah allum has never since received any partthat this resolution of the council is not justified even by themselves on principles of right and justice but by arguments of policy and convenience by which the best founded claims of right and justice may at all times be set aside and defeated they judged it highly impolitic and unsafe to answer the drafts of the king until they were satisfied of his amicable intentions and those of his new allies but neither had they any reason to question the kings amicable intentions nor was he pledged to answer for those of the mahrattas his trusting to the good faith of that people and relying on their assistance to reinstate him in the possession of his capital might have been imprudent and impolitic but these measures however ruinous to himself indicated no enmity to the english nor were they productive of any effects injurious to the english interests and it is plain that the said warren hastings and his council were perfectly aware that their motives or pretences for withholding the tribute were too weak to justify their conduct having principally insisted on the reduced state of their treasury which as they said rendered it impracticable to comply with those payments the right of a creditor does not depend on the circumstances of the debtor on the contrary the plea of inability includes a virtual acknowledgment of the debt since if the creditors right were denied the plea would be superfluous  that the east india company having on their part violated the engagements and renounced the conditions on which they received and have hitherto held and enjoyed the duanné of bengal bahar and orissa from the king shah allum have thereby forfeited all right and title to the said duanné arising from the said grant and that it is free and open to the said king to resume such grant and to transfer it to any other prince or statethat notwithstanding any distress or weakness to which he may be actually reduced his lawful authority as sovereign of the mogul empire is still acknowledged in india and that his grant of the duanné would sufficiently authorize and materially assist any prince or state that might attempt to dispossess the east india company thereof since it would convey a right which could not be disputed and to which nothing but force could be opposed nor can these opinions be more strongly expressed than they have been lately by the said warren hastings himself who in a minute recorded the 1st of december 1784 has declared that fallen as the house of timur is it is yet the relic of the most illustrious line of the eastern world that its sovereignty is universally acknowledged though the substance of it no longer exists and that the company itself derives its constitutional dominion from its ostensible bounty  that the said warren hastings by this declaration has renounced and condemned the principle on which he avowedly acted towards the mogul in the year 1773 when he denied that the sunnuds or grants of the mogul if they were in the hands of another nation would avail them anythingand when he declared that the sword which gave us the dominion of bengal must be the instrument of its preservation and that if it should ever cease to be ours the next proprietor would derive his right and possession from the same natural charter that the said warren hastings to answer any immediate purpose adopts any principle of policy however false or dangerous without any regard to former declarations made or to principles avowed on other occasions by himself and particularly that in his conduct to shah allum he first maintained that the grants of that prince were of no availthat we held the dominion of bengal by the sword which he has falsely declared the source of right and the natural charter of dominionwhereas at a later period he has declared that the sovereignty of the family of shah allum is universally acknowledged and that the company itself derives its constitutional dominion from their ostensible bounty   iiibenares  part i  rights and titles of the rajah of benares  i that the territory of benares is a fruitful and has been not long since an orderly wellcultivated and improved province of great extent and its capital city as warren hastings esquire has informed the court of directors in his letter of the 21st of november 1781 is highly revered by the natives of the hindoo persuasion so that many who have acquired independent fortunes retire to close their days in a place so eminently distinguished for its sanctity and he further acquaints the directors that it may rather be considered as the seat of the hindoo religion than as the capital of a province but as its inhabitants are not composed of hindoos only the former wealth which flowed into it from the offerings of pilgrims as well as from the transactions of exchange for which its central situation is adapted has attracted numbers of mahomedans who still continue to reside in it with their families and these circumstances of the city of benares which not only attracted the attention of all the different descriptions of men who inhabit hindostan but interested them warmly in whatever it might suffer did in a peculiar manner require that the governorgeneral and council of calcutta should conduct themselves with regard to its rulers and inhabitants when it became dependent on the company on the most distinguished principles of good faith equity moderation and mildness  ii that the rajah bulwant sing late prince or zemindar of the province aforesaid was a great lord of the mogul empire dependent on the same through the vizier of the empire the late sujah ul dowlah nabob of oude and the said bulwant sing in the commencement of the english power did attach himself to the cause of the english company and the court of directors of the said company did acknowledge in their letter of the 26th of may 1768 that bulwant sings joining us at the time he did was of signal service and the stipulation in his favor was what he was justly entitled to and they did commend the care that had been taken by the then presidency of those that had shown their attachment to them the company during the war and they did finally express their hope and expectation in the words following the moderation and attention paid to those who have espoused our interests in this war will restore our reputation in hindostan and that the indian powers will be convinced no breach of treaty will ever have our sanction  iii that the rajah bulwant sing died on the 23d of august 1770 and his son cheyt sing succeeding to his rights and pretensions the presidency of calcutta john cartier esquire being then president did instruct captain gabriel harper to procure a confirmation of the succession to his son cheyt sing as it was of the utmost political import to the companys affairs and that the young man ought not to consider the price to be paid to satisfy the viziers jealousy and avarice and they did further declare as follows the strong and inviolable attachment which subsisted betwixt the company and the father makes us most readily interpose our good offices for the son and the young rajah aforesaid having agreed under the mediation of captain harper to pay near two hundred thousand pounds as a gift to the said vizier and to increase his tribute by near thirty thousand pounds annually a deed of confirmation was passed by the said vizier to the said rajah and his heirs by which he became a purchaser for valuable considerations of his right and inheritance in the zemindary aforesaid in consequence of this grant so by him purchased the rajah was solemnly invested with the government in the city of benares amidst the acclamations of a numerous people and to the great satisfaction of all parties and the said harper in his letter of the 8th october 1770 giving an account of the investiture aforesaid did express himself in these words i will leave the young rajah and others to acquaint you how i have conducted myself only thus much let me say that i have kept a strict eye not to diminish our national honor disinterestedness and justice which i will conclude has had a greater effect in securing to the company their vast possessions than even the force of arms however formidable could do the president of calcutta testified his approbation of the said harpers conduct in the strongest terms that is in the following your disinterestedness has been equally distinguishable as your abilities and both do you the greatest honor  iv that the agreement between the rajah and nabob aforesaid continued on both sides without any violation under the sanction and guaranty of the east india company for three years when warren hastings esquire being then president did propose a further confirmation of the said grant and did on the 12th of october 1773 obtain a delegation for himself to be the person to negotiate the same it being his opinion as expressed in his report of october 4th 1773 that the rajah was not only entitled to the inheritance of his zemindary by the grants through captain harper but that the preceding treaty of allahabad though literally expressing no more than a security personal to bulwant sing did notwithstanding in the true sense and import thereof extend to his posterity and that it had been differently understood that is not literally by the company and by this administration and the vizier had before put it out of all dispute by the solemn act passed in the rajahs favor on his succession to the zemindary  v that the council in their instructions to the said governor hastings did empower him to renew in behalf of the rajah cheyt sing the stipulation which was formerly made with the vizier in consideration of his services in 1764 and the government was accordingly settled on the rajah and his posterity or to his heirs on the same footing on which it was granted to his said father excepting the addition aforesaid to the tribute with an express provision that no increase shall ever hereafter be demanded and the grant and stipulation aforesaid was further confirmed by the said sujah ul dowlah under the companys guaranty by the most solemn and awful form of oath known in the mahomedan religion inserted in the body of the deed or grant and the said warren hastings strongly impressed with the opinion of the propriety of protecting the rajah and of the injustice malice and avarice of the said sujah dowlah and the known family enmity subsisting between him and the rajah did declare in his report to the council as follows i am well convinced that the rajahs inheritance and perhaps his life are no longer safe than while he enjoys the companys protection which is his due by the ties of justice and the obligations of public faith  vi that some time after the new confirmation aforesaid that is to say in the year 1774 the governorgeneral and council which had been formed and the members thereof appointed by act of parliament did obtain the assignment of the sovereignty paramount of the said government by treaty with the nabob of oude by which although the supreme dominion was changed the terms and the conditions of the tenure of the rajah of benares remained as the said nabob of oude could transfer to the east india company no other or greater estate than he himself possessed in or over the said zemindary but to obviate any misconstruction on the subject the said warren hastings did propose to the board that whatever provision might in the said treaty be made for the interest of the company the same should be without an encroachment on the just rights of the rajah or the engagements actually subsisting with him  vii that the said warren hastings then having or pretending to have an extraordinary care of the interest of the rajah of benares did on his transfer of the sovereignty propose a new grant to be conveyed in new instruments to the said rajah conferring upon him further privileges namely the addition of the sovereign rights of the mint and of the right of criminal justice of life and death and he the said warren hastings as governorgeneral did himself propose the resolution for that purpose in council in the following words with remarks explanatory of the principles upon which the grants aforesaid were made namely  minute  viii that the perpetual and independent possession of the zemindary of benares and its dependencies be confirmed and guarantied to the rajah cheyt sing and his heirs forever subject only to the annual payment of the revenues hitherto paid to the late vizier amounting to benares sicca rupees 237165612 to be disposed of as is expressed in the following article that no other demand be made on him either by the nabob of oude or this government nor any kind of authority or jurisdiction be exercised by either within the districts assigned him to which minute he the said warren hastings did subjoin the following observation in writing and recorded therewith in the council books that is to say the rajah of benares from the situation of his country which is a frontier to the provinces of oude and bahar may be made a serviceable ally to the company whenever their affairs shall require it he has always been considered in this light both by the company and the successive members of the late council but to insure his attachment to the company his interest must be connected with it which cannot be better effected than by freeing him totally from the remains of his present vassalage under the guaranty and protection of the company and at the same time guarding him against any apprehensions from this government by thus pledging its faith that no encroachment shall ever be made on his rights by the company and the said warren hastings on the 5th of july 1775 did himself propose among other articles of the treaty relative to this object one of the following tenor that whilst the rajah shall continue faithful to these engagements and punctual in his payments and shall pay due obedience to the authority of this government no more demands shall be made upon him by the honorable company of any kind or on any pretence whatsoever shall any person be allowed to interfere with his authority or to disturb the peace of his country and the said article was by the other members of the council assented to without debate  ix on transferring the rajahs tribute from the nabob to the company the stipulation with the nabob was renewed on the proposition of the said warren hastings himself and expressed in a yet more distinct manner namely that no more demands shall be made upon him by the honorable company of any kind and the said warren hastings in justification of his proposal of giving the rajah a complete and uncontrolled authority over his zemindary did enter on the council book the following reasons for investing him with the same strongly indicating the situation in which he must be left under any other circumstances whether under the nabob of oude or under the english or under the double influence of both that the security of his person and possessions from the companys protection may be rated equal to many lacs of rupees which though saved to him are no loss to the government on which he depends being all articles of invisible expense in fees to the ministers and officers of the nabob in the charges of a double establishment of vackeels to both governments in presents and charges of accommodation to the nabob during his residence at any place within the boundaries of his zemindary in the frauds embezzlements and oppressions exercised in the mint and cutwally besides the allowed profits of those officers and the advantages which every man in occasional power or in the credit of it might make of the rajahs known weakness and the dread he stood in both of the displeasure of the nabob and the illwill of individuals among the english who were all considered either in their present stations or connections or the right of succession as members of the state of bengal it would be scarce possible to enumerate all the inconveniences to which the rajah was liable in his former situation or to estimate the precise effect which they produced on his revenue and on the gross amount of his expense but it may be easily conceived that both were enormous and of a nature the most likely to lessen the profits of government instead of adding to them and in justification of his proposal of giving the rajah the symbols of sovereignty in the power of life and death and in the coining of money as pledges of his independence he states the deplorable situation of princes reduced to dependence on the vizier or the company and obliged to entertain an english resident at their court in the following words it is proposed to receive the payment of his the rajahs rents at patna because that is the nearest provincial station and because it would not frustrate the intention of rendering the rajah independent if a resident was appointed to receive the money as it became due at benares such a resident would unavoidably acquire an influence over the rajah and over his country which would in effect render him the master of both this consequence might not perhaps be brought completely to pass without a struggle and many appeals to the council which in a government constituted like this cannot fail to terminate against the rajah and by the construction to which his opposition to the agent would be liable might eventually draw on him severe restrictions and end in reducing him to the mean and depraved state of a mere zemindar  x that in order to satisfy the said rajah of the intentions of the company towards him and of the true sense and construction of the grants to him the said rajah to be made the governorgeneral he the said warren hastings and council did on the 24th august 1775 instruct mr fowke the resident at the rajahs court in the following words it is proper to assure the rajah we do not mean to increase his tribute but to require from him an exact sum that under the sovereignty of the company we are determined to leave him the free and uncontrolled management of the internal government of his country and the collection and regulation of the revenues so long as he adheres to the terms of his engagement and will never demand any augmentation of the annual tribute which may be fixed  xi that the said warren hastings and the councilgeneral not being satisfied with having instructed the resident to make the representation aforesaid to remove all suspicion that by the new grants any attempt should insidiously be made to change his former tenure did resolve that a letter should be written by the governorgeneral himself to the rajah of benares to be delivered to mr fowke the resident together with his credentials in which letter they declare the board willing to continue the grant of the zemindary to him in as full and ample a manner as he possessed it from former sovereigns and on his paying the annual tribute cand in explaining the reasons for granting to him the mint and criminal justice they inform him that this is done in order that he may possess an uncontrolled and free authority in the regulation and government of his zemindary  xii that on the 26th february 1776 the board and council did order that the proper instruments should be prepared for conveying to the rajah aforesaid the government and criminal justice and mint of benares with its dependencies in the usual form expressing the conditions already resolved on in the several proceedings of the board and on the same day a letter was written to the resident at benares signifying that they had ordered the proper instruments to be prepared specifying the terms concerning the remittance of the rajahs tribute to calcutta as well as the several other conditions which had been already agreed toand that they should forward it to him to be delivered to the rajah and on the 20th of march following the board did again explain the terms of the said tribute in a letter to the court of directors and did add that a sunnud grant or patent for his cheyt sings zemindary should be furnished him on these and the conditions before agreed on  xiii that during the course of the transactions aforesaid in council and the various assurances given to the rajah and the court of directors certain improper and fraudulent practices were used with regard to the symbols of investiture which ought to have been given and the form of the deeds by which the said zemindary ought to have been granted for it appears that the original deeds were signed by the board on the 4th september 1775 and transmitted to mr fowke the resident at the rajahs court and that on the 20th of november following the court of directors were acquainted by the said warren hastings and the council that rajah cheyt sing had been invested with the sunnud charters or patents for his zemindary and the kellaut or robes of investiture in all the proper forms but on the 1st of october 1775 the rajah did complain to the governorgeneral and council that the kellaut or robes with which he was to be invested according to their order is not of the same kind as that which he received from the late vizier on the like occasion in consequence of the said complaint the board did in their letter to the resident of the 11th of the same month desire him to make inquiry respecting the nature of the kellaut and invest him with one of the same sort on the part of this government instead of that which they formerly described to him and it appears highly probable that the instruments which accompanied the said robes of investiture were made in a manner conformable to the orders and directions of the board and the conditions by them agreed to as the rajah who complained of the insufficiency of the robes did make no complaint of the insufficiency of the instruments or of any deviation in them from those he had formerly received from the vizier but a copy or duplicate of the said deeds or instruments were in some manner surreptitiously disposed of and withheld from the records of the company and never were transmitted to the court of directors  xiv that several months after the said settlement and investiture namely on the 15th of april 1776 the secretary informed the court that he had prepared a sunnud cabbolut and pottah that is a patent an agreement and a rentroll for cheyt sings zemindary and the board ordered the same to be executed but the resident on receiving the same did transmit the several objections made by the rajah thereto and particularly to a clause in the patent made in direct contradiction to the engagements of the council so solemnly and repeatedly given by which clause the former patents are declared to be null that on the representation aforesaid on the 29th july the secretary was ordered to prepare new and proper instruments omitting the clause declaring the former patents to be null and the said new patents were delivered to the rajah and the others which he objected to as well as those which had been delivered to him originally were returned to the presidency but neither the first set of deeds nor the fraudulent patent aforesaid nor the new instruments made out on the complaint of the rajah omitting the exceptionable words have been inserted in the records although it was the particular duty of the said warren hastings that all transactions with the country powers should be faithfully entered as well as to take care that all instruments transmitted to them on the faith of the company should be honestly candidly and fairly executed according to the true intent and meaning of the engagements entered into on the part of the companygiving by the said complicated artificial and fraudulent management as well as by his said omitting to record the said material document strong reason to presume that he did even then meditate to make some evil use of the deeds which he thus withheld from the company and which he did afterwards in reality make when he found means and opportunity to effect his evil purpose   part ii  designs of mr hastings to ruin the rajah of benares  i that the tribute transferred to the company by the treaty with the nabob of oude being 250000l a year sterling and upwards without any deductions whatsoever was paid monthly with such punctual exactness as had no parallel in the companys dealings with any of the native princes or with any subject zemindar being the only one who never was in arrears and according to all appearance a perfect harmony did prevail between the supreme council at calcutta and the rajah but though the rajah of benares furnished no occasion of displeasure to the board yet it since appears that the said warren hastings did at some time in the year 1777 conceive displeasure against him in that year he the said warren hastings retracted his own act of resignation of his office made to the court of directors through his agent mr macleane and calling in the aid of the military to support him in his authority brought the divisions of the government according to his own expression to an extremity bordering on civil violence this extremity he attributes in a narrative by him transmitted to the court of directors and printed not to his own fraud and prevarication but to what he calls an attempt to wrest from him his authority and in the said narrative he pretends that the rajah of benares had deputed an agent with an express commission to his opponent sir john clavering this fact if it had been true which is not proved was in no sort criminal or offensive to the companys government but was at first sight nothing more than a proper mark of duty and respect to the supposed succession of office nor is it possible to conceive in what manner it could offend the said hastings if he did not imagine that the express commission to which in the said narrative he refers might relate to the discovery to sir john clavering of some practice which he might wish to concealthe said clavering whom he styles his opponent having been engaged in obedience to the companys express orders in the discovery of sundry peculations and other evil practices charged upon the said hastings but although at the time of the said pretended deputation he dissembled his resentment it appears to have rankled in his mind and that he never forgave it of whatever nature it might have been the same never having been by him explained and some years after he recorded it in his justification of his oppressive conduct towards the rajah urging the same with great virulence and asperity as a proof or presumption of his the said rajahs disaffection to the companys government and by his subsequent acts he seems from the first to have resolved when opportunity should occur on a severe revenge  ii that having obtained in his casting vote a majority in council on the death of sir john clavering and mr monson he did suddenly and without any previous general communication with the members of the board by a minute of consultation of the 9th of july 1778 make an extraordinary demand namely that the rajah of benares should consent to the establishment of three regular battalions of sepoys to be raised and maintained at his own expense and the said expense was estimated at between fifty and sixty thousand pounds sterling  iii that the said requisition did suppose the consent of the rajahthe very word being inserted in the body of his the said warren hastingss minute and the same was agreed to though with some doubts on the parts of two of his colleagues mr francis and mr wheler concerning the right of making the same even worded as it was but mr francis and mr wheler soon after finding that the rajah was much alarmed by this departure from the treaty the requisition aforesaid was strenuously opposed by them the said hastings did notwithstanding this opposition persevere and by his casting vote alone did carry the said unjust and oppressive demand the rajah submitted after some murmuring and remonstrance to pay the sum requiredbut on the express condition as has been frequently asserted by him to the said warren hastings without any contradiction that the exaction should continue but for one year and should not be drawn into precedent he also requested that the extraordinary demand should be paid along with the instalments of his monthly tribute but although the said warren hastings did not so much as pretend that the instant payment was at all necessary and though he was urged by his beforementioned colleagues to moderate his proceedings he did insist upon immediate payment of the whole and did deliver his demand in proud and insulting language wholly unfit for a governor of a civilized nation to use towards eminent persons in alliance with and in honorable and free dependence upon its government and did support the same with arguments full of unwarrantable passion and with references to reports affecting merely his own personal power and consideration which reports were not proved nor attempted to be proved and if proved furnishing reasons insufficient for his purpose and indecent in any public proceedings that the said hastings did cause the said sums of money to be rigorously exacted although no such regular battalions as he pretended to establish as a color for his demand on the rajah were then raised or any steps taken towards raising them and when the said rajah pleaded his inability to pay the whole sum at once he the said hastings persevering in his said outrageous and violent demeanor did order the resident to wait on the rajah forthwith and demand of him in person and by writing the full payment in specie to be made to him within five days of such demand and to declare to him in the name of this government that his evading or neglecting to accomplish the payment thereof within that space of time should be deemed equivalent to an absolute refusal and in case of noncompliance with this the residents demand we peremptorily enjoin you to refrain from all further intercourse with him the said hastings appearing by all his proceedings to be more disposed to bring on a quarrel with the prince of benares than to provide money for any public service  iv that the said demand was complied with and the whole thereof paid on the 10th of october that year and the said rajah did write to the said hastings a letter in order to mitigate and mollify him declaring to the said hastings that his sole reliance was on him and that in every instance he depended on his faith religion promises and actions but he the said warren hastings as if the being reminded of his faith and promises were an incentive to him to violate the same although he had agreed that his demand should not be drawn into precedent and the payment of the fifty thousand pounds aforesaid should continue only for one year did the very day after he had received the letter aforesaid renew a demand of the same nature and on the same pretence this year even less plausible than the former of three battalions to be raised the said rajah on being informed of this requisition did remind the said warren hastings that he engaged in the last year that but one payment should be made and that he should not be called upon in future and pleading inability to discharge the new demand declared himself in the following words to the said warren hastings i am therefore hopeful you will be kindly pleased to excuse me the five lacs now demanded and that nothing may be demanded of me beyond the amount expressed in the pottah  v that on the day after the receipt of this letter that is on the 28th august 1779 he the said warren hastings made a reply to the said letter and without any remark whatsoever on the allegation of the rajah stating to him his engagement that he the said rajah should not be called upon in future he says i now repeat my demand that you do on the receipt of this without evasion or delay pay the five lac of rupees into the hands of mr thomas graham who has orders to receive it from you and in case of your refusal to summon the two battalions of sepoys under the command of major camac to benares that measures may be taken to oblige you to a compliance and in this case the whole expense of the corps from the time of its march will fall on you  vi that the said rajah did a second and third time represent to the said warren hastings that he had broke his promise and the said hastings did in no manner deny the same but did in contempt thereof as well as of the original treaty between the company and the rajah order two battalions of troops to march into his territories and in a manner the most harsh insulting and despotic as if to provoke that prince to some act of resistance did compel him to the payment of the said second unjust demand and did extort also the sum of two thousand pounds on pretence of the charge of the troops employed to coerce him  vii that the third year that is to say in the year 1780 the same demand was with the same menaces renewed and did as before produce several humble remonstrances and submissive complaints which the said hastings did always treat as crimes and offences of the highest order and although in the regular subsidy or tribute which was monthly payable by treaty fifty days of grace were allowed on each payment and after the expiration of the said fifty days one quarter par cent only was provided as a penalty he the said warren hastings on some short delay of payment of his third arbitrary and illegal demand did presume of his own authority to impose a fine or mulct of ten thousand pounds on the said rajah and though it does not appear whether or no the same was actually levied the said threat was soon after followed by an order from the said hastings for the march of troops into the country of benares as in the preceding year  viii that these violent and insulting measures failing to provoke the rajah and he having paid up the whole demand the said warren hastings being resolved to drive him to extremities did make on the said rajah a sudden demand over and above the ordinary tribute or subsidy of 260000l per annum and over and above the 50000l extraordinary to provide a body of cavalry for the service of the bengal government  ix the demand as expressed in the minute of consultation and in the public instructions of the board to the resident to make the requisition is for such part of the cavalry entertained in his service as he can spare and the demand is in this and in no other manner described by the governorgeneral and council in their letter to the court of directors but in a narrative of the said warren hastingss addressed to edward wheler esquire it appears that upon the rajahs making difficulties according to the representation of the said hastings relative to the said requisition the correspondence concerning which the said hastings hath fraudulently suppressed he the said hastings instead of adhering to the requisition of such cavalry as the rajah could spare and which was all that by the order of council he was authorized to make did of his own private and arbitrary authority in some letter which he hath suppressed instruct the resident markham to make a peremptory demand for two thousand cavalry which he well knew to be more than the rajahs finances could support estimating the provision for the same at 96000l a year at the lowest though the expense of the same would probably have been much more which extravagant demand the said hastings could only have made in hopes of provoking the rajah to some imprudent measure or passionate remonstrance and this arbitrary demand of cavalry was made and peremptorily insisted on although in the original treaty with the said rajah it was left entirely optional whether or not he should keep up any cavalry at all and in the minute of consultation it was expressly mentioned to be thus optional and that for whatsoever cavalry he the said rajah should furnish he should be paid fifteen rupees per month for each private and so in proportion for officers yet the demand aforesaid was made without any offer whatsoever of providing the said payment according to treaty  x that the said hastings did soon after but upon what grounds does not appear by any minute of council or from any correspondence contained in his narrative reduce the demand to fifteen hundred and afterwards to one thousand by which he showed himself to be sensible of the extravagance of his first requisition  xi that in consequence of these requisitions as he asserts in his narrative aforesaid the rajah did offer two hundred and fifty horse but sent none but the said hastings doth not accompany his said narrative with any voucher or document whatever and therefore the account given by the rajah and delivered to the said warren hastings himself inserted by the said warren hastings himself in his narrative and in no part thereof attempted to be impeached is more worthy of credit that is to say  with respect to the horse you desired me in your letter to inform you of what number i could afford to station with you i sent you a particular account of all that were in my service amounting to one thousand three hundred horse of which several were stationed at distant places but i received no answer to this mr markham delivered me an order to prepare a thousand horse in compliance with your wishes i collected five hundred horse and a substitute for the remainder five hundred burkundasses matchlockmen of which i sent you information and i told mr markham that they were ready to go to whatever place they should be sent no answer however came from you on this head and i remained astonished at the cause of it repeatedly i asked mr markham about an answer to my letter about the horse but he told me that he did not know the reason of no answer having been sent i remained astonished  xii that the said hastings is guilty of an high offence in not giving an answer to letters of such importance and in concealing the said letters from the court of directors as well as much of his correspondence with the residentsand more particularly in not directing to what place the cavalry and matchlockmen aforesaid should be sent when the rajah had declared they were ready to go to whatever service should be destined for them and afterwards in maliciously accusing the rajah for not having sent the same  xiii that on the 3d of february 1781 a new demand for the support of the three fictitious battalions of sepoys aforesaid was made by the said warren hastings but whilst the rajah was paying by instalments the said arbitrary demand the said rajah was alarmed with some intelligence of secret projects on foot for his ruin and being well apprised of the malicious and revengeful temper of the said hastings in order to pacify him if possible offered to redeem himself by a large ransom to the amount of two hundred thousand pounds sterling to be paid for the use of the company and it appears that the said alarm was far from groundless for major palmer one of the secret and confidential agents of the said hastings hath sworn on the 4th of december 1781 at the desire of the said warren hastings before sir elijah impey to the following effect that is to say that the said warren hastings had told him the said palmer that he the said hastings had rejected the offer of two hundred thousand pounds made by the rajah of benares for the public service and that he was resolved to convert the faults committed by the rajah into a public benefit and would exact the sum of five hundred thousand pounds as a punishment for his breach of engagements with the government of bengal and acts of misconduct in his zemindary and if the rajah should absolutely refuse the demand that he would deprive him of his zemindary or transfer the sovereignty thereof to the nabob of oude  xiv and mr anderson in his declaration from sindias camp of the 4th of january 1782 did also at the desire of mr hastings depose though not on oath concerning a conversation between him and the said hastings but mentioning neither the time nor place where the same was held in which conversation after reciting the allegations of the said hastings relative to several particulars of the delay and backwardness of the rajah in paying the aforesaid extra demand and his resolution to exact from the rajah a considerable sum of money to the relief of the companys exigencies he proceeds in the following words that if he the rajah consented you the said warren hastings were desirous of establishing his possessions on the most permanent and eligible footing but if he refused you had it in your power to raise a large sum for the company by accepting an offer which had been made for his districts by the vizier and the said anderson in the declaration aforesaid made at the request of the said hastings and addressed to him expressed himself as follows that you told me you had communicated our designs to mr wheler his only remaining colleague and i believe but i do not positively recollect you said he concurred in them but no trace of any such communication or concurrence did at the time referred to or at any time ever after appear on the consultations as it ought to have done and the said hastings is criminal for having omitted to enter and record the proceeding that the said wheler did also declare but a considerable time after the date of the conversations aforesaid that on the eve of the governorgenerals departure the said hastings had told him that the rajahs offences not stating what offences he having paid up all the demands ordinary and extraordinary were declared to require early punishment and as his wealth was great and the companys exigencies pressing it was thought a measure of policy and of justice to exact from him a large pecuniary mulct for their relief the sum to which the governor declared his resolution to extend the fine was forty or fifty lacs his ability to pay it was stated as a fact that could not admit of a doubt and the two alternatives on which the governor declared himself to have resolved were to the best of my recollection either a removal from his zemindary entirely or by taking immediate possession of all his forts to obtain out of the treasure deposited in them the above sum for the company  xv that in the declaration of the said wheler the time of the conversation aforesaid is stated to be on the eve of the governors departure and then said to be confidential nor is it said or insinuated that he knew or ever heard thereof at a more early period though it appears by major palmers affidavit that the design of taking not four or five but absolutely five hundred thousand pounds from the rajah was communicated to him as early as the month of june and it does not appear by the declarations of the said wheler he did ever casually or officially approve of the measure which long concealment and late communication time not being allowed to his colleague to consider the nature and consequences of such a project or to advise any precaution concerning the same is a high misdemeanor  xvi that the said hastings having formed a resolution to execute one of the three violent and arbitrary resolutions aforesaidnamely to sell the companys sovereignty over benares to the nabob of oude or to dispossess the rajah of his territories or to seize upon his forts and to plunder them of the treasure therein contained to the amount of four or five hundred thousand poundsdid reject the offer of two hundred thousand pounds tendered by the said rajah for his redemption from the injuries which he had discovered that the said hastings had clandestinely meditated against him although the sum aforesaid would have been a considerable and seasonable acquisition at that time the said hastings being determined at a critical period to risk the existence of the british empire rather than fail in the gratification of his revenge against the said rajah  xvii that the first of his three instituted projects namely the depriving the rajah of his territories was by himself considered as a measure likely to be productive of much odium to the british government he having declared whatever opinions he might entertain of its justice that it would have an appearance of severity and might furnish grounds unfavorable to the credit of our government and to his own reputation from the natural influence which every act of rigor exercised in the persons of men in elevated situations is apt to impress on those who are too remote from the scene of action to judge by any evidence of the facts themselves of their motives or propriety and the second attempt the sum of money which he aimed at by attacking the fortresses of the rajah and plundering them of the treasure supposed to be there secured besides the obvious uncertainty of acquiring what was thus sought would be liable to the same imputations with the former and with regard to the third project namely the sale of the companys sovereignty to the nabob of oude and his having actually received proposals for the same it was an high offence to the company as presuming without their authority or consent to put up to sale their sovereign rights and particularly to put them up to sale to that very person against whom the independence of the said province had been declared by the governorgeneral and council to be necessary as a barrier for the security of the other provinces in case of a future rupture with him59 it was an heinous injury to the said rajah to attempt to change his relation without his consent especially on account of the person to whom he was to be made over for money by reason of the known enmity subsisting between his family and that of the nabob who was to be the purchaser and it was a grievous outrage on the innocent inhabitants of the zemindary of benares to propose putting them under a person long before described by himself to the court of directors to want the qualities of the head and heart requisite for his station and a letter from the british resident at oude transmitted to the said court represents him to have wholly lost by his oppressions the confidence and affections of his own subjects and whose distresses and the known disorders in his government he the said hastings did attribute solely to his own bad conduct and evil character admitting also in a letter written to edward wheler esquire and transmitted to the court of directors that many circumstances did favor suspicion of his the said nabobs fidelity to the english interest the nabob being surrounded by men base in their characters and improvident in their understandings his favorites and his companions of his looser hours these had every cause to dread the effect of my influence on theirs and both these and the relations of the family whose views of consequence and power were intercepted by our participation in the administration of his affairs entertained a mortal hatred to our nation and openly avowed it and the said hastings was well aware that in case the nabob by him described in the manner aforesaid on making such purchase should continue to observe the terms of his fathers original covenants and engagements with the rajah and should pay the company the only tribute which he could lawfully exact from the said rajah it was impossible that he could for the mere naked and unprofitable rights of a sovereignty paramount afford to offer so great a sum as the rajah did offer to the said hastings for his redemption from oppression such an acquisition to the nabob while he kept his faith could not possibly be of any advantage whatever to him and that therefore if a great sum was to be paid by the nabob of oude it must be for the purpose of oppression and violation of public faith to be perpetrated in the person of the said nabob to an extent and in a manner which the said hastings was then apprehensive he could not justify to the court of directors as his own personal act   part iii  expulsion of the rajah of benares  i that the said warren hastings being resolved on the ruin of the rajah aforesaid as a preliminary step thereto did against the express orders of the court of directors remove francis fowke esquire the companys resident at the city of benares without any complaint or pretence of complaint whatsoever but merely on his own declaration that he must have as a resident at benares a person of his own special and personal nomination and confidence and not a man of the companys nominationand in the place of the said francis fowke thus illegally divested of his office did appoint thereto another servant of the company of his own choice  ii that soon after he had removed the companys resident he prepared for a journey to the upper provinces and particularly to benares in order to execute the wicked and perfidious designs by him before meditated and contrived and although he did communicate his purpose privately to such persons as he thought fit to intrust therewith he did not enter anything on the consultations to that purpose or record the principles real or pretended on which he had resolved to act nor did he state any guilt in the rajah which he intended to punish or charge him the said rajah with entertaining any hostile intentions the effects of which were to be prevented by any strong measure but on the contrary he did industriously conceal his real designs from the court of directors and did fallaciously enter on the consultations a minute declaratory of purposes wholly different therefrom and which supposed nothing more than an amicable adjustment founded on the treaties between the company and the rajah investing himself by his said minute with full power and authority to form such arrangements with the rajah of benares for the better government and management of his zemindary and to perform such acts for the improvement of the interest which the company possesses in it as he shall think fit and consonant to the mutual engagements subsisting between the company and the rajah and for this and other purposes he did invest himself with the whole power of the council giving to himself an authority as if his acts had been the acts of the council itself which though a power of a dangerous unwarrantable and illegal extent yet does plainly imply the following limits namely that the acts done should be arranged with the rajah that is with his consent and secondly that they should be consonant to the actual engagements between the parties and nothing appears in the minute conferring the said power which did express or imply any authority for depriving the rajah of his government or selling the sovereignty thereof to his hereditary enemy or for the plunder of his forttreasures  iii that the said warren hastings having formed the plans aforesaid for the ruin of the rajah did set out on a journey to the city of benares with a great train but with a very small force not much exceeding six companies of regular black soldiers to perpetrate some of the unjust and violent acts by him meditated and resolved on and the said hastings was met according to the usage of distinguished persons in that country by the rajah of benares with a very great attendance both in boats and on shore which attendance he did apparently intend as a mark of honor and observance to the place and person of the said hastings but which the said hastings did afterwards groundlessly and maliciously represent as an indication of a design upon his life and the said rajah came into the pinnace in which the said hastings was carried and in a lowly and suppliant manner alone and without any guard or attendance whatsoever entreated his favor and being received with great sternness and arrogance he did put his turban in the lap of the said hastings thereby signifying that he abandoned his life and fortune to his disposal and then departed the said hastings not apprehending nor having any reason to apprehend any violence whatsoever to his person  iv that the said hastings in the utmost security and freedom from apprehension did pursue his journey and did arrive at the city of benares on the 14th of august 1781 some hours before the rajah who soon after his arrival intended to pay him a visit of honor and respect at his quarters but was by the said hastings rudely and insolently forbid until he should receive his permission and the said hastings although he had previously determined on the ruin of the said rajah in order to afford some color of regularity and justice to his proceedings did on the day after his arrival that is on the 15th day of august 1781 send to the rajah a charge in writing which though informal and irregular may be reduced to four articles two general and two more particular the first of the general being that he the rajah had by the means of his secret agents endeavored to excite disorders in the government on which he depended the second that he had suffered the daily perpetration of robberies and murders even in the streets of benares to the great and public scandal of the english name  v that it appears that the said warren hastings is guilty of an high offence contrary to the fundamental principles of justice in the said mode of charging misdemeanors without any specification of person or place or time or act or any offer of specification or proofs by which the party charged may be enabled to refute the same in order to unjustly load his reputation and to prejudice him with regard to the articles more clearly specified  vi that the two specified articles relate to certain delays the first with regard to the payment of the sums of money unjustly extorted as aforesaid and the second the noncompliance with a requisition of cavalrywhich noncompliance the said hastings even if the said charges had been founded did falsely and in contradiction to all law affirm and maintain in his accusation against the rajah and addressing himself to him to amount to a direct charge of disaffection and infidelity to the government on which you depend and further proceeded as follows i therefore judged it proper to state them the said charges thus fully to you in writing and to require your answer and this i expect immediately that the said hastings stating his pretended facts to amount to a charge of the nature as he would have it understood of high treason and therefore calling for an immediate answer did wilfully act against the rules of natural justice which requires that a convenient time should be given to answer proportioned to the greatness of the offence alleged and the heavy penalties which attend it and when he did arrogate to himself a right both to charge and to judge in his own person he ought to have allowed the rajah full opportunity for conferring with his ministers his doctors of law and his accountants on the facts charged and on the criminality inferred in the said accusation of disloyalty and disaffection or offences of that quality  vii that the said rajah did under the pressure of the disadvantages aforesaid deliver in upon the very evening of the day of the charge a full complete and specific answer to the two articles therein specified and did allege and offer proof that the whole of the extraordinary demands of the said hastings had been actually long before paid and discharged and did state a proper defence with regard to the cavalry even supposing him bound when he was not bound to furnish any and the said rajah did make a direct denial of the truth of the two general articles and did explain himself on the same in as satisfactory a manner and as fully as their nature could permit offering to enter into immediate trial of the points in issue between him and the said hastings in the remarkable words following my enemies with a view to my ruin have made false representations to you now that happily for me you have yourself arrived at this place you will be able to ascertain all the circumstances first relative to the horse secondly to my people going to calcutta and thirdly the dates of the receipts of the particular sums above mentioned you will then know whether i have amused you with a false representation or made a just report to you and in the said answer the said rajah complained but in the most modest terms of an injury to him of the most dangerous and criminal nature in transactions of such moment namely his not receiving any answer to his letters and petitions and concluded in the following words i have never swerved in the smallest degree from my duty to you it remains with you to decide on all these matters i am in every case your slave what is just i have represented to you may your prosperity increase  viii that the said warren hastings was bound by the essential principles of natural justice to attend to the claim made by the rajah to a fair and impartial trial and inquiry into the matter of accusation brought against him by the said hastings at a time and place which furnished all proper materials and the presence of all necessary witnesses but the said hastings instead of instituting the said inquiry and granting trial did receive an humble request for justice from a great prince as a fresh offence and as a personal insult to himself and did conceive a violent passion of anger and a strong resentment thereat declaring that he did consider the said answer as not only unsatisfactory in substance but offensive in style this answer you will perceive to be not only unsatisfactory in substance but offensive in style and less a vindication of himself than a recrimination on me it expresses no concern for the causes of complaint contained in my letter or desire to atone for them nor the smallest intention to pursue a different line of conduct an answer couched nearly in terms of defiance to requisitions of so serious a nature i could not but consider as a strong indication of that spirit of independency which the rajah has for some years past assumed and of which indeed i had early observed other manifest symptoms both before and from the instant of my arrival which representation is altogether and in all parts thereof groundless and injurious as the substance of the answer is a justification proper to be pleaded and the style if in anything exceptionable it is in its extreme humility resulting rather from an unmanly and abject spirit than from anything of an offensive liberty but being received as disrespectful by the said hastings it abundantly indicates the tyrannical arrogance of the said hastings and the depression into which the natives are sunk under the british government  ix that the said warren hastings pretending to have been much alarmed at the offensive language of the said rajahs defence and at certain appearances of independency which he had observed not only on former occasions but since his arrival at benares where he had been but little more than one day and which appearances he never has specified in any one instance did assert that he conceived himself indispensably obliged to adopt some decisive plan and without any farther inquiry or consultation which appears with any person did at ten oclock of the very night on which he received the beforementioned full and satisfactory as well as submissive answer send an order to the british resident then being a public minister representing the british government at the court of the said rajah and as such bound by the law of nations to respect the prince at whose court he was resident and not to attempt anything against his person or state and who ought not therefore to have been chosen by the said hastings and compelled to serve in that business that he should on the next morning arrest the said prince in his palace and keep him in his custody until further orders which said order being conceived in the most peremptory terms the rajah was put under arrest with a guard of about thirty orderly sepoys with their swords drawn and the particulars thereof were reported to him as follows  honorable siri this morning in obedience to your orders of last night proceeded with a few of my orderlies accompanied by lieutenant stalker to shewalla ghaut the present residence of rajah cheyt sing and acquainted him it was your pleasure he should consider himself in arrest that he should order his people to behave in a quiet and orderly manner for that any attempt to rescue him would be attended with his own destruction the rajah submitted quietly to the arrest and assured me that whatever were your orders he was ready implicitly to obey he hoped that you would allow him a subsistence but as for his zemindary his forts and his treasure he was ready to lay them at your feet and his life if required he expressed himself much hurt at the ignominy which he affirmed must be the consequence of his confinement and entreated me to return to you with the foregoing submission hoping that you would make allowances for his youth and inexperience and in consideration of his fathers name release him from his confinement as soon as he should prove the sincerity of his offers and himself deserving of your compassion and forgiveness  x that a further order was given that every servant of the rajahs should be disarmed and a certain number only left to attend him under a strict watch in a quarter of an hour after this conversation two companies of grenadier sepoys were sent to the rajahs palace by the said hastings and the rajah being dismayed by this unexpected and unprovoked treatment wrote two short letters or petitions to the said hastings under the greatest apparent dejection at the outrage and dishonor he had suffered in the eyes of his subjects all imprisonment of persons of rank being held in that country as a mark of indelible infamy and he also in all probability considering his imprisonment as a prelude to the taking away his life and in the first of the said petitions he did express himself in this manner whatever may be your pleasure do it with your own hands i am your slave what occasion can there be for a guard and in the other my honor was bestowed upon me by your highness it depends on you alone to take away or not to take away the country out of my hands in case my honor is not left to me how shall i be equal to the business of the government whoever with his hands in a supplicating posture is ready with his life and property what necessity can there be for him to be dealt with in this way  xi that according to the said hastingss narrative of this transaction he the said hastings on account of the apparent despondency in which these letters were written thought it necessary to give him some encouragement and therefore wrote him a note of a few lines carelessly and haughtily expressed and little calculated to relieve him from his uneasiness promising to send to him a person to explain particulars and desiring him to set his mind at rest and not to conceive any terror or apprehension to which an answer of great humility and dejection was received  xii that the report of the rajahs arrest did cause a great alarm in the city in the suburbs of which the rajahs palace is situated and in the adjacent country the people were filled with dismay and anger at the outrage and indignity offered to a prince under whose government they enjoyed much ease and happiness under these circumstances the rajah desired leave to perform his ablutions which was refused unless he sent for water and performed that ceremony on the spot this he did and soon after some of the people who now began to surround the palace in considerable numbers attempting to force their way into the palace a british officer commanding the guard upon the rajah struck one of them with his sword the people grew more and more irritated but a message being sent from the rajah to appease them they continued on this interposition for a while quiet then the rajah retired to a sort of stone pavilion or bastion to perform his devotions the guard of sepoys attending him in this act of religion in the mean time a person of the meanest station called a chubdar at best answering to our common beadle or tipstaff was sent with a message of what nature does not appear from mr hastings or the resident to the prince under arrest and this base person without regard to the rank of the prisoner or to his then occupation addressed him in a rude boisterous manner passionately and insultingly as the said rajah has without contradiction asserted and reviling him with a loud voice gave both him and his people the vilest abuse and the manner and matter being observable and audible to the multitude divided only by an open stone lattice from the scene within a firing commenced from without the palace on which the rajah again interposed and did what in him lay to suppress the tumult until an english officer striking him with a sword and wounding him on the hand the people no longer kept any measures but broke through the inclosure of the palace the insolent tipstaff was first cut down and the multitude falling upon the sepoys and the english officers the whole or nearly the whole were cut to pieces the soldiers having been ordered to that service without any charges for their pieces and in this tumult the rajah being justly fearful of falling into the hands of the said hastings did make his escape over the walls of his palace by means of a rope formed of his turban tied together into a boat upon the river and from thence into a place of security abandoning many of his family to the discretion of the said hastings who did cause the said palace to be occupied by a company of soldiers after the flight of the rajah  xiii that the rajah as soon as he had arrived at a place of refuge did on the very day of his flight send a suppliant letter to the said hastings filled with expressions of concern affirmed by the said hastings to be slight expressions for what had happened and professions said by the said hastings to be indefinite and unapplied of fidelity but the said warren hastings though bound by his duty to hear the said rajah and to prevent extremities if possible being filled with insolence and malice did not think it becoming of him to make any reply to it and that he thought he ordered the bearer of the letter to be told that it required none  xiv that this letter of submission having been received the said rajah not discouraged or provoked from using every attempt towards peace and reconciliation did again apply on the very morning following to richard johnson esquire for his interposition but to no purpose and did likewise with as little effect send a message to cantoo baboo native steward and confidential agent of the said hastings which was afterwards reduced into writing to exculpate himself from any concern in what had passed and to profess his obedience to his will hastingss in whatever way he should dictate but the said hastings for several false and contradictory reasons by him assigned did not take any advantage of the said opening attributing the same to artifice in order to gain time but instead of accepting the said submissions he did resolve upon flight from the city of benares and did suddenly fly therefrom in great confusion  xv that the said hastings did persevere in his resolutions not to listen to any submission or offer of accommodation whatsoever though several were afterwards made through almost every person who might be supposed to have influence with him but did cause the rajahs troops to be attacked and fallen upon though they only acted on the defensive as the rajah has without contradiction asserted and thereby and by his preceding refusal of propositions of the same nature and by other his perfidious unjust and tyrannical acts by him perpetrated and done and by his total improvidence in not taking any one rational security whatsoever against the inevitable consequences of those acts did make himself guilty of all the mutual slaughter and devastation which ensued as well as in his opinion of the imminent danger of the total subversion of the british power in india by the risk of his own person which he asserts that it did runas also that it ought not to be thought that he attributed too much consequence to his personal safety when he supposed the fate of the british empire in india connected with it and that mean as its substance may be its accidental qualities were equivalent to those which like the characters of a talisman in the arabian mythology formed the essence of the state itself representation title and the estimate of the public opinion that had he fallen such a stroke would be universally considered as decisive of the national fate every state round it would have started into arms against it and every subject of its own dominion would according to their several abilities have become its enemy and that he knew and has declared that though the said stroke was not struck that great convulsions did actually ensue from his proceedings that half the province of oude was in a state of as complete rebellion as that of benares and that invasions tumults and insurrections were occasioned thereby in various other parts  xvi that the said warren hastings after he had collected his forces from all parts did with little difficulty or bloodshed subsequent to that time on the part of his troops and in a few days entirely reduce the said province of benares and did after the said short and little resisted hostility in cold blood issue an order for burning a certain town in which he accused the people at large of having killed upon what provocation he knows not certain wounded sepoys who were prisoners which order being generally given when it was his duty to have made some inquiry concerning the particular offenders but which he did never make or cause to be made was cruel inhuman and tended to the destruction of the revenues of the company and that this and other acts of devastation did cause the loss of two months of the collections  xvii that the said warren hastings did not only refuse the submissions of the said rajah which were frequently repeated through various persons after he had left benares and even after the defeat of certain of the companys forces but did proscribe and except him from the pardons which he issued after he had satisfied his vengeance on the province of benares  xviii that the said warren hastings did send to a certain castle called bidzigur the residence of a person of high rank called panna the mother of the rajah of benares with whom his wife a woman described by the said hastings to be of an amiable character and all the other women of the rajahs family and the survivors of the family of his father bulwant sing did then reside a body of troops to dispossess them of her said residence and to seize upon her money and effects although she did not stand even by himself accused of any offence whatsoeverpretending but not proving and not attempting to prove then nor since that the treasures therein contained were the property of the rajah and not her own and did in order to stimulate the british soldiery to rapine and outrage issue to them several barbarous orders contrary to the practice of civilized nations relative to their property movable and immovable attended with unworthy and unbecoming menaces highly offensive to the manners of the east and the particular respect there paid to the female sexwhich letters and orders as well as the letters which he had received from the officers concerned the said hastings did unlawfully suppress until forced by the disputes between him and the said officers to discover the same and the said orders are as follow  i am this instant favored with yours of yesterday mine of the same date 22d october 1781 has before this time acquainted you with my resolutions and sentiments respecting the rannee the mother of the rajah cheyt sing i think every demand she has made to you except that of safety and respect for her person is unreasonable if the reports brought to me are true your rejecting her offers or any negotiations with her would soon obtain you possession of the fort upon your own terms i apprehend that she will contrive to defraud the captors of a considerable part of the booty by being suffered to retire without examination but this is your consideration and not mine i should be very sorry that your officers and soldiers lost any part of the reward to which they are so well entitled but i cannot make any objection as you must be the best judge of the expediency of the promised indulgence to the rannee what you have engaged for i will certainly ratify but as to permitting the rannee to hold the purgunnah of hurluk or any other in the zemindary without being subject to the authority of the zemindar or any lands whatever or indeed making any conditions with her for a provision i will never consent to it and in another letter to the same person dated benares 3d of november 1781 in which he the said hastings consents that the said woman of distinction should be allowed to evacuate the place and to receive protection he did express himself as follows i am willing to grant her now the same conditions to which i at first consented provided that she delivers into your possession within twentyfour hours from the time of receiving your message the fort of bidzigur with the treasure and effects lodged therein by cheyt sing or any of his adherents with the reserve only as above mentioned of such articles as you shall think necessary to her sex and condition or as you shall be disposed of yourself to indulge her with if she complies as i expect she will it will be your part to secure the fort and the property it contains for the benefit of yourself and detachment i have only further to request that you will grant an escort if panna should require it to conduct her here or wherever she may choose to retire to but should she refuse to execute the promise she has made or delay it beyond the term of twentyfour hours it is my positive injunction that you immediately put a stop to any further intercourse or negotiation with her and on no pretext renew it if she disappoints or trifles with me after i have subjected my duan to the disgrace of returning ineffectually and of course myself to discredit i shall consider it as a wanton affront and indignity which i can never forgive nor will i grant her any conditions whatever but leave her exposed to those dangers which she has chosen to risk rather than trust to the clemency and generosity of our government i think she cannot be ignorant of these consequences and will not venture to incur them and it is for this reason i place a dependence on her offers and have consented to send my duan to her  xix that the castle aforesaid being surrendered upon terms of safety and on express condition of not attempting to search their persons the woman of rank aforesaid her female relations and female dependants to the number of three hundred besides children evacuated the said castle but the spirit of rapacity being excited by the letters and other proceedings of the said hastings the capitulation was shamefully and outrageously broken and in despite of the endeavors of the commanding officer the said woman of high condition and her female dependants friends and servants were plundered of the effects they carried with them and which were reserved to them in the capitulation of their fortress and in their persons were otherwise rudely and inhumanly dealt with by the licentious followers of the camp for which outrages represented to the said hastings with great concern by the commanding officer major popham he the said hastings did afterwards recommend a late and fruitless redress  xx that the governorgeneral warren hastings in exciting the hopes of the military by declaring them well entitled to the plunder of the fortress aforesaid the residence of the mother and other women of the rajah of benares and by wishing the troops to secure the same for their own benefit did advise and act in direct contradiction to the orders of the court of directors and to his own opinion of his public duty as well as to the truth and reality thereofhe having some years before entered in writing the declaration which follows  the very idea of prizemoney suggests to my remembrance the former disorders which arose in our army from this source and had almost proved fatal to it of this circumstance you must be sufficiently apprised and of the necessity for discouraging every expectation of this kind amongst the troops it is to be avoided like poison the bad effects of a similar measure were but too plainly felt in a former period and our honorable masters did not fail on that occasion to reprobate with their censure in the most severe terms a practice which they regarded as the source of infinite evils and which if established would in their judgment necessarily bring corruption and ruin on their army  xxi that the said hastings after he had given the license aforesaid and that in consequence thereof the booty found in the castle to the amount of 2327813 current rupees was distributed among the soldiers employed in its reduction the said hastings did retract his declaration of right and his permission to the soldiers to appropriate to themselves the plunder and endeavored by various devices and artifices to explain the same away and to recover the spoil aforesaid for the use of the company and wholly failing in his attempts to resume by a breach of faith with the soldiers what he had unlawfully disposed of by a breach of duty to his constituents he attempted to obtain the same as a loan in which attempt he also failed and the aforesaid money being the only part of the treasures belonging to the rajah or any of his family that had been found he was altogether frustrated in the acquisition of every part of that dishonorable object which alone he pretended to and pursued through a long series of acts of injustice inhumanity oppression violence and bloodshed at the hazard of his person and reputation and in his own opinion at the risk of the total subversion of the british empire  xxi that the said warren hastings after the commission of the offences aforesaid being well aware that he should be called to an account for the same did by the evil counsel and agency of sir elijah impey knight his majestys chiefjustice who was then out of the limits of his jurisdiction cause to be taken at benares before or by the said sir elijah impey and through the intervention not of the companys interpreter but of a certain private interpreter of his the said hastingss own appointment and a dependant on him called major davy several declarations and depositions by natives of hindostanand did also cause to be taken before the said sir elijah impey several attestations in english made by british subjects and which were afterwards transmitted to calcutta and laid before the councilgeneralsome of which depositions were upon oath some upon honor and others neither upon oath nor honor but all or most of which were of an irregular and irrelevant nature and not fit or decent to be taken by a british magistrate or to be transmitted to a british government  xxiii that one of the said attestations but not on oath was made by a principal minister of the nabob of oude to whom the said hastings had some time before proposed to sell the sovereignty of that very territory of benares and that one other attestation not upon oath was made by a native woman of distinction whose son he the said hastings did actually promote to the government of benares vacated by the unjust expulsion of the rajah aforesaid and who in her deposition did declare that she considered the expelled rajah as her enemy and that he never did confer with her or suffer her to be acquainted with any of his designs  xxiv that besides the depositions of persons interested in the ruin of the rajah others were made by persons who then received pensions from him the said hastings and several of the affidavits were made by persons of mean condition and so wholly illiterate as not to be able to write their names  xxv that he the said hastings did also cause to be examined by various proofs and essays the result of which was delivered in upon honor the quality of certain military stores taken by the british troops from the said rajah of benares and upon the report that the same were of a good quality and executed by persons conversant in the making of good military stores although the cannon was stated by the same authority to be bad he the said warren hastings from the report aforesaid did maliciously and contrary to the principles of natural and legal reason infer that the insurrection which had been raised by his own violence and oppression and rendered for a time successful by his own improvidence was the consequence of a premeditated design to overturn the british empire in india and to exterminate therefrom the british nation which design if it had been true the said hastings might have known or rationally conjectured and ought to have provided against and if the said hastings had received any credible information of such design it was his duty to lay the same before the council board and to state the same to the rajah when he was in a condition to have given an answer thereto or to observe thereon and not after he had proscribed and driven him from his dominions to have inquired into offences to justify the previous infliction of punishment  xxvi that it does not appear that in taking the said depositions there was any person present on the part of the rajah to object to the competence or credibility or relevancy of any of the said affidavits or other attestations or to account otherwise than as the said deponents did account for any of the facts therein stated nor were any copies thereof sent to the said rajah although the company had a minister at the place of his residence namely in the camp of the mahratta chief sindia so as to enable him to transmit to the company any matters which might induce or enable them to do justice to the injured prince aforesaid and it does not appear that the said hastings has ever produced any witness letter or other document tending to prove that the said rajah ever did carry on any hostile negotiation whatever with any of those powers with whom he was charged with a conspiracy against the company previous to the period of the said hastingss having arrested him in his palace although he the said hastings had various agents at the courts of all those princesand that a late principal agent and near relation of a minister of one them the rajah of berar called benaram pundit was at the time of the tumult at benares actually with the said hastings and the said benaram pundit was by him highly applauded for his zeal and fidelity and was therefore by him rewarded with a large pension on those very revenues which he had taken from the rajah cheyt sing and if such a conspiracy had previously existed the mahratta minister aforesaid must have known and would have attested it  xxvii that it appears that the said warren hastings at the time that he formed his design of seizing upon the treasures of the rajah of benares and of deposing him did not believe him guilty of that premeditated project for driving the english out of india with which he afterwards thought fit to charge him or that he was really guilty of any other great offence because he has caused it to be deposed that if the said rajah should pay the sum of money by him exacted he would settle his zemindary upon him on the most eligible footing whereas if he had conceived him to have entertained traitorous designs against the company from whom he held his tributary estate or had been otherwise guilty of such enormous offences as to make it necessary to take extraordinary methods for coercing him it would not have been proper for him to settle upon such a traitor and criminal the zemindary of benares or any other territory upon the most eligible or upon any other footing whatever whereby the said hastings has by his own stating demonstrated that the money intended to have been exacted was not as a punishment for crimes but that the crimes were pretended for the purpose of exacting money  xxviii that the said warren hastings in order to justify the acts of violence aforesaid to the court of directors did assert certain false facts known by him to be such and did draw from them certain false and dangerous inferences utterly subversive of the rights of the princes and subjects dependent on the british nation in india contrary to the principles of all just government and highly dishonorable to that of great britain namely that the rajah of benares was not a vassal or tributary prince and that the deeds which passed between him and the board upon the transfer of the zemindary in 1775 were not to be understood to bear the quality and force of a treaty upon optional conditions between equal states that the payments to be made by him were not a tribute but a rent and that the instruments by which his territories were conveyed to him did not differ from common grants to zemindars who were merely subjects but that being nothing more than a common zemindar and mere subject and the company holding the acknowledged rights of his former sovereign held an absolute authority over him that in the known relations of zemindar to the sovereign authority or power delegated by it he owed a personal allegiance and an implicit and unreserved obedience to that authority at the forfeiture of his zemindary and even of his life and property whereas the said hastings did well know that whether the payments from the rajah were called rent or tribute having been frequently by himself called the one and the other and that of whatever nature the instruments by which he held might have been he did not consider him as a common zemindar or landholder but as far independent as a tributary prince could be for he did assign as a reason for receiving his rent rather within the companys province than in his own capital that it would not frustrate the intention of rendering the rajah independent that if a resident was appointed to receive the money as it became due at benares such a resident would unavoidably acquire an influence over the rajah and over his country which would in effect render him the master of both that this consequence might not perhaps be brought completely to pass without a struggle and many appeals to the council which in a government constituted like this cannot fail to terminate against the rajah and by the construction to which his opposition to the agent would be liable might eventually draw on him severe restrictions and end in reducing him to the mean and depraved state of a zemindar  xxix and the said hastings in the said minute of consultation having enumerated the frauds embezzlements and oppressions which would ensue from the rajahs being in the dependent state aforesaid and having obviated all apprehensions from giving to him the implied symbols of dominion did assert that without such appearance he would expect from every change of government additional demands to be made upon him and would of course descend to all the arts of intrigue and concealment practised by other dependent rajahs which would keep him indigent and weak and eventually prove hurtful to the company but that by proper encouragement and protection he might prove a profitable dependant an useful barrier and even a powerful ally to the company but that he would be neither if the conditions of his connection with the company were left open to future variations  xxx that if the fact had been true that the rajah of benares was merely an eminent landholder or any other subject the wicked and dangerous doctrine aforesaid namely that he owed a personal allegiance and an implicit and unreserved obedience to the sovereign authority at the forfeiture of his zemindary and even of his life and property at the discretion of those who held or fully represented the sovereign authority doth leave security neither for life nor property to any persons residing under the companys protection and that no such powers nor any powers of that nature had been delegated to the said warren hastings by any provisions of the act of parliament appointing a governorgeneral and council at fort william in bengal  xxxi that the said warren hastings did also advance another dangerous and pernicious principle in justification of his violent arbitrary and iniquitous actings aforesaid namely that if he had acted with an unwarrantable rigor and even injustice towards cheyt sing yet first if he did believe that extraordinary means were necessary and those exerted with a strong hand to preserve the companys interests from sinking under the accumulated weight that oppressed them or secondly if he saw a political necessity for curbing the overgrown power of a great member of their dominion and to make it contribute to the relief of their pressing exigencies that his error would be excusable as prompted by an excess of zeal for their the companys interest operating with too strong a bias on his judgment but that much stronger is the presumption that such acts are founded on just principles than that they are the result of a misguided judgment that the said doctrines are in both the members thereof subversive of all the principles of just government by empowering a governor with delegated authority in the first case on his own private belief concerning the necessities of the state not to levy an impartial and equal rate of taxation suitable to the circumstances of the several members of the community but to select any individual from the same as an object of arbitrary and unmeasured impositionand in the second case enabling the same governor on the same arbitrary principles to determine whose property should be considered as overgrown and to reduce the same at his pleasure   part iv  second revolution in benares  that the said warren hastings after he had in the manner aforesaid unjustly and violently expelled the rajah cheyt sing the lord or zemindar of benares from his said lordship or zemindary did of his own mere usurped authority and without any communication with the other members of the council of calcutta appoint another person of the name of mehip narrain a descendant by the mother from the late rajah bulwant sing to the government of benares and on account or pretence of his youth and inexperience the said mehip narrain not being above twenty years old did appoint his father durbege sing to act as his representative or administrator of his affairs but did give a controlling authority to the british resident over both notwithstanding his declarations before mentioned of the mischiefs likely to happen to the said country from the establishment of a resident and his opinion since declared in a letter to the court of directors dated from this very place benares the 1st of october 1784 to the same or stronger effect in case agents are sent into the country and armed with authority for the purposes of vengeance and corruptionfor to no other will they be applied  that the said warren hastings did by the same usurped authority entirely set aside all the agreements made between the late rajah and the company which were real agreements with the state of benares in the person of the lord or prince thereof and his heirs and without any form of trial inquisition or other legal process for forfeiture of the privileges of the people to be governed by magistrates of their own and according to their natural laws customs and usages did contrary to the said agreement separate the mint and the criminal justice from the said government and did vest the mint in the british resident and the criminal justice in a mahomedan native of his own appointment and did enhance the tribute to be paid from the province from two hundred and fifty thousand pounds annually limited by treaty or thereabouts to three hundred and thirty thousand pounds for the first year and to four hundred thousand for every year after and did compel the administrator aforesaid father to the rajah to agree to the same and did by the same usurped authority illegally impose and cause to be levied sundry injudicious and oppressive duties on goods and merchandise which did greatly impair the trade of the province and threaten the utter ruin thereof and did charge several pensions on the said revenues of his own mere authority and did send and keep up various bodies of the companys troops in the said country and did perform sundry other acts with regard to the said territory in total subversion of the rights of the sovereign and the people and in violation of the treaties and agreements aforesaid  that the said warren hastings being absent on account of ill health from the presidency of calcutta at a place called nia serai about forty miles distant therefrom did carry on a secret correspondence with the resident at benares and under color that the instalments for the new rent or tribute were in arrear did of his own authority make in about one year a second revolution in the government of the territory aforesaid and did order and direct that durbege sing aforesaid father of the rajah and administrator of his authority should be deprived of his office and of his lands and thrown into prison and did threaten him with death although he the said warren hastings had at the time of the making his new arrangement declared himself sensible that the rent aforesaid might require abatement although he was well apprised that the administrator had been for two months of his administration in a weak and languid state of body and wholly incapable of attending to the business of the collections though a considerable drought had prevailed in the said province and did consequently affect the regularity and produce of the collections and though he had other sufficient reason to believe that the said administrator had not himself received from the collectors of government and the cultivators of the soil the rent in arrear yet he the said warren hastings without any known process or recording any answer defence plea exculpation or apology from the party or recording any other grounds of rigor against him except the following paragraph of a letter from the resident not only gave the order as aforesaid but did afterwards without laying any other or better ground before the councilgeneral persuade them to and did procure from them a confirmation of the aforesaid cruel and illegal proceedings the correspondence concerning which had not been before communicated he pleading his illness for not communicating the same though that illness did not prevent him from carrying on correspondence concerning the deposition of the said administrator and other important affairs in various places  that in the letter to the council requiring the confirmation of his acts aforesaid the said warren hastings did not only propose the confinement of the said administrator at benares although by his imprisonment he must have been in a great measure disabled from recovering the balances due to him and for the nonpayment of which he was thus imprisoned but did propose as an alternative his imprisonment at a remote fortress out of the said territory and in the companys provinces called chunar desiring them to direct the resident at benares to exact from baboo durbege sing every rupee of the collections which it shall appear that he has made and not brought to account and either to confine him at benares or to send him a prisoner to chunar and to keep him in confinement until he shall have discharged the whole of the amount due from him and the said warren hastings did assign motives of passion and personal resentment for the said unjust and rigorous proceedings as follows i feel myself and may be allowed on such an occasion to acknowledge it personally hurt at the ingratitude of this man and at the discredit which his ill conduct has thrown on my appointment of him he has deceived me he has offended against the government which i then represented and as a further reason for depriving him of his jaghire or salary out of land he did insinuate in the said letter but without giving or offering any proof that the said rajah had been guilty of little and mean peculations although the appointments assigned to him had been sufficient to free him from the temptations thereto  that it appears as it might naturally have been expected that the wife of the said administrator the daughter of bulwant sing the late rajah of benares and her son the reigning rajah did oppose to the best of their power but by what remonstrances or upon what plea the said warren hastings did never inform the court of directors the deposition imprisonment and confiscation of the estates of the husband of the one and the father of the other but that the said hastings persisting in his malice did declare to the said council as follows the opposition made by the rajah and the old rannee both equally incapable of judging for themselves does certainly originate from some secret influence which ought to be checked by a decided and peremptory declaration of the authority of the board and a denunciation of their displeasure at their presumption  that the said warren hastings not satisfied with the injuries done and the insults and disgraces offered to the family aforesaid did in a manner unparalleled except by an act of his own on another occasion fraudulently and inhumanly endeavor to make the wife and son of the said administrator contrary to the sentiments and the law of nature the instruments of his oppressions directing that if they the mother and son aforesaid could be induced to yield the appearance of a cheerful acquiescence in the new arrangement and to adopt it as a measure formed with their participation it would be better than that it should be done by a declared act of compulsion but that at all events it ought to be done  that in consequence of the pressing declarations aforesaid the said warren hastings did on his special recommendation appoint in opposition to the wishes and desires of the rajah and his mother another person to the administration of his affairs called jagher deo seo  that the company having sent express orders for the sending the resident by them before appointed to benares the said warren hastings did strongly oppose himself to the same and did throw upon the person appointed by the company francis fowke esquire several strong but unspecified reflections and aspersions contrary to the duty he owed to the company and to the justice he owed to all its servants  that the said resident being appointed by the votes of the rest of the council in obedience to the reiterated orders of the company and in despite of the opposition of the said hastings did proceed to benares and on the representation of the parties and the submission of the accounts of the aforesaid durbege sing to an arbitrator did find him the said durbege sing in debt to the company for a sum not considerable enough to justify the severe treatment of the said durbege sing his wife and son complaining at or about the same time that the balances due to him from the aumils or subcollectors had been received by the new administrator and carried to his own credit in prejudice and wrong to the said durbege sing which representation the only one that has been transmitted on the part of the said sufferers has not been contradicted  that it appears that the said durbege sing did afterwards go to calcutta for the redress of his grievances and that it does not appear that the same were redressed or even his complaints heard but he received two peremptory orders from the supreme council to leave the said city and to return to benares that on his return to benares and being there met by warren hastings aforesaid he the said warren hastings although he had reason to be well assured that the said durbege sing was in possession of small or no substance did again cruelly and inhumanly and without any legal authority order the said durbege sing to be strictly imprisoned and the said durbege sing in consequence of the vexations hardships and oppressions aforesaid died in a short time after insolvent but whether in prison or not does not appear   part v  third revolution in benares  that the said warren hastings having in the manner before recited divested durbege sing of the administration of the province of benares did of his own arbitrary will and pleasure and against the remonstrances of the rajah and his mother in whose name and in whose right the said durbege sing father of the one and husband of the other had administered the affairs of the government appoint a person called jagher deo seo to administer the same  that the new administrator warned by the severe example made of his predecessor is represented by the said warren hastings as having made it his avowed principle as it might be expected it should be that the sum fixed for the revenue must be collected and he did upon the principle aforesaid and by the means suggested by a principle of that sort accordingly levy from the country and did regularly discharge to the british resident at benares by monthly payments the sums imposed by the said warren hastings as it is asserted by the resident fowke but the said warren hastings did assert that his annual collections did not amount to more than lac 3737600 or thereabouts which he says is much short of the revenues of the province and is by about twentyfour thousand pounds short of his agreement  that it further appears that notwithstanding the new administrator aforesaid was appointed two months or thereabouts after the beginning of the fusseli year that is to say about the middle of november 1782 and the former administrator had collected a certain portion of the revenues of that year amounting to 17000l and upwards yet he the said new administrator upon the unjust and destructive principle aforesaid suggested by the cruel and violent proceedings of the said warren hastings towards his predecessor did levy on the province within the said year the whole amount of the revenues to be collected in addition to the sum collected by his predecessor aforesaid  that on account of a great drought which prevailed in the province aforesaid a remission of certain duties in grain was proposed by the chief criminal judge at benares but the administrator aforesaid being fearful that the revenue should fall short in his hands did strenuously oppose himself to the necessary relief to the inhabitants of the said city  that notwithstanding the cantonment of several bodies of the companys troops within the province since the abolition of the native government it became subject in a particular manner to the depredations of the rajahs upon the borders insomuch that in one quarter no fewer than thirty villages had been sacked and burned and the inhabitants reduced to the most extreme distress  that the resident in his letter to the board at calcutta did represent that the collection of the revenue was become very difficult and besides the extreme drought did assign for a cause of that difficulty the following that there is also one fund which in former years was often applied in this country to remedy temporary inconveniences in the revenue and which in the present year does not exist this was the private fortunes of merchants and shroffs bankers resident in benares from whom aumils collectors of credit could obtain temporary loans to satisfy the immediate calls of the rajah these sums which used to circulate between the aumil and the merchant have been turned into a different channel by bills of exchange to defray the expenses of government both on the west coast of india and also at madras to which representation it does not appear that any answer was given or that any mode of redress was adopted in consequence thereof  that the said warren hastings having passed through the province of benares gazipore in his progress towards oude did in a letter dated from the city of lucknow the 2d of april 1784 give to the council board at calcutta an account highly dishonorable to the british government of the effect of the arrangements made by himself in the years 1781 and 1782 in the words following having contrived by making forced stages while the troops of my escort marched at the ordinary rate to make a stay of five days at benares i was thereby furnished with the means of acquiring some knowledge of the state of the province which i am anxious to communicate to you indeed the inquiry which was in a great degree obtruded upon me affected me with very mortifying reflections on my inability to apply it to any useful purpose from the confines of buxar to benares i was followed and fatigued by the clamors of the discontented inhabitants it was what i expected in a degree because it is rare that the exercise of authority should prove satisfactory to all who are the objects of it the distresses which were produced by the longcontinued drought unavoidably tended to heighten the general discontent yet i have reason to fear that the cause existed principally in a defective if not a corrupt and oppressive administration of a multitude of petitions which were presented to me and of which i took minutes every one that did not relate to a personal grievance contained the representation of one and the same species of oppression which is in its nature of an influence most fatal to the future cultivation the practice to which i allude is this it is affirmed that the aumils and renters exact from the proprietors of the actual harvest a large increase in kind on their stipulated rent that is from those who hold their pottah by the tenure of paying one half of the produce of their crops either the whole without subterfuge or a large proportion of it by a false measurement or other pretexts and from those whose engagements are for a fixed rent in money the half or a greater proportion is taken in kind this is in effect a tax upon the industry of the inhabitants since there is scarce a field of grain in the province i might say not one which has not been preserved by the incessant labor of the cultivator by digging wells for their supply or watering them from the wells of masonry with which their country abounds or from the neighboring tanks rivers and nullahs the people who imposed on themselves this voluntary and extraordinary labor and not unattended with expense did it on the expectation of reaping the profits of it and it is certain they would not have done it if they had known that their rulers from whom they were entitled to an indemnification would take from them what they had so hardly earned if the same administration continues and the country shall again labor under a want of rain every field will be abandoned the revenue fail and thousands perish through want of subsistence for who will labor for the sole benefit of others and to make himself the subject of exaction these practices are to be imputed to the naib himself the administrator forced by the said warren hastings on the present rajah of benares the avowed principle on which he acts and which he acknowledged to myself is that the whole sum fixed for the revenue of the province must be collectedand that for this purpose the deficiency arising in places where the crops have failed or which have been left uncultivated must be supplied from the resources of others where the soil has been better suited to the season or the industry of the cultivators hath been more successfully exerted a principle which however specious and plausible it may at first appear certainly tends to the most pernicious and destructive consequences if this declaration of the naib had been made only to myself i might have doubted my construction of it but it was repeated by him to mr anderson who understood it exactly in the same sense in the management of the customs the conduct of the naib or of the officer under him was forced also upon my attention the exorbitant rates exacted by an arbitrary valuation of the goods the practice of exacting duties twice on the same goods first from the seller and afterwards from the buyer and the vexations disputes and delays drawn on the merchants by these oppressions were loudly complained of and some instances of this kind were said to exist at the very time i was at benares under such circumstances we are not to wonder if the merchants of foreign countries are discouraged from resorting to benares and if the commerce of that province should annually decay other evils or imputed evils have accidentally come to my knowledge which i will not now particularize as i hope that with the assistance of the resident they may be in part corrected one evil i must mention because it has been verified by my own observation and is of that kind which reflects an unmerited reproach on our general and national character when i was at buxar the resident at my desire enjoined the naib to appoint creditable people to every town through which our route lay to persuade and encourage the inhabitants to remain in their houses promising to give them guards as i approached and they required it for their protection and that he might perceive how earnest i was for his observation of this precaution i repeated it to him in person and dismissed him that he might precede me for that purpose but to my great disappointment i found every place through which i passed abandoned nor had there been a man left in any of them for their protection i am sorry to add that from buxar to the opposite boundary i have seen nothing but traces of complete devastation in every village whether caused by the followers of the troops which have lately passed for their natural relief and i know not whether my own may not have had their share or from the apprehensions of the inhabitants left to themselves and of themselves deserting their houses i wish to acquit my own countrymen of the blame of these unfavorable appearances and in my own heart i do acquit them for at one encampment a crowd of people came to me complaining that their new aumil collector on the approach of any military detachment himself first fled from the place and the inhabitants having no one to whom they could apply for redress or for the representation of their grievances and being thus remediless fled also so that their houses and effects became a prey to any person who chose to plunder them the general conclusion appeared to me an inevitable consequence from such a state of facts and my own senses bore testimony to it in this specific instance nor do i know how it is possible for any officer commanding a military party how attentive soever he may be to the discipline and forbearance of his people to prevent disorders when there is neither opposition to hinder nor evidence to detect them these and many other irregularities i impute solely to the naib and recommend his instant removal i cannot help remarking that except the city of benares the province is in effect without a government the administration of the province is misconducted and the people oppressed trade discouraged and the revenue in danger of a rapid decline from the violent appropriation of its means  that the said warren hastings did recommend to the council for a remedy of the disorders and calamities which had arisen from his own acts dispositions and appointments that the administrator aforesaid should be instantly removed from his officeattributing the aforesaid irregularities and many others solely to him although on his own representation it does appear that he was the sole cause of the irregularities therein described neither does it appear that the administrator so by the said hastings nominated and removed was properly charged and called to answer for the said recited irregularities or for the many others not recited but attributed solely to him nor has any plea or excuse from him been transmitted to the board or to the court of directors but he was at the instance of the said hastings deprived of his said office contrary to the principles of natural justice in a violent and arbitrary manner which proceeding combined with the example made of his predecessor must necessarily leave to the person who should succeed to the said office no distinct principle upon which he might act with safety but in comparing the consequences of the two delinquencies charged the failure of the payment of the revenues from whatever cause it may arise is more likely to be avoided than any severe course towards the inhabitants as the former fault was besides the deprivation of office attended with two imprisonments with a menace of death and an actual death in disgrace poverty and insolvency whereas the latter namely the oppression and thereby the total ruin of the country charged on the second administrator was only followed by loss of officealthough he the said warren hastings did farther assert but with what truth does not appear that the collection of the last administrator had fallen much short of the revenue of the province  that the said warren hastings himself was sensible that the frequent changes by him made would much disorder the management of the revenues and seemed desirous of concealing his intentions concerning the last change until the time of its execution yet it appears by a letter from the british resident dated the 23d of june 1784 that a very strong report prevailed at benares of his the said hastingss intentions of appointing a new naib for the approaching year and that the effect is evident which the prevalence of such an idea amongst the aumils would probably have on the cultivation at this particular time the heavy mofussil kists harvest instalments have now been collected by the aumils the season of tillage is arrived the ryots country farmers must be indulged and even assisted by advances and the aumil must look for his returns in the abundance of the crop the consequence of this early attention to the cultivation the effect is evident which the report of a change in the first officer of the revenue must have on the minds of the aumils by leaving them at an uncertainty of what they have in future to expect and in proportion to the degree of this uncertainty their efforts and expenses in promoting the cultivation will be languid and sparing in compliance with the naibs request i have written to all the aumils encouraging and ordering them to attend to the cultivation of their respective districts but i conceive i should be able to promote this very desirable intention much more effectually if you will honor me with the communication of your intentions on this subject at the same time i cannot help just remarking that if a change is intended the sooner it takes place the more the bad effects i have described will be obviated  that the council having received the proposition for the removal of the administrator aforesaid did also in a letter to him the said hastings condemn the frequent changes by him made in the administration of the collections of benaresbut did consent to such alterations as might be made without encroaching on the rights established by his the said hastingss agreement in the year 1781 and did desire him to transmit to them his plan for a new administration  that the said hastings did transmit a plan which notwithstanding the evils which had happened from the former frequent changes he did propose as a temporary expedient for the administration of the revenues of the said provincein which no provision was made for the reduction or remission of revenue as exigences might require or for the extraction of the circulating specie from the said province or for the supply of the necessary advances for cultivation nor for the removal or prevention of any of the grievances by him before complained of other than an inspection by the resident and the chief criminal magistrate of benares and other regulations equally void of effect and authorityand which plan mr stables one of the supreme council did altogether reject but the same was approved of as a temporary expedient with some exceptions by two other members of the board mr wheler and mr macpherson declaring the said warren hastings responsible for the temporary expediency of the same  that the said warren hastings in the plan aforesaid having strongly objected to the appointment of any european collectors that is to say of any european servants of the company being concerned in the same declaring that there had been sufficient experience of the ill effects of their being so employed in the province of bengalby which the said hastings did either in loose and general terms convey a false imputation upon the conduct of the companys servants employed in the collection of the revenues of bengal or he was guilty of a criminal neglect of duty in not bringing to punishment the particular persons whose evil practices had given rise to such a general imputation on british subjects and servants of the company as to render them unfit for service in other places  that the said warren hastings having in the course of three years made three complete revolutions in the state of benares by expelling in the first instance the lawful and rightful governor of the same under whose care and superintendence a large and certain revenue suitable to the abilities of the country and consistent with its prosperity was paid with the greatest punctuality and by afterwards displacing two effective governors or administrators of the province appointed in succession by himself and in consequence of the said appointments and violent and arbitrary removals the said province being left in effect without a government except in one city only and having after all settled no more than a temporary arrangement is guilty of an high crime and misdemeanor in the destruction of the country aforesaid   ivprincesses of oude  i that the reigning nabob of oude commonly called asoph ul dowlah son and successor to sujah ul dowlah by taking into or continuing in his pay certain bodies of regular british troops and by having afterwards admitted the british resident at his court into the management of all his affairs foreign and domestic and particularly into the administration of his finances did gradually become in substance and effect as well as in general repute and estimation a dependant on or vassal of the east india company and was and is so much under the control of the governorgeneral and council of bengal that in the opinion of all the native powers the english name and character is concerned in every act of his government  ii that warren hastings esquire contrary to law and to his duty and in disobedience to the orders of the east india company arrogating to himself the nomination of the resident at the court of oude as his particular agent and representative and rejecting the resident appointed by the company and obtruding upon them a person of his own choice did from that time render himself in a particular manner responsible for the good government of the provinces composing the dominions of the nabob of oude  iii that the provinces aforesaid having been at the time of their first connection with the company in an improved and flourishing condition and yielding a revenue of more than three millions of pounds sterling or thereabouts did soon after that period begin sensibly to decline and the subsidy of the british troops stationed in that province as well as other sums of money due to the company by treaty ran considerably in arrear although the prince of the country during the time these arrears accrued was otherwise in distress and had been obliged to reduce all his establishments  iv that the prince aforesaid or nabob of oude did in humble and submissive terms supplicate the said warren hastings to be relieved from a body of troops whose licentious behavior he complained of and who were stationed in his country without any obligation by treaty to maintain thempleading the failure of harvest and the prevalence of famine in his country a compliance with which request by the said warren hastings was refused in unbecoming offensive and insulting language  v that the said nabob laboring under the aforesaid and other burdens and being continually urged for payment was advised to extort and did extort from his mother and grandmother under the pretext of loans and sometimes without that appearance various great sums of money amounting in the whole to six hundred and thirty thousand pounds sterling or thereabouts alleging in excuse the rigorous demands of the east india company for whose use the said extorted money had been demanded and to which a considerable part of it had been applied  vi that the two female parents of the nabob aforesaid were among the women of the greatest rank family and distinction in asia and were left by the deceased nabob the son of the one and the husband of the other in charge of certain considerable part of his treasures in money and other valuable movables as well as certain landed estates called jaghires in order to the support of their own dignity and the honorable maintenance of his women and a numerous offspring and their dependants the said family amounting in the whole to two thousand persons who were by the said nabob at his death recommended in a particular manner to the care and protection of the said warren hastings  vii that on the demand of the nabob of oude on his parents for the last of the sums which completed the six hundred and thirty thousand pounds aforesaid they the said parents did positively refuse to pay any part of the same to their son for the use of the company until he should agree to certain terms to be stipulated in a regular treaty and among other particulars to secure them in the remainder of their possessions and also on no account or pretence to make any further demands or claims on them and well knowing from whence all his claims and exactions had arisen they demanded that the said treaty or family compact should be guarantied by the governorgeneral and council of bengal and a treaty was accordingly agreed to executed by the nabob and guarantied by john bristow esquire the resident at oude under the authority and with the express consent of the said warren hastings and the councilgeneral and in consequence thereof the sum last required was paid and discharges given to the nabob for all the money which he had borrowed from his own mother and the mother of his father  that the distresses and disorders in the nabobs government and his debt to the company continuing to increase notwithstanding the violent methods before mentioned taken to augment his resources the said warren hastings on the 21st of may and on the 31st july 1781 he and mr wheler being the only remaining members of the councilgeneral and he having the conclusive and casting voice and thereby being in effect the whole council did in the name and under the authority of the board resolve on a journey to the upper provinces in order to a personal interview with the nabob of oude towards the settlement of his distressed affairs and did give to himself a delegation of the powers of the said council in direct violation of the companys orders forbidding such delegation  viii that the said warren hastings having by his appointment met the nabob of oude near a place called chunar and possessing an entire and absolute command over the said prince he did contrary to justice and equity and the security of property as well as to public faith and the sanction of the companys guaranty under the color of a treaty which treaty was conducted secretly without a written document of any part of the proceeding except the pretended treaty itself authorize the said nabob to seize upon and confiscate to his own profit the landed estates called jaghires of his parents kindred and principal nobility only stipulating a pension to the net amount of the rent of the said lands as an equivalent and that equivalent to such only whose lands had been guarantied to them by the company but provided neither in the said pretended treaty nor in any subsequent act the least security for the payment of the said pension to those for whom such pension was ostensibly reserved and for the others not so much as a show of indemnityto the extreme scandal of the british government which valuing itself upon a strict regard to property did expressly authorize if it did not command an attack upon that right unprecedented in the despotic governments of india  ix that the said warren hastings in order to cover the violent and unjust proceedings aforesaid did assert a claim of right in the same nabob to all the possessions of his said mother and grandmother as belonging to him by the mahomedan law and this pretended claim was set up by the said warren hastings after the nabob had by a regular treaty ratified and guarantied by the said hastings as governorgeneral renounced and released all demands on them and this false pretence of a legal demand was taken up and acted upon by the said warren hastings without laying the said question on record before the councilgeneral or giving notice to the persons to be affected thereby to support their rights before any of the principal magistrates and expounders of the mahomedan law or taking publicly the opinions of any person conversant therein  x that in order to give further color to the acts of ill faith and violence aforesaid the said warren hastings did cause to be taken at lucknow and other places before divers persons and particularly before sir elijah impey knight his majestys chiefjustice acting extrajudicially and not within the limits of his jurisdiction several passionate careless irrelevant and irregular affidavits consisting of matter not fit to be deposed on oathof reports conjectures and hearsays some of the persons swearing to the said hearsays having declined to declare from whom they heard the accounts at second hand sworn to the said affidavits in general tending to support the calumnious charge of the said warren hastings namely that the aged women before mentioned had formed or engaged in a plan for the deposition of their son and sovereign and the utter extirpation of the english nation and neither the said charge against persons whose dependence was principally if not wholly on the good faith of this nation and highly affecting the honor property and even lives of women of the highest condition nor the affidavits intended to support the same extrajudicially taken ex parte and without notice by the said sir elijah impey and others were at any time communicated to the parties charged or to any agent for them nor were they called upon to answer nor any explanation demanded of them  xi that the article affecting private property secured by public acts in the said pretended treaty contains nothing more than a general permission given by the said warren hastings for confiscating such jaghires or landed estates with the modifications therein contained as he the nabob may find necessary but does not directly point at or express by name any of the landed possessions of the nabobs mother but soon after the signing of the said pretended treaty that is on the 29th november 1781 it did appear that a principal object thereof was to enable the nabob to seize upon the estates of his female parents aforesaid which had been guarantied to them by the east india company and although in the treaty or pretended treaty aforesaid nothing more is purported than to give a simple permission to the nabob to seize upon and confiscate the estates leaving the execution or nonexecution of the same wholly to his discretion yet it appears by several letters from nathaniel middleton esquire the resident at the court of oude of the 6th 7th and 9th of december 1781 that no such discretion as expressed in the treaty was left or intended to be left with him the said nabob but that the said article ought practically to have a construction of a directly contrary tendency that instead of considering the article as originating from the nabob and containing a power provided in his favor which he did not possess before the confiscation of the jaghires aforesaid was to be considered as a measure originating from the english and to be intended for their benefit and as such that the execution was to be forced upon him and the execution thereof was accordingly forced upon him and the resident middleton on the nabobs refusal to act in contradiction to his sworn engagement guarantied by the east india company and in the undutiful and unnatural manner required did totally supersede his authority in his own dominions considering himself as empowered so to act by the instructions of the said hastings although he had reason to apprehend a general insurrection in consequence thereof and that he found it necessary to remove his family which he did not wish to retain there in case of a rupture with the nabob or the necessity of employing the british forces in the reduction of his aumils and troops and he did accordingly as sovereign issue his own edicts and warrants in defiance of the resistance of the nabob in the manner by him described in the letters aforesaidin a letter of 6th december 1781 that is to say finding the nabob wavering in his determination about the resumption of the jaghires i this day in presence of and with the ministers concurrence ordered the necessary purwannahs to be written to the several aumils for that purpose and it was my firm resolution to have dispatched them this evening with proper people to see them punctually and implicitly carried into execution but before they were all transcribed i received a message from the nabob who had been informed by the minister of the resolution i had taken entreating that i would withhold the purwannahs until tomorrow morning when he would attend me and afford me satisfaction on this point as the loss of a few hours in the dispatch of the purwannahs appeared of little moment and as it is possible the nabob seeing that the business will at all events be done may make it an act of his own i have consented to indulge him in his request but be the remit of our interview whatever it may nothing shall prevent the orders being issued tomorrow either by him or myself with the concurrence of the ministers your pleasure respecting the begums i have learnt from sir elijah and the measure heretofore proposed will soon follow the resumption of the jaghires from both or indeed from the former alone i have no doubt of the complete liquidation of the companys balance and also in another letter of the 7th december 1781 i had the honor to address you yesterday informing you of the steps i had taken in regard to the resumption of the jaghires this morning the vizier came to me according to his agreement but seemingly without any intention or desire to yield me satisfaction on the subject under discussion for after a great deal of conversation consisting on his part of trifling evasion and puerile excuses for withholding his assent to the measure though at the same time professing the most implicit submission to your wishes i found myself without any other resource than the one of employing that exclusive authority with which i consider your instructions to vest me i therefore declared to the nabob in presence of the minister and mr johnson who i desired might bear witness of the conversation that i construed his rejection of the measure proposed as a breach of his solemn promise to you and an unwillingness to yield that assistance which was evidently in his power towards liquidating his heavy accumulating debt to the company and that i must in consequence determine in my own justification to issue immediately the purwannahs which had only been withheld in the sanguine hope that he would be prevailed upon to make that his own act which nothing but the most urgent necessity could force me to make mine he left me without any reply but afterwards sent for his minister and authorized him to give me hopes that my requisition would be complied with on which i expressed my satisfaction but declared that i could admit of no further delays and unless i received his excellencys formal acquiescence before the evening i should then most assuredly issue my purwannahs which i have accordingly done not having had any assurances from his excellency that could justify a further suspension i shall as soon as possible inform you of the effect of the purwannahs which in many parts i am apprehensive it will be found necessary to enforce with military aid i am not however entirely without hopes that the nabob when he sees the inefficacy of further opposition may alter his conduct and prevent the confusion and disagreeable consequences which would be too likely to result from the prosecution of a measure of such importance without his concurrence his excellency talks of going to fyzabad for the purpose heretofore mentioned in three or four days i wish he may be serious in his intention and you may rest assured i shall spare no pains to keep him to it and further in a letter of the 9th december 1781 i had the honor to address you on the 7th instant informing you of the conversation which had passed between the nabob and me on the subject of resuming the jaghires and the step i had taken in consequence his excellency appeared to be very much hurt and incensed at the measure and loudly complains of the treachery of his ministersfirst in giving you any hopes that such a measure would be adopted and secondly in their promising me their whole support in carrying it through but as i apprehended rather than suffer it to appear that the point had been carried in opposition to his will he at length yielded a nominal acquiescence and has this day issued his own purwannahs to that effectdeclaring however at the same time both to me and his ministers that it is an act of compulsion i hope to be able in a few days in consequence of this measure to transmit you an account of the actual value and produce of the jaghires opposed to the nominal amount at which they stand rated on the books of the circar  xii that the said warren hastings instead of expressing any disapprobation of the proceedings aforesaid in violation of the rights secured by treaty with the mother and grandmother of the reigning prince of oude and not less in violation of the sovereign rights of the nabob himself did by frequent messages stimulate the said middleton to a perseverance in and to a rigorous execution of the sameand in his letter from benares of the 25th december 1781 did express doubts of his firmness and activity and above all of his recollection of his instructions and their importance and that if he could not rely on his own power and the means he possessed for performing those services he would free him the said middleton from the charges and would proceed himself to lucknow and would himself undertake them  xiii that very doubtful credit is to be given to any letters written by the said middleton to the said warren hastings when they answer the purposes which the said warren hastings had evidently in view the said middleton having written to him in the following manner from lucknow 30th december 1781  xiv my dear siri have this day answered your public letter in the form you seem to expect i hope there is nothing in it that may appear to you too pointed if you wish the matter to be otherwise understood than i have taken up and stated it i need not say i shall be ready to conform to whatever you may prescribe and to take upon myself any share of the blame of the hitherto nonperformance of the stipulations made on behalf of the nabob though i do assure you i myself represented to his excellency and the ministers conceiving it to be your desire that the apparent assumption of the reins of his government for in that light he undoubtedly considered it at the first view as specified in the agreement executed by him was not meant to be fully and literally enforced but that it was necessary you should have something to show on your side as the company were deprived of a benefit without a requital and upon the faith of this assurance alone i believe i may safely affirm his excellencys objections to signing the treaty were given up if i have understood the matter wrong or misconceived your design i am truly sorry for it however it is not too late to correct the error and i am ready to undertake and god willing to carry through whatever you may on receipt of my public letter tell me is your final resolve  xv that it appears but on his the said middletons sole authority in a letter from the said middleton dated lucknow 2d december 1781 that the nabob of oude wishing to evade the measure of resuming the jaghires aforesaid did send a message to him purporting that if the measure proposed was intended to procure the payment of the balance due to the company he could better and more expeditiously effect that object by taking from his mother the treasures of his father which he did assert to be in her hands and to which he did claim a right and that it would be sufficient that he the said hastings would hint his opinion upon it without giving a formal sanction to the measure proposed and that whatever his resolution upon the subject should be it would be expedient to keep it secret adding the resumption of the jaghires it is necessary to suspend till i have your answer to this letter  xvi that it does not appear that the said hastings did write any letter in answer to the proposal of the said middleton but he the said hastings did communicate his pleasure thereon to sir elijah impey being then at lucknow for his the said middletons information and it does appear that the seizing of the treasures of the mother of the nabob said to have been proposed as an alternative by the said nabob to prevent the resumption of the jaghires was determined upon and ordered by the said hastingsand that the resumption of the said jaghires for the ransom of which the seizing of the treasures was proposed was also directed not one only but both sides of the alternative being enforced upon the female parents of the nabob aforesaid although both the one and the other had been secured to them by a treaty with the east india company  xviii60 that sir elijah impey knight his majestys chiefjustice at port william did undertake a journey of nine hundred miles from calcutta to lucknow on pretence of health and pleasure but was in reality in the secret of these and other irregular transactions and employed as a channel of confidential communication therein and the said warren hastings by presuming to employ the said chiefjustice a person particularly unfit for an agent in the transaction of affairs primâ facie at least unjust violent and oppressive contrary to public faith and to the sentiments and law of nature and which he the said hastings was sensible could not fail to draw obloquy on himself by his participation did disgrace the kings commission and render odious to the natives of hindostan the justice of the crown of great britain  xix that although the said warren hastings was from the beginning duly informed of the violence offered to the personal inclinations of the nabob and the apparent assumption of the reins of his government for the purposes aforesaid yet more than two years after he did write to his private agent major palmer that is to say in his letter of the 6th of may 1783 that it has been a matter of equal surprise and concern to him to learn from the letters of the resident that the nabob vizier was with difficulty and almost unconquerable reluctance induced to give his consent to the attachment of the treasure deposited by his father under the charge of the begum his mother and to the resumption of her jaghire and the other jaghires of the individuals of his family which pretence of ignorance of the nabobs inclinations is fictitious and groundless but whatever deception he might pretend to be in concerning the original intention of the nabob he was not nor did he pretend to be ignorant of his the nabobs reluctance to proceed in the said measures but did admit his knowledge of the nabobs reluctance to their full execution and yet did justify the same as follows  xx i desire that you will inform him the nabob that in these and the other measures which were either proposed by him or received his concurrence in the agreement passed between us at chunar i neither had nor could have any object but his relief and the strengthening of his connection with the company and that i should not on any other ground have exposed myself to the personal obloquy which they could not fail to draw upon me by my participation in them but left him to regulate by his own discretion and by his own means the economy of his own finances and with much more cause the assertion of his domestic right in these he had no regular claim to my interference nor had i in my public character any claim upon him but for the payment of the debt then due from him to the company although i was under the strongest obligations to require it for the relief of the pressing exigencies of their affairs he will well remember the manner in which at a visit to him in his own tent i declared my acquiescence freely and without hesitation to each proposition which afterwards formed the substance of a written agreement as he severally made them and he can want no other evidence of my motives for so cheerful a consent nor for the requests which i added as the means of fulfilling his purposes in them had he not made these measures his own option i should not have proposed them but having once adopted them and made them the conditions of a formal and sacred agreement i had no longer an option to dispense with them but was bound to the complete performance and execution of them as points of public duty and of national faith for which i was responsible to my king and the company my immediate superiors and this was the reason for my insisting on their performance and execution when i was told that the nabob himself had relaxed from his original purpose and expressed a reluctance to proceed in it  xxi that the said warren hastings does admit that the nabob had originally no regular claim upon him for his interference or he any claim on the nabob which might entitle him to interfere in the nabobs domestic concerns yet in order to justify his so invidious an interference he did in the letter aforesaid give a false account of the said treaty which as before mentioned did nothing more than give a permission to the nabob to resume the jaghires if he should judge the same to be necessary and did therefore leave the right of dispensing with the whole or any part thereof as much in his option after the treaty as it was before the declared intent of the article being only to remove the restraint of the companys guaranty forbidding such resumption but furnishing nothing which could authorize putting that resumption into the hands and power of the company to be enforced at their discretion and with regard to the other part of the spoil made by order of the said hastings and by him in the letter aforesaid stated to be made equally against the will of the nabob namely that which was committed on the personal and movable property of the female parents of the nabob nothing whatsoever in relation to the same is stipulated in the said pretended treaty  xxii that the said hastings in asserting that he was bound to the acts aforesaid by public duty and even by national faith in the very instance in which that national faith was by him grossly violated and in justifying himself by alleging that he was bound to the complete execution by a responsibility to the company which he immediately served and by asserting that these violent and rapacious proceedings subjecting all persons concerned in them to obloquy would be the means of strengthening the connection of the nabob with the british united company of merchants trading to the east indies did disgrace the authority under which he immediately acted and that the said hastings in justifying his obligations to the said acts by a responsibility to the king namely to the king of great britain did endeavor to throw upon his majesty his lawful sovereign whose name and character he was bound to respect and to preserve in estimation with all persons and particularly with the sovereign princes the allies of his government the disgrace and odium of the aforesaid acts in which a sovereign prince was by him the said hastings made an instrument of perfidy wrong and outrage to two mothers and wives of sovereign princes and in which he did exhibit to all asia a country remarkable for the utmost devotion to parental authority the spectacle of a christian governor representing a christian sovereign compelling a son to become the instrument of such violence and extortion against his own mother  that the said warren hastings by repeated messages and injunctions and under menaces of a dreadful responsibility did urge the resident to a completion of this barbarous act and well knowing that such an act would probably be resisted did order him the said resident to use the british troops under his direction for that purpose and did offer the assistance of further forces urging the execution in the following peremptory terms you yourself must be personally present you must not allow any negotiation or forbearance but must prosecute both services until the begums princesses are at the entire mercy of the nabob61  xxiii that in conformity to the said peremptory orders a party of british and other troops with the nabob in the ostensible and the british resident in the real command were drawn towards the city of fyzabad in the castle of which city the mother and grandmother of the nabob had their residence and after expending two days in negotiation the particulars of which do not appear the resident not receiving the satisfaction he looked for the town was first stormed and afterwards the castle and little or no resistance being made and no blood being shed on either side the british troops occupied all the outer inclosure of the palace of one of the princesses and blocked up the other62  xxiv that this violent assault and forcible occupation of their houses and the further extremities they had to apprehend did not prevail on the female parents of the nabob to consent to any submission until the resident sent in unto them a letter from the said warren hastings63 no copy of which appears declaring himself no longer bound by the guaranty and containing such other matter as tended to remove all their hopes which seemed to be centred in british faith  xxv that the chief officers of their household who were their treasurers and confidential agents the eunuchs jewar ali khân and behar ali khân persons of great eminence rank and distinction who had been in high trust and favor with the late nabob were ignominiously put into confinement under an inferior officer in order to extort the discovery of the treasures and effects committed to their care and fidelity and the said middleton did soon after that is to say on the 12th of january 1782 deliver them over for the same purpose into the custody of captain neal stuart commanding the eighth regiment by his order given in the following words to be kept in close and secure confinement admitting of no intercourse with them excepting by their four menial servants who are authorized to attend them until further orders you will allow them to have any necessary and convenience which may be consistent with a strict guard over them  xxvi that in consequence of these severities upon herself and on those whom she most regarded and trusted the mother of the said nabob did at length consent to the delivering up of her treasures and the same were paid to the resident to the amount of the bond given by the nabob to the company for his balance of the year 177980 and the said treasure was taken from the most secret recesses in the houses of the two eunuchs  xxvii that the nabob continuing still under the pressure of a further pretended debt to the company for his balance of the year 178081 the resident not satisfied with the seizure of the estates and treasures of his parents aforesaid although he the said resident did confess that the princess mother had declared with apparent truth that she had delivered up the whole of the property in her hands excepting goods which from the experience which he the resident had of the small produce of the sales of a former payment made by her in that mode he did refuse and that in his opinion it certainly would have amounted to little or nothing did proceed to extort another great sum of money that is to say the sum of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds sterling on account of the last pretended balance aforesaid in order therefore to compel the said ministers and treasurers either to distress their principals by extorting whatever valuable substance might by any possibility remain concealed or to furnish the said sum from their own estates or from their credit with their friends did order their imprisonment to be aggravated with circumstances of great cruelty giving an order to lieutenant francis rutledge dated 20th january 1782 in the following words  xxviii sirwhen this note is delivered to you by hoolas roy i have to desire that you order the two prisoners to be put in irons keeping them from all food c agreeable to my instructions of yesterday      signed       nathl middleton  xxix that by the said unjust and rigorous proceeding the said eunuchs were compelled to give their engagement for the payment of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds sterling aforesaid to be completed within the period of one month but after they had entered into the said compulsory engagement they were still kept in close imprisonment and the mother and grandmother of the nabob were themselves held under a strict guardalthough at the same time the confiscated estates were actually in the companys possession and found to exceed the amount of what they were rated at in the general list of confiscated estates64 and although the assistant resident johnson did confess that the object of distressing the bhow begum was merely to obtain a readymoney instead of a dilatory payment and that this readymoney payment if not paid was recoverable in the course of a few months upon the jaghires in his possession and that therefore it was not worth proceeding to any extremities beyond the one described namely the confinement of the princesses and the imprisonment and fettering of their ministers upon so respectable a family65  xxx that after the surrender of the treasure and the passing the bonds and obligations given as aforesaid the resident having been strictly ordered by the said warren hastings not to make any settlement whatsoever with the said women of high rank the nabob was induced to leave the city of fyzabad without taking leave of his mother or showing her any mark of duty or civility and on the same day the resident left the city aforesaid and after his return to lucknow in order to pacify the said hastings who appeared to resent that the nabob was not urged to greater degrees of rigor than those hitherto used towards his mother he the said resident did in his letter of the 6th february give him an assurance in the following wordsi shall as you direct use my influence to dissuade his excellency from concluding any settlement until i have your further commands  xxxi that the payment of the bond last extorted from the eunuchs was soon after commenced and the grandmother as well as the mother were now compelled to deliver what they declared was the extent of the whole of both their possessions including down to their table utensils which as the resident admitted they had been and were still delivering and that no proof had yet been obtained of their having more  xxxii that bullion jewels and goods to the amount of five hundred thousand pounds and upwards were actually received by the resident for the use of the company before the 23d of february 1782 and there remained on the said extorted bond no more than about twentyfive thousand pounds according to the statement of the eunuchs and not above fifty thousand according to that made by the resident  xxxiii that in this advanced state of the delivery of the extorted treasure the ministers of the women aforesaid of the reigning family did apply to captain leonard jaques under whose custody they were confined to be informed of the deficiency with which they stood charged that they might endeavor with the assistance of their friends to provide for the same and praying that they might through his mediation be freed from the hardships they suffered under their confinement to which application they received an insolent answer from the said richard johnson dated february 27th 1782 declaring that part of what he had received in payment was in jewels and bullion and that more than a month the time fixed for the final payment would elapse before he could dispose of the sameinsisting upon a readymoney payment and assuring them that the day on which their agreement expired he should be indispensably obliged to recommence severities upon them until the last farthing was fully paid and in order to add to their terrors and hardships as well as to find some pretext for the further cruel and inhuman acts intended an apparently groundless and injurious charge was suggested to the imprisoned ministers aforesaid in the following words you may also mention to them that i have reason to suspect that the commotions raised by bulbudder have not been without their suggestion and abetment which if proved upon them in addition to the probable breach of their agreement will make their situation very desperate  xxxiv that on the receipt of the said letter that is on the 2d march the ministers aforesaid did aver that they were not able to obtain cash in lieu of the jewels and other effects but that if the goods were sold and they released from their confinement and permitted as they have before requested to go abroad among their friends they could soon make good the deficiency and they did absolutely deny that they had any hand in the commotions raised by bulbudder or any kind of correspondence with him or his adherents  xxxv that the prisoners aforesaid did shortly after that is to say on the 13th march a third time renew their application to nathaniel middleton esquire the resident and did request that the jewels remaining in his the said residents hands towards the payment of the balance remaining might be valued by four or five eminent merchants mussulmen and hindoos upon oath and that if any balance should afterwards appear they would upon their release get their friends to advance the same and they did again represent the hardship of their imprisonment and pray for relief and did again assert that the imputations thrown upon them by the said richard johnson were false and groundlessthat they had no kind of intercourse either directly or indirectly with the authors of the commotions alluded to and that they did stake their lives upon the smallest proof thereof being brought  xxxvi that instead of their receiving any answer to any of the aforesaid reasonable propositions concerning either the account stated or the crimes imputed to them or any relief from the hardships they suffered he the resident middleton did on the 18th of the said month give to the officer who had supplicated in favor of the said prisoners an order in which he declared himself under the disagreeable necessity of recurring to severities to enforce the said payment and that this is therefore to desire that you immediately cause them to be put in irons and keep them so until i shall arrive at fyzabad to take further measures as may be necessary which order being received at fyzabad the day after it was given the said eunuchs were a second time thrown into irons and it appears that probably in resentment for the humane representations of the said captain jaques the resident did refuse to pay for the fetters and other contingent charges of the imprisonment of the said ministers of the nabobs mother when at the same time very liberal contingent allowances were made to other officers and the said jaques did strongly remonstrate against the same as follows you have also ordered me to put the prisoners in irons this i have done yet as i have no business to purchase fetters or supply them any other way it is but reasonable that you should order me to be reimbursed and why should i add anything more a late commander at this place i am told draws near as many thousands monthly contingencies as my trifling letter for hundreds however if you cannot get my bill paid be so obliging as to return it and give me an opportunity of declaring to the world that i believe i am the first officer in the companys service who has suffered in his property by an independent command  xxxvi that in about two months after the said prisoners had continued in irons in the manner aforesaid the officer on guard in a letter of the 18th may did represent to the resident as follows the prisoners behar and jewar ali khân who seem to be very sickly have requested their irons might be taken off for a few days that they might take medicine and walk about the garden of the place where they are confined now as i am sure they will be equally secure without their irons as with them i think it my duty to inform you of this request i desire to know your pleasure concerning it to which letter the said officer did receive a direct refusal dated 22d may 1782 in the following words i am sorry it is not in my power to comply with your proposal of easing the prisoners for a few days of their fetters much as my humanity may be touched by their sufferings i should think it inexpedient to afford them any alleviation while they persist in a breach of their contract with me and indeed no indulgence can be shown them without the authority of the nabob who instead of consenting to moderate the rigors of their situation would be most willing to multiply themendeavoring to join the nabob whom he well knew to be reluctant in the whole proceeding as a party in the cruelties by which through the medium of her servants it was intended to coerce his mother  xxxviii that the said resident in a few days after that is to say on the 1st june 1782 in a letter to major gilpin in command at fyzabad did order the account as by himself stated to be read to the prisoners and without taking any notice of their proposal concerning the valuation of the effects or their denial of the offences imputed to them to demand a positive answer relative to the payment and upon receiving from them a negative or unsatisfactory reply to inform them that all further negotiation being at an end they must prepare for their removal to lucknow where they would be called upon to answer not only their recent breach of faith and solemn engagement but also to atone for other heavy offences the punishment of which as had frequently been signified to them it was in their power to have mitigated by a proper acquittal of themselves in this transaction by which insinuations concerning the pretended offences of the said unhappy persons and the manner by which they were to atone for the same and by their never having been specifically and directly made it doth appear that the said crimes and offences were charged for the purpose of extorting money and not upon principles or for the ends of justice  xxxix that after some ineffectual negotiations to make the prisoners pay the money which it does not appear to have been in their power to pay they were again threatened by the resident in a letter to major gilpin dated 9th june 1782 in the following terms i wish you to explain once more to the prisoners the imprudence and folly of their conduct in forcing me to a measure which must be attended with consequences so very serious to them and that when once they are removed to lucknow it will not be in my power to show them mercy or to stand between them and the vengeance of the nabob advise them to reflect seriously upon the unhappy situation in which they will be involved in one case and the relief it will be in my power to procure them in the other and let them make their option  xl that he the said resident did also at the same time receive a letter from the princess mother which letter does not appear but to which only the following insolent return was madethat is to say the letter from the bhow begum is no ways satisfactory and i cannot think of returning an answer to it indeed all correspondence between the begum and me has long been stopped and i request you will be pleased to inform her that i by no means wish to resume it or to maintain any friendly intercourse with her until she has made good my claim upon her for the balance due  xli that in consequence of these threats and to prevent a separation of the ministers from their mistresses several plans for the payment of the balance were offered both by the mother of the nabob and the prisoners to which no other objection appears to have been made than the length of time required by the parties to discharge the comparatively small remainder of the extorted bond the officer on command declaring that conformable to his instructions he could not receive the same66  xlii that the prisoners were actually removed from the city of their residence to the city of lucknow where they arrived on the 24th of june 1782 and were on the next day threatened with severities to make them discover where the balance might be procurable and on the 28th it should seem that the severities for the purpose aforesaid were inflicted at least upon one of them for the assistant resident johnson did on that day write to captain waugh the officer commanding the guard the letter following full of disgrace to the honor justice and humanity of the british nation  xliii sirthe nabob having determined to inflict corporal punishment upon the prisoners under your guard this is to desire that his officers when they shall come may have free access to the prisoners and be permitted to do with them as they shall see proper only taking care that they leave them always under your charge  xliv that the said richard johnson did further to terrify the prisoners and to extort by all ways the remainder of the said unjust oppressive and rapacious demand threaten to remove them out of the nabobs dominions into the castle of churnagur in order forever to separate them from their principals and deprive both of their reciprocal protection and services67and did order a further guard to be put on the palace of the grandmother of the nabob an ally of the company and to prevent the entrance of the provisions to her which order relative to the guard only was executed and did use sundry unworthy and insulting menaces both with regard to herself and to her principal ministers68  xlv that a proposal was soon after made by the said princess and her daughterinlaw praying that their ministers aforesaid should be returned to fyzabad and offering to raise a sum of money on that condition69 as also that they would remove from one of their palaces whilst the english were to be permitted to search the other70 but the assistant resident johnson did instead of a compliance with the former of these propositions send the following orders dated 23d july 1782 to the officer commanding the guard on the ministers aforesaid some violent demands having been made for the release of the prisoners it is necessary that every possible precaution be taken for their security you will therefore be pleased to be very strict in guarding them and i herewith send another pair of fetters to be added to those now upon the prisoners and in answer to the second proposition the said resident did reply in the following terms the proposal of evacuating one palace that it may be searched and then evacuating the next upon the same principle is apparently fair but it is well known in the first place that such brickedup or otherwise hidden treasure is not to be hit upon in a day without a guide i have therefore informed the nabob of this proposal and if the matter is to be reduced to a search he will go himself with such people as he may possess for information together with the prisoners and when in possession of the ground by punishing the prisoners or by such other means as he may find most effectual to forward a successful search upon the spot he will avail himself of the proposal made by the bhow begum  xlvi that probably from the nabobs known and avowed reluctance to lend himself to the perpetration of the oppressive and iniquitous proceedings of the representative of the british government the scandalous plan aforesaid was not carried into execution and all the rigors practised upon the chief ministers of the ladies aforesaid at lucknow being found ineffectual and the princess mother having declared herself ready to deliver up everything valuable in her possession which behar ali khân one of her confidential ministers aforesaid only could come at the said change of prison was agreed tobut not until the nabobs mother aforesaid had engaged to pay for the said change of prison a sum of ten thousand pounds one half of which was paid on the return of the eunuchs and that she would ransack the zenanah womens apartments for kincobs muslins clothes c c c and that she would even allow a deduction from the annual allowance made to her for her subsistence in lieu of her jaghire71  xlvii that soon after the return of the aforesaid ministers to the place of their imprisonment at fyzabad bonds for the five thousand pounds aforesaid and goods estimated according to the valuation of a merchant appointed to value the same at the sum of forty thousand pounds even allowing them to sell greatly under their value were delivered to the commanding officer at fyzabad and the said commanding officer did promise to the begum to visit lucknow with such proposals as he hoped would secure the small balance of fifteen thousand pounds remaining of the unjust exaction aforesaid72 but the said resident middleton did in his letter of the 17th of the said month positively refuse to listen to any terms before the final discharge of the whole of the demand and did positively forbid the commanding officer to come to lucknow to make the proposal aforesaid in the terms following as it is not possible to listen to any terms from the begums before the final discharge of their conditional agreement for fiftyfive lacs your coming here upon such an agency can only be loss of time in completing the recovery of the balance of 655000 for which your regiment was sent to fyzabad i must therefore desire you will leave no efforts gentle or harsh unattempted to complete this before you move from fyzabad and i am very anxious that this should be as soon as possible as i want to employ your regiment upon other emergent service now suffering by every delay  xlviii that the goods aforesaid were sent to lucknow and disposed of in a manner unknown and the harsh and oppressive measures aforesaid being still continued the begum did about the middle of october 1782 cause to be represented to the said middleton as follows that her situation was truly pitiableher estate sequestered her treasury ransacked her cojahs prisoners and her servants deserting daily from want of subsistence that she had solicited the loan of money to satisfy the demands of the company from every person that she imagined would or could assist her with any but that the opulent would not listen to her adversity she had hoped that the wardrobe sent to lucknow might have sold for at least one half of the companys demands on her but even jewelry and goods she finds from woful experience lose their value the moment it is known they come from her that she had now solicited the loan of cash from almas ali khân and if she failed in that application she had no hopes of ever borrowing a sum equal to the demand73an hope not likely to be realized as the said almas ali was then engaged for a sum of money to be raised for the companys use on the security of their confiscated lands the restoration of which could form the only apparent security for a loan  xlix that this remonstrance produced no effect on the mind of the aforesaid residentwho being about this time removed from his residency did in a letter to his successor mr bristow dated 23d october 1782 in effect recommend a perseverance in the cruel and oppressive restraints aforesaid as a certain means of recovering the remainder of the extorted bond and that the lands with which the princesses aforesaid had been endowed should not be restored to them  l that the said warren hastings was duly apprised of all the material circumstances in the unjust proceedings aforesaid but did nothing to stop the course they were in or to prevent relieve or mitigate the sufferings of the parties affected by them on the contrary he did in his letter of the 25th of january 1782 to the resident middleton declare that the nabob having consented to the resumption of the jaghires held by the begums and to the confiscation of their treasures and thereby involved my own name and the credit of the company in a participation of both measures i have a right to require and insist on the complete execution of them and i look to you for their execution declaring that i shall hold you accountable for it and it appears that he did write to the nabob a letter in the same peremptory manner but the said letter has been suppressed  li that he the said hastings farther did manifest the concern he took in and the encouragement which he gave to the proceedings aforesaid by conferring honors and distinctions upon the ministers of the nabob whom he the nabob did consider as having in the said proceedings disobeyed him and betrayed him and as instruments in the dishonor of his family and the usurpation of his authority that the said ministers did make addresses to the said hastings for that purpose which addresses the said hastings hath suppressed and the resident middleton did with his letter of the 11th of february 1782 transmit the same and did in the said letter acquaint the said hastings that the ministers of the nabob had incurred much odium on account of their participation in his measures and that they were not only considered by the party of the dispossessed jaghiredars and the mother and uncle of the nabob but by the nabob himself as the dependants of the english government which they certainly are and it is by its declared and most obvious support alone that they can maintain the authority and influence which is indispensably necessary and the said middleton did therefore recommend that they should be honored with some testimony of his the said hastingss approbation and favor and he the said warren hastings did send kellauts or robes of honor the most public and distinguished mode of acknowledging merit known in india to the said ministers in testimony of his approbation of their late services  lii that the said hastings did not only give the aforesaid public encouragement to the ministers of the nabob to betray and insult their master and his family in the manner aforesaid but when the said nabob did write several letters to him the said hastings expressive of his dislike of being used as an instrument in the dishonorable acts aforesaid and refusing to be further concerned therein he the said warren hastings did not only suppress and hide the said letters from the view of the court of directors but in his instructions to the resident bristow did attribute them to hyder beg khân minister to the nabob whom in other respects he did before and ever since support against his master and did express himself with great scorn and contempt of the said nabob and with much asperity against the said minister affirming in proud and insolent terms that he had by an abuse of his influence over the nabobhe the nabob himself being as he ever must be in the hands of some person a mere cipher in his the said ministersdared to make him the nabob assume a very unbecoming tone of refusal reproach and resentment in opposition to measures recommended by me and even to acts done by my authority the said hastings in the instruction aforesaid particularizing the resumption of the jaghires and the confiscation of the treasures that had been so long suffered to remain in the hands of his the nabobs mother but the letters of the nabob which in the said instructions he refers to as containing an opposition to the measures recommended by him and which he asserts was conveyed in a very unbecoming tone of refusal reproach and resentment he the said hastings hath criminally withheld from the company contrary to their orders and to his dutyand the more as the said letters must tend to show in what manner the said nabob did feel the indignities offered to his mother and the manner in which the said ministers notwithstanding their known dependence on the english government did express their sense of the part which their sovereign was compelled to act in the said disgraceful measures and in farther instructions to him the said new resident he did declare his approbation of the evil acts aforesaid as well as his resolution of compelling the nabob to those rigorous proceedings against his parent from which he had long shown himself so very averse in the following words the severities which have been increased towards the begums were most justly merited by the advantage which they took of the troubles in which i was personally involved last year to create a rebellion in the nabobs government and to complete the ruin which they thought was impending on ours if it is the nabobs desire to forget and to forgive their past offence i have no objection to his allowing them in pension the nominal amount of their jaghires but if he shall ever offer to restore their jaghires to them or to give them any property in land after the warning which they have given him by the dangerous abuse which they formerly made of his indulgence you must remonstrate in the strongest terms against it you must not permit such an event to take place until this government shall have received information of it and shall have had time to interpose its influence for the prevention of it and the said warren hastings who did in the manner aforesaid positively refuse to admit the nabob to restore to his mother and grandmother any part of their landed estates for their maintenance did well know that the revenues of the said nabob were at that time so far applied to the demands of the company by him the said warren hastings aggravated beyond the whole of what they did produce or were otherwise so far applied to the purposes of several of the servants of the company and others the dependants of him the said hastings that none of the pensions or allowances assigned by the said nabob in lieu of the estates confiscated were paid or were likely to be discharged with that punctuality which was necessary even to the scanty subsistence of the persons to which they were in name and appearance applied for  liii that so early as the 6th march 1782 captain leonard jaques who commanded the forces on duty for the purpose of distressing the several women in the palaces at fyzabad did complain to the resident richard johnson in the following words the women belonging to the khord mohul or lesser palace complain of their being in want of every necessary of life and are at last driven to that desperation that they at night get on the top of the zenanah make a great disturbance and last night not only alarmed the sentinels posted in the garden but threw dirt at them they threaten to throw themselves from the walls of the zenanah and also to break out of it humanity obliges me to acquaint you of this matter and to request to know if you have any directions to give me concerning it i also beg leave to acquaint you i sent for letafit ali khân the cojah who has the charge of them and who informs me it is well groundedthat they have sold everything they had even to the clothes from their backs and now have no means of subsisting  liv that the distresses of the said women grew so urgent on the night of the said 6th of march the day when the letter above recited was written that captain leonard jaques aforesaid did think it necessary to write again on the day following to the british resident in the following words i beg leave to address you again concerning the women in the khord mohul the lesser palace their behavior last night was so furious that there seemed the greatest probability of their proceeding to the uttermost extremities and that they would either throw themselves from the walls or force open the doors of the zenanah i have made every inquiry concerning the cause of their complaints and find from letafit ali khân that they are in a starving condition having sold all their clothes and necessaries and now have not wherewithal to support nature and as my instructions are quite silent on this head i should be glad to know how to proceed in case they were to force the doors of the zenanah as i suspect it will happen should no subsistence be very quickly sent to them  lv that in consequence of these representations it appears that the said resident richard johnson did promise that an application should be made to certain of the servants of the nabob vizier to provide for their subsistence  lvi that captain jaques being relieved from the duty of imprisoning the women of sujah ul dowlah the late sovereign of oude an ally of the company who dwelt in the said lesser palace and major gilpin being appointed to succeed the same malicious design of destroying the said women or the same scandalous neglect of their preservation and subsistence did still continue and major gilpin found it necessary to apply to the new resident bristow in a letter of the 30th of october 1782 as follows  lvii sirlast night about eight oclock the women in the khord mohul lesser palace or zenanah womens apartment under the charge of letafit ali khân assembled on the tops of the buildings crying in a most lamentable manner for foodthat for the last four days they had got but a very scanty allowance and that yesterday they had got none  lviii the melancholy cries of famine are more easily imagined than described and from their representation i fear the nabobs agents for that business are very inattentive i therefore think it requisite to make you acquainted with the circumstance that his excellency the nabob may cause his agents to be more circumspect in their conduct towards these poor unhappy women  lix that although the resident bristol did not then think himself authorized to remove the guard he did apply to the minister of the nabob who did promise some relief to the women of the late nabob confined in the lesser palace but apprehending with reason that the minister aforesaid might not be more ready or active in making the necessary provision for them than on former occasions he did render himself personally responsible to major gilpin for the repayment of any sum equal to one thousand pounds sterling which he might procure for the subsistence of the sufferers but whatever relief was given the amount thereof not appearing the same was soon exhausted and the number of persons to be maintained in the said lesser palace being eight hundred women the women of the late sovereign sujah ul dowlah and several of the younger children of the said sovereign prince besides their attendants major gilpin was obliged on the 15th of november following again to address the resident by a representation of this tenor  sirthe repeated cries of the women in the khord mohul zenanah for subsistence have been truly melancholy  lx they beg most piteously for liberty that they may earn their daily bread by laborious servitude or to be relieved from their misery by immediate death  lxi in consequence of their unhappy situation i have this day taken the liberty of drawing on you in favor of ramnarain at ten days sight for twenty son kerah rupees ten thousand of which i have paid to cojah letafit ali khân under whose charge that zenanah is  lxii that notwithstanding all the promises and reiterated engagements of the minister hyder beg khân the ladies of the palace aforesaid fell again into extreme distress and the resident did again complain to the said minister who was considered to be and really and substantially was the minister of the governorgeneral warren hastings aforesaid and not of the nabob the said nabob being according to the said hastingss own account a cipher in his the said ministers hands that the funds allowed for their subsistence were not applied to their support but notwithstanding all these repeated complaints and remonstrances and the constant promise of amendment on the part of his the said hastingss minister the supply was not more plentiful or more regular than before  lxiii that the said resident bristow finding by experience the inefficacy of the courses which had been pursued with regard to the mother and grandmother of the reigning prince of oude and having received a report from major gilpin informing him that all which could be done by force had been done and that the only hope which remained for realizing the remainder of the money unjustly exacted as aforesaid lay in more lenient methods74 he the said resident did of his own authority order the removal of the guard from the palaces the troops being long and much wanted for the defence of the frontier and other material servicesand did release the said ministers of the said women of rank who had been confined and put in irons and variously distressed and persecuted as aforerecited for near twelve months75  lxiv that the manner in which the said inhuman acts of rapacity and violence were felt both by the women of high rank concerned and by all the people strongly appears in the joy expressed on their release which took place on the 5th of december 1782 and is stated in two letters of that date from major gilpin to the resident in the words following  lxv i have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2d instant and in consequence immediately enlarged the prisoners behar ali khân and jewar ali khân from their confinement a circumstance that gave the begums and the city of fyzabad in general the greatest satisfaction  lxvi in tears of joy behar and jewar ali khân expressed their sincere acknowledgments to the governorgeneral his excellency the nabob vizier and to you sir for restoring them to that invaluable blessing liberty for which they would ever retain the most grateful remembrance and at their request i transmit you the inclosed letters  lxvii i wish you had been present at the enlargement of the prisoners the quivering lips with the tears of joy stealing down the poor mens cheeks was a scene truly affecting  lxviii if the prayers of these poor men will avail you will at the last trump be translated to the happiest regions in heaven  lxix and the resident bristow knowing how acceptable the said proceeding would be to all the people of oude and the neighboring independent countries did generously and politically though not truly in his letter to the princess mother attribute the said relief given to herself and the release of her ministers to the humanity of the said warren hastings agreeably to whose orders he pretended to act asserting that he the said hastings was the spring from whence she was restored to her dignity and consequence76 and the account of the proceedings aforesaid was regularly transmitted to the said warren hastings on the 30th of december 1782 with the reasons and motives thereto and a copy of the report of the officer concerning the inutility of further force attended with sundry documents concerning the famishing and other treatment of the women and children of the late sovereign but the same appear to have made no proper impression on the mind of the said warren hastings for no answer whatsoever was given to the said letter until the 3d of march 1783 when the said hastings writing in his own character and that of the council did entirely pass by all the circumstances before recited but did give directions for the renewal of measures of the like nature and tendency with those which for several of the last months at least of the said proceeding had been employed with so little advantage to the interest and with so much injury to the reputation of the company his masters in whose name he actedexpressing himself in the said letter of the 3d of march 1783 as follows we desire you will inform us what means have been taken for recovering the balance the pretended balance of the extorted money due from the begums princesses at fyzabad and if necessary you must recommend it to the vizier to enforce the most effectual means for that purpose and the resident did in his answer to the board dated 31st march 1783 on this peremptory order again detail the particulars aforesaid to the said warren hastings referring him to his former correspondence stating the utter impossibility of proceeding further by force and mentioning certain other disgraceful and oppressive circumstances and in particular that the company did not in plundering the mother of the reigning prince of her wearing apparel and beasts of carriage receive a value in the least equal to the loss she suffered the elephants having no buyer but the nabob and the clothes which had last been delivered to middleton at a valuation of thirty thousand pounds were so damaged by ill keeping in warehouses that they could not be sold even for six months credit at much more than about eight thousand pounds by which a loss in a single article was incurred of twentytwo thousand pounds out of the fifty for the recovery of which supposing it had been a just debt such rigorous means had been employed after having actually received upwards of five hundred thousand pounds in value to the company and extorted much more in loss to the suffering individuals and the said bristow being well acquainted with the unmerciful temper of the said hastings in order to leave no means untried to appease him not contented with the letter to the governorgeneral and council did on the same day write another letter to him particularly in which he did urge several arguments the necessity of using of which to the said hastings did reflect great dishonor on this nation and on the christian religion therein professed namely that he had experienced great embarrassment in treating with her the mother of the reigning prince for as the mother of the vizier the people look up to her with respect and any hard measures practised against women of her high rank create discontent and affect our national character and the said resident after condemning very unjustly her conduct added still she is the mother of the prince of the country and the religious prejudices of mussulmen prevail too strongly in their minds to forget her situation  lxx that the said warren hastings did not make any answer to the said letter but the mother of the prince aforesaid as well as the mother of his father being in consequence of his the said hastingss directions incessantly and rudely pressed by their descendant in the name of the company to pay to the last farthing of the demand they did both positively refuse to pay any part of the pretended balances aforesaid until their landed estates were restored to them on the security of which alone they alleged themselves to be in a condition to borrow any money or even to provide for the subsistence of themselves and their numerous dependants and in order to put some end to these differences the vizier did himself about the beginning of august 1783 go to fyzabad and did hold divers conferences with his parents and did consent and engage to restore to them their landed estates aforesaid and did issue an order that they should be restored accordingly but his minister aforesaid having before his eyes the peremptory orders of him the said warren hastings did persuade his master to dishonor himself in breaking his faith and engagement with his mother and the mother of his father by first evading the execution and afterwards totally revoking his said public and solemn act on pretence that he had agreed to the grant from shame being in their presence the presence of his mother and grandmother and that it was unavoidable at the time77the said minister declaring to him that it would be sufficient if he allowed them money for their necessary expenses and that would be doing enough  lxxi that the faith given for the restoration of their landed estates being thus violated and the money for necessary expenses being as ill supplied as before the women and children of the late sovereign father of the reigning prince continued exposed to frequent want of the common necessaries of life78 and being sorely pressed by famine they were compelled to break through all the principles of local decorum and reserve which constitute the dignity of the female sex in that part of the world and after great clamor and violent attempts for one whole day to break the inclosure of the palace and to force their way into the public market in order to move the compassion of the people and to beg their bread they did on the next day actually proceed to the extremity of exposing themselves to public viewan extremity implying the lowest state of disgrace and degradation to avoid which many women in india have laid violent hands upon themselvesand they did proceed to the public marketplace with the starving children of the late sovereign and the brothers and sisters of the reigning prince a minute account of the transaction aforesaid was written to the british resident at lucknow by the person appointed to convey intelligence to him from fyzabad in the following particulars highly disgraceful to the honor justice and humanity of this nation  lxxii the ladies their attendants and servants were still as clamorous as last night letafit the darogah went to them and remonstrated with them on the impropriety of their conduct at the same time assuring them that in a few days all their allowances would be paid and should not that be the case he would advance them ten days subsistence upon condition that they returned to their habitation none of them however consented to his proposals but were still intent upon making their escape through the bazar marketplace and in consequence formed themselves into a line arranging themselves in the following order the children in the front behind them the ladies of the seraglio and behind them again their attendants but their intentions were frustrated by the opposition which they met from letafits sepoys  lxxiii the next day letafit went twice to the women and used his endeavors to make them return into the zenanah promising to advance them ten thousand rupees which upon the money being paid down they agreed to comply with but night coming on nothing transpired  lxxiv on the day following their clamors were more violent than usual letafit went to confer with them upon the business of yesterday offering the same terms depending upon the fidelity of his promises they consented to return to their apartments which they accordingly did except two or three of the ladies and most of their attendants letafit then went to hossmund ali khân to consult with him upon what means they should take they came to a resolution of driving them in by force and gave orders to their sepoys to beat any one of the women who should attempt to move forward the sepoys consequently assembled and each one being provided with a bludgeon they drove them by dint of beating into the zenanah the women seeing the treachery of letafit proceeded to throw stones and bricks at the sepoys and again attempted to get out but finding that impossible from the gates being shut they kept up a continual discharge of stones and bricks till about ten when finding their situation desperate they retired into the kung mohul and forced their way from thence into the palace and dispersed themselves about the house and garden after this they were desirous of getting into the begums apartment but she being apprised of their intention ordered her doors to be shut in the mean time letafit and hossmund ali khân posted sentries to secure the gates of the lesser mohul during the whole of this conflict all the ladies and women remained exposed to the view of the sepoys the begum then sent for letafit and hossmund ali khân whom she severely reprimanded and insisted upon knowing the causes of this infamous behavior they pleaded in their defence the impossibility of helping it as the treatment the women had met with had been conformable to his excellency the viziers orders the begum alleged that even admitting that the nabob had given those orders they were by no means authorized in this manner to disgrace the family of sujah dowlah and should they not receive their allowance for a day or two it could be of no great moment what was passed was now at an end but that the vizier should certainly be acquainted with the whole of the affair and that whatever he desired she should implicitly comply with the begum then sent for five of the children who were wounded in the affray of last night and after endeavoring to soothe them she sent again for letafit and hossmund ali khân and in the presence of the children expressed her disapprobation of their conduct and the improbability of asoph ul dowlahs suffering the ladies and children of sujah dowlah to be disgraced by being exposed to the view of the rabble upon which letafit produced the letter from the nabob at the same time representing that he was amenable only to the orders of his excellency and that whatever he ordered it was his duty to obey and that had the ladies thought proper to have retired into their apartments quietly he would not have used the means he had taken to compel them the begum again observed that what had happened was now over she then gave the children four hundred rupees and dismissed them and sent word by jumrud and the other eunuchs that if the ladies would peaceably retire to their apartments letafit would supply them with three or four thousand rupees for their personal expenses and recommended to them not to incur any further disgrace and that if they did not think proper to act agreeable to her directions they would do wrong the ladies followed her advice and about ten at night went back into the zenanah the nest morning the begum waited upon the mother of sujah dowlah and related to her all the circumstances of the disturbances the mother of sujah dowlah returned for answer that after there being no accounts kept of crores of revenues she was not surprised that the family of sujah dowlah in their endeavors to procure a subsistence should be obliged to expose themselves to the meanest of the people after bewailing their misfortunes and shedding many tears the begum took her leave and returned home  that the said affecting narrative being sent with others of the same nature on the 29th of january 1784 to the said warren hastings he did not order any relief in consequence thereof or take any sort of notice whatsoever of the said intelligence  lxxv that the court of directors did express strong doubts of the propriety of seizing the estates aforesaid and did declare to him the said hastings that the only consolation they felt on the occasion is that the amount of those jaghires for which the company were guaranties is to be paid through our resident at the court of the vizier and it very materially concerns the credit of your governor on no account to suffer such payments to be evaded but the said warren hastings did never make the arrangement supposed in the said letter to be actually made nor did he cause the resident to pay them the amount of their jaghires or to make any payment to them  and the said hastings being expressly ordered by the court of directors to restore to them their estates in case the charges made upon them should not be found true he the said hastings did contumaciously and cruelly decline any compliance with the said orders until his journey to lucknow in  when he did as he says conformably to the orders of the court of directors and more to the inclination of the nabob vizier restore to them their jaghires but with the defalcation according to his own account of a large portion of their respective shares pretending without the least probability that the said defalcation was a voluntary concession on their part but what he has left to them for their support or in what proportion to that which he has taken away he has nowhere stated to the court of directors whose faith he has broken and whose orders he has thus eluded whilst he pretended to yield some obedience to them  lxxvi that the said warren hastings having made a malicious loose and illsupported charge backed by certain unsatisfactory affidavits as a ground for his seizing on the jaghires and the treasures of the viziers mother solemnly guarantied to them the court of directors did in their letter of the 14th of february 1783 express themselves as follows concerning that measurewhich the governorgeneral he the said warren hastings in his letter to your board the 23d of january 1782 has declared he strenuously encouraged and supported we hope and trust for the honor of the british nation that the measure appeared fully justified in the eyes of all hindostan the governorgeneral has informed us that it can be well attested that the begums the mother and grandmother of the nabob aforesaid principally excited and supported the late commotions and that they carried their inveteracy to the english nation so far as to aim at our utter extirpation and the court of directors did farther declare as follows that it nowhere appears from the papers at present in our possession that they the mother and grandmother of the nabob of oude excited any commotions previous to the imprisonment of rajah cheyt sing and only armed themselves in consequence of that transaction and as it is probable that such a conduct proceeded from motives of selfdefence under an apprehension that they themselves might likewise be laid under unwarrantable contributions and the said court of directors in giving their orders for the restoration of the jaghires or for the payment of an equivalent through the resident did give this order for the restoration of their estates as aforesaid on condition that it should appear from inquiry that they were not guilty of the practices charged upon them by the said hastings mr stables one of the councilgeneral did in execution of the said conditional order propose an inquiry leading to the ascertainment of the condition and did enter a minute as follows that the court of directors by their letters of the 14th of february 1783 seem not to be satisfied that the disaffection of the begums to this government is sufficiently proved by the evidence before them i therefore think that the late and present resident and commanding officer in the viziers country at the time should be called on to collect what further information they can on this subject in which the honor and dignity of this government is so materially concerned and that such information may be transmitted to the court of directors and he did further propose heads and modes of inquiry suitable to the doubts expressed by the court of directors but the said warren hastings who ought long before on principles of natural justice to have instituted a diligent inquiry in support of his so improbable a charge and was bound even for his own honor as well as for the satisfaction of the court of directors to take a strong part in the said inquiry did set himself in opposition to the same and did carry with him a majority of council against the said inquiry into the justice of the cause or any proposition for the relief of the sufferers asserting that the reasons of the court of directors if transmitted with the orders for the inquiry will prove in effect an order for collecting evidence to the justification and acquittal of the begums and not for the investigation of the truth of the charges which have been preferred against them that mr stables did not propose as in the said hastingss minute is groundlessly supposed that the reasons of the court of directors should be transmitted with the orders for an inquiry but the apprehension of the said warren hastings of the probable result of the inquiry proposed did strongly indicate his sense of his own guilt and the innocence of the parties accused by him and if by his construction mr stabless minute did indicate an inquiry merely for the justification of the parties by him accused which construction the motion did not bear it was no more than what the obvious rules of justice would well support his own proceedings having been ex partehe having employed sir elijah impey to take affidavits against the women of high rank aforesaid not only without any inquiry made on their part but without any communication to them of his practice and proceeding against them and equity did at least require that they with his own knowledge and by the subordinates of his own government should be allowed a public inquiry to acquit themselves of the heavy offences with which they had been by him clandestinely charged  lxxvii that he the said hastings in order to effectually stifle the said inquiry did enter on record a further minute asserting that the said inquiry would be productive of evils greater than any which exist in the consequences which have already taken place and which time has almost obliterated as also the following if i am rightly informed the nabob vizier and the begums are on terms of mutual goodwill it would ill become this government to interpose its influence by any act which might tend to revive their animositiesand a very slight occasion would be sufficient to effect it they will instantly take fire on such a declaration proclaim the judgment of the company in their favor demand a reparation of the acts which they will construe wrongs with such a sentence warranting that construction and either accept the invitation to the proclaimed scandal of the nabob vizier which will not add to the credit of our government or remain in his dominions but not under his authority to add to his vexations and the disorders of the country by continual intrigues and seditions enough already exists to affect his peace and the quiet of his people if we cannot heal let us not inflame the wounds which have been inflictedif the begums think themselves aggrieved to such a degree as to justify them in an appeal to a foreign jurisdiction to appeal to it against a man standing in the relation of son and grandson to them to appeal to the justice of those who have been the abettors and instruments of their imputed wrongs let us at least permit them to be the judges of their own feelings and prefer their complaints before we offer to redress them they will not need to be prompted i hope i shall not depart from the simplicity of official language in saying the majesty of justice ought to be approached with solicitation not descend to provoke or invite it much less to debase itself by the suggestion of wrongs and the promise of redress with the denunciation of punishments before trial and even before accusation  lxxviii that the said warren hastings in attempting to pass an act of indemnity for his own crimes and of oblivion for the sufferings of others supposing the latter almost obliterated by time did not only mock and insult over the sufferings of the allies of the company but did show an indecent contempt of the understandings of the court of directors because his violent attempts on the property and liberty of the mother and grandmother of the ally aforesaid had not their first commencement much above two years before that time and had been continued without abatement or relaxation on his part to the very time of his minute the nabob having by the instigation of his the said hastingss instrument hyder beg khân not two months before the date of the consultation been obliged a second time to break his faith with relation to the estates of his mother in the manner hereinbefore recited and the said hastings did not and could not conceive that the clearing the mother could revive any animosity between her and her son by whom she never had been accused the said hastings was also sensible that the restoration of her landed estates recommended by the court of directors could not produce any ill effect on the mind of the said son as it was with almost unconquerable reluctance he had been persuaded to deprive her of them and at the time of his submitting to become an instrument in this injustice did declare both to the resident and his ministers that it was an act of compulsion  lxxix that the said hastings further by insinuating that the women in question would act amiss in appealing to a foreign jurisdiction against a son and grandson could not forget that he himself being that foreign jurisdiction if any jurisdiction there was did himself direct and order the injuries did himself urge the calumnies and did himself cause to be taken and produced the unsatisfactory evidence by which the women in question had sufferedand that it was against him the said hastings and not against their son that they had reason to appeal but the truth is that the inquiry was moved for by mr stables not on the prayer or appeal of the sufferers but upon the ill impression which the said hastingss own conduct merely and solely on his own state of it and on his own evidence in support of it had made on the court of directors who were his lawful masters and not suitors in his court and his arrogating to himself and his colleagues to be a tribunal and a tribunal not for the purpose of doing justice but of refusing inquiry was an high offence and misdemeanor particularly as the due obedience to the companys orders was eluded on the insolent pretence that the majesty of justice ought to be approached with solicitation and that it would debase itself by the suggestion of wrongs and the promise of redress in a governor whose business it is even of himself and unsolicited not only to promise but to afford redress to all those who should suffer under the power of the company even if their ignorance or want of protection or the imbecility of their sex or the fear of irritating persons in rank and station should prevent them from seeking it by formal solicitation  lxxx that the said warren hastings at the time when he pretended ignorance of all solicitation for justice on the part of the women aforesaid and on that pretence did refuse the inquiry moved by his colleague mr stables had in all probability received from the resident middleton or if he had made the slightest inquiry from the said middleton then at calcutta might immediately receive an account that they did actually solicit the said resident through major gilpin for redress against his the said hastingss calumnious accusation and the false testimony by which it was supported and did send the said complaint to the resident middleton by the said gilpin to be transmitted to him the said hastings and the council so early as the 19th of october 1782 and that she the mother of the nabob did afterwards send the same to the resident bristow asserting their innocence and accompanying the same with the copies of letters the originals of which they asserted were in their hands from the chief witnesses against them hannay and gordon which letters did directly overturn the charges or insinuations in the affidavits made by them and that instead of any accusation of an attempt upon them and their parties by the instigation of the mother of the nabob or by her ministers they the said hannay and gordon did attribute their preservation to them and to their services and did with strong expressions of gratitude both to the mother of the nabob and to her ministers fully acknowledge the same which remonstrance of the mother of the nabob and the letters of the said hannay and gordon are annexed to this charge and the said hastings is highly criminal for not having examined into the facts alleged in the said remonstrance  lxxxi that the violent proceedings of the said warren hastings did tend to impress all the neighboring princes some of whom were allied in blood to the oppressed women of rank aforesaid with an ill opinion of the faith honor and decency of the british nation and accordingly on the journey aforesaid made by the nabob from lucknow to fyzabad in which the said nabob did restore in the manner before mentioned the confiscated estates of his mother and grandmother and did afterwards revoke his said grant it appears that the said journey did cause a general alarm the worst motives obtaining the most easy credit with regard to any future proceeding on account of the foregone acts and excited great indignation among the ruling persons of the adjacent country insomuch that major brown agent to the said warren hastings at the court of the king shah allum at delhi did write a remonstrance therein to mr bristow resident at oude as follows  the evening of the 7th at a conference i had with mirza shaffee khân he introduced a subject respecting the nabob vizier which however it may be disagreeable for you to know and consequently for me to communicate i am under a necessity of laying before you he told me he had received information from lucknow that by the advice of hyder beg khân the vizier had determined to bring his grandmother the widow of sufdar jung from fyzabad to lucknow with a view of getting a further sum of money from her by seizing on her eunuchs digging up the apartments of her house at fyzabad and putting her own person under restraint this he said he knew was not an act of our government but the mere advice of hyder beg khân to which the vizier had been induced to attend he added that the old begum had resolved rather to put herself to death than submit to the disgrace intended to be put upon her that if such a circumstance should happen there is not a man in hindostan who will attribute the act to the vizier nabob of oude but every one will fix the odium on the english who might easily by the influence they so largely exercise in their own concerns there have prevented such unnatural conduct in the vizier he therefore called upon me as the english representative in this quarter to inform you of this that you may prevent a step which will destroy all confidence in the english nation throughout hindostan and excite the bitterest resentment in all those who by blood are connected with the house of sufdar jung he concluded by saying that if the vizier so little regarded his family and personal honor or his natural duty as to wish to disgrace his fathers mother for a sum of money let him plunder her of all she has but let him send her safe up to delhi or agra and poor as i am i will furnish subsistence for her which she shall possess with safety and honor though it cannot be adequate to her rank  this sir is a most exact detail of the conversation as far as related to that affair on the part of mirza shaffee khân on my part i could only say that i imagined the affair was misrepresented and that i should write as he requested let me therefore request that you will enable me to answer in a more effectual manner any further questions on this subject  lxxxii as mirza shaffees grandfather was brother to sufdar jung there can be no doubt of what his declaration means and if this measure of dismissing the old begum should be persisted in i should not from the state of affairs and the character of the amir ul omrah be surprised at some immediate and violent resolution being adopted by him  lxxxiii that mirza shaffee mentioned in this correspondence who has since been murdered was of near kindred to the lady in question grandmother to the nabob was resident in a province immediately adjoining to the province of oude and from proximity of situation and nearness of connection was likely to have any intelligence concerning his female relations from the best authority  lxxxiv that the resident bristow on receiving this letter did apply to the said hyder beg khân for an explanation of the nabobs intentions who denied that the nabob intended more than a visit of duty and ceremony which whatever his dispositions might have been and probably were towards his own mother was not altogether probable as it was well known that he was on very bad terms with the mother of his father and it appears that intentions of a similar nature had been before manifested even with regard to his own mother and therefore obtained the more easy credit concerning the other woman of high rank aforesaid especially as the evil designs of the said hyder beg were abundantly known and that the said hastings upon whom he did wholly depend continued to recommend the most effectual that is the most violent means for the recovery of the small remains of his extorted demand but although it does not appear that the resident did give credit to the said report yet the effect of the same on the minds of the neighboring princes did make it proper and necessary to direct a strict inquiry into the same which was not done and it does not appear that any further inquiry was made into the true motives for this projected journey to fyzabad nor into the proceedings of hyder beg khân although the said warren hastings well knew that all the acts of the nabob and his principal ministers were constantly attributed to him and that it was known that secret agents as well as the companys regular agent were employed by him at lucknow and other places  lxxxv that the said hastings who did on pretence of the majesty of justice refuse to inquire into the charges made upon the female parents of the nabob of oude in justification of the violence offered to them did voluntarily and of his own accord make himself an accuser of the resident middleton for the want of a literal execution of his orders in the plans of extortion and rapine aforesaid the criminal nature spirit and tendency of the said proceedings for the defective execution of which he brought the said charge appearing in the defence or apology made by mr middleton the resident for his temporary and short forbearances  lxxxvi it could not i flatter myself be termed a long or unwarrantable delay two days when the importance of the business and the peculiar embarrassments attending the prosecution of it to its desired end are considered the nabob was son to the begum whom we were to proceed against a son against a mother must at least save appearances in his mode of proceeding the produce of his negotiation was to be received by the company receiving a benefit accompanying the nabob withdrawing their protection were circumstances sufficient to mark the english as the principal movers in this business at a court where no opportunity is lost to throw odium on us so favorable an occasion was not missed to persuade the nabob that we instigated him to dishonor his family for our benefit the impressions made by these suggestions constantly retarded the progress and more than once actually broke off the business which rendered the utmost caution on my part necessary especially as i had no assistance to expect from the ministers who could not openly move in the business in the east it is well known that no man either by himself or his troops can enter the walls of a zenanah scarcely in the case of acting against an open enemy much less of an allyan ally acting against his own mother the outer walls and the begums agents were all that were liable to immediate attack they were dealt with and successfully as the event provedhe had before observed to mr hastings in his correspondence what mr hastings well knew to be true that no farther rigor than that he had exerted could be used against females in that country where force could be employed it was not sparedthat the place of concealment was only known to the chief eunuchs who could not be drawn out of the womens apartments where they had taken refuge and from which if an attempt had been made to storm them they might escape and the secret of the money being known only to them it was necessary to get their persons into his hands which could be obtained by negotiation onlythe resident concluded his defence by declaring his hope that if the main object of his orders was fulfilled he should be no longer held criminal for a deviation from the precise letter of them  lxxxvii that the said warren hastings did enter a reply to this answer in support of his criminal charge continuing to insist that his orders ought to have been literally obeyed although he did not deny that the above difficulties occurred and the above consequences must have been the resultand though the reports of the military officers charged with the execution of his commission confirmed the moral impossibility as well as inutility in point of profit of forcing a son to greater violence and rigor against his mother  lxxxviii that the said hastings after all the acts aforesaid did presume to declare on record in his minute of the 23d september 1788 that whatever may happen of the events which he dreads in the train of affairs now subsisting he shall at least receive this consolation under them that he used his utmost exertions to prevent them and that in the annals of the nations of india which have been subjected to the british dominions he shall not be remembered among their oppressors and speaking of certain alleged indignities offered to the nabob of oude and certain alleged suspicions of his authority with regard to the management of his household he the said hastings did in the said minute endeavor to excite the spirit of the british nation severely animadverting on such offences making use of the following terms if there be a spark of generous virtue in the breasts of any of my countrymen who shall be the readers of this compilation this letter a letter of complaint from the nabob shall stand for an instrument to awaken it to the call of vengeance against so flagitious an abuse of authority and reproach to the british name   from her excellency the bhow begum to mr bristow resident at the viziers court  there is no necessity to write to you by way of information a detail of my sufferings from common report and the intelligence of those who are about you the account of them will have reached your ears i will here relate a part of them  after the death of sujah dowlah most of his ungrateful servants were constantly laboring to gratify their enmity but finding from the firm and sincere friendship which subsisted between me and the english that the accomplishment of their purposes was frustrated they formed the design of occasioning a breach in that alliance to insure their own success i must acquaint you that my son asoph ul dowlah had formerly threatened to seize my jaghire but upon producing the treaty signed by you and showing it to mr middleton he interfered and prevented the impending evil the conspiration now framed an accusation against me of a conduct which i had never conceived even in idea of rendering assistance to rajah cheyt sing the particulars are as follow my son asoph ul dowlah and his ministers with troops and a train of artillery accompanied by mr middleton on the 16th of the month of mohurum arrived at fyzabad and made a demand of a crore of rupees as my inability to pay so vast a sum was manifest i produced the treaty you signed and gave me but to no effect their hearts were determined upon violence i offered my son asoph ul dowlah whose will is dearer to me than all my riches or even life itself whatever money and goods i was possessed of but an amicable adjustment seemed not worth accepting he demanded the delivering up the fort and the recall of the troops that were stationed for the preserving the peace of the city to me tumult and discord appeared unnecessary i gave up these points upon which they seized my head eunuchs jewar ali khân and behar ali khân and sent them to mr middleton after having obliged them to sign a bond for sixty lacs of rupees they were thrown into prison with fetters about their feet and denied food and water i who had never even in my dreams experienced such an oppression gave up all i had to preserve my honor and dignity but this would not satisfy their demands they charged me with a rupee and a half batta upon each mohur and on this account laid claims upon me to the amount of six lacs some thousand rupees and sent major gilpin to exact the payment major gilpin according to orders at first was importunate but being a man of experience and of a benevolent disposition when he was convinced of my want of means he changed his conduct and was willing to apply to the shroffs and bankers to lend me the money but with the loss of my jaghire my credit was sunk i could not raise the sum at last feeling my helpless situation i collected my wardrobe and furniture to the amount of about three lacs of rupees besides fifty thousand rupees which i borrowed from one place or other and sent major gilpin with it to lucknow my sufferings did not terminate here the disturbances of colonel hannay and mr gordon were made a pretence for seizing my jaghire the state of the matter is this when colonel hannay was by mr hastings ordered to march to benares during the troubles of cheyt sing the colonel who had plundered the whole country was incapable of proceeding from the union of thousands of zemindars who had seized this favorable opportunity they harassed mr gordon near junivard juanpore and the zemindars of that place and acberpore opposed his march from thence till he arrived near taunda as the taunda nullah from its overflowing was difficult to cross without a boat mr gordon sent to the phousdar to supply him he replied the boats were all in the river but would according to orders assist him as soon as possible mr gordons situation would not admit of his waiting he forded the nullah upon his elephant and was hospitably entertained and protected by the phousdar for six days in the mean time a letter was received by me from colonel hannay desiring me to escort mr gordon to fyzabad as my friendship for the english was always sincere i readily complied and sent some companies of nejeebs to escort mr gordon and all his effects to fyzabad where having provided for his entertainment i effected his junction with colonel hannay the letters of thanks i received from both these gentlemen upon this occasion are still in my possession copies of which i gave in charge to major gilpin to be delivered to mr middleton that he might forward them to the governorgeneral to be brief those who have loaded me with accusations are now clearly convicted of falsehood but is it not extraordinary notwithstanding the justness of my cause that nobody relieves my misfortunes why did major gilpin return without effect  my prayers have been constantly offered to heaven for your arrival report has announced it for which reason i have taken up the pen and request you will not

that a prince called ahmed khân was of a family amongst the most distinguished in hindostan and of a nation famous through that empire for its valor in acquiring and its policy and prudence in well governing the territories it had acquired called the patans or afghans of which the rohillas were a branch the said ahmed khân had fixed his residence in the city of furruckabad and in the first wars of this nation in india the said ahmed khân attached himself to the company against sujah dowlah then an enemy now a dependant on that company ahmed khân towards the close of his life was dispossessed of a large part of his dominions by the prevalence of the mahratta power but his son a minor succeeded to his pretensions and to the remainder of his dominions the mahrattas were expelled by sujah ul dowlah the late vizier who finding a want of the services of the son and successor of ahmed khân called muzuffer jung did not only guaranty him in the possession of what he then actually held but engaged to restore all the other territories which had been occupied by the mahrattas and this was confirmed by repeated treaties and solemn oaths by the late vizier and by the present but neither the late nor the present vizier fulfilled their engagements or observed their oaths the former having withheld what he had stipulated to restore and the latter not only subjecting him to a tribute instead of restoring him to what his father had unjustly withheld but having made a further invasion by depriving him of fifteen of his districts levying the tribute of the whole on the little that remained and putting the small remains of his territory under a sequestrator or collector appointed by almas ali khân who did grievously afflict and oppress the prince and territory aforesaid  that the hardships of his case being frequently represented to warren hastings esquire he did suggest a doubt whether that little ought to be still subject to tribute indicating that the said tribute might be hard and inequitablebut whatever its justice might have been that from the earliest period of our connection with the present nabob of oude it had invariably continued a part of the funds assigned by his excellency as a provision for the liquidation of the several public demands of this government calcutta upon him and in consequence of the powers the board deemed it expedient to vest in the resident at his court for the collection of the companys assignments a sezauwil a sequestrator has always been stationed to enforce by every means in his power the payment of the tribute and the said tribute was in consequence of this arrangement not paid to the nabob but to the british resident at oude and the same being therefore under the direction and for the sole use of the company and indeed the prince himself wholly dependent the representatives of the said company were responsible for the protection of the prince and for the good government of the country  ii that the said warren hastings did on the 22d of may 1780 represent to the board of calcutta the condition of the said country in the following manner  to the total want of all order regularity or authority in his government the furruckabad government among other obvious causes it may no doubt be owing that the country of furruckabad is become an almost entire waste without cultivation or inhabitants that the capital which but a very short time ago was distinguished as one of the most populous and opulent commercial cities in hindostan at present exhibits nothing but scenes of the most wretched poverty desolation and misery and the nabob himself though in possession of a tract of country which with only common care is notoriously capable of yielding an annual revenue of between thirty and forty lacs three or four hundred thousand pounds with no military establishment to maintain scarcely commanding the means of bare subsistence and the said warren hastings taking into consideration the said state of the country and its prince and that the latter had preferred frequent complaints which complaints the said hastings to that time did not lay before the board as his duty required of the hardships and indignities to which he is subjected by the conduct of the sezauwil sequestrator stationed in the country for the purpose of levying the annual tribute which he is bound by treaty to pay to the subah of oude he the said warren hastings did declare himself extremely desirous as well from motives of common justice as due regard to the rank which that chief holds among the princes of hindostan of affording him relief and he the said warren hastings as the means of the said relief did with the consent of the board order the said native sequestrator to be removed and an english resident a servant of the company to be appointed in his room declaring he understood a local interference to be indispensably necessary for realizing the viziers just demands  iii that the said native sequestrator being withdrawn and a resident appointed no complaint whatever concerning the collection of the revenue or of any indignities offered to the prince of the country or oppression of his subjects by the said resident was made to the superior council at calcutta yet the said warren hastings did nevertheless in a certain paper purporting to be a treaty made at chunar with the nabob of oude on the 19th september 1781 at the request of the said nabob consent to an article therein that no english resident be appointed to furruckabad and that the present be recalled and the said warren hastings knowing that the nabob of oude was illaffected towards the said nabob of furruckabad and that he was already supposed to have oppressed him did justify his conduct on the principles and in the words following that if the nabob muzuffer jung must endure oppression and i dare not at this time propose his total relief it concerns the reputation of our government to remove our participation in it and the said warren hastings making recording and acting upon the first of the said false and inhuman suppositions most scandalous to this nation namely that princes paying money wholly for the use of the company and directly to its agent for the maintenance of british troops by whose force and power the said revenue was in effect collected must of necessity endure oppression and that our government at any time dare not propose their total relief was an high offence and misdemeanor in the said warren hastings and the rather because in the said treaty as well as before and after the said hastings who pretended not to dare to relieve those oppressed by the nabob of oude did assume a complete authority over the said nabob himself and did dare to oppress him  iv that the second principle assumed by the said warren hastings as ground for voluntarily abandoning the protection of those whom he had before undertaken to relieve on the sole strength of his own authority and in full confidence of the lawful foundation thereof and for delivering over the persons so taken into protection under false names and pretended descriptions to known oppression asserting that the reputation of the company was saved by removing this apparent participation when the new as well as the old arrangements were truly and substantially acts of the british government was disingenuous deceitful and used to cover unjustifiable designs since the said warren hastings well knew that all oppressions exercised by the nabob of oude were solely and in this instance particularly upheld by british force and were imputed to this nation and because he himself in not more than three days after the execution of this treaty and in virtue thereof did direct the british resident at oude in orders to which he required his most implicit obedience that the ministers the nabob of oudes ministers are to choose all aumils and collectors of revenue with your concurrence and the dishonor to the company in thus deceitfully concurring in oppression which they were able and were bound to prevent is much aggravated by the said warren hastingss receiving from the person to whose oppression he had delivered the said prince as a private gift or donation to himself and for his own use a sum of money amounting to one hundred thousand pounds and upwards which might give just ground of suspicion that the said gift from the oppressor to the person surrendering the person injured to his mercy might have had some share in the said criminal transaction  v that the said warren hastings did in the paper justifying the said surrender of the prince put by himself under the protection of the east india company assert that it was a fact that the nabob muzuffer jung the nabob of furruckabad is equally urgent with the nabob vizier for the removal of a resident without producing as he ought to have done any document to prove his improbable assertion namely his assertion that the oppressed prince did apply to his known enemy and oppressor the nabob of oude who if he would was not able to relieve him against the will of the english government rather than to that english government which he must have conceived to be more impartial to which he had made his former complaint and which was alone able to relieve him  vi that the said warren hastings in the said writing did further convey an insinuation of an ambiguous but on any construction of a suspicious and dangerous import viz it is a fact that mr shees the residents authority over the territory of furruckabad is in itself as much subversive of that of the lawful rulers as that of the viziers aumil collector ever was and is the more oppressive as the power from whence it is derived is greater the said assertion proceeds upon a supposition of the illegality both of the nabobs and the companys government all consideration of the title to authority being therefore on that supposition put out of the question and the whole turning only upon the exercise of authority the said hastingss suggestion that the oppression of government must be in proportion to its power is the result of a false and dangerous principle and such as it is criminal for any person intrusted with the lives and fortunes of men to entertain much more publicly to profess as a rule of action as the same hath a direct tendency to make the new and powerful government of this kingdom in india dreadful to the natives and odious to the world but if the said warren hastings did mean thereby indirectly to insinuate that oppressions had been actually exercised under the british authority he was bound to inquire into these oppressions and to animadvert on the person guilty of the same if proof thereof could be hadand the more as the authority was given by himself and the person exercising it was by himself also named and the said warren hastings did on another occasion assert that whether they were well or illfounded he never had an opportunity to ascertain but it is not true that the said hastings did or could want such opportunity the fact being that the said warren hastings did never cause any inquiry to be made into any supposed abuses during the said residency but did give a pension of fifteen hundred pounds a year to the said late resident as a compensation to him for an injury received and did afterwards promote the resident as a faithful servant of the company and nothing appears to show him otherwise to a judicial office of high trustthereby taking away all credit from any grounds asserted or insinuated by the said hastings for delivering the said nabob of furruckabad to the hand of a known enemy and oppressor who had already contrary to repeated treaties deprived him of a large part of his territories  vii that on the said warren hastingss representation of the transaction aforesaid to the court of directors they did heavily and justly censure the said warren hastings for the same and did convey their censure to him recommending relief to the suffering prince but without any order for sending a new resident being as it may be supposed prevented from taking that step by the faith of the treaty made at chunar  viii that all the oppressions foreseen by him the said warren hastings when he made the article aforesaid in the treaty of chunar did actually happen for immediately on the removal of the british resident the country of furruckabad was subjected to the discretion of a certain native manager of revenue called almas ali khân who did impoverish and oppress the country and insult the prince and did deprive him of all subsistence from his own estatestaking from him even his gardens and the tombs of his ancestors and the funds for maintaining the same  ix that on complaint of those proceedings the said hastings did of his own authority and without communicating with his council direct the native collector aforesaid to be removed and the territory of furruckabad to be left to the sole management of its natural prince but in a short time the said hastings pretending to receive many complaints purporting that the tribute to the nabob remained wholly unpaid and the agent to the prince of furruckabad at the presidency and afterwards chief manager to the prince aforesaid having as the said warren hastings saith had the insolence to propagate a report that the interference to which his master owed the power he then enjoyed was purchased through him he the said hastings did again but as before without the council withdraw his protection and interference altogether on or about the month of august 1782 and did signify his resolution through the resident middleton to the nabob vizier but the said hastings asserts that the consequence of this his own second dereliction of the prince of furruckabad was an aggravated renewal of the severities exercised against his government and the reappointment of a sezauwil with powers delegated or assumed to the utter extinction of the rights of muzuffer jung and actually depriving him of the means of subsistence and the said hastings did receive on the 16th of february 1783 from the prince aforesaid a bitter complaint of the same to the following tenor  the miseries which have fallen upon my country and the poverty and distress which have been heaped upon me by the reappointment of the sezauwil are such that a relation of them would i am convinced excite the strongest feelings of compassion in your breast but it is impossible to relate them on one side my country ruined and uncultivated to a degree of desolation which exceeds all description on the other my domestic concerns and connections involved in such a state of distress and horror that even the relations the children and the wives of my father are starving in want of daily bread and are on the point of flying voluntary exiles from their country and from each other  but although the said hastings did on the 16th of february receive and admit the justice of the said complaint and did not deny the urgent necessity of redress the said letter containing the following sentence if there should be any delay in your acceptance of this proposal my existence and the existence of my family will become difficult and doubtfuland although he did admit the interference to be the more urgently demanded as the services of the english troops have been added to enforce the authority of the sezauwiland although he admits also that even before that time similar complaints and applications had been madeyet he did withhold the said letter of complaint a minute of which he asserts he had at or about that time prepared for the relief of the sufferer from the board of council and did not so much as propose anything relative to the same for seven months after viz until the 6th of october 1783 the said letter and minute being as he asserts withheld from causes not necessary to mention from presentation by which means the said country and prince did suffer a long continuance of unnecessary hardship from which the said hastings confessed it was his duty to relieve them and that a british resident was necessary at furruckabad from a sense of submission to the implied orders of the court of directors in their letter of 1783 lately received added to the conviction i have long since entertained of the necessity of such an appointment for the preservation of our national credit and the means of rescuing an ancient and respectable family from ruin  and the said warren hastings did at length perform what he thought had long since been necessary and in contradiction to his engagements with the nabob in the treaty of chunar and against his strong remonstrances urging his humiliation from this measure and the faith of the agreement and against his own former declaration that it concerned the reputation of our government to remove our participation in the oppressions which he the said hastings supposed the prince of furruckabad must undergo did once more recommend to the council a british resident at furruckabad and the withdrawing the native sezauwil no course being left to the said hastings to take which was not a violation of some engagement and a contradiction to some principle of justice and policy by him deliberately advanced and entered on record  that mr willes being appointed resident and having arrived at furruckabad on the 25th of february 1784 with instructions to inquire minutely into the state of the country and the ruling family he the said resident willes in obedience thereto did fully explain to him the governorgeneral the said warren hastings he being then out of the companys provinces at lucknow on a delegation which respected this very country as part of the dependencies of oude the situation of the province of furruckabad but the said warren hastings did not take or recommend any measure whatsoever for the relief thereof in consequence of the said representation nor even communicate to the councilgeneral the said representation and it was not until the 28th of june 1783 1785 that is sixteen months from the arrival of the resident at his station that anything was laid before the board relative to the regulation or relief of the distressed country aforesaid and that not from the said warren hastings but from other members of the council which purposed neglect of duty joined to the preceding wilful delay of seven months in proposing the said relief originally caused near two years delay and the said warren hastings is further culpable in not communicating to the council board the order which he had of his own authority and without any powers from them given to the said resident willes and did thereby prevent them from taking such steps as might counteract the ill effects of the said order which order purported that the said willes was not to interfere with the nabob of furruckabads government for the regulation of which he was in effect appointed to the residencydeclaring as follows i rely much on your moderation and good judgment which i hope will enable you to regulate your conduct towards the nabob and his servants in such a manner that without interfering in the executive part of his government you may render him essential service by your council and advice and this restriction the said hastings did impose which totally frustrated the purpose of the residents mission though he well knew and had frequently stated the extreme imbecility and weakness of the said nabob of furruckabad and his subjection to unworthy servants and in the minute of consultation upon which he founded the appointment did state the nabob of furruckabad as a weak and unexperienced young man who had abandoned himself entirely to the discretion of his servants and the restoration of his independence was followed by a total breach of the engagements he had promised to fulfil attended by pointed instances of contumacy and disrespect and in the said minute the said hastings adds as before mentioned his principal servant and manager had propagated a report that the interference namely his the said hastingss interference to which his master owed the power he then enjoyed was purchased by him the principal servant aforesaid yet he the said hastings who had assigned on record the character of the said nabob and the conduct of his servants and the aforesaid report of his principal servant so highly dishonorable to him the said hastings as reasons for taking away the independency of the nabob of furruckabad and the subjecting him to the oppression of the nabob of oudes officer almas ali did again himself establish the pretended independence of the said prince of furruckabad and the real independence of his corrupt and perfidious servants not against the nabob of oude but against a british resident appointed by himself as a character eminently qualified for such a charge for the correction of those evils and for rendering the prince aforesaid an useful ally to the company and restoring his dominions to order and plenty  that the said hastings did not only disable the resident at furruckabad by his said prohibitory letter but did render his very remaining at all in that station perfectly precarious by a subsequent letter rendering him liable to dismission by the vizierthereby changing the tenure of the residents office and changing him from a minister of the company dependent on the governorgeneral and council to a dependant upon an unresponsible powerin this also acting without the council and by his own usurped authority and accordingly the said resident did declare in his letter of the 24th of april 1785 that the situation of the country was more distressful than when he the prince of furruckabad addressed himself for relief in 1783 and that he was sorry to say that his appointment at furruckabad was of no use that though the old tribute could not be paid owing to famine and other causes it was increased by a new imposition making the whole equal the entire gross produce of the revenue that therefore there will not be anything for the subsistence of the nabob and family and the uncles of the said nabob of furruckabad the brethren of the late ahmed khân who had rendered important services to the company and their children in a petition to the resident represented that soon after the succession of muzuffer jung their misery commenced the jaghires lands and estates on which they subsisted were disallowed our distress is great we have neither clothes nor food though we felt hurt at the idea of explaining our situation yet could we have found a mode of conveyance we would have proceeded to calcutta for redress the scarcity of grain this season is an additional misfortune with difficulty we support life from your presence without the provinces we expect relief it is not the custom of the company to deprive the zemindars and jaghiredars of the means of subsistence to your justice we look up  this being the situation of the person and family of the nabob of furruckabad and his nearest relations the state of the country and its capital prevented from all relief by the said warren hastings is described in the following words by the resident willes  almas ali has taken the purgunnah of marara at a very inadequate rent and his aumils have seized many adjacent villages the purgunnahs of cocutmow and souje are constantly plundered by his people the collection of the ghauts near futtyghur has been seized by the viziers cutwal and the zemindars in four purgunnahs are so refractory as to have fortified themselves in their gurries and to refuse all payments of revenue this is the state of the purgunnahs and furruckabad which was once the seat of great opulence and trade is now daily deserted by its inhabitants its walls mouldering away without police without protection exposed to the depredations of a banditti of two or three hundred robbers who night after night enter it for plunder murdering all who oppose them the ruin that has overtaken this country is not to be wondered at when it is considered that there has been no state no stable government for many years there has been the nabob viziers authority his ministers the residents at lucknow the sezauwils the camp authority the nabob muzuffer jungs and that of twenty duans or advisers no authority sufficiently predominant to establish any regulations for the benefit of the country whilst each authority has been exerted as opportunity offered for temporary purposes  such being the present deplorable state of furruckabad and its districts in the ensuing year it will be in vain to look for revenue if some regulations equal to the exigency be not adopted the whole country will be divided between the neighboring powerful aumils the refractory zemindars and banditti of robbers and the patans who might be made useful subjects will fly from the scene of anarchy the crisis appears now come that either some plan of government should be resolved on so as to form faithful subjects on the frontier or the country be given up to its fate and if it be abandoned there can be little doubt but that the mahrattas will gladly seize on a station so favorable to incursions into the viziers dominions will attach to their interests the hindoo zemindars and possess themselves of forts which with little expense being made formidable would give employment perhaps to the whole of our force should it be ever necessary to recover them  that the council at calcutta on the representation aforesaid made by the resident at furruckabad did propose and record a plan for the better government of the said country but did delay the execution of the same until the arrangements made by the said hastings with the nabob vizier should be known but the said hastings as far as in him lay did entirely set aside any plan that could be formed for that purpose upon the basis of a british resident at furruckabad by engaging with the said nabob vizier that no british influence shall be employed within his dominions and he has engaged to that prince not to abandon him to any other mode of relation and he has informed the court of directors that the territories of the nabob of oude will be ruined if residents are sent into them observing that residents never will be sent for any other purposes than those of vengeance and corruption  that the said warren hastings did declare to the court of directors that in his opinion the mode of relief most effectual and most lenient with regard to furruckabad would be to nominate one of the family of the prince to superintend his affairs and to secure the payments but this plan which appears to be most connected with the rights of the ruling family whilst it provides against the imbecility of the natural lord and is free from his objection to a resident is the only one which the said hastings never has executed or even proposed to execute  that the said hastings by the agreements aforesaid has left the company in such an alternative that they can neither relieve the said prince of furruckabad from oppression without a breach of the engagements entered into by him the said hastings with the nabob vizier in the name of the company nor suffer him to remain under the said oppression without violating all faith and all the rules of justice with regard to him and the said hastings hath directly made or authorized no less than six revolutions in less than five years in the aforesaid harassed province by which frequent and rapid changes of government all of them made in contradiction to all his own declared motives and reasons for the several acts successively done and undone in this transaction the distresses of the country and the disorders in its administration have been highly aggravated and in the said irregular proceedings and in the gross and complicated violations of faith with all parties the said hastings is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors   videstruction of the rajah of sahlone  i that the late nabob of oude sujah ul dowlah did on what reasons of policy or pretences of justice is unknown dispossess a certain native person of distinction or eminent rajah residing in the country of sahlone the lineal descendant of the most powerful hindoo family in that part of hindostan of his patrimonial estate and conferred the same or part of the same on his the nabobs mother as a jaghire or estate for the term of her life and the mother of the nabob in order to quiet the country and to satisfy in some measure the principal and other inhabitants did allow and pay a certain pension to the said rajah which pension on the general confiscation of jaghires made at the instigation of the said warren hastings and by the letting the lands so confiscated to farmers at rackrents was discontinued and refused to be paid and the discontinuance of the said pension on account of the personal respect borne to the rajah as connections with him are sought for and thought to confer honor did cause an universal discontent and violent commotions in the district of sahlone and other parts of the province of oude with great consequent effusion of blood and interruption if not total discontinuance to the collection of the revenues in those parts other than as the same was irregularly and with great damage to the country enforced by british troops  ii that mr lumsdaine the officer employed to reduce those disordered parts of the province to submission after several advantages gained over the rajah and his adherents and expelling him from the country did represent the utter impossibility of bringing it to a permanent settlement merely by forcible methods as in any of his the rajahs incursions it would not be necessary to bring even a force with him as the zemindars landed proprietors and freeholders are much attached to the rajah whom they consider as their hereditary prince and never fail to assist him and that his rebellion against government is not looked on as a crime and mr lumsdaine declared it as his clear opinion that the allowing the said rajah a pension suitable to his rank and influence in the country would be the most certain mode of obtaining a permanent peacealleging among other cogent reasons that the expense of the force necessary to be employed to subdue the country might be spared and employed elsewhere and that the people would return to their villages with their cattle and effects and of course government have some security for the revenue whereas at present they have none and
