abroad  in treating this part of the subject i shall do my best to avoid bitterness and harsh judging as far as the duty of a travellerthat of telling the whole truthpermits me it is better for both writer and reader to praise than to dispraise most englishmen know negroes of pure blood as well as coloured persons who at oxford and elsewhere have shown themselves fully equal in intellect and capacity to the white races of europe and america these men afford incontestable proofs that the negro can be civilised and a high responsibility rests upon them as the representatives of possible progress but hitherto the african as will presently appear has not had fair play the petting and pampering process the spirit of mawkish reparation and the coddling and highstrung sentimentality so deleterious to the tone of the colony were errors of english judgment pure and simple we can easily explain them  the sad grey life of england the reflection of her climate has ever welcomed a novelty a fresh excitement society has in turn lionised the marmiton or assistantcook selfstyled an emir of the lebanon the indian rajah at home a munshi or languagemaster and the african princess a slavegirl picked up in the bush it is the same hunger for sensation which makes the mob stare at the giant and the savage the fat lady the living skeleton and the spotted boy  before entering into details it will be necessary to notice the history of the colonyan ofttold tale yet nevertheless some parts will bear repetition footnote the following is its popular chronology   1787 first settlers numbering 460 sailed   1789 town burnt by natives 1790   1791 st georges bay company founded   1792 colonists 1831 from nova scotia   1794 colony plundered by the french   1800 maroons 560 from jamaica added   1808 sá leone ceded to the crown cruits introduced   1827 direct government by the crown  according to père labat the french founded in 1365 petit paris at serrelionne a town defended by the fort of the dieppe and rouen merchants the official date of the discovery is 1480 when pedro de cintra one of the gentlemen of prince henry the navigator visited the place after his employers death ad 1463 in 1607 william finch merchant found the names of divers englishmen inscribed on the rocks especially thos candish or cavendish captain lister and sir francis drake in 1666 the sieur villault de bellefons tells us that the river from cabo ledo or cape sierra leone had several bays of which the fourth now st georges was called baie de france this seems to confirm père labat i have noticed the tasso fort built by the english in 1695 the next account is by mr surveyor smith footnote he is mentioned in the last chapter who says it is not certain when the english became masters of sierra leone which they possessed unmolested until roberts the pirate took it in 1720 between 1785 and 1787 lieutenant john matthews rn resided here and left full particulars concerning the export slavetrade apparently the only business carried on by the british  modern sá leone is the direct outcome of lord chief justice mansfields memorable decision delivered in the case of jas somerset v mr james g stewart his master the claim of slavery never can be supported the power claimed never was in use here or acknowledged by law this took place on june 21 1772 yet in 1882 the gold coast is not wholly free footnote slavery was abolished on the gold coast by royal command on december 7 1874 yet the gold coast times declares that domestic slavery is an institution recognised by the lawcourts of the protectorate  many poor blacks thrust out of doors by their quondam owners flocked to the africans friend granville sharp and company presently a charitable society with a large command of funds and jonas hanway for chairman was formed in london and our people sorely sorrowing for their newlyfound sin proposed a colony founded on philanthropy and free labour in africa sá leone was chosen by the advice of mr smeathman an old resident in 1787 captain thompson agent of the st georges bay company paid 30l to the timni chief naimbana alias king tom for the rocky peninsula extending twenty square miles from the rokel to the ketu river in the same year he took out the first batch of emigrants 460 black freedmen and about 60 whites in the ship nautilus whose history so far resembled that of the mayflower eightyfour perished on the journey and not a few fell victims to the african climate and its intemperance but some 400 survived and built for themselves granville town these settlers formed the first colony  in 1790 the place was attacked by the timni tribe to avenge the insult offered to their king jimmy by the crew of an english vessel who burnt his town the people dispersed and were collected from the bush with some difficulty by mr falconbridge this official was sent out from england early in 1791 and his wife wrote the book in the same year 1791 st georges bay company was incorporated under act 31 geo iii c 55 as the sierra leone company amongst the body of ninetynine proprietors the foremost names are granville sharp william wilberforce william ludlam and sir richard carr glynn they spent 111500l in establishing and developing the settlement during the first ten and a half years of its existence and the directors organised a system of government closely resembling the british constitution under lieutenant clarkson rn  next year the second batch of colonists came upon the stage the negroes who had remained loyal to england and had been settled by the government in nova scotia found the bleak land utterly unsuitable and sent home a delegate to pray that they might be restored to africa the directors obtained free passage in sixteen ships for 100 white men and 1831 negroes led by lieutenant clarkson they landed upon the lioness range in march 1792 after losing sixty of their number  bred upon maize and rice bread and milk the new comers sickened on cassava and groundnuts they had no framehouses and the rains set in early about midmay before they had found shelter the whites were attacked with climatefever which did not respect even the doctors quarrels and insubordination resulted and 800 of the little band were soon carried to the grave then a famine broke out a ship from england freighted with stores provisions and framehouses was driven back by a storm fortyfive acres had been promised to each settlerfamily it was found necessary to diminish the number to four and the denseness of the bush rendered even those four unmanageable disgusted with granville town the new comers transferred themselves to the present site of freetown the northern libreville  the company offered annual premiums to encourage the building of farmhouses stockrearing and growing provisions and exportable produce under dr afzelius afterwards professor at upsal who first studied the natural history of the peninsula they established an experimental garden and model farm an english gardener was also employed to naturalise the large collection of valuable plants from the east and west indies and the south sea islands supplied by kew the nova scotians however like true slaves considered agriculture servile and degrading worka prejudice which as will be seen prevails to this day not only in the colony but throughout the length and breadth of the dark continent  meanwhile war had broken out between england and france causing the frequent detention of vessels and a storeship in the harbour caught fire the precursor of a worse misfortune on a sunday morning 1794 as the unfortunates were looking out for the companys craft the harpy a french manofwar sailed into the roadstead pillaged the church and the apothecarys shop and burnt boats as well as town the assailant then wasted granville sailed up to bance island and finally captured two vessels besides the longexpected harpy having thus left his mark he disappeared after granting at the governors urgent request two or three weeks provision for the whites famine followed with sickness in its train and the neighbouring slavedealers added all they could to the sufferings of the settlement  in the same year zachary macaulay father of lord macaulay became governor for the first time the company also made its earliest effort to open up trade with the interior by a mission and two of their servants penetrated 300 miles inland to timbo capital of that part of puloland a deputation of chiefs presently visited the settlement to propose terms but the futility of the negro settler was a complete obstacle to the development of the internal commerce the main object for which the company was formed yet the colony prospered in 1798 freetown numbered besides public buildings about 300 houses  in 1800 the sierra leone company obtained a charter of justice from the crown authorising the directors to appoint a governor and council and to make laws not repugnant to those of england during the same year the settlers roused to wrath by a small groundrent imposed upon their farms rose in rebellion this movement was put down by introducing a third element of 530 maroons who arrived in october they were untamable coromanti gold coast negroes who boasted that among blacks they were what the english are among whites able to fight and thrash all other tribes they had escaped from their spanish masters when the british conquered jamaica in 1655 they took to the mountains and joined by desperadoes they built sundry scattered settlements footnote in 1738 after regular military operations the maroons of jamaica agreed to act as police and to deliver up runaways in 1795 the trelawny men rebelled and having inflicted a severe loss upon the troops were deported to nova scotia and sá leone introducing these men fostered the illfeeling which in the earlier part of the present century prevented the rival sections from intermarrying many of the disaffected sá leonites left the colony some fled to the wilds and the wild ones of the interior and a few remained loyal  rumours of native invasions began to prevail the governor was loth to believe that king tom would thus injure his own interests until one morning when forty warcanoes carrying armed timnis were descried paddling round the eastern point londoners and nova scotians fled to the fort and next day the timni drum sounded the attack the governor who attempted to parley was wounded but the colonists seeing that life was at stake armed themselves and beat off the assailants when the maroons of granville town completed the rout after this warning a wall with strong watchtowers was built round freetown  notwithstanding all precautions another timni rising took place in 1803 the assailants paddled down in larger numbers from porto loko landed at kissy and assaulted freetown headed by a jumping and drumming witchwoman divided into three storming parties they bravely attacked the gates but they were beaten back without having killed a man the dead savages lay so thick that the governor fearing pestilence ordered the corpses to be cast into the sea  the first law formally abolishing slavery was passed after a twenty years campaign by the energy of messieurs clarkson stephen wilberforce and others on may 23 1806 in 1807 the importation of fresh negroes into the colonies became illegal on march 16 1808 sá leone received a constitution and was made a depôt for released captives this gave rise to the preventive squadron and in due time to a large importation of the slaves it liberated locally called cruits many of these savages were warcaptives others were criminals condemned to death whom the wise chief preferred to sell than to slay with a marvellous obtuseness and want of common sense our government made englishmen by wholesale of these wretches with eligibility to sit on juries to hold office and to exercise all the precious rights of englishmen instead of being apprenticed or bound to labour for some seven years under superintendence and being taught to clear the soil plant and build as in similar cases a white man assuredly would have been they were allowed to loaf lie and cheat through a life equally harmful to themselves and others laws of labour says an african writer footnote sierra leone weekly times july 30 1862 may be out of place date in england but in sierra leone they would have saved an entire population from trusting to the allurements of a petty demoralising trade they would have saved us the sight of decayed villages and a people becoming daily less capable of bearing the laborious toil of agricultural industry to handle the hoe has now become a disgrace and men have lost their manhood by becoming gentlemen i shall presently return to this subject  thus the four colonies which successively peopled sá leone were composed of destitute paupers from england of fugitive nova scotian serviles of outlawed jamaican negroes and of slaveprisoners or criminals from every region of western and inner africa  the first society of philanthropists the sierra leone company failed but not without dignity it had organised a regular government and even coined its own money in the british museum a silver piece like a florin bears on the obverse sierra leone company africa surrounding a lion guardant standing on a mountain the reverse shows between the two numbers 50 and 50 two joined hands representing the union of england and africa and the rim bears halfdollar piece 1791 the year of the creation of the colony the companys intentions were pure its hopes and expectations were lofty and the enthusiasts flattered themselves that they had proved the practicability of civilising africa but debt and native wars ended their career and transferred on january 1 1808 their rights to the crown the members however did not lose courage but at once formed the african institution the parent of the royal geographical society  the government of the crown colony has undergone some slight modifications in 1866 it was made with very little forethought a kind of governmentgeneral the centre of rule for all the west african settlements the unwisdom of this step was presently recognised and sá leone is now under a charter dated december 17 1874 the governorinchief having command over the administration of bathurst gambia similarly farther south lagos now the liverpool of west africa has been bracketed foolishly enough with the gold coast  the liberateds called by the people cruits and officially recaptives soon became an important factor in 1811 they numbered 2500 out of 4500 and between june 1819 and january 1833 they totalled 27167 hands they are now represented by about seventeen chief and two hundred minor tribes a hundred languages according to mr koelle increased to a hundred and fifty by bishop vidal and reduced to sixty by mr griffith are spoken in the streets of freetown a city which in 1860 numbered 17000 and now 22000 souls the inextricably mixed descendants of the liberateds may be a total of 35430 more than half the sum of the original settlement 53862 being mostly criminals and ergo more energetic spirits they have been the most petted and patronised by colonial rule there were governors who attempted to enforce our wise old regulations touching apprenticeship still so much wanted in the merchant navy but disgust recall or death always shortened their term of office naturally enough the cruits were fiercely hated by colonists settlers and maroons mrs melville reports an elderly woman exclaiming well tis only my wonder that we settlers do not rise up in one body and kill and slay kill and slay dem spanish and portuguese sailors were quite right in making slaves i would do de same myself suppose i were in dere place he is only a liberated is a favourite sneer at the new arrivals so in the west indies by a curious irony of fate willyfoss nigger is a term of abuse addressed to a congo or guinea recaptive but here all the tribes are bitterly hostile to one another and all combine against the white man after the fashion of the gold coast they have formed themselves into independent caucuses called companies who set aside funds for their own advancement and for the ruin of their rivals  the most powerful and influential races are twothe aku and the ibo the akus footnote this is a nickname from the national salutation aku ku ku how dye do or egbas of yoruba the region behind lagos the eyeos of the old writers so called from their chief town oyo are known by their long necklaces of tattoo they are termed the jews of western africa they are perfect in their combination and they poison with a remarkable readiness the system of egba clanship is a favourite sometimes an engrossing topic for invective with the local press who characterise this worst species of tradesunion founded upon intimidation and something worse as the aku tyranny and the aku inquisition the national proverb speaks the national sentiment clearly enough okàn kau lè ase ibi ikoko li asi ìmolle bi atoju ìmolle taù ke atoju ibi pella bi aba kû ara enni ni isni ni a man must openly practise the duties of kinship even though he may privately belong to a secret club when he has attended the club he must also attend to the duties of kinship because when he dies his kith and kin are those who bury him  the ibos or eboes of american tales are even more divided still they feel and act upon the principle union is strength this large and savage tribe whose headquarters are at abo about the head of the nigerian delta musters strong at sá leone here they are the swiss of the community the kruboys and further south the kabendamen being the paddies it is popularly said that while the aku will do anything for money the ibo will do anything for revenge both races are astute in the extreme and intelligent enough to work harm unhappily their talents rarely take the other direction in former days they had factionfights the second eastern district witnessed the last serious disturbance in 1834 now they do battle under the shadow of the law aku constables will not unless in extreme cases take up their delinquent countrymen nor will an ebo constable apprehend an ebo thief and so on through all the different tribes says the lady resident of sierra leone if the majority of the jury be akus they will unhesitatingly find the worst of aku criminals innocent and the most innocent of whites ibos or timnis guilty the government has done its best to weld all those races into one and has failed many however are becoming moslems as at lagos and this change may have a happier effect by introducing the civilisation of elislam  trial by jury has proved the reverse of a blessing to most nonenglish lands in africa it is simply a curse the model institution becomes here as in the united states a better machine for tyranny than any tyrant except a free people ever invented the british constitution determines that a man shall be tried by his peers half a dozen of his peers at sá leone may be fullblooded blacks liberated slaves halfreformed fetishworshippers sometimes with a sneaking fondness for shángo the egba god of fire and if not criminals and convicts in their own country at best paupers clad in dishclouts and palmoil the excuse is that a white jury cannot be collected among the forty or fifty eligibles in freetown it is vain to challenge for other negroes will surely take the place of those objected to no one raises the constitutional question are these halfreclaimed savages my peers and if he did justice would sternly reply yes the witnesses will forswear themselves not like our posters for half a crown but gratis because the plaintiff or defendant is a fellowtribesman the judge may be touched with a tarbrush but be he white as milk he must pass judgment according to verdict this state of things recalls to mind the ireland of the early nineteenth century when the judges were prefects armed with a penal code and the jurymen vulgar capricious and factious partisans  surely such a caricature of justice such an outrage upon reason was never contemplated by british law or lawgiver our forefathers never dreamt that the free institutions for which they fought and bled during long centuries would thus be prostituted would be lavished upon every black recaptive be he thief wizard or assassin after living some fourteen days in a black corner of the british empire even the irishman and the german must pass some five years preparing themselves in the united states before they become citizens sensible africans themselves own that the negro race is not fitted without a guiding hand to exercise the privileges of english citizenship a writer of the last century justly says ideas of perfect liberty have too soon been given to this people considering their utter ignorance if one of them were asked why he does not repair his house clear his farm mend his fence or put on better clothes he replies that king no give him work dis time and that he can do no more than burn bush and plant little cassader for yam  but a kind of hysterica passio seems to have mastered the cool common sense of the nationa fury of repentance for the war about the asiento contract for building bristol and liverpool with the flesh and blood of the slave and for the 2130000 negroes supplied to jamaica between 1680 and 1786 like a veteran devotee great britain began atoning for the coquetries of her hot youth while spain and portugal have passed sensible laws for gradual emancipation england with a sublime folly set free by a stroke of the pen at the expense of twenty millions sterling the born and bred slaves of jamaica the result was an orgy for a week a systematic refusal to work and for many years the ruin of the glorious island  if the reader believes i have exaggerated the state of things long prevalent at sá leone he is mistaken and he will presently see a confirmation of these statements in the bad name which the sá leonite bears upon the whole of the western coast yet i repeat the colony is changed for the better physically by a supply of pure water morally by the courage which curbed the black abuse twenty years ago to call a negro nigger was actionable many a 5l has been paid for the indulgence of lèsemajesté against the man and brother and not a few 50l when the case was brought into the civil courts after a rough word the sá leonite would shake his fist at you and trot off exclaiming lawyer rainy or montague lib for town a case of mild assault which in england would be settled by a policemagistrate and a fine of five shillings became at freetown a serious bob niger accompanied by his friends or his company betook himself to some limb of the law possibly a pettifogger certainly a pauper who braved a deadly climate for uncertain lucre his interest was to promote litigation and to fill his pockets by what is called sharp practice after receiving the preliminary fee of 5l to be paid out of the plunder he demanded exemplary damages and the defendant was lightened of all he could afford to pay when the offender was likely to leave the station the modus operandi was as follows the writ of summons was issued the lawyer strongly recommended an apology and a promise to defray costs with the warning that judgment would go by default against the absentee if the defendant prudently stumped up the affair ended if not a capias was taken out and the law ran its course a jury was chosen and i have already told the results  at length these vindictive cases became so numerous and so scandalous that strong measures became necessary governor blackall 186266 was brave enough to issue an order that cases should not be brought into the civil courts unless complainants could prove that they were men of some substance immense indignation was the result yet the measure has proved most beneficial the negro no longer squares up to you in the suburbs and dares the white niggah to strike the black genleman he mostly limits himself to a mild impudence if you ask a welldressed black the way to a house he may still reply i wonder you dar peak me without making compliment the true remedy however is still wanting a court of summary jurisdiction presided over by men of honour and probity footnote wanderings in west africa ii pp 23123  it cannot be said that the sá leonite has suffered from any want of religious teaching or educational activity on the contrary he has had too much of both  after the collapse of portuguese missionary enterprise on the west coast the first attempts to establish wesleyan methodism at sá leone were made in 1796 when dr thomas coke tried and failed the nova scotian colonists in 1792 had already brought amongst them wesleyans baptists and lady huntingdons connexion this school which differs from other methodists only in church government still has a chapel at sá leone thus each sect claims 1792 as the era of its commencement in the colony in 1811 mr warren the first ordained wesleyan missionary reached freetown and died on july 23 1812 he was followed by mrs davies the prima donna of the corps she gathered up her feet as the native saying is on december 15 1815 since that time the place has never lacked an unbroken succession of european missionary deaths  the church missionary society founded in 1799 sent out five years afterwards its first representatives mm renner and hartwig germans supported by english funds in 1816 they devoted themselves steadily to converting the recaptives and many of them together with their wives fell bravely at their posts in twenty years thirtyseven out of seventy died or were invalided the names of wylander and w a b johnson are deservedly remembered nearly half a million sterling was spent at sá leone where the stone church of kissy road was built in 1839 and that of pademba road in 1849 the grants were wisely withdrawn in 1862 at the present moment only 300l is given and the church is reported to be selfsupporting the first bishopric was established in 1852 in 1861 bishop beckles instituted the native church pastorate its constitution is identical with that of the episcopalians whose ecclesiastical functions it has taken over  according to the last censusreturns sá leone contains 18660 episcopalians 17093 wesleyans and methodists of the new connection 2717 lady huntingdonians 388 baptists and 369 catholics these native christians keep the sundays and church festivals with peculiar zest and delight in discordant hymns and preaching of the most ferocious kind the dissenting chapel combines the christy minstrel with messieurs moody and sankey and the wellpeppered palaversauce of home cookery reappears in hotly spiced bitterly pious sermons and experiences in shouts of amen glory and hallelujah and in promiscuous orders to hol de fort right well do i remember while the rival pilots messieurs elliot and johnson were shamelessly perjuring themselves in the policecourt footnote wanderings in west africa i pp 25658 the junior generation on the other side of the building separated by the thinnest of partywalls was refreshing itself with psalms and spiritual songs  we went to hear the psalmody ascending the staircase in the gable opposite the courthouse we passed down the hall and saw through the open door the young idea at its mental drill in the hands of a pedagogue apparently one of the greek anaimosarka who ghastly white and thatched with paganini hair sat at the head of the room the ruling body of the unruly rout down the long length whose whitewashed walls were garnished with inscriptions legal moral and religious all sublime as far as size went were ranged parallel rows of négrillons in the vast costumal variety of a ragged school they stood bolt upright square to the fore in the position of  tention their naked toes disposed at an angle of 60º with fingers close to the seams of their breeches when not breekless heads up and eyes front face and body were motionless as if cast in ebony nothing moved but the saucerlike white eyes and the ivorylined mouths from whose ample lips and gape issued a prodigious volume of sound native assistants in sable skins and yellowish white chokers carrying musicscores and armed with canes sloped through the avenues occasionally halting to frown down some delinquent whose body was not perfectly motionless and whose soul was not wholly fixed upon the development of sacred time and tune i have no doubt that they sang      the sun the moon and all the stars c  precisely in the same spirit as if they had been intoning      peter hill poor soul     flog um wife oh no oh no  and that famous anthropological assertion      eve ate de appel     gib one to daddy adam     and so came misery     upon dis worl   chorus bis  oh sorrow oh sorrow     tribulation     until salvation day  it is a pity that time and toil should be thus wasted the negro child like the hindu is much sharper because more precocious than the european at six years he will become a good penman in fact he promises more than he can perform reaching the age of puberty his capacity for progress suddenly disappears the physical reason being well known and the cute lad becomes a dummer junge mrs melville thus describes her small servantgirl from one of these schools she looks almost nine years old and as far as reading goes she knows nothing more than her alphabet can repeat the prayerbook catechism by rote and one or two hymns utterly ignorant all the while of the import of a single word even in europe education till lately exercised the judgment too little the memory too much consequently there were more learned men than wise men the system is now changing and due attention is paid to the corpus sanum the first requisite for the mens sana the boys at sá leone are kept nine hours in school learning verse by heart practising a vocalisation which cannot be heard without pain and toiling at the english language which some missionaries seem to hold a second revelation far better two or three hours of the three rs and six of the shop or workyard briefly the system should be that of the basle missionary society footnote i deeply regret that wanderings in west africa spoke far less fairly of this establishment than it deserves my better judgment had been warped by the prejudiced accounts of a fellowtraveller which combines abstract teaching with practical instruction in useful handicraft and which thus suggests the belief that work is dignified as it is profitable  the sá leonites from their earliest days were greedy to gain knowledge as the modern greeks and bulgarians but the motive was not exalted their proverb said read book and learn to be rogue as well as white man hence useless fanciful subjects were in voguealgebra as it were before arithmeticand the poor made every sacrifice to give their sons a smattering of latin greek and hebrew the desire of entering the professions naturally affected the standard of education what is still wanted at sá leone is to raise the mass by giving to their teaching a more practical turn which shall cultivate habits of industry economy and selfrespect and encourage handicrafts and agriculture as well as trade  i have already noticed the fourah bay college the church missionary grammarschool opened in 1845 prepares boarders and dayscholars for university education and the curriculum is that of an ordinary english grammarschool the establishment which has already admitted over 1000 boys is now selfsupporting and has an invested surplus with which tutors are sent to england for higher instruction in pædagogia the wesleyan high school for boys opened in 1874 receives youths from neighbouring colonies that for girls originating with mrs godman the wife of a veteran missionary still on the coast was founded in 1879 it was cordially taken up by the natives who subscribed all the funds the founders thought best to adopt the commercial principle but no one as yet has asked for profit and the school shows signs of prosperity and progress the annie walsh memorial school for girls dating from a bequest by the lady whose name it bears is under the management of the church missionary society the catholics are as usual well to the fore the priests keep a large school for boys and the sisters educate young women and girls i have before described the dark novice     under a veil that wimpled was full low    and over all a black stole shee did throw  the masters also make their children learn arabic and english there is a manliness and honesty in the look of the mandenga and the susu never seen in the impudent recaptive the dignity of elislam everywhere displays itself it is the majesty of the monotheist who ignores the degrading doctrine of original sin it is the sublime indifference to life which kazá wa kadar by us meagrely translated fatalism confers upon the votaries of the faith these are not the remarks of a prejudiced sympathiser with elislam many others have noted the palpable superiority of the moslem over the missionary convert and the liberated populace of sá leone  as a rule journalism on the west coast is still in the lowest stage of eatanswillism and the journal is essentially ephemeral the newspapers of twenty years ago are all dead and forgotten such were the african herald a buff organ edited by the late rev mr jones a west indian and its successor the african weekly times the sierra leone gazette succumbed when the wesleyans established 1842 the sierra leone watchman other defuncts are the free press a radical paper representing young sá leone and a fourth the intelligencer which strove to prove what has sometimes been asserted at negro indignationmeetings namely that a white man if he behave himself is as good as a black man cain like the rest of the family was a negro but when rebuked by the creator he turned pale with fear a tint inherited by his descendants the theory is par parenthèse as good as any other the only papers now published are the west african reporter whose proprietor and editor was the late hon mr grant and the watchman a quasicomic sheet  the worst feature of journalism in west africa is that fair play is unknown to it the negroes may thoroughly identify themselves with england claim a share in her greatness and display abundant liployalty yet there is the racial aversion to englishmen in the concrete and to this is added the natural jealousy of seeing strangers monopolise the best appointments the sá leonite openly declares that he and his can rule the land much better and more economically than the sickly foreigner who spends half his servicetime on board the steamers and at home dere goes another white raskel to his grave they will exclaim at the sight of a funeral wish dey all go and leave colony to us and as the reading and paying public is mainly composed of nigers the papers must sooner or later cater for their needs and lose no opportunity of casting obloquy and ridicule upon the authorities and albus in general we can hardly blame them i have shown that the worst and most scandalous display of journalism comes from london  after the church the school and the newspaper the most important civilising institution is the market sá leone is favourably situated for collecting the interior trade and yet seventenths of the revenue is derived from articles passing through the loko and rokel rivers the rest is levied from wines spirits and tobacco and in the form of preposterous harbourdues the export duties are light but the exports do not seem to have increased as rapidly as they should have done during the last twenty years this too despite missions into the interior and the hospitable reception of native chiefs and their messengers there are no assessed or house taxes the revenue and expenditure of the past five years have averaged respectively 63869l and 59283l leaving a surplus of 4586l which might profitably be expended upon roads but the liabilities of the colony early in 1881 still amounted to 50637l being the balance of a debt resulting principally from the harbourworks  the present population of the original settlementincluding british kwiáh quiah an early annexationis 53862 the dependencies isles de los tasso kikonkeh and british sherbro according to the census of 1881 add 6684 a figure which experts would increase by 4000 the total therefore in round numbers would be nearly 65000 at the last census only 163 were resident whites the crews and passengers of ships in port added 108  on the whole the sá leonite cannot be called a success servants in shoals present themselves on board the steamers begging masr to take them down coast in vain the fellow is handier than his southern brother he can mend a wheel make a coffin or cut your hair yet none save the veriest greenhorn will engage him in any capacity as regards civility and respectfulness he is far inferior to the emancipado of cuba or the brazil with a superior development of sass he is often an inveterate thief he has fits of drinking when he becomes mad as a malay he gambles he overdresses himself and he indulges in loveintrigues till he has exhausted his means and then he makes boss pay for all with a terrible love of summonsing and a thorough enjoyment of a lawcourt he enters into the spirit of the thing like an attorneys clerk he soon wearies of the less exciting life in the wilder settlements where orgies and debauchery are not fully developed homesickness seizes him and he deserts his post probably robbing house or till  even a black who has once visited sá leone is considered spoilt for life as if he had spent a year in england hence the eccentric captain phil beaver declared that he would rather carry a rattlesnake than a negro who has been in london i have met with some ugly developments of homeeducation one was a yellow dan lambert the son of a small shopkeeper who was returningdubbed a templarfrom the land of liberty he was not a pleasant companion his face was that of a porker halftranslated he yelped the regular tom coffee laugh and when asked why sá leone had not contributed to the crimean widow fund he uttered the benevolent wish that the damned  and their brats might all starve like their husbands another was a fullblooded negro a petty huckster at the red grave who in his last homeward voyage had met at madeira the dean and deaness of oxbridge the lady resolved to keep up the creditable acquaintanceship so strong is feminine love for the black lion shortly afterwards niger paid his promised visit which he described graphically and sans sense of shamehow he had been met at the station by a tall gentleman in uniform and goldlaced hat how he was invited to enter a carriage and how great was his astonishment when the officer preferred standing in the open air behind to accompanying him inside after this naïve début he showed tact mr dean wished to know if anything could be done towards advancing the interesting guest in his professionnot trade we talk of an english schoolmaster but a mulatto or a negro becomes a professor niger whispered no which ladylike meant a distinct yes he ended by graciously accepting an introduction to a manchester firm and soon relieved it of 16000l  no one who knows the west african coast will assert that the influence of sá leone has been in any way for good all can certify that this colony intended as a model of policy and founded with the object of promoting african improvement has been the greatest obstacle to progress she fought to keep every advantage to herself and she succeeded in securing a monopoly of recaptives who were more wanted elsewhere she became an incubus in 1820 when all british possessions from n lat 20º to s lat 20º were made her dependencies the snake was scotched in 1844 by the gold coast achieving her independence yet sá leone raised herself to a governmentgeneral in 1866 and possibly she will do so again  the sá leonite has ever distinguished himself by kicking down as the phrase is the ladder which raised him no man maltreats his wild brother so much as the socalled civilised negro he never addresses his congener except by you jackass and tells him ten times a day that he considers such trash like the dirt beneath his feet consequently he is hated and despised withal being of the same colour as while assuming such excessive superiority over his former equals no one also is more hopeless about the civilisation of africa than the semicivilised african returning to the home of his fathers he feels how hard has been his struggle to emerge from savagery he acknowledges in his own case a selection of species and he foresees no end to the centuries before there can be a nation equal even to himself yet in england and in books he will cry up the majesty of african kingssee for a specimen bishop crowthers niger diary he will give his fellowcountrymen whom he thoroughly despises a thousand grand gifts of morals and industry i have heard a negro assert with the unblushing effrontery which animates the exeter hall speechifier that at some african den of thieves men leave their money with impunity in the storehouse or on the highway i read the assertion of a mulatto who well knew the contrary a white man who supposes himself respected in africa because he is white is grievously mistaken the aristocracy of colour is a notable and salient fact in africa where the chiefs are lighter hued and better grown than their subjects and the reason is patentthey marry the handsomest women  finally the sá leonite is the horror of europeans on the west coast he has been formally expelled by his neighbours the liberians at lagos and abeokuta he lost no time in returning to his original fetishism which the recaptive apparently can never throw off moreover he became an inveterate slavedealer impudently placing himself under native protection and renegading the flag that saved the crimeserf from lifelong servitude these insolent vagabond loafers were the only men who gave me much trouble in the socalled oil rivers where one of them accused a highly respected scotch missionary of theft finally the gaboon merchants long preferred forfeiting the benefits of the mailsteamers to seeing themselves invaded by a locust tribe whose loveliest view is apparently that which leads out of sá leone  part of this demoralisation arose from the overtenderness of the british government in deference to the philanthropist and the missionary throughout the bights of benin and biafra where the chief stalks about with his fetishman and his executioner there is still some manliness amongst men some modesty amongst women there the offending wife fears beheading and saucy water here she leaves with impunity her husband who rarely abandons the better half consequently the sex has become vicious as in egyptworse than the men bad as these are petty larceny is carried on to such an extent that no improvement is possible as regards property the peninsula contains the most communistic of communities the robbers are expert to a degree they work naked and well greased and they choose early dawn or the nighthour when the tornado is most violent the men fight by biting squeezing and butting with the head like the brazilian capoeira the women have a truly horrible way of putting out of the world an obnoxious lover ask an aku if an ibo is capable of poisoning you he will say emphatically yes put the same question to an ibo touching an aku and he will not reply no  with respect to the relative position of japhet and hamperhaps i should say ham and japhetultraphilanthropy has granted all the aspirations of the ethiopian melodist       wish de legislator would set dis darkie free   oh what a happy place den de darkie world would be       wed have a darkie parliament         an darkie code of law       an darkie judges on de bench         darkie barristers and aw  i own that darkey must be defended and sturdily defended too from the injustice and cruelty of the class he calls poor white trash but the protection should be in reason or it becomes an injustice why for instance did the unwise negrophile propose to protect the jamaica negro against the indian coolie because niger wants it pure ignorance and prejudice of gentlemen who stay at home though physically and mentally weaker than europeans the negro can hold his own as sá leone proves by that combination which enables cattle to resist lions japhet albus is by nature aggressive if not he would not now be dwelling in the tents of shem and the huts of ham he feels towards contrarius albo as the gamecock regards the dunghillfowl displays of this sentiment on the part of the white population must be repressed but this should be done fairly and without passion  i do not for a moment regret our philanthropical move despite its awful waste of life and gold england however can do her duty to africa without cant and humbug and nonsense about the sin and crime of slavery serfdom like cannibalism and polygamy are the steps by which human society rose to its present status to abuse them is ignorantly to kick down the ladder the spirit of christianity may tend to abolish servitude but the letter distinctly admits it and the translators have unfairly rendered slave and bondsman by servant which is absurd england can fight if necessary against a traffic which injures the free man but she might abstain from abusing those who do not share her opinions the antislavery party has hitherto acted rather from sentiment than from reason and mr buckle was right in determining that morality must be ruled by and not rule intellect we have one point in our favour the dies atra between 181020 when a man could not speak what he thought upon the subject of slavery ended as the last slave left the west african coast and yet i doubt whether the day is yet come when we can draw upon the great labourbank of africa and establish that muchwanted institution the black ouvrier libre  there are several classes interested in pitting black man against white man an unscrupulous missionary will for his own ends preach resistance to timehonoured customs and privileges which niger has himself accepted an unworthy lawyer will urge litigation a dishonest judge or policemagistrate will make popularity at the expense of equity and honour a weakminded official will fear the murmurs the complaints and the memorials of those under him and the tomahawking which awaits him from the little army of negrophiles at home but the most dangerous class of all is the mulatto he is everywhere like wealth irritamenta malorum the bar sinister and the fancy that he is despised fill him with ineffable gall and bitterness inferior in physique to his black and in morale to his white parent he seeks strength by making the families of his progenitors fall out had the southern states of america deported all the products of miscegenation instead of keeping them in servitude the patriarchal institution might have lasted to this day instead of being prematurely abolished  my first visit to sá leone showed me the root of all her evils there is hardly a peasant in the peninsula had the colonyborn or older families the kingyard men or recaptives and the creoles or children of liberated africans been apprenticed and compelled to labour the colony would have become a flourishing item of the empire now it is the mere ruin of an emporium and the people born and bred to do nothing cannot prevail upon themselves to work but the improved african has an extra contempt for agriculture and he is good only at destruction rice and cereals indigo and cotton coffee and arrowroot tallownuts and sheabutter squills and jalap oilpalms and cocoas ginger cayenne and groundnuts are to be grown copal and beeswax would form articles of extensive export but the people are satisfied with maize and roots especially the cassava which to sá leone is a curse as great as the potato has proved to ireland petty peddling has ever been and still is the civilised africans forte he willingly condemns himself to spend life between his wretched little booth and his ebenezer to waste the week and keep the sabbath holy by the holloaing of anthems his beau idéal of life is to make wife and children work for feed and clothe him whilst he lies in the shady piazza removing his parasites and enjoying porcine existence his pleasures are to saunter about visiting friends to grin and guffaw to snuff chew and smoke and at times to drink kerringkerry caña or caxaça poisonous rum at a shilling a bottle such is the life of ignoble idleness to which by not enforcing industry we have condemned these sable ticketsofleave  before quitting the african coast i diffidently suggested certain steps towards regenerating our unhappy colony for the encouragement of agriculture i proposed a tax upon small shopkeepers and hucksters who by virtue of sitting behind a few strings of beads or yards of calico call themselves traders and merchants this measure bytheby was attempted in 1879 by governor rowe but the strong opposition compelled him to withdraw it i would have imposed a heavy tax upon all grogshop licenses and would have allowed very few retailshops in the colony policemagistrates appeared to me perfectly capable of settling disputes and of punishing offenders i would have discouraged the litigation which the presence of lawyers and a bench suggests and which causes such heartburn between europeans and africans i would have established a court of summary jurisdiction and never have allowed a black jury to sit upon a white man or vice versâ and in the case of a really deserving negro or mulatto i would rather see him appointed lordlieutenant of ireland than governor or secretary of sá leone  on my last journey i met the hon mr t risely griffith a west indian and colonial secretary at sá leone he kindly read what i had written about the white mans grave and found it somewhat harsh and bitter at the same time he gave me with leave to use his valuable lecture delivered before the royal colonial institute footnote the colonies and india a weekly newspaper london december 17 1881 making allowance for the official couleur de rose and reading between the lines i found that he had stated in parliamentary language what had been told by me in the rude tongue of a traveller the essay he assured me had been well received at sá leone and yet to my knowledge the newspapers of the western coast had proposed to make it the subject of an indignationmeeting  hear what mr griffith has to say upon the crucial questionagriculture the ordinary observer cannot fail to be impressed with the great number of traders and hawkers in the peninsula of sierra leone there are returned 53862 of these traders and hawkers number 10250 or about 19 per cent or including hucksters 23 per cent little good can result to a country as long as onefourth of its people are dependent for their livelihood for what they sell to the remaining threequarters the same tendency to engage in the work of distribution rather than the production of wealth seems to be a general characteristic of the negro race  the real number of artisans or mechanics who have any right to the term is very limited and it is to be regretted that in sierra leone where the people are apt to learn and tolerably quick to apply there is not a greater number of thorough workmen to teach their handicrafts and make them examples for the rising generation a youth who has been two years with a carpenter boatbuilder blacksmith or mason arrogates the name to himself without compunction and frequently whilst he is learning from an indifferent teacher the rudiments of his trade he sets up as a master there is hardly a single trade that can turn out half a dozen men who would be certificated by any european firm for possessing a thorough knowledge of it of all trades in sierra leone and certainly in freetown that of tailoring is the most patronised but this arises from the love of dress which is inherent  the proper cultivation of the soil is and must always be the true foundation of prosperity in any country the shop cannot flourish unless the farm supports it and the friends of the colony regard with anxiety the centralisation of capital at freetown i have been gratified however to notice that the desire to acquire land and cultivate it has lately increased to a very great extent and i regard it as a very hopeful sign for the future the people still want two things capital and scientific agricultural knowledge the native implements are of the rudest kindtheir hoes little more than sufficient to scratch the ground and their only other implement a cutlass to cut down the bush ploughs are unknown and spades very little used wheelbarrows are detested although they are not quite unknown the people would sooner tote the soil in a box on their heads and instances are on record where the negro has toted the wheelbarrow itself wheel handle and all  mr griffith further informs us that the colonial government is desirous of fostering and encouraging agriculture that it proposes to establish or rather to reestablish a model farm that lands have been granted at a trifling sum to mr william grant on condition of his devoting capital and labour to the development of agriculture that mr thomas bright has laid out a coffee and cocoa farm at murray town and that mr samuel lewis a barristeratlaw universally well spoken of is engaged in cultivation with a view of studying the best methods and of influencing his fellowcountrymen in favour of agricultural pursuits major bolton also is working the land seventeen miles down coast and planting cocoanuts chocolate and kolatrees the latter when ten years old are said each to fetch 15l per annum here therefore we have at least a beginning  during the discussion on mr griffiths lecture some hometruths were told by the hon mr grant footnote this eminent african who had gone to england with the view of buying agricultural implements and an icemachine died in london on january 28 1881 his speech therefore was delivered only a week or so before his death much fulsome praise of him followed in the press which seemed completely surprised that a black man could talk common sense a fullblooded negro of the ibo tribe and a member of the sierra leone legislative council he objected to the term white mans grave he bravely and truly told his audience that if the french held possession of sá leone they would have made it a different thing after praising the present governors instructionordinance he spoke these remarkable words  but education from the point i allude to is that practical education which develops the man and makes him what he is not the education which makes him simply the blind imitator of what he is not of course the education as originally introduced into the colony was an experiment and a grand experiment it was they said there are these people and we will educate them as ourselves it was a good idea but it was defective because there is as great a difference between the negro and the white man as there can be he is capable of doing anything that the white man can do but then to get him to do that you must educate him in himself you must bring him out by himself you must not educate him otherwise he must be educated to carry out a proper and distinct course for himself the complaint has been general of the want of success in the education of the negro but it is not his fault the fault is from the defect of his education he fancies by the sort of education which you give him that he must imitate you in everythingact like you dress in broadcloth like you and have his tall black hat like you then you see the result is that he is not himself he confuses himself and when he comes to act within himself as a man he is confused and you find fault that he has not improved as he ought to do but if he is properly educated you will find him of far greater assistance to you than you have any idea of  the remarks on agriculture and on capital were equally apposite and captain cameron remarked that these were the truest words of wisdom about africa that it ever was his lot to hear they will leave a sweet savour in the readers mouth after a somewhat acid chapter  but the ingrained idleness of generations is not so easily cleared away the real cure for sá leone will be an immigration of chinese or of indian coolies that will cheapen labour and enable men of capital to farm on a large scale it may be years before agriculture supplants trade with its light work and ready profits but the supplanting process itself will do good at present sá leone finds it cheaper to import salt from england than to lay out a salina and to make an article of commerce which finds its way into the furthest interior immigration i repeat is the sole panacea for the evils which afflict the lioness range    chapter xiii  from sÁ leone to cape palmas  frowsy old sá leone bestowed on us a parting smile after a roaring tornado at night and its terminal deluge the morning of january 19 broke clear and fine we could easily trace amongst the curious series of volcanic cones the three several sanitary steps on the leicester or lioness hill these are first the hospice of the french jesuits now officers quarters then a long

lazuli above and of sapphire below golden sand green strand of silky bermudagrass and red land showing chiefly in banks and thready paths again we admired the dainty and delicate beauties of the shore about pirate bay and other illnamed sites then bidding adieu to the white mans red grave and steering southwest we gave a wide berth to the redoubted carpenter upon which the waves played to the shoals of st anne and to a multitude of others which line the coast as far as that treacherous false cape and lumpy cape shelling or shilling whose prolongation is the banana group  sherbro fifty

most languages says the right reverend have some term which we translate love but love in english is not equivalent to its representative in kru or in vái therefore by using their words i am expressing their ideas i bring them over to mine by the reverse process  we shipped for grand bassá two citizens a lawyer and an attorney of course one was an honourable footnote even the coast english are always confounding the hon john a son of a peer with the hon mr a official rank and i have seen sundry civilians thus missign themselves as mr h m stanley says footnote coomassie and

the small round horny mocha  i could obtain few details concerning the black devil society which suggests the old knownothings it has been they say somewhat active in flogging strangers especially sá

republic was in a parlous state he mr gardiner the new president refused to swear in the upper house and the lower refused to acknowledge the presidential authority consequently business had been at a standstill for six weeks we were disappointed in our hopes of being accompanied by the honourable professor e w blyden exminister to england and afterwards principal of the college he had travelled with winwood reade and i looked forward to hearing the opinions of an african arabic scholar touching the progress and future of elislam in the dark continent that it advances with giant steps may be proved by these figures between 1861 and 1862 i found at most a dozen moslems at lagos in 1865 the number had risen to 1200 and in 1880 according to my old friend m colonna agent consulaire de france it passes 10000 requiring twentyseven mosques  the latest charts of liberia show no less than twentysix parallelograms stretching inland at various angles with the shore and stated to have been acquired by conquest or purchase between 1822 and 1827 but the natives especially the krumen complain that after allowing the foreigners to dwell amongst them they have been despoiled of their possessions and that once lords of the soil they have sunk to mere serfs hence the frequent wars and chronic bad blood every african traveller knows the meaning of landpurchase in these regions there are two ideas peculiar to the negro brain but apparently inadmissible into european heads the first is the nonalienation of land niger never parts with his ground in perpetuity he has always the mental reservation while selling it to a stranger that the soil and its improvements return to him by right after the death or the departure of the purchaser should the settlers heirs or assignees desire to remain in loco they are expected to pay a fresh gratification the lessor will raise his terms as high as possible but public opinion will oblige him to remain content with a dash or present equivalent to that paid by the original lessee  the second idea is even more repugnant to european feelings in africa a born chattel is a chattel for ever the native phrase is pose man once come up slave he be slave all time there is no such thing as absolute manumission the unsophisticated libertus himself would not dream of claiming it we have on board a whiteheaded negro in an old and threadbare dutch uniform returning from java on a yearly pension of fifteen dollars according to treaty he had been given by the king of ashanti to the hollanders and he had served them so long that he spoke only low german and malay he will be compelled to end his career somewhere within the range of our fortguns or his owners family will claim and carry off their property  at 8 am we steamed

deep trough they are far superior to the boats with weatherboards in the fore which formerly bore us to land the crew scoop up the water as if digging with the paddle they vary the exercise by highly eccentric movements and they sing savage barcarolles the better to keep time  the middle settlement is upper buchanan whose river the st johns owns a bar infamous as that of lagos for surf and sharks the southernmost lower buchanan is defended by a long and broken wall of black reef but the village is far from smooth water all these towns occupy holes in a curtain of the densest and tallest greenery they are composed of groups and scatters of whitewashed houses half of them looking like chapels and the other like toys each has its adjunct of brown huts the native quarter these bassá tribes must not be confounded with their neighbours the krumen the languages are quite different and the latter is of much harsher sound there is no doubt of this being a good place for engaging labour and it is hoped that in due time bassáhands who work well will be engaged for the gold coast mines at present however they avoid english ships call themselves americans and willingly serve on board the yankee craft which load with coffee camwood and palmoil  we steamed along the cape river and town of sinou the very home of the kráo or krumen strictly speaking a small tribe returning homewardbound we here landed a host of men from the oilrivers greatly to my delight as they had cumbered the deck with their leaky powderkegs amid which wandered the sailors smoking unconcernedly in the good old times this would not have been allowed at least one poor fellow was drowned so careful were the relatives to embark the kit so careless of the owners person next day we sighted the garrawaytrees silk cottons some 200 feet high fine marks for clearing the cape shoals then came fishtown and rocktown once celebrated for the exploits of ashmun and his associates and at 215 pm we anchored in the heavy harmatan roll off       the cape of palmas called from palmy shade  a score of years ago the ass steamers lay within half a mile of shore and barrin the ducking it was easy to land but the bay is bossed with rocks and skirted with shoals they lurk treacherously under water and have brought many a tall ship to grief as for the obsolete hydrographic charts they only add to the danger two wrecks give us ample warning one is a german barque lying close to the bar of the fussy little river the other a huge mass of rust is the hapless yoruba years ago after the fashion of the nigritia and the monrovia she was carelessly lost though anchored in a safe place when swinging round she hit upon a rock and was incontinently ripped up the injured compartment filled and the skipper ran her on the beach wrecking her according to act of parliament they once managed to get her off but she had not power to stem the seas and there she still lies high and dry  cape palmas or

head to the continentbody is a long low sandspit and the background sweeps northward in the clear grassy stretches which african travellers agree to call parks these are fronted by screens of tall trees and backed by the blue tops of little hills a combination which strongly reminded me of the gaboon  the prominent building is still the large whitewashed missionhouse with its ample windows and shady piazzas the sons of st benedict could not have placed it better in rear lies the square tower yclept a lighthouse and manipulated like that of monrovia its range is said to be thirteen miles but it rarely shows beyond five an adjacent flagstaff bears above the steamersignal the liberian arms stripes and a lone star not unknown to the ages between assyria and texas the body of the settlement lying upon the river is called harper after a remarkable negro and its suburbs lodge the natives when i last visited it the people were rising to the third stage of their architecture the first or nomad is the hide or mat thrown over a bush or a few standing sticks then comes the cylinder the round hovel of the northern and southern regions with the extinguisher or the ovenshaped thatchroof and lastly the square or oblong form which marks growing civilisation the american missionaries laboured strenuously to build st marks hospital and church the latter a very creditable piece of lumberwork with 500 seats in nave and aisles but now everything hereabouts is down in its luck this puerile copy or rather caricature of the united states can console itself only by saying spero meliora

only place of refuge is a mean boardinghouse  much injury was done to the settlement by the socalled grebo war these wild owners of cape palmas are confounded by europeans with the true krumen their distant cousins the tribal name is popularly derived from gré or gri the jumping monkey and it alludes to a late immigration a host of some 20000 savages closely besieged the settlement and ravaged all the lands belonging to the intruders especially the fine french farm fighting ended with a treaty of peace and renewal of allegiance sic at harper on march 1 1876 following the battle of harper october 10 1875 the latter resulting from an attack on grebo big town proved a regular bulls run wherein the citizens lost all their guns and ammunition and where the grebes slaughtered my true and trusty steward selim agha  i must allow myself a few lines in memory of a typical man selim was a nubian of lampblack skin but his features were semitic down to the nosebridge and below it like the hair distinctly african this mixture characterises the negroid as opposed to the negro in the first fourth of the present century he was bought by mr thurburnvenerabile nomenof alexandria and sent for education to north britain there he learned to speak scotch to make turtlesoup to stuff birds to keep accounts and to be useful and valuable in a series of ways then his thoughts full of philanthropy turned towards the old mother the murder of dr barths companion vogel in 1856 originated seven fruitless expeditions to murderous wadáy and he made sundry journeys into the interior i believe that he took service for some time with lieutenant now sir john h glover before he became my factotum between 1860 and 1865 when i left the coast he transferred himself to liberia where he wrote they proposed to run him for the presidency selim joined the monrovians during the grebo war as an assistantsurgeon his object being to mitigate the horrors of the campaign and he met his death on october 9 1875 during the mismanaged attack on grebo big town captain a b ellis in his amusing and outspoken west african sketches quotes from the liberian independent the following statement mr selim agha was also overtaken by the barbarous greboes and one of them bye weah by name after allowing him to read his bible which he had by him in his pocket and which he made a present of to the barbarian chopped his body all about chopped off his head which he took to his town with eighteen others and threw the body with the gift into the swamp the account sounds trustworthy especially that about the bible it is exactly what the poor fellow would have done but many have assured me that he was slaughtered by mistake during the rout of his party rip  another reminiscence  although it has melancholy associations i can hardly remember without a smile my last visit to good bishop payne he led me to the missionschool a shed that sheltered settles and desks tattered books slates and boards two native pedagogues and two lines of pupils sized from the right the biggest being nearest the boss we took our places upon the bench and the catechiser when bade to begin opened after a little hesitation as follows

bishop looked on approvingly we then spoke of the mysterious mount geddia the lybian thala oros of ptolemy footnote lib iv 6 §§ 12 14 16 the home of the thála tribe  the people say that it may be seen at times from settra kru that the distance by round road is some 200 miles and that none have ascended it on account of the intense cold if this be fact there is a kilimanjáro 18000 feet high in western africa the glitter of the white cap has been visible from great distances and some would explain it by a bare vein of quartzagain kilimanjáro the best time to travel would be in october or november after the rains and the grebo rascals might be paid and persuaded to supply an escort  at cape palmas we engaged thirty socalled krumen only seven were ready to accompany us and the rest came nearly two months behind time this is the farming season and the people do not like to leave their fieldlands jack davis headman chief crimp and promising party had been warned to be ready by mr r b n walker whose name and certificate he wore upon a big silver crescent but as senegal appeared on sunday instead of saturday he gravely declared that his batch had retired to their plantationsin blackmans english small countries we were compelled to make an advance a measure unknown of old and to pay more than double hire for working on the gold coast these races kruboys grebos and their cognates have not improved during the last score of years their headmen were old hands approaching the fifties now they are youths of twentyfive the younger sort willingly engaged for three years now they begin to notch their tallies for every new moon and they wax homesick after the tenth month once they were content to carry home a seamans chest well filled with chowchow and stolen goods in these days they must have ready money to deal with the bristol barques  having before described the kráo and the kru republic with its four recognised castes i need not repeat myself footnote wanderings c vol ii chap vi which ends with a short specimen of the language we again admired the magnificent development of muscle which stood out in bunches as on the farnese hercules set off by the most appropriate dress a coloured oblong of loincloth tucked in at the waist we marvelled too at the contrast of grecian figure and cynocephalous features whose frizzly thatch often cut into gardenplots is unnecessarily protected by a gaudy greasy cap  in morals too these men are as peculiar as they are contradictory they work and work well many old coasters prefer them to all other tribes they are at their best in boats or on board ship especially ships of war where they are disciplined for carrying burdens or working in the bush they are by no means so valuable and yet as will be seen they are highly thought of by some miners in the gold mines in the house they are at their worst and they are a nuisance to camp noisy and unclean their chief faults are lying and thieving they are also apt to desert to grow discontented to presume and ever to ask for more these qualities are admirably developed in our headman toby johnson and his gang i should not travel again with krumen on the gold coast  another of their remarkable characteristics is the fine union of the quarrelsome with the cowardly like the wányamwezi of eastcentral africa they will fight amongst themselves and fight furiously but they feel no shame in telling their employers that they sell their labour not their lives that man can die but once that heads never grow again and that to battling they prefer going back to we country if a ship take fire all plunge overboard like seals and the sound of a gun in the bush makes them run like hares yet an english officer actually proposed to recruit a force of these recreants for fieldservice in ashanti he probably confounded them with the wásawahili the seedyboys of the east coast a race which some day will prove useful when the sepoy mutiny shall repeat itself or if the difficulties in egypt be prolonged a few thousands of these sturdy fellows would put to flight an army of henhearted hindús or hindís  we left cape palmas at 5 pm and duly respected the fivefathom deep athole rock so called from the frigate which first made its acquaintance the third victim was the b and a ss gambia captain hamilton footnote curiously enough a steamer carrying another fine of palmoil has come to grief owing as usual to imperfect charts she was carrying home part of the 400 puncheons exacted after the blockade of 1876 by way of fine from gelelé king of dahome by the senior naval officer captain sullivan the dhowchaser the jujumen naturally declared that their magic brought her to such notable grief  we then passed grand tabú tabou in the middle of the bay formed by point tahoua coast better known fifty years ago than it is now the only white resident is mr julio who has led a rather accidented life a native of st helena he fought for the northerners in the american war and proved himself a firstrate rifleshot he traded on the congo and travelled like a native far in the interior now he has married a wife from cape palmas and is the leading man at tabú  this place again is a favourite labourmarket the return of the krumen repeats the spectacles of sinou and war being here chronic the canoemen come off armed with guns swords and matchets after a frightful storm of tongues and much bustle but no work the impatient steamer begins to waggle her screw powderkegs and dwarf boxes are tossed overboard and every attention is bestowed upon them whilst a boy or two is left behind either to swim ashore or to find a watery grave  presently we sighted the bar and breakers that garnish the mouth of the cavally anglicè cawally river the name is properly cavallo because it lies fourteen miles ridingdistance from cape palmas here bishop payne had his headquarters and his branch missions extended sixty miles upstream on the left bank some fifteen or sixteen miles from the embochure resides the grand devil equivalent to the great god of krúland the place is described as a large caverned rock where a mysterious suffing something answers through an interpreter any questions in any tongue even english receiving in return for the revelations offerings of beads leaftobacco and cattle which are mysteriously removed the oracle is doubtless worked by some sturdy knave a demondoctor as the missionaries call him who laughs at the beards of his implicitlybelieving dupes a tree growing near the stream represents lots wifes pillar some sceptical and voltairian black was punished for impious curiosity by being thus translated skippers who treated their boys kindly were allowed a score of years ago to visit the place and to join in the ceremonies even as most of the old calabar traders now belong to the egbo mystery but of late years a village called hidya with land on both banks forbids passage moreover krumen are not hospitable masters and men cast ashore upon a coast which they have visited for years to hire hands are stripped beaten and even tortured by women as well as by men the savages have evidently not learnt much by a centurys intercourse with europeans  leaving cavally the last place where kruboys can be shipped we coasted along the fiery sands snowed over with surf and set in the glorious leekgreen growth that distinguishes the old ivory coast the great gulf stream which bifurcating at the azores sweeps southwards with easting now sets in our favour it is however partly a windcurrent and here it often flows to the west even in winter the everrolling seas off this bristol coast are almost clear of reef and shoal and the only storms are tornadoes which rarely blow except from the land from the ocean they are exceedingly dangerous such conditions probably suggested the bristol barque trade which still flourishes between cape palmas and grand bassam a modern remnant of the old bristolian merchantadventurers it was established for slaving purposes during the last century by mr henry king maintained by his sons richard who hated menofwar and william who preferred science and it is kept up by his grandsons for legitimate trade  the shipsbarques and brigsnumbering about twentyfive are neat clean trim craft no longer coppered perpendicularly footnote still occurs sometimes the idea is that as they roll more than they sail less strain is brought on the seams of the copper instead of horizontally after the older fashion skippers and crews are well paid for the voyage which lasts from a year to fifteen months the floating warehouses anchor off the coast where it lacks factories and pick up the waifs and strays of camwood palmoil and kernels the peculiar export of the gold coast at times a tusk or a little golddust finds its way on board the trader must be careful in buying the latter not only have the negroes falsified it since the days of bosnian but now it is made in birmingham this false dust resists nitric acid yet is easily told by weight and bulk it blows away too with the breath whilst the true does not again the skippers have to beware of fetish gold mostly in the shape of brokenup ornaments of inferior ley  the bristolians preserve the old round trade and barter native produce against cloth and beads rum and gin salt tobacco and gunpowder these shipshops send home their exports by the mailsteamers and vary their monotonous days by visits on board they sail home when the cargoes are sold each vessel making up her own accounts and leaving trust but no debts the life must be like making ones home in a lighthouse plus an eternal roll and the line gives a weary time to the mailsteamers as these never know exactly where the bristol barques will be found  after hugging the coast and prospecting biribi we sighted the drewins whose natives are a powerful and spirited race equally accustomed to either element there are no better canoemen on the coast they ship only on board the bristol ships and they have more than once flogged a cruel skipper caught ashore passing king georges town we halted 11 am january 23 opposite the river and settlement of fresco where two barques and a cutter were awaiting supplies frescoland is beautified by perpendicular red cliffs and the fine broad beach is feathered with cocoas which suggest koprathe dried meat of the split kernel at 315 pm came grand lahoubosmans cabo la hoe180 miles from cape palmas the native settlements of nutbrown huts in the clearings of thick forests resemble heaps of withered leaves the french have reoccupied a fort twenty miles up the pretty barless river the outlet of a great lagoon it was abandoned during the prussogallic war nine bristol barques were lying off three towns a place not upon the chart and at halfjack 205 miles from the cape here we anchored and rolled heavily through the night a regular seesaw of head and heels seamen have prejudices about ships pronouncing some steady and others uncommon lively i find them under most circumstances much of a muchness  the next morning carried us forty miles along the bassam country and villages little piccaninny and great to grand bassam it is a regular lagoonland whose pretty rivers are the outlets of the several sweet waters and the saltponds opposite piccaninny bassam heads with its stalk to the shore and spreading out a huge funnel eastward and westward the curious formation known as the bottomless pit the chart shows a dot a line and 200 fathoms in these days of deepsea soundings i would recommend it to the notice of the hydrographic office we know exactly as much about it in ad 1882 as in ad 1670 when ogilvy wrote six miles beyond jak in jakko footnote bosmans jaquijaqui is the bottomless pit so called from its unfathomable deepness for the seamen having sounded with their longest lines and plummets could never reach the bottom it would be interesting to know whether it is an area of subsidence or a volcanic depression the adjacent gold coast suffers from terrible earthquakes as accra learnt to her cost in 1862  at 10 am we made grand bassam where the french have had a résidence for many years here the famous marseille house of régis frères first made fortune by goldbarter the precious ore bought by the middlemen a peculiar race from the wild tribes of the far interior appears in the shape of dust with an occasional small nugget the traders dislike bars and ingots because they are generally half copper we have now everywhere traced the trade from gambia to the gold coast and we may fairly conclude that all the metal comes from a single chain of ghauts subtending the maritime region  grand bassam is included in the french côte dor but not in the english gold coast which begins east of the ivory coast the dutch was even narrower according to bosnian being a part of guinea it is extended about sixty miles beginning with the gold river assini twelve miles above axim and ending with ponni seven or eight miles east of accra grand bassam has only two european establishments eastward lies the blockhouse of m verdier agent of the government at assini so called from its battlemented roof it is the old fort nemours built in 1843 the poste abandoned during the war of 1870 was let to messieurs swanzy it is a series of ridgeroofs surrounded by a whitewashed stockade both have been freely accused of supplying the ashantis with arms and ammunition during the last war similarly the gambia is said to have supported the revolteds of senegal the site is vile liable to be flooded by sea and rain the river akbu or komo comoe with its spiteful little bar drains the realms of amatifú king of assini it admits small craft and we see the masts of a schooner amid the trees the outlet of immense lagoons to the east and west it winds down behind the factories and bears the native town upon its banks here we discharged only tradegin every second surfboat and canoe upsetting the red cases piled upon the beach looked like a bed of rosebuds the whole of this coast as far as axim is so dangerous that men land with their lives in their hands they disembark when outwardbound and reembark when homewardbound and in the interim they never tempt surf and sharks  the senegal left grand bassam at 530 pm to cover the eightyfive miles separating us from our destination the next important feature is the assini river also the outlet of enormous navigable lagoons breaking the continuity of forestbacked sands it lies fourteen to fifteen miles which the chart has diminished to seven west of the french settlement of old fort joinville the latter shows a tiled and whitewashed establishment the property of m verdier outlying the normal anthill of brown huts in 1868 winwood reade here found a poste and stockade a park of artillery a commandant a surgeon and a detachment of tirailleurs sénégalais levied amongst the warlike moslem tribes of senegambia like grand bassam it was under the station admiral who inspected the two once a year and who periodically sent a gunboat to support french interests  by night we passed new town not on the charts but famed for owning a fine gold placer north of the townlagoon after my departure from the coast it was inspected by mr grant who sent home specimens of bitumen taken from the wells then came the two assinis eastern and western both places of small present importance the assini hills of the chart lie to the north not to the south of the tando water and by day one can easily distinguish their broken line blue and treeclad the francoenglish frontier has been determined after a fashion according to mr stanfords last map footnote gold coast november 20 1873 a footnote tells us the whole coast belongs to the english the french having withdrawn since 1870 from grand bassam and assini winwood reade this is obsolete in 1882 the limits of ashantiland are immensely exaggerated by this map the westernmost point was in west long 2º 55 g thus our territory begins between great assini and new town the latter being included in the protectorate this position would reduce the old gold coast from 245 direct geographical miles of shoreline between the river assini w long 3º 23 and the volta mouth e long 0º 42 to some 217 or 220 in round numbers inland the limit should be the tando valley but it has been fancifully traced north from the eyhi lagoon the receptacle of the tando on a meridian of w long 2º 50 g to a parallel of n lat 6º 30 or ninetyeight miles from the coast about axim n lat 4º 52 thence it bends east and southeast to the ofim or western fork of the bosom prah and ascends the prah proper separating ashantiland north from fantiland south  it should be our object to acquire by purchase or treaty or both the whole territory subject to grand bassam and assini the reasons may be gathered from the preceding pages  by night we also passed cape apollonia and its four hummocks which are faintly visible from axim the name has nothing to do i need hardly say with apollo or his feasts the apolloniæ nor has it any relationship with the admirable apollinaris water it was given by the portuguese from the saint footnote butlers lives gives s apollonia not appolonia as the miners have it vm february 9 this admirable old maid leaped into the fire prepared for her by the heathen populace of alexandria when she refused to worship their execrable divinity there are also an apollonius march 5 a zealous holy anchorite of egyptian antinous and apollinaris who about ad 376 began to broach his heresy denying in christ a human soul who presided over the day of discovery in the early half of the present century the king of

majesty deceased some twenty men were sacrificed on every saturday till the great customs took place six months afterwards the underlying idea was doubtless that of dahome the potentate must not go like a small boy alone and unattended to the shadowy realm the african cruiser footnote journal of an african cruiser by an officer of the us navy edited by nathaniel hawthorn aberdeen clark and son 1848 speaks of the royal palace being sumptuously furnished in european style of gold cups pitchers and plates and of vast treasures in bullion when the king died sixty victims were slain and buried with their liege lord besides a knife plate and cup swords guns cloths and goods of various kinds the corpse smeared with oil and powdered capàpié with golddust looked like a statue of the noble ore  as the senegal advanced under easy steam we had no rolling off this rollercoast and we greatly and regretfully enjoyed the glorious harmatan weather so soon about to cease the mornings and evenings were cool and dewy and the pale roundfaced sun seemed to look down upon us through an honest northern fog there was no heat even during the afternoons usually so close and oppressive in this section of the tropics i only wished that those who marvelled at my preferring to the blustering boisterous weather of the northern adriatic the genial and congenial climate of west africa could have passed a day with me    chapter xv  axim the gold port of the past and the future  all the travellers anxiety about the known and apprehensions of the unknown fell from him like a garment as after passing the

stretches the town from this distance it appears a straggle of brown thatched huts and hovels enlivened here and there by some whitewashed establishments mining or in the mercanteel the soil is ruddy and rusty and we have the usual african tricolor  the agents of the several aximite houses came on board we drained the normal stirrupcup and embarked in the usual heavy surfboat manned by a dozen leatherylunged elmina boys with paddles and a helmsman with an oar there are smaller surfcanoes that have weatherboards at the bow to fend off the waves our anchorageplace lies at least two miles southwestandbysouth of the landingplace there is absolutely nothing to prevent steamers running in except a sunken reef the pinnacle or hoeven rock it is well known to every canoeman cameron sounded for it and a buoy had been laid by fishermen but so unskilfully that the surge presently made a clean sweep hence a wilful waste of time and work i wrote to messieurs elder and dempster advising them to replace it for their own interests and for the convenience of travellers but in africa one is out of the world and receiving answers is emphatically not the rule  there is no better landingplace than axim upon this part of the african coast the surf renders it impracticable only on the few days of the worst weather we hugged the north of the bobowusúa rockislet when the water here breaks there is a clear way further north the southern passage paved with rocks and shoals can be used only when the seas are at their smoothest a regular and welldefined channel placed us on the shingly and sandy beach we had a succulent breakfast with messieurs gillett and selby lintott and spink to whose unceasing kindness and hospitality we afterwards ran heavily in debt there we bade adieu to our

and exchanged at the will of headquarters often before they can settle down and always before they learn to take interest in the place the works consist of two bastions on the land side a large one to the southeast and a smaller to the northeast seawards projects a rounded cavalier fronted by dead ground or rather water in the days of the dutch the platforms carried 22 iron guns besides some

does that the west coast of africa preserves traces of an ancient connection with the nile valley and the eastern regions but this is not one of them barbot calls it axim or atzyn or achen the native name is essim which in the language of the mfantse or mfantsefo fantirace means you told me and in the apollonian dialect you know me these fanciful terms are common and they allude to some tale or legend which is forgotten in course of time the date of its building is utterly unknown the fanti tradition is that their race was driven coastwards like their kinsmen the ashantis footnote in wanderings in west africa ii 98 i have given the popular derivation of fanti fandidi  herbeater and asyanti sándidi  corneater bowdich wrote ashanti because he learnt the word from the accramen by tribes pressing down upon them from the north they must have found the maritime lands occupied but they have preserved no notices of their predecessors the porttown became the capital of an upper factor who ruled the whole coast as far as elmina it was almost depopulated say the old authorities by long wars with the more powerful apollonia but its commanding position has always enabled it to recover from the heaviest blows it is still the threshold of the western goldregion and the principal port of occidental wásá wassaw  we may fairly predict a future for axim the town is well situated to catch the seabreeze the climate is equatorial but exceptionally healthy save after the rainy season which here opens a month or six weeks earlier than on the leeward coast the downfall must however have diminished since the times when the blacks will tell you the wet weather lasts eleven months and twentynine days in the year the rains now begin with april and end in september the position is

falling after midnight to 70º and that the wet season on the seaboard is perhaps the least sickly we were there in januarymarch during an unusually hot and dry season following the harmatan and the smokes and preceding the tornadoes and the rains yet i never felt an oppressive daynothing worse than alexandria or trieste in early august the mornings and evenings were mostly misty the moons were clear and the nights were tolerable an excessive damp which mildews and decays everythingclothes books metals manwas the main discomfort but we were living as it were in the open and we neglected morning and evening fires this will not be the case when solid and comfortable houses shall be built the improvement of lodging and diet accounts for the better health of angloafricans as of angloindians in the present day our predecessors during the early nineteenth century died of bad shelter bad food and bad drink  the town built upon a flat partly formed by cutting away the mounds and hillocks of red clay was well laid out by mr sam the districtcommissioner after its bombardment during the ashanti war the main streets or rather roads running northsouth are avenued with shady ganian or umbrella figs i should prefer the breadtree which here flourishes these thoroughfares are kept clean enough and nuisances are punished as in england cross lines however are wanted the crooked passages between the huts do not admit the seabreeze native hovels also should be removed from the foreshore which as admiralty property ought to be kept for public purposes the native dwellings are composed of split bamboofronds raphia vinifera thatched with the foliage of the same tree they are mere basketsairy and perhaps too airy some are defended against wind and wet by facings of red swish a few like that of the king and chief native traders are built of adobes sundried bricks whitewashed outside of this kind too are the stores and the mining establishments the akankon house near the landingplace the gold coast house in the interior the methodist chapel a barnshaped affair the effuenta house to the north and the tákwá or french house to the south  sanitation however is loudly called for and if cholera come here it will do damage the southern part of the narrow ledge bearing the town and including the french establishment is poisoned by a fetid stagnant pool full of sirens shrimps and anthropophagous crabs which after heavy rains cuts a way through its sandbar to the sea this marigot is the little shallow river axim the achombene of barbot which the people call awaminísu ghosts or deadmans water to the north also there are two foul nullahs the eswá and the besáon which make the neighbourhood pestilential in days to come the latter will be restored to its old course east of the town and thrown into the awaminísu whose mouth will be kept open throughout the year the eastern suburbs so to call them want clearing of offal and all manner of impurities beyond the original valley of the besáon the ground rises and bears the wall of trees seen from the offing there is therefore plenty of buildingroom and long heads have bought up all the land in that

poisonous lagoons  mr william m grant the clever and active agent of our friend mr james irvine came on board to receive us and housed us and our innumerable belongings in his little bungalow facing

the men are the usual curious compound of credulity and distrust hope and fatalism energy and inaction which make the negro so like the irish character but we must not expect too much from the denizens of african seaports mostly fishermen who will act hammockbearers a race especially fond of bacchus and worshippers of the devil venus perhaps a little too much license is allowed to them in the matter of noisy and drunken native customs palavers and powwows they rarely go about armed if you see a gun you know that the bearer is a huntsman they are easily commanded and despite their sympathies with ashantiland they are not likely to play tricks since their town was bombarded in the villages they are civil enough baring the shoulders like taking off the hat when they meet their rulers theirs also is the great virtue of cleanliness even when the mornings are coldest you see them bathing on the beach they are never pinched for food and they have high ideas of diet he lib all same prince he chop cow and sheep ebery day and fowl and duck he be all same vegetal they have poultry in quantities especially capons sheep with negro faces like the persian dwarf milchgoats of sturdy build dark and dingy pigs and cattle whose peculiarity it is to be either black or piebald the latter are neat animals like the smallest alderneys with short horns and backs flat as tables there are almost as many bulls as there are cows and they herd together without fighting being looked upon as capital and an honour to the owner they are never killed and although the udders of cows and goats are bursting with milk they are never milked  the women differ very little from their sisters of the eastern gold coast you never see beauty beyond the beauté du diable and the naïve and piquant plainness which one admires in a pugpup the forms are unsupported and the figure falls away at the hips they retain the savage fashion of coiffure shown in camerons across africa training their wool to bunches tufts and horns the latter is the favourite the pigtails which stand stiff upright and are whipped round like pricks of tobacco may number half a dozen one however is the common style and the size is said to be determined by a delicate consideration opposed to this is the highly civilised atufu kankey or bussle whose origin is disputed some say that it prevents the long cloth clinging to the lower limbs others that it comes from a modest wish to conceal the forms some make it a jockeysaddle for the baby others a mere exaggeration of personal development an attempt to make aphrodite a callipygé i hold that it arose in the mysterious hands of fashion from the knot which secures the bodycloth and which men wear in front or by the side usually this bussle is a mere bundle

like a coffin and lined with red cloth to receive the royal person and goldhilted swords was carried stretcherfashion by four sturdy knaves king blay is an excellent man true and loyal to the backbone but his angloafrican garb was to say the least peculiar a tall cocked hat with huge red and white plume contrasted with the dwarf pigtail bearing a popobead by way of fetish at the occiput his bodydress was a skyblue silk his waistcloth marigoldyellow and he held in hand the usual useless sword of honour a wilkinson presented to him for his courage and conduct in 18731874 the ashanti medal hung from his neck by a plaited gold chain of native trichinopolywork with a neat sliding clasp of two cannons and an empty asumamma or talismancase the bracelets were of popobeads and thick goldwire curiously twisted into wreathknots each finger bore a ring resembling a knuckleduster three mushroomlike projections springing from each oval shield  ahin blay dismounted with ceremony and was as ceremoniously received his features are those of the fanti somewhat darker than usual and his expression is kindly and intelligent though barely fiftyfive his head is frosty and his goatee is snowy the visit was a state affair a copy in small of ashanti and dahome  on the left the place of honour sat the kings father that is eldest uncle on the female side evidently younger than his nephew the

custom of the chiefs and if you give them a good tile it goes at once into store he made us promise a returnvisit and set out to collect bearers  hereabouts a week is as a day whilst carriage was collecting we inspected the neighbourhood of axim our first visit was to bobowusúa island a fetish place for palavers where the natives object to guns being fired here it was that admiral van ruyter built his battery of twelve cannons and forced fort santo antonio to surrender on january 19 1642 the rock is of trap greenstone or whinstone which miners call ironstone and cornishmen blue elvan this diorite composed of felspar and the hardest hornblende contains granular iron and pyrites like silver some specimens are beautifully banded in onyxfashion and revetted with spar quartz of many colours deadwhite and crystalline red and yellow we find the same trap on the mainland near the smaller akinim or saltpond village there is a mass threaded with quartzveins from north to south 1º 30 bossed by granite dykes footnote it is generally believed that these granite injections have been cooled and consolidated deep below earths surface trending eastwest 96º 50 and traversed by a burnt vein striking 67º from the surfboat we remarked that there were no sharks apparently they shun coming within the reefs our landing was not pleasant for the krumen the shallow bottom was strewed with rounded pebbles and the latter are studded with sharp limpets and corallines we climbed round the seaward bluff fissured with deep narrow clefts up which the tidewaves race and roar here the trap has a ruddy hue the salt water bringing out the iron corallines now several feet above water clothed the boulders this corroborated by a host of other phenomena argues a secular upheaval of the island and

as thunder and lightning accompany the downfalls the stones are supposed to be the result  the osrámanbo are used in medicine they cool the heart and water in which they are steeped when given to children mitigates juvenile complaints one of my collections owes its black colour to having been boiled in palmoil by way of preserving its virtues it resembles the básanos of lydian tmolus but the gold coast touchstone is mostly a dark jasper imported from europe the substance of the thunderstone is the greenstonetrap everywhere abundant and taking with age a creamy patina like the basalt of the haurán i heard however that at abusi beyond anamabo birdrock and other places further east worked stones of a lightish slaty hue are common about new town and assini these implements become very plentiful mr s cheetham informs me that the thinner hatchets somewhat fingershaped are copied in iron by the peoples of the benin river these expert smiths buy poor european metal and like other west

without reason between fridays and mondays at sekondi seecondee and consumes a week in the downmarch i have already noted the want of sanitation the condition of the ammunition and the absence of medical stores it moves ones sense of the absurd to compare the desolate condition of the goldland which is to supply the money with the civilised machinery in england which is to work it companies and syndicates shares debentures and what not  i have treated the subject of axim with a minuteness that is almost porochial its future importance must be my excuse the next chapter will show that we are truly in the land of gold in an old new california  and now to conclude this unpleasant account with the good words of old barbot axim in my opinion is the most tempting of any on the coast of guinea taking one thing with another you have there a perpetual greenness which affords a comfortable shade against the scorching heat of the sun under the lofty palm and other trees planted about the village with a sweet harmony of many birds of several sorts perching on them the walk on the low flat strand along the seaside is no less pleasant at certain hours of the day and from the platform of the fort is a most delightful prospect of the ocean and the many rocks and small islands about it    chapter xvi  gold about axim especially at the apatim or bujiÁ concession  any one who has eyes to see can assure himself that axim is the threshold of the goldregion it abounds in diorite a rock usually associated with the best paying lodes after heavy showers the naked eye can note spangles of the precious metal in the streetroads you can pan it out of the wallswish the little streambeds bonedry throughout the hot season roll down during the rains a quantity of dark arenaceous matter like that of taranaki new zealand and the black sand of australia which collects near the sea in stripes and patches the people believe that without it gold never occurs and if they collect the common yellow sand it is to extract from it the darker material if the stuff does not answer the magnet it is probably schorl tourmaline hornblende or dark quartz strangers have often mistaken this emerylike rock for tin which occurs abundantly in the northern region it is simply titaniferous iron iserine pleonaste ilmenite footnote or peroxide of iron with 8 to 23 per cent of blue oxide of titanium and degraded itabirite the iron and quartz formation so called in the brazil and it is the same mineral which i found so general throughout the gold and silver fields of neglected midian it is found striating white sandstone about tákwá and other places in the interior the surfacestone is decomposed by the oxide of iron and thus the precious dust with its ingrained gold is dissolved and separated from it at a greater depth the itabirite will be found solid and the occurrence of these oldest crystalline formations in large layers is a hopeful sign when colonel bolton was interested in the gold coast diggings i advised him to send for a few tons of this metal and to test it as paydirt a barrelful was forwarded from the coast to the akankon company it was probably thrown away without experiment  at axim as at cape coast castle and other parts of the shore women may be seen goldgathering even on the seasands they rarely wash more than 40 lbs or a maximum of 50 lbs per diem and they strike work if they do not make daily half a dollar 2s 3d to two dollars they have nests of wooden platters for pans the oldest and rudest of all mechanical appliances the largest two feet in diameter are used for rough work in the usual way with a peculiar turn of the wrist the smallest are stained black inside to show the colour of gold and the finer washings are carried home to be worked at leisure during the night this is peculiarly womens work and some are well known to be better panners than others they refuse to use saltwater because they say it will not draw out the gold  the whole land is impregnated with the precious metal i find it richer in sedimentary gold than california was in 1859 immediately behind the main square of axim a bank of red clay leads eastward to a shallow depression the old valley of the besáon a swamp during the rains backed by rising and forested ground to the east on the inland versant a narrow native shaft has been sunk for gold by mr sam now native agent under mr crocker we pounded and panned the rock which yielded about twopence per 2 lbs or one ounce to the ton observing its strike we concluded that it must extend through mr irvines property throughout the gold coast auriferous reefs ran northsouth with easting rather than westing the deviation varies from 5º west to 15º22º east and i have heard of but not seen a strike of northeast 45º to southwest this confirms the meridional hypothesis of professor sedgwick who stated as some of the great physical agencies of the earth are meridional these agencies may probably in a way we do not comprehend have influenced the deposit of metals on certain lines of bearing we may also observe that all the great mineral chains of the old and new world are meridional rather than longitudinal striking from northeast to southwest the geologists theory combined with the knowledge that the noble metal is chiefly found among palæozoic rocks of a quartzose type is practically valuable on the gold coast every mound or hillock of red clay contains one or more quartzreefs generally outcropping but sometimes buried in the subsoils they can always be struck by a crosscut trending eastwest the dip is exceedingly irregular some lodes are almost vertical and others quasihorizontal  we now take the main road leading to the ancobra after crossing the fetid besáon by its ricketty bridge of planks we find on the right hand facing messieurs swanzys a fine bit of rising ground which i shall call after its proprietor mount irvine over the southern slope runs a cleared highway which presently becomes a bushpath it is named the dudley road after an energetic districtcommissioner this is the first tákwá line whose length is described to be about fifty miles or four days slow journey for laden porters mr gillett who had covered twentysix sixteen miles of it describes the path as unbroken by swamps or streams further north according to the many native guides whom i questioned travellers pass two rivulets and finally they are ferried over the abonsá or tákwá river the second road follows closely the left bank of the ancobra it is used by the hausá soldiers but only in the heart of the dries and it must be impassable during the rains dr j africanus b horton who contributes to a characteristic paper footnote the african times january 2 1882 the paper is full of inaccuracies it begins by placing tomento tumento ninetyfive miles for thirty along the rivercourse from the mouth and he makes steamlaunches take from two to four days say one to go up to it has never heard of the former when he says from axim to taquah tákwá there is no direct route and he justly deprecates the latter but he cries up the bushua or dixcovetákwá line upon which he has large concessions i shall return to this subject in a future chapter  on the north side of mount irvine is a second nullah the eswá which flows like the besáon through the dense growth of bush covering the eastern uplands a few minutes walk along the right bank leads to a broadening of the bed a swamp during the rains and a field of cereals in the dries thence we plunge into the jungle and after a couple of hundred yards come upon signs of mining in the eswá bed where the gulch is choked by two mounds or hillocks appear the usual womens washings shallow pits like the brazilian catas whence the paydirt has been extracted on the right bank subtending the bed their husbands have sunk the usual chimneyhole to scratch quartz from the boundingwall of the reef these rude beginnings of shafts reach a depth of 82 feet and perhaps more all are round like the circular hut of the african savage similarly in australia the first pits were circular or oval they are descended in sweepfashion by means of footholes and they are just large enough for a man to sit in and use his diminutive tool the quartz is sent up to grass by a basket and carried to the hut after a preliminary roasting the old custom of egypt it is broken into little bits and made over to the women who grind it down upon the cankeystone which serves to make the daily bread in some parts of africa this is mens work and it is always done at night with much jollity and carousing  i named this place the axim reef it had been taken by dr j ogilby ross formerly district medical officer axim and now preparing to explore the regions behind the ancobra sources he allowed however his prospecting term to elapse and thus it has been secured by mr grant for mr j irvine it taught us three valuable lessons  1 wherever catas or womens washings are found we can profitably apply the hydraulic system of sluicing and fluming not by an upper reservoir only but also from below by a forcepump water is procurable at all seasons by means of nortons abyssinian tubes footnote the egyptian campaigners seem to have thought of these valuable articles somewhat late in the day yet two years ago i saw one working at alexandria and the brookbeds dammed above and below will form perennial tanks i am surprised that english miners on the gold coast have not borrowed this valuable hint to wash from the people who have practised it since time immemorial wherever we read as on mr wyatts map golddust found in all these streams natives dive for gold in the dry and old goldshafts all along this track we should think of hydraulicking  2 the natives here and elsewhere prospect for and work the bankreefs after the subtending gutterbed has proved auriferous there is however no connection between the two and the precious metal in the subsoil is either swept down by the floods or washed out of the sides as we shall see on the ancobra river  3 the negroes who ignore pumps and steamnavvies have neglected the obvious measure of deepdigging in all the streambeds where much detrital gold and even nuggets will assuredly be found this should be done either by shafting or by opening with steamnavvies the whole course of the channel during the dries  regaining the main road and passing towards the northern town which is separated from southern axim by the fort and the grassy drillground we cast a look at a heap of rotting cases at last stored under a kind of shed though labelled akim by the ungeographical manufacturer they contain a boardhouse with glass windows and all complete intended for axim and eventually for the districtcommissioner tákwá but with a futility worthy of the futile african certain authorities at headquarters after buying and landing the proposed bungalow which probably cost 500l discovered that they could not afford the expense of sending it to its destination consequently it was made over to the white ants and it has now duly qualified for fuel  at the end of the northern town a noble bombax notes the last restingplace of europeans and on it hangs a tale deserving a place in spiritualistic prints a certain m thiebaut transportmanager to the french tákwácompany died at axim and was here buried in july 1881 many persons including mr grants mother and wife declare that they saw during broad daylight his spirit standing over his grave and no wonder if he walked a decent ghost would feel unhappy in such a yard then a receptacle for native impurities we represented the case to mr alexander allan who succeeded poor captain obrien and that active and energetic new broom at once took steps to abate the nuisance the ghost has not been seen since its last home has been surrounded by a decent paling and inscribed cigît thiebaut the same pious service was then done for one of our countrymen mr crawford who died at axim in the same year  leaving on the left a neat bungalow the effuenta house we see to seaward of it the wooded knoll bosomato footnote abosom obosom or bosom vulg bossum are imaginary beings guardians and so forth worshipped by the people and called fetishes by europeans the word fetish is properly applied only to charms philters amulets and all that genus see p 78 wit and wisdom from west africa london tinsleys 1865 here a thatched hut shows where the late m bonnat proposed to build a trading establishment and to disembark his goods despite rock and reef a few yards further the road is crossed by the breviya where life ends another foul lagoonstream haunted by sirens and crossed by a corduroybridge it leads to a village of the same name which the angloafrican calls stinkfish town footnote as usual it is a translation the natives call the preserve bomom from bon to stink alluding tersely and picturesquely to its sundried produce  from this knot of huts and hovels we turn sharp to the east or inland and presently enter the apatim or bujiá concession which has been leased for mining purposes to mr irvine there is a shorter road further north but it is barred we were assured by a bad swamp our path fairly open ran up and down a succession of roundtopped abruptflanked hills thrown together without system and showing no signs of a plateau they are parted by creekvalleys gulches and gullies thick with tangled vegetation and varying in depth from a few feet to two and even three hundred many of them carry water even in the driest season the country is remarkably like that behind cape coast castle where the home government during the last ashanti war 187374 proposed to lay down a tramway  the land is not heavily timbered but there is wood sufficient for everyday purposes its chief growth is the spiny bombax whose timber is hardly durable enough for permanent shafting here however and in all the mines upon and near the seaboard carpenterwork should be imported from england it will be at once cheaper and better the country is everywhere seamed with reefs and ridges of naked quartz beginning near the coast and striking in the right direction there must be many more underground and all will be bared by washing the country mr r b n walker whose energy and enterprise obtained this as well as other concessions tells me that during a second visit one of his company picked up two or three small pieces of quartz showing free gold among the refuse around the native pits  we progressed slowly enough as we delayed to botanise to net butterflies footnote our large collection all came to grief because we had neglected to carry camphor the hint may be useful to those who follow us and to shoot for specimens the path crossed and recrossed the impima rivulet which in parts was dammed and doubledammed its bed of quartzgravel and red ironstone again suggested deep digging after a two hours stroll we traversed the snaking course by a rude bridge and presently came to the halfway plantation impatási it is faced by a dwarf clearing and we noted a fine clump of bamboocane the next village was edukru marked upon the maps edu we then passed over the dry bed of the bujiá wady which looked as fit as the impima and at about twentyfive yards north of the bed we breasted the rough ascent of the apatim hill  here we turned to the right and found mr grants trialshaft it had been sunk amongst a number of round holes dug by the native miner and it appeared to us that they had been working the southern buttend of the eastern reef he had preferred it to another pit sunk a little distance from the centre by a man named jones whose venture yielded the poorest results cameron drew my attention to the necessity of hydraulicking this hillside and from three pounds of its yellow clay gathered at random we washed about fourpence worth of golddust upwards of 8l a ton other specimens assayed 1 oz 13 dwts and 13 grains the quartz at a little lower than a fathom had yielded poorly footnote messieurs johnson and matthey found only 0650 oz gold and 0225 silver but better results were expected from a deeper horizon  a few minutes of uphillwalk led us to the little apatim village our objective we had spent three hours and a half over a distance which would be easily covered in two the march may be about two and a half miles direct geographical from axim and five along the native path during the night my companion took a good observation of castor and pollux and with the aid of his chronometer laid down the position of the apatim village at n lat 4º 55 and w long g 2º 14 2 consequently the nearest point from central axim is 2200 yards and 200 from the shore the northwestern angle runs clean across the ancobra river footnote mr walker wrote to me i am inclined to believe that the concession will be found to extend to the river ankobra on the west and northwest sides but i do not feel certain that this would be of any material advantage the distance from axim by land being so short and the road between that port and the property being capable of improvement so as to render transport a matter of small expense the concession measures 4000 square yards the centre being an old native shaft a little north of the bujiá bed the quadrangle lies between n lat 4º 53 56 and 4º 55 56 and w long g 2º 12 48 and 2º 14 48 the lease costs 12l per annum paid quarterly and 120l when the works shall open its lessor had forbidden his fraudulent people to prospect or to mine because as usual they systematically robbed him of his royalty this universal practice has made the kings and chiefs throughout the country ready and even anxious to sell mininglands for small sums which will be paid honestly and regularly they are also fully alive to the prospective advantages of european staffs settling amongst them like them we shall find the systematic dishonesty and roguery of the natives a considerable drawback the fellows know good stone at sight and can easily secrete it the cure for this evil will be the importation of labour especially of chinese labourers  at apatim the name of the district as well as the village we were civilly received by the chief kwábina sensensé he is also lessor of the unfortunate akankon concession and his right to sell or to let either of them has been seriously disputed this practice again may lead unless checked to serious difficulties when the local government shall have established a regular department and a staff of goldcommissioners every owner should be compelled legally to prove his title to the land west africans know nothing of yards and fathoms they have hardly any words to express north or south footnote the four points are taken from the buried body the feet being to the east and the head lying west consequently they will sell either wittingly or in their ignorance of dimension and direction the same ground or parts of it to two or three purchasers indeed they would like nothing better and consequently jumpers must be expected  sensensé is a dark man apparently on the wrong side of fifty his grizzly beard grown comparatively long his closelytrimmed mustachios and his headcloth worn like a turban made me take him at first sight for a moslem he has a cunning eye which does not belie his reputation his fad is to take money and to do no work for it he now wants us to pay for the clearing of an uncleared path the villagers fear him on account of certain fetishpractices which in plain english mean poison and he keeps up their awe by everywhere displaying the outward signs of magic and sorcery a man with this gift can rise at night when all sleep cast off his body like a snakes slough become a loupgarou shoot flames from eyes and ears nose mouth and armpits walk with his head on the ground and kill man either by drinking his blood or by catching his kra umbra which he boils and devours here the sign of fetish is mostly the koro or pot full of rubbish at axim and akankon we shall find our chief a mighty bore each visit being equivalent to a bottle of gin  after a restful sleep in the cool and pleasant air of apatim we proceeded to visit the valley east of the settlement despite sensensés warning that the ground was fetish he had made the same objection to m bonnat his evident object being to keep the rich placer for private use or for further sale there are evil reports about the origin of the frenchmans fatal illness after disregarding this and similar warnings the deep and steepbanked depression runs northsouth and is apparently the head of the bujiá stream the vegetation especially near the water which flows some 300 feet below the village was exceedingly dense and tangled except where the ground had been cleared for bananas maize or groundnuts the bottom especially at the sharp corners gave the idea of exceeding richness and there were many old works apparently deserted the fetishpot stood everywhere filled with oil water and palmwine leaves cowries eggs and all manner of filth this stuff stirred by the komfo diviner answers questions and enables man to soothsay it also corresponds with the obeah of the west indies the ubio of the efik race a charm put into the ground to hurt or kill how hot the rich hole was what a perspiration and what a thirst came out of the climb  in the evening we walked about half a mile to the southwest of the village and prospected the central shaft whence the measurements were made here it is sunk in a western reef palpably running parallel with the eastern which we first inspected and this visit gave us a fair idea of the property it consists of at least three ridges of clay running from north to south and each containing one or more meridional walls of quartz some of the latter may turn out to be master lodes  i regret that this fine apatim concession was not thrown into the market before the socalled izrah the distance from axim to the miningground is so small that provisions and machinery could be transported for a trifle the village lies 220 feet above sealevel and a hillock in its rear perhaps 80 feet higher commands a noble view showing axim bay it could be used as a signalstation the rise is a fine healthy position for the dwellings to be occupied by the european staff and in such air white men could work for years  moreover the short distance from the shore offers peculiar advantages for hydraulicking flumes and sluices could carry the golden subsoil to the sea and discharge it into a series of tanks and cisterns which would be cradled for paydirt finally it will be easy to baffle the plundering negro workman by sending all stone containing free gold to be worked in england where superior appliances extract more than enough to pay transportcosts indeed it is a question with me whether despite great expenses reduction at home even of inland produce will not be found

spare my readers the slightest description of the troubles that attended our departure from axim on january 31 briefly we began loading at dawn and the loads were not headed before 10 am  the black caravan or rather herd was mustered by its guide and manager the energetic w m grant his personnel consisted of seven kruboys from cape palmas and fortythree axim carriers who now demand eight and sixpence for a trip which two years ago cost a dollar they stray about the country like goats often straggling over four miles as bearers they are the worst i know and the gold coast hammock is intended only for beachtravelling the men are never sized and they scorn to keep step whilst the crosspieces at either end of the pole rest upon the head and are ever slipping off it hence the jolting stumbling movement and the sensation of feeling every play of the porters muscles which make the march one long displeasure yet the alternative walking means fever for a new comer on return we cut long bamboos and palmfronds and made the krumen practise carrying hindufashion upon the shoulder  the rest of the moving multitude was composed of the servantry and the campfollowers one bouche inutile bore a flag a second carried a gun and so forth the only principle being to work as little as possible and to plunder all things plunderable there were exceptions joe kwasi bedeh of dixcove camerons old servant who boasts of being a pagan and who speaks english french and dutch a handy and intelligent young fellow who can cook sew carpenter or lead a caravanin fact can serve as

senior of missionary presence having been long employed in that line he wears a white tie on sundays and i shrewdly suspect him of preaching a hard worker beginning early and ending late he is an excellent stuffer of birds and beasts and the good condition of our collection is owing entirely to him his son kwasi yau sunday joe is a sharp boy in the angloindian sense the carpenter our model idler who wont work and cant work receives 3l per mens when 8 should be the utmost we cleared him out on return to axim meanwhile he saunters about under an umbrella and is always missing when wanted for work  our companions and bodyguards are bianco and nero both bought by cameron at lpool for a suspiciously trifling sum the former is a small smoothhaired terrier who dearly loves to bark and bite and who shows evident signs of early training in the cabline a dog with all the manners of a doggess he eventually found a happy home in the fort axim the second a bastard newfoundland with a dash of the bloodhound and just emerging from puppyhood soon told us the reason why he was sold for a song that animal was a born murderer he could not sight a sheep a goat or a bullock without the strongest desire to pull it down therefore he had been sold into slavery african and oldenglish fashion instead of being hanged he had fine qualitiesobedience fidelity affection a grand voice and a ferocious presence all these good gifts however were marred by an overdevelopment of destructiveness he survived his journeys by passing many of his hours in the water and he was at last dashed to dr roulston of tákwá  we took once more the northern road to brévia or stinkfish town and crossed its tongue of red clay bounded by the bed of the anjueri stream here again appeared a large block of greenstone deeply grooved by the grinder thence we debouched upon the surflashed shore tripped over by the sandpiper and the curlew and roped by the brightflowered convolvulus streaks of the auriferous black

the portuguese who were everywhere haunted by memories of the classics bowdich footnote folio p 271 is eminently in error when he places the remains at the extreme navigable point of the river and opines that the work was built by governor ringhaven ruyghaver buried at elmina in 1700 he was misinformed by colonel starrenberg a dutch officer who canoed three days up the bosom prah river a fact

were shot down after using rockgold nuggets for bullets he rolled sundry powderbarrels under the palaverhall and stationed there a boy with a match to be applied when he stamped on the floor he then

great room he reproached them with their greed of gain gave the sign and blew them and himself into eternity i am told by a good authority that the natives whose memories are tenacious on some points will not show to strangers the ruins which cost their forefathers so dear  the last village on the sands is kukakun where the wreck of a schooner saddens the scene within a few hundred yards of akromasi we bent abruptly eastward and exchanged the sands for the usual stiff soil of red clay the gut is formed by the pointbluff and a southern block and the surface is covered with dense secondgrowthpandanus the false sugarcane ferns large and small and the slothtree the brazilian ubá or preguiça with tall thin white trunk and hanging palmated leaves the african palmbirds orioles of the merulidæ family whose two colours red ntiblii and golden yellow enadsi apparently divide them into as many fighting factions give a touch a bright colour to the dulness and chatter over their pensile homes which strangers would mistake for cocoanuts  severely hustled and horribly shaken up we ran down the little valley of the avin streamlet it comes from afar heading they say in abasakasu a region where gold abounds in threequarters of an hour we had cleared the four short miles which separate axim from the ancobra ferry this is the line of a future tramway which will transport goods from the port to the river at present they must be shipped in barboats which cost much and carry little the ground divides itself into three sectionsthe red clay north of axim the sands whose greengrown upper levels are fitted to support ironpot sleepers and the avin valley which debouches upon the left bank of the ancobra the first and the last divisions are safe for creosoted wood my friend mr russell shaw would i doubt not take the contract for 4000l and a macadamised cartroad could be made for 500l  this would be the beginning of a muchwanted change at present the prices of transport are appalling the french mines pay from 2l to 2l 10s per ton from england to axim from axim to tákwá forty miles by river and thirty by land costs them 600 francs 24l per ton moreover native hands are not always forthcoming  the ancobra river the main artery and waterway of this region must not be written after the jonesian or modern mode ankobra and ankober nor with bosman rio cobre

declared that nothing but a storm could lay it low sánmá is still the name of the settlement on the right bank near the rivermouth  we rested at kumprasi a few huts close to the embouchure of the ironbedded avin streamlet and backwater the little zincroofed hut called by courtesy a store belonging to messieurs swanzy was closed katubwé the northern hill on the left bank had been bought together with akromasi point and the avin valley by the late m bonnat who cleared it and began shafting it for gold in the usual routine way during the last six months it has been overgrown with dense vegetation mr walker believes not unreasonably that this lode is connected with the apatim or bujiá reefs  ferrying across we could note the wild features of the ancobras mouth the bar which in smooth weather allows passage to a load of five tons not unfrequently breaks at an offing of four miles and breaks obliquely the gape is garnished on either side by little black stumps of rocks and the general effect is very unpleasant a fine school of sharks fattens on the fish inside the bar at this season the entrance narrows to a few feet the effect of a huge sandspit on the right lip and carries only six feet of water during the rains it will rise eleven feet at sánmá and at tumento twentyfour feet in a day falling with the same dangerous rapidity we shall see more of the ancobra which here separates two districts between it and cape threepoints the land is called avaláwé and the westward region extending to cape apollonia is named amrehía the amregia of jeekel and dahse meaning where people meet  we halted for breakfast at sánmá where messieurs swanzy have another storehouse and where the french company is building one for itself with characteristic slowness the settlement is illfamed for the chigo or jigger pulex penetrans unknown in my day upon the west african coast it has killed men by causing gangrenous sores from tabon footnote tabon is evidently corrupted from the popular greeting sta bom are you well how de do the brazil it crept over to são paulo de loanda and thence it spread far and wide up and down coast and deep into the interior this fact suggests that there may be truth in the theory which makes the common flea of india an immigrant from europe  at 1 pm we resumed our way along the beach under sunshine tempered by the smokes these mists however are now clearing away for the tornadoseason and insolation will become more decided we ran by sundry little bushvillages their names will be found in my companions careful routesurvey i shall notice only those which showed something notable  there is sameness in the prospect which however does not wholly lack interest soon after dawn the village urchins begin disporting themselves among the breakers and billows upon broken bits of boat while their fathers throw the castnet nearer shore the brownblack pigs and piglets root up the wet sand for shellfish and higher up the small piebald cattle loiter in the sun or shade from afar the negrogroups are not unpicturesque in their bright red and brimstone yellow sheets worn like roman togas a nearer view displays bridgeless patulous noses suggesting a figure of symbol figure8 on its side cheekbones like molehills and lips splayed out in the manner of speakingtrumpets often indeed the face is a mere attachment to the devouringapparatus throughout the day sexes and ages keep apart the nude boys perch upon stones or wornout canoes their elders affect the shade men on one side of the village and women on the other all the settlements are backed by cocoatrees in lines and clumps those who view africa biliously compare them with hearseplumes i find in them a peculiar individuality and likeness to humankind there is the chubby babe six feet high the fastgrowing hobbedehoy the adult bending away from you like a man or womanlike inclining towards you there is the bald shrunken senior and lastly appears death lean and cold and dry  between sea and settlement stand the canoes flatbottomed and tiptilted like turkish slippers where the land is low and floods are high each is mounted upon four posts fronting and outside the village stands a wallless roof of flat matting the palaverhouse the settlement is surrounded by a palisade of fronds stripped from the bamboopalm and strengthened by posts the latter put forth green shoots as soon as stuck in the ground and recall memories of robinson crusoe the general entrance has a threshold two to two and a half feet high the tenements are simple as birds nests primitive as the highlanders mudcabin and shieling of wattle and heather the outer walls are of bamboopalm fronds the partitions are of bamboopalm matting and the roofs are of bamboopalm thatch each place has its osafahin or headman and each headman has his guesthouse built of better material swish or adobe  the only approach to grandeur are the long surges and white combers of the mournful and misty atlantic they roll like the waving prairieland curl their huge heads and dash down in a fury of foam on the top of a billow we ride with a witness here and there black dots peer through the surf and to touch them is death this foul shore presents a formidable barrier to landing there absolutely is no safe place between apollonia and the ancobra european employés avoid tempting the breakers they disembark and reembark for home and that is all mr grant assures us that there is no risk mr grillett who has worked the coast since 1875 says the contrary no man knows it better or fears it more some places are worse than others for instance inenyápoli is exceptionally dangerous the sea is shallow and ships requiring eight fathoms must to be safe anchor four miles out the coastsoundings in the admiralty charts are positively unsafe and will remain so until revised on the other hand the reefs and rocks of axim bay have wholly disappeared with some exceptions seen off kikam and esyáma  looking inland we find the shore mostly subtended by a marigot or saltwater lagoon a miniature of those regular rivers which made the slave coast what it was and along the sea we can detect its presence by the trickling of little rills guttering and furrowing the sandy surface the formation of these characteristic african features which either run parallel with or are disposed at various angles to the coast is remarkably simple there is no reason to assume with lieutenant r c hart that they result from secular upheaval footnote page 186 gold coast blue book london 1881 the powerful artillery with which the ocean assails the bulwarks of the land here heaps up a narrow strip of high sandbank and the tails of the smaller streams are powerless to break through it except when swollen by the rains they maintain their level by receiving fresh water at the head and by percolation through the beach while most of them are connected with the sea  we halted for rest at the esyáma village its landmarks are the ronnier the glorious palmyra borassus flabelliformis here called womens cocoatree the village looked peculiarly neat with its straight sandy streetroads a quarter of a mile long and the tenements generally are better than those of axim we noticed the usual feature a long thatched barn of yellow clayschoolcumchapel the people are fond of planting before their doors the felfa croton or physicnut jatropha curcas whose oil so long lighted lisbon it is a tree of many uses boys suck the honey of the flowerstalk and adults drink or otherwise use as corrective of bile an infusion of the leaves and the under bark they could not give me the receipt for the valuable preparation of the green apple well known to the fantis of accra  after returning to axim we heard of rich diggings two hours march inland or north with easting from esyáma they are called yirima or chokefullthat is of gold the site is occupied by king blays family and the place is described as containing three or four reefs which have all been more or less worked by the natives after we left the coast yirima was visited by mr grant who reported it as exceptionally promising  about sunset we hit the ebumesu or winding water the people declare that it had a single mouth till the earthquakes of july 1862 which shook down accra raised a divide and made a double embouchure the eastern fork known as the páná is the drain of a large and branchy lagoon brackish water bitumencoloured or brassyyellow with poisonous vegetation and bounded by mangroves abounding in tannin these waterforests grow differently from the red and white rhizophores of eastern africa we shall again be ferried over the upper part of the western mouth both have bad bars especially the latter i therefore can by no means agree with mr walkers reportthe western outlet of the ebumesu near the village of eku enu or ekwanu is quite practicable for ordinary surfboats during the dry seasonsay half the yearand even in the middle of june i found the bar smooth and safe having for thirty years worked some of the worst bars and beaches the gaboon or the sherbro along some hundreds of miles of the west coast i am able to state that the ebumesu bar might be safely utilised for landing goods and machinery but during the heavy surf of the rainy season goods could always be disembarked at axim and if necessary carried along the beach to the mouth of the ebumesu and thence by boat to the tramway from that river to the mine this last statement is quite correct  all the aximites described the ebumesu bars as practically impassable cameron and i agreed that the only way of entering them is by running the boat ashore unloading her and warping her round the point as we shall afterwards do at princes but the

graham who dispenses elementary knowledge to the missionary pupils came to us at once and kindly offered his aid as mouf these useful men who serve as gobetweens and interpreters are called scholars by the people and are charged with making profit out of whites and blacks in the afternoon mr graham brought me two neolithic stoneimplements we then set out for the palace a large congeries of houses and huts guided by a mighty braying of horns and beating of drums and by union jacks with the most grotesque adjuncts of men and beasts planted in the clean and sandy streetroad king blay received us in his palaverhall and his costume now savoured not of europe but of fetish he had been making customs or worshipping after countryfashion and would not keep us waiting while he changed dress the cap was a kind of tall hood adorned with circles of cowries and two horns of the little bushantelope the robe was moorish long and largesleeved and both were charged with rolls of red white and blue stuff supposed to contain grígrís or talismans the ashanti medal however was still there indeed he wore it round his neck even on the march when his toilette was reduced to a waistcloth and a billycock after discussing palmwine in preference to tradegin we persuaded king blay despite all his opposition that time is gold and that with strange and indelicate haste we must set out early on the morrow for the izrah mine his main difficulty was about clearing the path he had issued strong orders upon the subject but african kings often command and no one cares to obey the monarchy is essentially limited and the lieges allow no stretch of power unless the ruling arm be exceptionally long and strong  hearing that the goldhilted official swords of the king of béin were for sale and wishing to inspect the place we set off at 330 pm to cover the 4769 yards measured along the sands by mr graham reaching our destination eighteen miles distant from axim we were carried up the long straight streetroad which leads to the old english fort it is the normal building a house on bastions both well and solidly made of stone and lime amongst the materials i found a fine yellow sandstonegrit and a nummulite so weathered that the shells stood out in strong relief both were new to us on this trapcoast and no one could say where they were quarried many thought they must have come from europe others that they are brought from inland the masonry of the seafront was pitted with seven large wounds dealt by as many shells when we broke down our own work such was the consequence of sympathising with the ashantis in 1873 when axim also was bombarded  what changes these factoryforts have seen beginning with the days of the jolly old hollanders who in doublets and trunkhose held high state commanding large garrisons and ruling the rulers of the land what banquets what carousals with sopies of the best schiedam and long claypipes stuffed with the finest tobacco when an exceptional haul of golddust or captives had come to hand but time got the better of them the abolition of the export slavetrade cut the ground from under their feet diminished profits made economy necessary and the forts were allowed to become the shadows of their former selves then came the cession to england when all appeared running on the road to ruin now however things are again changed and resurgam may be written upon these scenes of decay the mines will once more make the fortune of the gold coast and the old buildings will become useful as hospitals and storehouses and barracoons for coolie emigrants  the béin fort has been repaired and whitewashed inside by the lessees messieurs swanzy whose agent mr carr we found here in possession unlike axim it still preserves intact the outer work with its dwarf belfry over the strong doorway but the cistern in the middle of this slavecourt must make the cleanly old netherlanders turn in their tombs  opposite the fort is the normal schoolroom occasionally served by mr graham of atábo béin has a tidewaiter but no pedagogue beyond it rises the large and uneven swishhouse of the king who has lately been summonsed as a defaulting debtor to cape coast castle the single black policeman who served the writ evidently looked upon us as his colleagues the people eyed us with no friendly glances they were making custom for the rulers return the vague phrase denoted in this case a frantic battering of drums big and little a squeaking of scrannel pipes a feminine breakdown of the most effrénée description and a general libation to the bacchus of blackland a debauched and drunken ashanti who executed for our benefit a decapitationdance evidently wishing that we had been its objects thanked us ironically for a sixpence we met some difficulty in seeing the swords which were not to be sold they were the usual rusty and decayed fishslicers cameron however was kind enough to sketch them for me and they will appear in my coming book  most of the adult males had travelled inland to the tákwá or french mines where the apollonians bear the highest reputation whole gangs flock to the diggings bringing their own provisions and implements thus they have begun working on tribute and contracting for piecework footnote this information was given to me by m plisson trafficmanager to the company this is a favourable phase of the labourquestion at the same time it is clear that the labourer can easily keep the richest specimens for himself and palm off the worst stuff upon the stranger  here we are next door to the ivory coast and elephants they say are still to be found within two days north of béin the hunters cross a broad stream the tando and a dry swamp they then enter an uninhabited forest and after a couple of marches they reach the animals haunts small tusks are at times brought in but no europeans so far as i know ever killed a tusker in these wilds my informants heard that a route from béin leads to gyáman and that it may be travelled without difficulty  the following note by mr edward l mccarthy describes an excursion from béin to the unvisited essuátí made by him in august 1881  accompanied by prince john coffee heir to king blay three other chiefs their servants and my own party of krumen we left the town of béin apollonia to go up to the village in the bush called essuátí half a mile from the town we found canoes awaiting us and in these we were poled along for over half an hour over what in the dry season is a native path but now a narrow channel of water winding about in a dense jungle of reeds here and there we came upon small hillocks covered with trees in which numerous monkeys sported about emerging from these reeds one broad sheet of water presented itself to the eye encircled by a low shore fringed with canes bush and palmtrees and at its western extremity a range of hills rose out of the background the lagoon receives several small streams and empties itself into the sea by the ebumesu river its mouth being about halfway between béin and the ancobra according to the natives the river used to be navigable to its mouth but of late years has become overgrown with reeds a few years back they set to work to cut a channel through them but getting tired of the work gave it up the length of the lagoon appears to be about three to four miles and about one to one and a half in breadth its major axis runs parallel to the coastline or nearly due east and west twenty minutes paddling brought us round the point of a small headland where we came in sight of a pretty lakevillage built upon piles at some little distance from the shore the whole forming a most picturesque and animated scene from house to house canoes laden with people plantains c were passing to and fro groups of villagers some standing others sitting upon the raised bambooplatforms outside their houses were busy bartering fish for plantains while the children played around apparently unconscious of any danger from falling into the water the settlement consisted of over forty houses mostly of bamboo a few of swish forming one long irregular line and three or four standing away from the rest round a corner of land after the fanti custom these houses were built on a bambooplatform supported by piles and raised above the water some three and a half feet one half of the platform is covered by the house the other half left free is used to fish from for the children to play about on and for receptions when palavers are held  the distance from the shore varies with the overflow of the lake at the time of my visit about thirty to forty yards though for miles beyond this the ground was saturated with water whose depth varied from three and a half to nine feet the piles are made of stout sticks the mode of driving them in is to lash two canoes abreast by means of two sticks or paddles placed transversely leaving an open space of about two and a half feet between them two men in each canoe and facing each other then vigorously twist and churn about the pole or rather stick into the soft bottom of the lagoon some fifteen of these poles are thus driven in and firmly braced together by crosspieces upon which the platform is constructed and on this again the house is built  we stopped here to breakfast before ascending the bousaha river and while so doing i counted at one time over forty natives sitting round us on the platform i was not without my fears that we should all be precipitated into the water but the structure though in appearance frail and very rude was far stronger than what it looked  i closely questioned the natives as to why they had built their village upon the lake and they invariably gave as their reason that they chiefly fished at night and as the water often overflowed they would have to build their houses too far away to be able to come and go during the night whereas now they said we are close to where we catch our fish and we often catch them even from our houses underneath each house were tied from one to five and sometimes more canoes these were much lighter more rounded off in the keel stem and stern than the beachcanoes  three white men they told me had visited their villagecaptain dudley in 1876 judging from the age of a child who was born at the time of his visit captain grant and mr gillett in 1878 i afterwards learnt were the other two none of them went further into the interior  after breakfast we crossed the lagoon passing on our way several canoes fishing in the middle the water was very clear and blue and of considerable depth judging from a stone dropped in unfortunately i had no other means of sounding not until a dozen yards from the shore were any signs of a stream discernible pushing aside some reeds we entered a narrow lane of water varying from three feet to eighteen feet in width deep and according to the natives navigable for three days by canoes this stream is known by the name of bousaha and the lagoon by ebumesu after two hours hard paddling in a northerly direction we stopped to walk to the village of níbá a large place principally engaged in raising food for the coast fishingvillages and béin and also in elephanthunting  elephants at the time of my visit were reported in large numbers two days journey in the bush and the villagers were then organising a party for a hunt outside the village i came across the skull of a young elephant from which i extracted the teeth the only report of a white man having been here before was long ago when some of the old men told me he came from assini direction but turned back again the village was neatly laid out in streets and was beautifully clean  another three hours pull still bearing northwards brought us to the village of essuati a smaller place than níbá but very prettily laid out with trees surrounded by seats in its central street the people here as at níbá were mainly engaged in agriculture  crowds came to see the white man many of the women and children never having been to axim the nearest place where whites are to be found and consequently had never seen one before  after a few days stay here i returned to the coast while there i came across a curious fishtrap a description of which may not be uninteresting across a stick planted in the riverbed a light piece of bamboo was tied and at its further extremity was suspended a string carrying fishhooks above these a broad piece of wood suspended so as to be half in and half out of the water acted as a float and spindle above this again were tied four large shells so that when a fish is hooked the shells begin to jingle and the fishermen hid in the bush immediately rush out and secure the fish  illustration of fish trap    chapter xviii  the

and we hammocked in the cool and misty morning along shore to inyenápolithe word means greater inyena as opposed to inyenachi the less in the house of mr j eskine i saw his tradesman bartering cloth

will be preserved in the proverb there is no market wherein the dove with the pouting breast the cypraea has not traded the same is the case with the oldest money round and perforated quartzstones which suggest the ringcoinage of ancient egypt from inyenápoli preceded by king blay who so managed that a fair path had been hastily cut through the bush we struck inland the course being northwards bending to the northeast and east the first hour covering some three miles lay partly over a flat plain of grass used for thatch pimpled with red anthills and broken by lines and patches of dense jungle these savannahs are common near the sea we had already remarked one behind béin they denote the false coast and they become during the wet season almost impassable swamps and mudfields  then we struck the valley of ebumesu winding water whose approach rank with mire and corded with roots is the great dismal swamp of dahome in miniature here seven and a quarter miles from the mouth the stream measures about twenty yards broad the thalweg is deep and navigable and the water bitumencoloured with vegetable matter tastes brackish there is the usual wasteful profusion of growth ferns ramp upon the trees cameron counted at akankon two dozen different species within a few hundred yards orchids bunch the boughs and boles of dead forestgiants and llianas the african tietie varying in growth from a packthread to a cable act as cordage to connect the growths  there is evidently a shorter cut up the river at whose lagoonmouth craft can be hired our ferryman with his single canoe wasted a good hour over the work of a few minutes we then remounted hammock and struck the true coast a charming bit of country gradually upsloping to the north and east the path passed through the plantationvillages benyá and arábo growing bananas and maize cassava and groundnuts peppers and papaws cocoas and bamboopalms raphia vinifera the latter not only build the houses they also yield wine of two kinds both however inferior to the produce of the oilpalm elais guineënsis the adúbé drawn from the cut spathe which continues to yield for two or three months is held to be wholesome diuretic and laxative the inséfu is produced in morticelike holes cut along the felled trunk they fill freely for a fortnight to three weeks when fires must be lighted below to make the juice run into the pots it is sweeter and better flavoured than the former but it is accused of being unwholesome the people drink palmwine at different hours of the day according to taste the beverage is mild as milk in the morning after noon it becomes heady and rough as the sourest cider the useful palm bears a huge bolsterlike roll of fruit which should be tried for oil cameron brought home a fine specimen for kew here the land is evidently most fertile and will form good farms for the company leaving arábo we forded the double stream called the bilá which runs a few yards west of the concession the banks are grown with rice showing how easily they will produce all the food necessary for the labourers the quality moreover is better and the grain more nutritious than the chinese import the bed of bright sand supplying the sweetest water has in places been worked for gold by the women but much remains to be done  in another hour making a total of six miles from inyenápoli we reached our destination arábokasu or one stone for top we lodged our belongings in the bamboohouse newly built by mr grant finding it perfectly fit for temporary use before i left axim mr c c robertson landed there instructed by the izrah company to choose a fair site for a framehouse mounted on piles it was presently made in england but unfortunately not after the lagos fashion with the bedrooms opening upon a verandah seven to nine feet broad and a double roof of wood with airspace between instead of thatch and corrugated iron the house measures 52 x 32 feet and contains four bedrooms a diningroom and the managers office a comfortable tenement of the kind costs from 300l to 500l an exceptional article 700l  we at once set out to cast a first glance upon the izrah mine the word is properly izíá a stone also the name of the man who began golddigging on the spot this style of nomenclature is quite countryfashion apparently izíá became izrah to assume a scriptural sound if so why not go the whole animal and call it the isaiah  this fine concession is a rectangular parallelogram whose dimensions are 2000 yards long from north to south by a breadth of half the village stands outside the southwestern angle and the fía rivulet runs through the southeastern corner the surface is rolling ground with a rise and a depression trending from southwest to northeast the whole extent except where bush lingers is an old plantation of bananas manioc and groundnuts there is an ample supply of good hard timber but red pitchpine or creosoted teak from england would last much longer amongst the trees are especially noted the copal the gamboge rich in sticky juice the brovi said to be the hardest wood and the dum or african mahogany oldfieldia africana well known in ceylon as excellent material for boatbuilding there was an abundance of the calabarbean physostigma venenosum once used for an ordealpoison and now applied by surgery in ophthalmic and other complaints the tietie as angloafricans call the ropelike creepers was also plentiful it may prove valuable for cordage and possibly for papermaking i was pleased to see the ease with which the heapedup junglegrowth is burnt at this season and the facility of roadmaking half a dozen kruboys with their matchets can open at the rate of some miles a day a path fit to carry a sulky and the ground wants only metalling with the stone which lines every stream at the same time i hold that here as in mexico we should begin with railways and tramways nor will there be any difficulty in keeping down the jungle the soft and silky bahamagrass has been brought from sá leone to axim where it covers the open spaces and it grows well at akankon there is no trouble except to plant a few roots which extend themselves afar and the carpet when thick allows like the orangetree no undergrowth  the izrah concession is due to the energy and activity of mr r b n walker who has told its history in march 1881 when he first visited it there had been a black rush the din and clamour of human voices were audible from afar and on reaching the mine he found some 300 natives hard at work i was told that the greatest number at one time was 2000 the account reminds us exactly of the human floods so famous in other parts of the mining world the men were sinking pits of unusual size along the southeastern slope of the hillock where the great clearing now is the excitement was remarkable and negroes not being given to hard and continuous labour without adequate inducement the bustle and the uproar and the daily increasing numbers of miners flocking from considerable distances were evidence sufficient that there was an unusually good find their pits attaining a maximum of 12 feet square by 55 deep extended over some 150 yards from nne to ssw with a breadth of about 20 from some of these holes rich quartz had been taken one piece the size of a 32pounder cannonball yielding more than ten ounces of gold a shaft however soon caved in for the usual reason it had been inadequately timbered and incautiously widened at the bottom to the shape of a sodawaterbottle all these works owed a royalty to ahin blay but his dues were irregularly paid and consequently he preferred to them a fixed rental of 100l per annum  the following anecdote will show how limited is the power of these kings he of apollonia wished to sell this southern patch of ground worked by the natives it being in fact the terminal tail of the izrah reef and the key of the property but one etié headman of kikam bluntly refused presently this chieflet agreed to sell to mr grant the whole tract a length of one thousand fathoms from north to south the breadth being left undetermined but etié was deep in messieurs swanzys books and he wanted ready money the tempter came in the shape of mr dawson a native missionary whom i met a score of years ago at agbóme and whose name appears in all narratives of the last ashanti war although an employé of the tákwá or french mine he bought for himself paying 200l the best part of the reef 100 fathoms leaving the buttend of inferior value to mr grant this was a direct breach of contract and might be brought into the local lawcourts i advised however an arrangement à laimable and i still hope to see it carried out  life at arábokasu was pleasant enough the site rising about 120 feet above oceanlevel permits the doctor alias the seabreeze to blow freshly and we distinctly heard the sough of the surf mornings and evenings were exceedingly fine and during the cool nights we found blankets advisable these small countries little villages are remarkably clean and so are the villagers who unlike certain whiteskins bathe at least once a day at this season we had nothing to complain of mosquitoes or sandflies nor was insektenpulver wanted inside the house the only physiological curiosity in the settlement was a spotted boy a regular piebald like a circuspony even his head grew a triangular patch of white hair we wanted him for the london aquarium but there were difficulties in the way amongst the apollonians albinoes are not uncommon nor are the children put to death as by the ashantis both races cut the boss from hunchbacks after decease and make fetish over it to free the future family from similar distortion our villagers told us strange tales of a magician near assini who can decapitate a man and restore him to life and who lately had placed a dogs head on a boys body who can doubt the fact the boy was there  i will now borrow freely from the diary kept during our five days inspection of the izrah diggings cameron worked hard at a rough survey of the ground which mr walker had attempted with considerable success seeing that he carried only a pedometer and a small pocketcompass my proceedings were necessarily limited as i had no authority to disburse money  february 3the night had been somewhat noisy with the hyenalike screams which startled our soldiers en route to kumasi they are said to proceed from a kind of hyrax  about the size of a rabbit the krumen call it a bushdog and as will appear cameron holds it to be a lemur the morning was cool but not clear and the country so far like the garden of eden that there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground but the mist was a scotch mist which in less humid lands might easily pass for fine rain and the drip drip drip of heavy dewdrops from the broad bananaleaves sounded like a sharp shower at this hour the birds are wide awake and hungry a hundred unknown songsters warble their native woodnotes wild the bush resounds with the shriek of the parrot and the cooing of the ringdove which reminds me of the kukuku where oh where of umarikhayyám its rival is the tsilfuifuifui or hair grown meaning that his locks are too long and there is no one to cut or shave them upon the nearest tall tree making a spiteful noise to frighten away all specimens sits the watchbird or apateplu so called from his cry he is wary and cunning but we bagged two the clockbird supposed to toll every hour has a voice which unites the bark of a dog the caw of a crow and the croak of a frog he is rarely seen and even cleverer than hair grown more familiar sounds are the roucoulement of the pigeon and the tapping of the woodpecker the only fourfooted beast we saw was the small bushantelope with black robe of which a specimen was brought home and the only accident was the stinging of a kruboy by a spider more spiteful than a scorpion  reaching the ground after a ten minutes walk we examined the principal reef as carefully as we could the strike is nearly northsouth the dip easterly and the thickness unknown the trialshaft sunk by mr walker in the centre of the southern line was of considerable size eight by twelve feet and the depth measured thirty of which four held water based upon claymud the original native shafts to the south are of two kinds the indigenous chimneypit and the parallelogramshaped well borrowed from europeans the latter varied in dimensions from mere holes to oblongs six by seven feet and all the more important were roofed and thatched with penthouses of palmleaf to keep out the rain the shafttimbering also a loan from foreigners consisted of perpendicular bamboofronds tied with bushrope to a frame of poles cut from small trees they corresponded with our sets and laths there were rude ladders but useful enough two bamboos connected by rungs of tietie the sollars were shaky platforms of branches but there was no sign of a winch  we set krumen and porters to clear and lay out the southern boundary and to open a path leading direct to the beach one would fancy that nothing is easier than to cut bush in a straight line from pole to pole especially when these were marked by strips of red calico yet the moment our backs were turned the wrong direction was taken it pains ones heart to see the shirking of work the slipping away into the bush for a sleep and the roasting of maize and palmnutsgroundpigs fare they call the latterwhenever an opportunity occurs the dawdling walk and the dragging of one leg after the other with intervals to stand and scratch are a caution even the villagers appear incapable of protracted labour unless it leads immediately to their benefit and the future never claims a thought  february 4after the southeastern corner had been marked with a tall cross we opened a path from arábokasu to the trialshaft we threw a bridge of the felled trunks cumbering the clearing over the fía rivulet and again examined its bed gold had been found in it by the women and this as usual gave rise to the discovery of its subtending reef the whole of the little rivervalley extending to the sea should be bought and worked there is no doubt that it will turn out rich in the channel we found an outcrop of slates both crumbling and compact this is always a welcome sign to the east of the water there is a second quartzreef running parallel with the upper ridge and apparently untouched by the pick  the next two days were spent in finishing the southern line and in planting a post at the southwestern extremity here we found that our workmen had gone entirely wrong and we were forced to repeat the work i had exposed myself overfreely to the sun and could do little for the next week fortunately my energetic companion was in better condition  february 7cameron took bearings from the south of the concession which he placed with mr walker four geographical miles from the sea other informants had exaggerated it to him and m dahse writes six after 1000 to 1200 yards he struck the false coast crossed a deep and fetid swamp and after a short rise came upon the miry borders of the ebumesu he canoed 800 yards downstream without difficulty and finding the water brackish while the ebbtide ran strong he considered that this part was rather a lagoon than a river the people also assured us that it runs along the coast ending near and north of the béin fortvillage  in the evening my companion and mr grant walked to the northwest of the concession the place is called by mr walker iziábookah izíá hill but the natives ignore the term here at a distance of 900 yards north and by west true of the arábokasu village they found and collected specimens of a fine reef of hard white quartz womens washings were numerous showing the proper way to begin working the ground the right of prospecting the whole of the section to the ne had been secured by mr walker for mr irvine and presently the apollonian concession appeared in the mining journals  we had now done all we could the circumstances of the case compelled us to study the geology and topography of the property rather than its geology and mineralogy nothing now remained save to rebrousser chemin good king blay who had formally made over to me possession of the izrah mine left us for his own village in order to cure an inflamed foot he attributed it to the fetish of some unfriend but it turned out to be guineaworm a malady from which many are suffering this season we parted upon the most friendly terms and arranged to meet again  both of us came to the conviction that the izrah concession will pay and pay well but instead of the routine shafting and tunnelling it must be treated by hydraulicking and washing away the thirty feet of auriferous soil whose depth covers the reef the bed of the fía will supply the water and a forcepump worked by men or preferably by steampower thus we shall keep the mine dry otherwise it will be constantly flooded moreover the land seems to be built for ditching and sluicing and the trenches will want only a plankbox with a metal grating at the head i can only hope that the operations will be conducted by an expert hand who knows something of the californian or the australian diggings  on february 8 we left arábokasu intending to march upon the inyoko concession our guide and people however seemed to change every five minutes what they might call their minds and at last they settled to try the worst but to us the most interesting line at 8 am we struck into the bush viâ a heap of huts the matinga village at the southeastern corner of the fine mineral property here womens washings again appeared at the achyáko settlement we crossed the two branches of the fía one measures twenty feet wide and two feet six inches deep in the dry season it runs a knot an hour and thus the supply is ample about a mile further on we were carried across the gwabisa stream four feet wide by eighteen inches deep running over a bed of quartzpebbles this ended the true coast  the false coast began close to the little settlement known as ashankru it shows a fine quartzreef striking north fourteen degrees east the formation was shown by the normal savannah and junglestrips about noon we were ferried over the eastern arm of the ebumesu known as the pápá i have noted scanty belief in the bar of the ebumesu proper the western feature the eastern entrance however perhaps can be used between the end of december and march and in calm weather would offer little difficulty to the surfboats transhipping machinery from the steamers  beginning a little east of the esyámo village the pápá lagoon subtends the coast we shot over it in the evening and at night found quarters at the ezrimenu village marked ebumesu in old maps  this return march of two hours or so had been a mere abomination the path which had not been cleared led through a tangle of foul and fetid thicket upon which the sun darted a sickly malignant beam creepers and llianas some of which are spiny and poisonous barred the thread of path which could not be used for hammocks the several streambeds about to prove so precious run chocolatetinted water over vegetable mire rich when stirred in sulphuretted hydrogen the only bridges are fallen trunks amongst

from axim to the izrah mine and the face of the country will be changed within a year  as i was still weak cameron and mr grant early next morning feb 9 canoed over the 300 yards or so of the pápá lagoon bounding ezrimenu village on the landward side they then struck nearly due north and after walking threequarters of an hour perhaps two miles and a half over a good open path easily convertible into a cartroad they reached the inyoko concession it measures 2400 yards square beginning at the central shaft on the northern side of the hill which gives it a name and thus it lies only about eight miles westward of the ancobra river the ground has not been much worked of late years but formerly kwáko akka the tyrant of apollonia rich in blood and ore who was deposed by the british colonial government about 1850 and was imprisoned in cape coast castle is said to have obtained from it much of his wealth  they found the strike of the hill approximately north 22º east true footnote in laying down limits great attention must be paid to variation as a rule 19º 45 west has been assumed from the admiralty chartsgood news for the london attorney at tumento this figure rises to 20º upon the coast it must be changed to 19º 15 w and in other places to 16º 40 the dip appears to be easterly and the natives have worked the abbruch or débris which have fallen from the reefcrest this wall may be a continuation of the akankon formation both are rich in a highly crystalline quartz of livid blue apparently the best colour throughout the gold region the surfaceground of yellowish marl with quartzpebbles is evidently auriferous and below it lies a harder red earth rusty with iron from the southern boundary of the inyoko concession and the village of that name runs a strong outcrop of a kindly white quartz which when occurring in conjunction with the blue usually denotes that both are richer than when a single colour is found such at least is camerons experience  mr walker who secured this concession also notes that the native pits were very shallow and superficial he was pressed for time and sunk his trialshaft but little more than three fathoms here free gold was visible in the blue quartz which yielded upwards of one ounce per ton  my companion found the shaft still open and observed that the valley contained many holes and washingpits one was pointed out to him by mr grant as having yielded twenty ounces of dust in one day these reports recall the glories of california and australia in the olden time the little etubu water which runs 200 yards from the shaft would easily form a reservoir supplying the means of washing throughout the year here then are vast facilities for hydraulic work millions of cubic feet can be strained of thin gold at a minimum expenditure there will be less dead work and getting would be immediate thus too as in california the land will be prepared for habitation and agriculture and the conditions of climate will presently be changed for the better  early in the forenoon jan 9 we hammocked to the kikam village and were much disappointed king blay too lame to leave his home had sent his interpreter to show us the yirima or chokefull reef and the man doubtless influenced by some intrigue gave us wrong information moreover the safahin etié before mentioned had gone they said to his lands at princes he was probably lurking in some adjacent hut we breakfasted in his house but all the doors were bolted and locked and his people would hardly serve us with drinking water we attempted in vain to buy the boma or fetishdrum a venerable piece of furniture hung round with human crania of which only the roofs remained king blay however eventually sent us home a boma and it was duly exhibited in town kikam was the only place in apollonia where we met with churlish treatment no hospitality however could be expected when the strangers were supposed to be mixed up in a native quarrel  unwilling to linger any longer in the uninviting and uninteresting spot we ordered our hammocks set out at noon and following the line over which we had travelled reached axim at 5 pm  we had no other reason to complain of our weeks trip except its inordinate expense apparently one must be the owner of a rich goldmine to live in and travel on the gold coast we had already in a fortnight got through the 50l of silver sent from england and this too without including the expenses of bed and board  we came home with the conviction that the inyoko property should have been the second proposed for exploitation coming immediately after the apatim our reasons were the peculiar facilities of reaching it and the certainty that when work here begins it will greatly facilitate communication with izrah but progress is slow upon the gold coast and our wishes may still be realised  i cannot better conclude this chapter than with an extract from captain brackenburys narrative of the ashanti war footnote blackwoods edinburgh and london 1874 vol ii pp 351 352 it will show how well that experienced and intelligent officer foresaw in 1873 the future of the gold coast  are there no means of opening this country up to trade no means of infusing into it an element superior to that of the fanti races of holding in check the savagery of the inland tribes and preventing the whole coast again becoming abandoned to fetishism and human sacrifices to the writers mind there is but one method and that one by an appeal to mans most ignoble passionthe lust of gold this country is not without reason called the gold coast gold is there in profusion and to be had for the seeking we have ourselves seen the women washing the sand at cape coast and finding gold when captain thompson visited the wassaw wásá country he found the roads impassable at night by reason of the goldpits upon them captain butler describes western akim as a country teeming with gold captain glover has said that in eastern akim gold is plentiful as potatoes in ireland and the paths were honeycombed with goldpits dawson has distinctly stated his opinion that the fanti goldmines are far more valuable than those of ashantithat the only known ashanti goldmine of great value is that of manoso whereas the wassaw and the nquamfossoo mines as well as the akim mines have rockgold nuggets in profusion he says that the ashantis get their gold from the fantis in exchange for slaves whom they buy for two or three loads of coller kola nuts worth less than half an ounce of gold and sell to the fantis for as much as two and a quarter ounces of gold let our government prospect these mines let acts be passed similar to those by which vast railway companies are empowered to compel persons to sell their land at a fair price let our government by means of houssa troops guarantee protection to companies formed to work the mines and let the payment to the kings in whose country they are be by royalties upon the gold obtained the kings would offer the utmost resistance to their mines being thus taken and worked but they have never worked them properly themselves and they will never work them properly and it would be no injustice to allow others to do so if the true value of these services were ascertained by government mining engineers if the government would guarantee protection to those engaged in working them companies would soon be formed to reap the rich harvest to be found upon the coast chinese coolies would be imported who would breed in with the natives and infuse some energy into the fanti races trade would soon follow roads be made and the whole country opened up the engagement of our government should be a limited one for if once the goldmines were at work there would be no further fear that the country would ever fell back into the hands of the ashantis  the counsel is good but we have done better private companies have undertaken the work and have succeeded where the government would fail so far from resisting the kings have been too glad to accept our offers and now the course is forwards without costing the country a farthing and with a fair prospect of supplying to it a large proportion of the precious metal still wanted  notesince these lines were written the yiri full ma quite reef has been leased by mr grant who sent home specimens showing i am told 14 oz per ton

older date the type of this growth is the red camwoodtree with its white flower of the sweetest savour imagine an english elm studded with pinks or daisies gardenias or hyacinths there is nothing more picturesque than the shiftings and changes of aspect upon these african streams which at first seem so monotonous after dawn the smoking water feeling tepid to the hand and warmer than the atmosphere

with rocky reefs showed us twentytwo turns in a few miles some were horseshoebends sweeping clean round to the south and one described a curve of 170º after slow and interrupted paddling for an hour and a half at 6 pm when night neared we halted at the village of esubeyah or watermade footnote the radical of water is su curiously corresponding with turkish and with that oldest of the turkish

fresh butter the price is high 1s 6d a bottle or for the case of fortyeight imperial pints 72s this however is the coast not the cost figure for invalids who are nauseated by the sickly oversugared stuff popularly called tinjuice and who feel life put in them by rum and milk it is an invaluable comfort  we left esubeyah in the lizards sun at 7 am and found the river changed for the worse the freshets had uptorn from the banks the tallest trees which in places formed a timberfloor and the surfboat gallantly charged till she leaked the huge trunks over which she had often to be lifted nothing would be easier than to clear away these obstacles a few pounds of guncotton would remove snags and sawyers and dredging by boats would do the rest then princes river would become an excellent highway  an hour and a halfs slow paddling placed us at the landingplace of bekaí a village in general the usual hole in the bush here navigation ends in the dry season we walked to and through the mean little settlement and established ourselves at animakru footnote the english croom is a corruption of krumu or krum in the village properly speaking kru and man are the town or common centre of

worst of all plagues the sandfly  after breakfasting we set out north over a sandy level clearly reclaimed from the sea and in a few minutes struck the true coast here begins the st john miningground conceded for prospecting to messieurs gillett and selby a fair path runs up hillocks of redyellow clay metalled with rounded quartz and ironstonegravel roped with roots and barred with trees their greatest elevation may have been 120 feet two parallel ridges trending northnortheast are bisected by torrents pouring westward to the river now dry they have rolled down huge boulders in their frequent floods these hardheads which try the hammer show a revetment of cellular iron upon a solid core of greenstone and bluish trap some fragments not a little resembled the clayslates of the brazilian goldmines such was the concession which we named são joão do principe  presently the chief mrá kwámi announced to us that we had reached the northern boundaryline of the estate he now would have left us as it is not customary when gold is in question for one headman to enter anothers country we succeeded however in persuading him to show us the other side of the river a short walk up and down hill led to the ford of the yenna the native name probably a corruption of st john it lies a little above the dyke where the stream breaks into a dwarf fall and below the crossing where a ferry formerly plied we now found a regular river no longer a lagoonstream the clear water most unlike the mattersuspending and bitumencoloured fluid of the lower bed was beautified by lilies with long leaves and broad flowers of virgin white  we rode the kruboys pickaback across the broken reef through which the stream bursts and brawls and walked a few paces up the left bank to the kumasi footnote

polissoirs of ancient date littering the village cameron who had before visited the site and had remarked how vigorously the placergravels had been attacked by the natives would hydraulick by means of the st johns river this might also be done by damming up and tapping the adjacent bottom and if routine work be wanted it would cost little to construct upon the topmost crest a large reservoir with channels to conduct the rains and thus secure a fair fall for the water  we slept once more at animakru and here cameron made sure of his position by jupiter and procyon and by his valuable watchchronometer the gift of his brotherofficers it worked peculiarly well the st johns mine lies in north lat 4º 49 44 and in west long g 2º 6 44 while the owners would place it seven miles from the sea it is distant only 22 from old fort brandenburg early next morning we packed and prepared for return the chief mrá kwámi insisting upon escorting us and now the difference of travel in africa and england struck me forcibly fancy a band of negro explorers marching uninvited through the squires manor strewing his lawn and tennisground with all manner of rubbish housing their belongings in his dining and drawing and best bedrooms which are at once vacated by his wife and family turning his cook out of his or her kitchen calling for the keys of his dairy and poultryyard hothouses and cellar and rummaging the whole mansion for curios and heirlooms interesting to the negro anthropologist fancy also their bidding him to be ready next morning for sporting and collecting purposes with all his pet servants his steward and his headgardener his studgroom and his gamekeeper and allowing by way of condescension mr squire to carry their spears bows and arrows bitterly deriding his weapons the while as they proceed to whip his troutstream to pluck his pet plants to shoot his pheasants and to kill specimens of his rarest birds for exhibition in africa fancy their enquiring curiously about his superstitions sitting in his pew asking for bits of his east window and criticising his fetish in general ending with patting him upon the back and calling him a jolly old cock finally fancy the squire greatly enjoying such treatment and feeling bitterly hurt unless handled after this fashion paddling down stream we collected for kew but the hopelessness of the task weighs upon the spirits a square mile of such flora would take a week there is a prodigious variety of vegetation and the quantity of edible berries fowls lard ashantipapaw and the guineapeach sarcophalus esculentus would gladden the heart of a gorilla every larger palmtrunk was a fernery every dead bole was an orchidry and huge fungi two feet broad fed upon the remains of their victims climbers chiefly papilionaceous

with marantas whose broad green leafage was lined with pink and purple deep in shadow lay black miry sloughs of sickening odour near which the bed of father thames at low water would be scented with rosewater and the caverns formed by the arching roots of the muddy mangrove looked haunts fit for crocodile and behemoth and all manner of unclean deadly beasts and there are little miseries for african collectors waitabit thorns tear clothes and skin treesnakes turn the kruboys not pale but the colour of boiled liver their bowels fail them as the natives say each tree has its ant big or small black or red and all sting more or less we see their armies marching up the trunks and the brush of a bough brings down a little shower monstrous mangroveflies and small browncoloured huri most spiteful biters and wasps here and there assail the canoe and we are happy if we escape a swarm of the wild bees their curious treaclelike honey is enjoyed by the people  we landed in due time at

chairs it belonged to one of the penins or elders the chapel with its three front and five lateral windows is the best we have yet seen the schoolmaster mr sego lives in a house hard by and the adjacent school a wattled cottage echoes to the voices of some thirty to forty scholars the town looks prosperous building is easy oysters and other shells supply lime the clay dug to the north makes good adobes and stone is easily quarried from the old fort  we found princes in a state of unusual jollity drinking the proceeds of their three puncheons dancing and playing what sá leone calls warry footnote a game with counters and holes in the ground or a board hollowed with cups the same called báo or tables is found in east africa zanzibar and cameron traced it extending clear across the dark

very black face was dazzlingly chalked lines by threes running from hairroots to nosebridge and meeting others drawn across the temples the orbits of the eyes were whitened and thence triple streaks stretched up the nose and across the cheeks hung to the extensive necklace of beads and other matters were tassels of dry white fibre her forearms carried yellow bunches of similar material and she held a broom of blackened bamboo and the metal bell familiar to unyamwezi whilst the juniors danced and sang the elders drank and gambled  after a cool and comfortable night we visited the ruins which

chapel remains on the northern side old iron guns still cumber the embrasures and the ground  issuing by the northern face which has been torn down for ashlar we set up the photographic stand and took the northwestern angle here an enormous fig draws its life from the death of the wall the morning air in the shade was delicious a great contrast with the heavy dampness of axim and the view of the st johns river west and of cape threepoints east was charming with usual neglect the photographer had sent out his machine and dry plates without any means of developing them we therefore worked blindly and could not see results  when embarking in princes bay where the surf was perfectly safe we were informed a little too late of a valuable goldmine called kokobené it lies close behind the village akitáki which we had seen during our mornings walk along the beach leading to cape threepoints the chief eshánchi promised to forward specimens of the reefs and did not forget to keep his promise the quartzspecimens which were brought to us at akankon by wafápa or barnabas promised excellently and i authorised mr grant to buy an exploring right of the kokobenéakitáki diggings their position as well as their quality will render them valuable they will prove a second apatim  we returned to axim on february 19 after a short but very satisfactory trip which added much to our knowledge of the coast and its ways it had also the merit of being economical we took matters in hand and consequently our four days cost us only 2l 8s  i have spoken much about hydraulicking in this chapter and i shall now borrow a few details concerning the operation from sir william logan who in his geological survey of canada quotes mr william p blake speaking of california the learned author writes in this method the force of a jet of water with great pressure is made available both for excavating and washing the auriferous earth the water issuing in a continuous stream with great force from a large hosepipe like that of a fireengine is directed against the base of a bank of earth and gravel and tears it away the bank is rapidly undermined the gravel is loosened violently rolled together and cleansed from any adhering particles of gold while the fine clay and the sand are carried off by the water in this manner hundreds of tons of earth and gravel may be removed and all the gold which they contain liberated and secured with greater ease and expedition than ten tons could be excavated and washed in the old way all the earth and gravel of a deposit is moved washed and carried off through long sluices by the water leaving the gold behind square acres of earth on the hillsides may thus be swept away into the hollows without the aid of a pick or a shovel in excavation water performs all the labour moving and washing the earth in one operation while in excavating by hand the two processes are of necessity entirely distinct the value of this method and the yield of gold as compared with the older one can hardly be estimated  the water acts constantly with uniform effect and can be brought to bear upon almost any point where it would be difficult for men to work it is especially effective in a region covered by trees where the tangled roots would greatly retard the labour of workmen in such places the stream of water washes out the earth from below and tree after tree falls before the current any gold which may have adhered to the roots being washed away with a pressure of sixty feet and a pipe of from one and a half to two inches aperture over 1000 bushels of earth can be washed out from a bank in a day  earth which contains only onetwentyfifth part of a grain of gold equal to onefifth of a cent in value to the bushel may be profitably washed by this method and any earth or gravel which will pay the expense of washing in the old way gives enormous profits by the new process to wash successfully in this way requires a plentiful supply of water at an elevation of from fifty to ninety feet above the bedrock footnote this is by no means necessary the jet can be thrown from below like the firemans hose playing upon a burning house i shall return to this highly important subject and a rapid slope or descent from the base of the bank of earth to be washed so that the waste water will run off through the sluices bearing with it gravel sand and suspended clay                                       in the case of a deposit in north carolina where ten men were required for thirtyfive days to dig the earth with pick and shovel and wash it in sluices two men with a single jet of water could accomplish the same work in a week the great economy of this method is manifest from the fact that many old deposits in the riverbeds the gravel of which had been already washed by hand have again been washed with profit by the hydraulic method  in california the whole art of working the diluvial golddeposits was revolutionised by this new method the auriferous earth lying on hills and at some distance above the level of the watercourses would in the ordinary methods be excavated by hand and brought to the water but by the present system the water is brought by aqueducts to the golddeposits and whole square miles which were before inaccessible have yielded up their precious metal it sometimes happens from the irregular distribution of the gold in the diluvium in california that the upper portions of a deposit do not contain gold enough to be washed by the ordinary methods and would thus have to be removed at a considerable expense in order to reach the richer portion below by the hydraulic method however the cost of cutting away and excavating is so trifling that there is scarcely any bank of earth which will not pay the expense of washing down in order to reach the rich deposits of gold beneath  to conclude our collection of plants was sent to the herbarium kew and as the appendix ii part ii shows was kindly catalogued by the learned professor d oliver    chapter xx  from axim to ingotro and akankon  after a long palaver with the three claimants to the akankon miningground kofi blaychi little blay kwáko jum and safahin sensensé the lessor we left axim once more february 24 to inspect the head of the ancobra river at the sleepingplace kumprasi we were visited by mr cascaden districtcommissioner for tákwá a finelooking man of fifteen stone pulled down to twelve by dysentery he was speedily followed to england by his remplaçant dr duke  next morning when the thick white fog which made the smoking river resemble father rhine in autumn had been licked up by fiery rays we embarked together with chief apó of asánta the honest old owner of the ingotro concession our conveyance was the effuenta a steamlaunch attached to the mine of that name bought secondhand and a fine specimen of what launches ought not to be built by messieurs dickenson of birkenhead she is much too small 36 feet by 8 for a river which even in the depth of the dries averages two fathoms and rarely runs less than ten feet the engines are over far from the boiler and the long raking stern swells out into a big belly worthy of a manatee or a dutch hoy her boiler had been replaced with the usual inconsequence she had been repaired by an intelligent artisan mr emery but as he was allowed no tools and no time he contented himself with reporting her in good working order consequently after every halfhour we had to unscrew the safetyvalve let off steam and fill the boiler with a funnel and a tin pot pleasant three hours under a thin boardawning in a broiling sun off a poisonous mangroveswamp presently she had to be started by the surfboat lashed to one side and a large canoe to the other finally after a last breakdown we saw steamlaunch effuenta lying high and dry upon the beach at sánmá  we had nothing to complain of the engineer mr william george a sá leonite and of the helmsman kwámina ekum a gold coast man both did their best with the heavily laden trio of boats cameron established himselfcompass log lead and dredgein the steamer stern his admirable geographical labours in crossing africa are after a few years of a swiftmoving age lapsing lethewards and             to have done is to hang   quite out of fashion like a rusty nail   in monumental mockery  now he has another opportunity of doing valuable service none of these positions having been established by observations and of showing travellers how topography should be worked he has before him for correction the hydrographic chart which pretends to nothing within the coast and the river ankobra and tarquah gold mines printed in 1878 by captain louis wyatt then districtcommissioner for axim this first attempt at a regular survey is meritorious for an amateur but of course it cannot compare with the produce of a scientific and experienced naval surveyor we had lieut jeekel before alluded to but his scale 1250000 is too small for details i did not see till long after our return from this excursion the then unfinished map by m paulus dahse a veteran westcoaster who has spent years in travelling through the interior my fellowvoyager also was the first to show me the various cartes printed and published by the late m bonnat footnote carte des concessions de the african gold coast company par m j bonnat paris august 1879 beginning south at tumento it does not show the southern fork of the bonsá or abonsá river which falls into the ancobras left bank and it ends a little north of asseman the cemetery of the kings m bonnat had already printed in 1877 a chart of the river ankobra extending north as far as the gold mines of aodoua  the ancobra is an enlarged copy of the yenna or princes river there are the same swampy borders and impenetrable forests as captain wyatt entitles them while the mangrove never quite disappears from this true lagoonstream the monotonous fringe of rhizophores is broken about two miles from the mouth by bamboopalms and hibiscusbeds then by the bombax the rubbervine the locusttree inga and the bananaplantation the mounds and hillocks on either side beginning with the akromasi and kabudwe mounds near the mouth are evidently parts of an ancient archipelago built by the mangrove and silted up to mainland the long and curious reaches are shown in my companions map and i shall notice only those details which claim something of general interest  after about eight miles steaming up a huge loop to the west and a bend easterly we passed the kwábina bosom or fetishrocks two walllike blocks one mangrovegrown and the other comparatively bare contrary to native usage we chose the fair way between the latter and the left bank for which innovation said our escort we shall surely suffer  beyond the fetishrocks the right bank shows a cleared mound ready for immediate planting this concession once belonged to dr ross of axim opposite it the miningground has been leased for prospecting by messieurs gillett and selby the notable feature of the river is now the prawnbasket a long cone closed at the blunt apex the ancobra is a camarones supplying a firstrate article for curries this is the work of the uninteresting little villages scatters of mere crates built in holes worn in the bush all disappear during the floods and are rebuilt in the dry season for growing rice and tapping palmtrees besides a few humans they contain nothing save lean dogs and etiolated poultry cattle sheep and even pigs are wholly unknown  in the afternoon we pushed through a wild thunderstorm of furious tropical rain which pitted the riverface like musketballs it arose in the south but throughout the ancobra valley wet weather apparently comes from all directions chief apó gravely ascribed it to our taking the wrong side of the fetishrocks i have heard even in civilised lands sillier posthocergòpropterhocs  there were two landingplaces for the large ingotro concession both on the right bank the lower leads they say over dry land but the way is long and hilly that up stream is peculiarly foul and to us it was made fouler by the pelting shower at low water in the dry season the little nánwá creek subtending the higher ground on the north becomes too shallow for the smallest dugout and we had to wade or to be carried over an expanse of fetid and poisonous mangrovemud festering in the sun and promising a luxuriant growth of ague and fever the first rise of sandy yellow loam showed the normal gold coast metalling of ironstone and quartzgravel thinly spread with waterrounded pebbles then the path very badly laid out merged into a second foul morass whose depths were crossed by the rudest of bridges single and double trunks of felled or fallen trees nothing easier than to corduroy this mauvais pas  a second rise showed a fine reef of white and blue quartz which runs right through the settlement to the banks of the nánwá stream a quarter of an hours walk from the landingplace placed us in the nánwá village now popularly known as walkerkru it consists of a few mean little hovels the usual cagework huddled together in most unpicturesque confusion prickeared curs ducks and fowls compose the bestial habitants to which must be added the regiments of rats and neer a cat which infest all these places there were no mosquitoes but the sandfly bit viciously on mornings and evenings between the dark and sunlit hours confining one to the dim cage and putting a veto upon the pleasant lounge or seat in the cool open we found lodgings in the guesthut of the headman kwáko juma like most of his brethren a civil man and a greedy but the krumen boatmen and carriers were also lodged in the little settlement and these people always make night hideous with their songs and squabbles their howling voices and hyænalike bursts of laughter it is very difficult to love ones neighbour as oneself when he appears in this form under these circumstances  by times next morning we woke too soon the villagers who enjoy long talks by night and deep slumbers in early day they appear much inclined to slumber again but both apó of asánta and juma of nánwá were exceedingly anxious to know when miningworks would begin and that failing to secure as much dash as possible  the ingotro concession the largest we have yet seen measures 3000 fathoms square the measurements being taken from the central shaft assuming every thousand fathoms roughly to represent a geographical mile the area would be of nine square miles this will evidently admit of being divided and subdivided into half a dozen or more estates as yet little of its wealth has been explored chiefly owing to the dense growth of forest as mr walker remarks although timber is a great desideratum on a miningestate the thick woods have the disadvantage of concealing many rich deposits of gold and i have very little doubt that the diminution of the population and the consequent overgrowth of the bush or jungle has much to do with the great falling off in the production and export of gold from this region  the emancipation of slaves and pawns would have in africa no other effect free men will not work and bush unless kept down will grow with terrible ferocity  when indian file was duly formed we descended the nánwá hillock which takes its name from the stream here the little rivulet deeply encased bore a fine growth of snowy waterlilies it had been newly bridged with corduroy the next passage boasted treetrunks and after that all was leaping the nánwá must rise near the trialshaft which we are about to visit and it snakes through the property in all directions with a general rhumb from westnorthwest to eastsoutheast at this season there is little or no flow and the bed is mostly a string of detached pools where gold has been washed and will be washed again thus the facilities for hydraulicking are superior and the number of shallow native pits at once suggests the properest process  we then struck across the heavily timbered country which is the wildest state of bushiness a few paces led to kings croom a deserted miningvillage in a dwarf clearing rapidly overgrowing with the brazilian catinga hereabouts we saw nothing save hungry quartz then we struck across three several ridges whose slopes were notably easier on the eastern and more abrupt on the western side the people had sunk several pits in places likely to yield kindly quartz and they had made no mistakes as to the overlay of the lode its footwall or its hangingwall  cameron presently made an offset to the north and cutting his road walked ten minutes up the tail of tuáko hill at whose southern base lies the nánwá bed here guided by mr grant who knew the place well he found a native shaft thirty feet deep and a lode of disintegrated quartz in red or yellow ferruginous clay the surface looking as rich as the stone it overlies  a few paces further and a third drop led us again to the swampy valley of the nánwá here flowing south it is bounded by two rises treegrown from foot to head that on the left bank is the tuáko the husband along whose skirt we have been walking the other on the opposite side is jama the wife from their conjugal visits the gold is born some attempts had been made to blast a rock in the skirt of jamas garment but all had notably failed the reeking unwholesome bottom showed extensive traces of digging and washing  following the water we came to the second little miningvillage also deserted the name ingotro means a broadleaved liliaceous plant the wurahaban waterleaf of the fantis used for thatching when palmfronds are not found from this place an old bushpath once led directly to the lands we call izrah but it has long been closed by native squabbles a few yards further placed us in an exceedingly rich bottom honeycombed by native workers hard by it appeared the central shaft lying between two hills the ingotrobuká and the nánwábuká which define the course of the rivulet the distance from nánwá village may have been three miles but we had spent more than three hours in making collections  amongst the insects was the silkspider a large arachnid of sulphuryellow tint with three black transverse bars it weaves no web but spins a thread of the strongest texture and the richest golden hue i had sent from fernando po several pounds of this fine silk intending to experiment upon it in a veil or lace shawl and afterwards i learned that the empress eugénie had a dress made of it which cost a fabulous number of francs bacon and other old writers talk of spiders silk like gathering moonbeams footnote the ananse or agya ananse father spider as the ojispeaking peoples call the insect is with them either a creator of man corresponding so far with the scarabeus in the nile valley or a representative of the evil principle bosman letter xvii describing a great hideous hairy species says the negroes call this spider ananse and believe that the first men were made by that creature and notwithstanding some of them by conversation with the europeans are better informed there are yet a great number that remain of that opinion out of which folly they are not to be reasoned the people have a number of fables called anansesem such as spider and spiderson and the three ghosts in these spiderstories the insect like the fox with us is the most intelligent of animals the late rev j zimmermanns akra or gã grammar stuttgart 1858 it is represented as speaking through the nose like the local bogy and its hobbling gait is imitated by the storyteller another superstition is that the anánu the akra form of the word injures children sleeping in the same room with it at fernando po i found another valuable spider which preys upon cockroaches when a cruiser was particularly afflicted by the blatta a couple of these insects would effectually clear chests and drawers in a few days there are other species entekuma c  the upper shaft had been sunk as it should be in the eastern flank of the hill which faces north 71º east and which runs north 3º west both true the surface and subsoil are the usual sandy loam scattered with gravel of quartz and ironstone and the spoilbanks showed blue and white quartz the clayslate dark soft and laminated appeared everywhere lower down on the same slope mr grant had dug a second shaft somewhat smaller than the upper both were full of rainwater mr walker mentions a large native pit near the centre whence rich stone had been taken he picked up from the refuse several pieces of quartz showing free gold which gave when assayed 26 oz gold and 03 oz silver per ton this was from a depth of only ten feet his own trialshaft when he left the coast was not more than three feet deep but every sample showed traces of gold and an australian miner of thirty years experience declared that the stuff promised a rich yield below like ourselves he found the whole country impregnated with gold on the path within fifty yards of the nánwá village we knocked off some pieces of quartz that displayed the precious ore to the naked eye  the slope in which the two shafts had been sunk fell into a depression between the hills which indicated the richest surfacediggings here a number of detached sinkings had been run together by the recent rains into a long miry pool mr walker also speaks of a very large number of shallow native pits no one could see this exceedingly rich gulch without determining that it should be washed upon the largest scale it will be time to sink shafts and make deep diggings here when sluicing and surfacing shall have done their work  from ingotro we marched back to nánwá and took leave of chief apó his parting words were a request that work might be begun as soon as possible and that at any rate his concession should be properly marked out the limitation must not be neglected but the exploitation of the diggings is another affair the ground is exceptionally rich in gold and it offers every facility for extracting the metal but the climate of the lowlands presents difficulties in so large an area of broken ground however there are eminences that command a prospect of the sea and which are within the influence of the seabreeze the conditions will doubtless improve when the adjacent mininggrounds inyoko and izrah shall have been opened and the country cleared and ventilated in the meantime light works and hydraulicking on an extensive scale might be begun at once especially during the rainy season under seasoned and acclimatised overseers an amelioration must be the result and even before the rich surface has been washed it will be possible to set up heavy machinery for deep working shafting and tunnelling  embarking about 3 pm on board effuenta we steamed up the ancobra which here looks more like a river and less like a lagoon the settlements become more important the first being nfiakru or the dogvillage there were many influents which showed like dark breaches in the rampart of verdure such was the ahema huma a creek that breaks the left bank this name may become memorable upon its upper course messieurs gillett and selby have a small mining concession and in its golden gravels mr o pegler associate of the school of mines found a crystal which he strongly suspected to be a diamond it was taken to axim where its glasscutting properties were proved unfortunately during one of these trials the setting gave way and the stone fell into a heap of rubbish where it could not be found many have suspected that these regions will prove diamantiferous and it is reported that an experienced french mineralogist who has visited the south african diggings landed at assini and proposed to canoe up the tando river to the tákwá mines prospecting in search of his specialty  a portentous cloud ahead growled its thunder and discharged thin rain while the westing sun shone clear

spiritspage 407 dictionary of the asante and fante languages by rev j g christaller in fantiland the hunchback woman becoming a mother and in england his satanic majesty beating his wife off the eketekki village we saw for the first time bad snags which will require removal about sunset the akakru settlement the largest yet noted appeared on the left bank here the akankon mining company has a native house of wattle and dab looking somewhat better than the normal mudcabin it had been unceremoniously occupied by natives who roared their laughter when ordered to turn out from akakru there is a direct line to the effuenta within an hours walk of the tákwá mine the four stages can be covered in twenty hours footnote mr gillett who had lately passed over it gave me these notes on the line no

south of the abonsá station three hours no 4 to the effuenta mine five hours  at 630 pm we saw a little above akakru and also on the left bank jyachabo or silver jyácho stone of this settlement captain wyatt notes it is said that a silvermine was formerly worked here by the dutch and portuguese hard by the north of it lie the ruins of the old hollanders fort st john which the natives have corrupted to senchorsu the people however did not seem to know their whereabouts we determined to push on to akankon despite the ugly prospect of a dark walk through the wet bush and of deferring the survey to another time suddenly we saw on the right bank the black silhouette of a house standing high and lone in its clearing and we made fast to a good landingplace an inclined plane of corduroy it was an unexpected pleasure both had been put up after cameron left the mine by the native caretaker mr morris  we slept soundly through a cool and pleasant night at riverside house the large building of palmfronds with a roof like the lid of a lunchbasket contains three rooms and will be provided with outhouses inside and outside it is whitewashed above and blackwashed below the coaltar was suggested by my nautical companion and for the first time on the ancobra river we exchanged the bouquet dafrique for the smell of europe the big crate stands high upon the right bank here rising about twenty feet and affording a pleasant prospect of breezy brown stream deeply encased in bright green forest the draught caused by flowing water keeps the clearing clean of sandflies the pest of the inner settlements and european employés will find the place healthy the upsloping ground behind the house could be laid out in a pottagegarden and as bahamagrass grows fast there will be no difficulty about disposing of the undergrowth  next morning february 27 we were joined by mr morris who told the long tale of his grievances he had been in charge of ten men for five months during which he had not received a farthing of pay consequently his gang had struck work thus chatting we followed the cleared path leading up the right bank of the little akankon creek now dry it is navigable for canoes during the rains and falls into the ancobra under a good corduroy bridge near the landingramp a line of posts showed the levels which had been carefully marked by cameron it was a pleasure to see the bed it had been scraped in many places by the goldwasher and it promises an ample harvest when properly worked we left on the left hand safahin sensensés village a cluster of huts surrounded by bananas we crossed the shallow head of the creek all a swamp during the rains we walked up a dwarf slope and after half an hour we found ourselves at granton  the position of granton is not happily chosen though the hillside faces south it is beyond reach of the seabreeze the damp and wooded depression breeds swarms of sandflies and being only forty feet above the river it is reeking hot the thermometer about noon never showed less than 92º f and often rose to 96º in the rains it falls to 72º and the nights are cold with damp it will be a question which season will here prove the safest for working on the coast i should say the rains in the higher lands about the effuenta mine i am told that the dries must be preferred  granton is or was composed of eight tenements disposed to form a hollow square five of them are native cages of frond and thatch which i should have preferred on a second visit the rest are planks brought from europe good carpentrywork and raised a little off the ground unfortunately the bulkheads are close above instead of being latticed for draught the items are two boxessleepingroom and storeroomwith a larger lodging of four rooms which sadly wants a flyingroof the offices are kept in good order by the penniless caretaker who has been left entirely without supplies and who is obliged to borrow our inkbottles  we lost no time in visiting the akankon reef a word appropriately meaning abandoned or left alone the people however understand it in the sense that when a miner has taken possession of the ground and has shown a right to it his fellows leave him to work and betake themselves elsewhere immediately behind the huts we came upon a broad streak cochinealred except where tarnished by oxygen where it looked superficially like ochre the strike ran parallel with the quartzreef north 5º east true cameron had broken some of the stone into chips subjected it to the blowpipe and obtained bright globules of quicksilver veins of sulphide of mercury cinnabar or vermilion have been found in other parts of the protectorate we suspected their presence at apatim and collected specimens still to be assayed the natives have an idea that when the gold turns white it is uncanny to work the place moreover silver is always removed from the person when miners approach the golddiggings i should explain the phenomenon by the presence of mercury  a good road with sidedrains running about half a mile to the north has been kept open by the caretaker to its right is a manner of hillock evidently an old plantation in some places replanted from the top a view to the west shows three several ridges the akankon proper ijimunbukai and agunah blue in the distance northwards the akankon hogsback is seen sweeping riverwards from north to northeast rising to the hill akankonbukah here mr amondsen a danish sailor long employed in messieurs swanzys local sailing craft and lately sent out by the company informed me that he proposed to transfer the quarters for european employés he has however i am told changed his mind and built upon plantation hillock on the left or western side of the road the akankon ridge is subtended by a hollow the valley of a streamlet in rainy weather this supply which can easily be made perennial will greatly facilitate washing the highway ended in a depression where stood the deserted krumens quarters the only sign of work was a peculiar crosscut made by mr cornish ce one of the engineers  from this point turning abruptly from north to west we took the steep narrow path which climbs the akankon ridge rising 78 feet above the river a few paces led us to the prospecting shaft a native pit squared and timbered by mr cornish he was assisted by mr james b ross practical miner working manager and mineowner for the last twenty years in queensland australia he thus describes himself in the very able report which he sent to his company and i am glad to hear that he has returned to the gold coast the shaft 40 feet from the outcrop and 50 from the hillbase is bottomed at the depth of 52 feet unfortunately it is only boxtimbered and much of the woodwork was shaken down by the blasts the sinking through stiff clay stained with iron cobalt manganese and cinnabar was reported easy but where the hanging and foot walls should have been fragments of clay iron and micaslate showed that the former lie still deeper my companion proposed a descent into the shaft by bucket and windlass i declined greatly distrusting such deserted pits especially in this region where they appear unusually liable to foul two days afterwards a kruboy went down and was brought to grass almost insensible from the chokedamp his hands clenched the rope so tightly that their grip was hard to loose  we then mounted to the outcrop near the ridgesummit 100 yards northnortheast this reefcrest is a tongue of quartz and quartzite veining grey granite it was found dug out and cleared all round by the people mr cornish had contented himself with splitting off a fragment by a shot or two  when the whole hill shall have been properly washed the contained reefs will present this walllike appearance the dimensions are ten feet long by the same height and half that thickness and the slope shows an angle of 40º we passed onwards to the top of the ridge winding among the pits and round holes sunk by the native miners in order to work the casing of the reef one of these carefully measured showed 82 feet about sixty yards to the northnortheast we reached the crest of what mr ross calls ponsonby hill he notices that the strike of the quartz which shows visible gold is from northnortheast to southsouthwest and its underlie to the southeast is at the ratio of one inch in twelve cameron found that near the head of the descent 120 feet to the plain below three and perhaps four lodes meet the true bed with a measured thickness of 157 feet strikes north 22º east the western 355º and the eastern north 37º east true all radiate from one point a knot which gives great expectations the natives have opened large manholes in search of loose gold and here tradition says many nuggets have been found a greater number will come to light when the miners shall dig the blind creek to the east and when the roots of the secular trees crowning the summit shall be laid bare by the hose i would wash down and sluice the whole of the akankon ridge  next day we proceeded to inspect two other reefs lying to the southwest and to the southeast the first asankumá lies a few yards from granton on the left of the path leading to our landingplace the ground was covered with deep bush and painfully infested with the nkran or enkran footnote anglicè the driver a small black formica which bites severely clears out houses destroys the smaller animals and has it is said overpowered and destroyed hunters when torpid with fatigue they have fallen asleep in the bush the same horrible end being eaten alive atom by atom has befallen white traders whose sickness prevented their escape accra which calls itself ga is known to the ojispeaking peoples as enkran and must be translated land of drivers not of white ants which marched in detached but parallel lines it rises gently in slopes of yellow clay towards the west and doubtless it covers quartzreefs as the lay is the usual meridional the talus pitted with the shallow pans called womens washings shows signs of hard work probably dating from the days when every headman had his gang of pawns and slaves rising at the head of the creek itself a natural goldsluice its bed and banks can carry any number of flumes which would deposit their precious burden in cisterns near the river i need hardly say they must be made movable so as to raise their level above the inundation here the one thing wanted would be a miner accustomed to hydraulicking in california or british columbia australia or south africa i hope that the work will not be placed in inexperienced hands whose blunders of ignorance will give the invaluable and infallible process a bad name  retracing our steps we made the chief sensensés village and persuaded him to guide us the short cut led through a forest and a swamp which reeked with nauseating sulphuretted hydrogen we avoided it on return by a détour after a short hours walk we ascended a bananagrown hillock upon which lay the ruins of the little miningvillage abesebá a few paces further through a forest rich in gamboge and dragons blood not the d draco in rubber and in guttapercha  where wellladen limetrees gave out their perfume placed us upon the great southeastern reef it was everywhere drilled with pits and we obtained fine specimens from one which measured twenty feet deep several of them were united by rude and dangerous tunnels i have heard of these galleries being pierced in other places but the process is not common and has probably been copied from europeans  on march 1 was held a formal palaver of headmen and elders the akankon concession had been bought by messieurs bonnat and wyatt from sensensé of the fetish whose ancestors he declared had long ruled the whole country the rent they say was small4 per mensem and 15 pereguins 135l footnote assuming at 9l the pereguin which others reduce at 8l and others raise to 10l per annumwhen operations began i have heard these gentlemen blamed and very unjustly for buying so cheap and selling so dear17000l in cash and 33000l in shares but the conditions were well worth the natives acceptance and if he be satisfied no one can complain the apparently large amount included the expenses of bringing out the mine and these probably swallowed a half when sensensé received his pay a host of rival claimants started up in these lands there is no law against trespass wherever a plantation is deserted the squatter may occupy it and popular opinion allows him and his descendants the permanent right of using letting or selling it i do not think however that this rule would apply to a white man  sensensés claims were contested by three chiefskofi blaychi kwáko bukári who brought an acute advocate ebba of axim and kwáko jum a fine specimen of the sealawyer this bumptious black had pulled down the board which marked the abesebá reef and had worked the pits to his own profit after many meetings of which the present was our last the litigants decided that hire and dashes should be shared by only two sensensé and kofi blaychi energetic jum finding his pretensions formally ignored jumped up and at once set out to enter a protest in legal form at axim  the crowd of notables present affixed their marks which however they by no means connected with the sign of the cross we witnessed the document and a case of tradegin concluded an unpleasant business that threatened the apatim as well as the akankon concession i repeat what i have before noted too much care cannot be taken when title to ground in africa is concerned and a registration office is much wanted at headquarters otherwise we may expect endless litigation and the advent of the london attorney moreover the people are fast learning foreign ideas sensensé for instance is nephew sisters son to blaychi which relationship in blackland makes him the heir meanwhile his affectionate uncle works upon the knowledge that this style of succession does not hold good in england  the eventful evening ended with a ball which demanded another distribution of gin the dance was a compound affair the krumen had their own forming an indian file for attack they carried bits of board instead of weapons and it was well that they did so the warlike performance causing immense excitement the apollonians preferred wide skirts and the pas seul of an amatory nature it caused shrieks of laughter and at last even the women and wees could not prevent joining in the sport years ago i began to collect notes upon the dances of the world and the desultory labour of some months convinced me that an exhaustive monograph supposing such thing possible would take a fair slice out of a mans life i learnt however one general rulethat all the myriad forms of dancing originally express only love and war in african parlance womanpalaver and landpalaver however much the quiet grace of high refinement may disguise original significance nature will sometimes return despite the pitchfork witness a bal de lopéra in the palmy days of the second empire  the kruman ball ended in a battle royal the results were muzzles swollen and puffed out like those of mandrills and black eyesthat is to say bloodred orbits where the skin had been abraded by fist and stick as they applied to us for justice and redress we administered it after seeing face and back or hearing both sides by a general cuttingoff of the ginsupply and a temporary stoppage of sundaybeef  i cannot leave this rich and unhappy akankon mine without a few reflections it so admirably solves the problem how not to do it the concession was negotiated in 1878 in april 1881 cameron proceeded to open operations accompanied by the grantee and four englishmen engineers and miners he was however restricted to giving advice and was not permitted to command the results as we have seen were a round shaft made square and a crosscut which cut nothing as little more appeared likely to be done and harmony was not the order of the day my companion sent the party home in june 1881 and followed it himself shortly afterwards since that time the company has been spending much money and making nil the councilroom has been a barren battlefield over a choice of superintendents and the properest kind of machinery londonwork being pitted for palmoil in commissionshape against provincial work and at the moment i write may 1 1882 when 7000l have been spent or wasted the shares 10s in the pound paid up may be bought for a quarter i can only hope that mr amondsen who met me at axim may follow my suggestions and send home alluvial gold  camerons most sensible advice concerning the local establishment required for akankon was as follows  he laid down the total expenditure at 21000l per annum including expenses in england this sum would work 100 tons per diem with 350 hands each at 1s hire and 3d subsistencemoney and sixteen cooks and servants the staff would consist of six officers the manager should draw 800l not 1200l and the surgeon absolutely necessary in case of accidents 450l with rations this is the pay of government which does not allow subsistence the reductionofficer and the bookkeeper are rated at 500l and the superintendent of works and the headminer each at 240l the pay of carpenters and other mechanics who should know how to make small castings would range from 180l to 150l the first native clerk and the storekeeper would be paid 100l the timekeeper with three assistants 70l and 65l the manager requires office sittingroom and bedroom and the medico a dispensary the other four would have separate sleepingplaces and a common parlour each room would have its small german stove for burning mangrovefuel and a fireengine should be handy on every establishment all the white employés would mess together unless it be found advisable to make two divisions the house would be of the usual pitchpine boarding on piles like those of lagos omitting the common passage or gallery which threatens uncleanness and the rooms might be made gay with pictures and coloured prints the natives would build bamboohuts  cameron well knowing what ennui in africa means would send out a billiardtable and a good lathe he also proposed a skittle or bowlingalley a ground for lawntennis under a shed an icemachine and one for making sodawater each establishment would have its library a good atlas a few works of reference and treatises on mining machinery and natural history the bulk would be the cheap novels each 4d in which weary men delight in addition to the mining journal the illustrated and the comics local and country papers should be sent out exiles care more for the little pedlington courant than for the journal of the city the times  gardening should be encouraged the vegetables would be occros hibiscus and brinjalls lettuce tomatoes and marrow yam and sweet potatoes pumpkins peppers and cucumbers whose seeds yield a fineflavoured saladoil not sold in london the fruits are grapes and pineapples limes and oranges mangoes and melons papaws and a long list of native growth nor should flowers be neglected especially the pink and the rose the land fenced in for privacy would produce in abundance holeusmillet rice and lucern for beasts there would be a breedingground for black cattle sheep goats and pigs and a poultryyard protected against wild cats  the routineday would be as follows at 515 am first bell and notice to turn out at 540 the little breakfast of tea or coffee breadandbutter or toast ham and eggs the five workinghours of morning 611 am to be followed by a substantial déjeuner à la fourchette at 1130 each would have a pint of beer or claret and be allowed one bottle of whisky a week mr ross the miner preferred breakfast at 8 am dinner at 1 pm and tea at 5 pm but these hours leave scant room for work  the warningbell at 1245 pm after 1 hr 45 min rest would prepare the men to fall in and return to work at 1 pm and the afternoonspell would last till 530 thus the workingday contains 9 hrs 30 min dinner would be served at any time after 6 pm and the allowance of liquor be that of the breakfast an occasional holiday to axim should be allowed in order to correct the monotony of junglelife    chapter xxi  to tumento the great central depÔt  march 4 was a sore trial to us both we went down on the same day and by our own fault we had given the sorelyabused climate no chance nor have we any right to abuse it instead of blaming ourselves the stranger should begin work quietly in these regions living if possible near the coast and gradually increasing his exercise and exposure within three months especially if he be lucky enough to pass through a mild seasoning of ague and fever he becomes acclimatised the consecrated term for a european shorn of his redundant health strength and vigour medical men warn new comers and for years we had read their warnings against the exhaustion of the physical powers of the body from overexertion they prescribe gentle constitutionals to men whose hours must do the work of days it is like ordering a pauperpatient generous diet in the shape of port and beefsteaks for the safe system which takes a quarter of a year would have swallowed up all our time consequently we worked too hard our mornings and evenings were spent in collecting and our days in boating or in walking instead of hammocking indeed we placed by way of derision the krumen in the fashionable vehicle and we had been too confident in our past seasoning we had neglected such simple precautions as morning and evening fires and mosquitobars at night finally we had exposed ourselves somewhat recklessly to sickly sun and sweltering swamp four days on the burning hillside completed the work my companion was prostrated by a bilious attack i by ague and fever  i thought you were at least feverproof says the candid friend as if one had compromised oneself  alas no a man is not feverproof in africa till he takes permanent possession of his little landed estate happily we had our remedies at hand there was no medico within hail and had there been we should have hesitated to call him in these gentlemen are government servants who add to their official salaries 400l per annum by private practice for five visits to a sick kruboy six guineas have been charged 5l for tapping a liver and sending two draughts and a box of pills and 37l 10s for treating a mild tertian which lasted a week the late m bonnat cost 80l for a fortnight such fees should attract a host of talented young practitioners from england at any rate they suggest that each mine or group of mines should carry its own surgeon  cameron applied himself diligently to chlorodyne one of the two invaluables on the coast we had a large store but unfortunately the natives have learnt its intoxicating properties and during our absence from axim many bottles had disappeared i need hardly say that good locks and keys are prime necessaries in these lands and that they are mostly found wanting  i addrest myself to warburgs drops tinctura warburgii a preparation invaluable for travellers in the tropics and in the lower temperates the action appears to be chiefly on the liver through the skin the more a traveller sees the firmer becomes his conviction that health means the good condition of this rebellious viscus and that its derangement causes the two great pests of africa dysentery and fever indeed he is apt to become superstitious upon the subject and to believe that a host of diseasesgout and rheumatism cholera and enteric complaintsresult from and are to be cured or relieved only by subduing hepatic disturbances my warburg was procured directly from the inventor not from the common chemist who makes the little phialful for 9d and sells it for 4s 6d some years ago a distinguished medical friend persuaded dr warburg once of vienna now of london to reveal his secret in the forlorn hope of a liberal remuneration by the home government needless to say the reward is to come i first learnt to appreciate this specific at zanzibar in 1856 where lieutcolonel hamerton used it successfully in the most dangerous remittents and marshfevers cases of the febrifuge were sent out to the coast during the ashanti war for the benefit of army and navy the latter they say made extensive use of it i have persistently recommended it to my friends and the public and before leaving england in 1879 i wrote to the times proposing that all who owe like myself their lives to dr warburg should join in relieving his straitened means by a small subscription at this moment june 1882 measures are being taken in favour of the inventor and i can only hope that the result will be favourable  the drops are composed of the aromatic sudorific and diaphoretic drugs used as febrifuges by the faculty before the days of jesuits bark to which a small quantity of quinine is added thus the tincture is successful in many complaints besides fevers evidently skilful manipulation is an important factor in the sum of its success dr warburg has had the experience of the third of a century and the authorities could not do better than to give him a contract for making his own cure  the enemy came on with treacherous gentlenessa slight rigor a dull pain in the head and a local irritation i have had dozens of fevers and dread them little more than a cold said winwood reade indeed the english catarrh is quite as bad as the common marshtertian of the coast the normal month of immunity had passed i was prepared for the inevitable ordeal and i flattered myself that it would be a mild ague at worst the affair of a week altro  next morning two white men owning that they felt awful mean left granton walked down to riverside house and at 8 am embarked upon the hapless effuenta the stream rapidly narrowed and its aspect became wilder dead trees anchored by the bolebase cumbered the bed and dykes and bars of slate overlaid by shales of recent date projected from either side the land showed no sign of hills but the banks were steep at this season in places here and there based on ruddy sand and exposing strips of rude conglomerate the cascalho of the brazil this pudding is composed of waterworn pebbles bedded in a dark clayey soil which crumbles under the touch on an arenaceous strip projecting from the western edge the women were washing and panning where the bottom of the digging was below that of the river this is an everyday sight on the ancobra and it shows what scientific hydraulicking will do after six hours of steaming not including three to fill the boiler we halted at enfrámadié the fanti frammanji meaning wind cools that is falls calm it is a wretched split heap of huts on the left bank one patch higher pitched than the other to avoid the floods the tenements are mere cages the bush lying close to the walls and supplies are unprocurable in fact the further we go the worse we fare as regards mere lodgings yet the site of our present halt is a high bank of yellow clay which suggests better things there is no reason why this miserable hole should not be made the riverdepôt  on march 4 we set out in the lizards sun as the people call the morning rays our vehicle was the surfboat escorted by the big canoe enfrámadié is the terminus of launchnavigation the snags in the dries stop the way and she cannot stem the current of the rains the ancobra now resembles the st johns or princes river in the matter of timberfloorwork and chevaux de frise of treecorpses disposed in every possible direction after half an hour we paddled past the devils gate a modern name for an old and ugly feature hsms entrance to home is formed by black reefs and ridges projected gridironfashion from ledges on either side almost across the stream leaving a narrow thalweg so shallow that the boatmen must walk and drag during the height of the floods it is sometimes covered for a few hours by forty feet of water rising and falling with perilous continuity  beyond devils gate a pleasant surprise awaited us mr d c maclennan manager of the effuenta mine footnote the name was given by m dahse it is that of the first worker efuátá a woman born on saturday efua and the third of a series of daughters átá stopped his canoe to greet us he was justly proud of his chargea box of amalgam weighing 15 lbs and carrying eighty ounces of gold it was to be retorted at home and to be followed within a fortnight by a larger delivery and afterwards by monthly remittances the precious case which will give courage to so many halfhearted shareholders was duly embarked on the ass ambriz captain crookes and its successor containing the produce of a hundred tons on the b and a benguela captain porter consequently the papers declared that effuenta was first in the field of results this is by no means the case as early as november 1881 mr w e crocker of crockerville manager of the important wásá wassaw miningproperty sent home goldamalgam and black sand footnote i have before noticed this golden seasand it has lately been found the papers tell me on the coast about cape commerell british columbia a handful taken from a few inches below the surface shows glittering specks of floatgold scales so fine that it was difficult to wash them by machinery mem this is what women do every day on the gold coast the colonist says that a san francisco company has at length hit upon the contrivance it consists of six drawers or layers of plates punched with holes about half an inch in diameter and covered with amalgam the goldsand is dumped in and the water turned on the topplate sets all in motion the sand falls from plate to plate leaving the free loose gold which has attached itself to the amalgam and very little remains to be caught by the sixth plate so simple a process is eminently fitted for the gold coasta total of sixtyeight ounces to twentyfive tons  after an hours paddling we sighted a few canoes and surfboats under a raised claybank binding the stream on the left this was tumento tomento our destination the word means wont go as the rock is supposed to say to the water the aspect of the ancobra becomes gloomy and menacing the broad bed shrinks to a ditch almost overshadowed by its sombre walls of manyhued greens and the dead treetrunks of the channel ghastly white in the dull brown shade look to the feverish imagination like the skeleton hands and fingers of monstrous spectres outspread to bar thoroughfare  we landed and walked a few yards to the settlement a steamlaunch sounds grandiose and so does a great central depôtseen on paper and touching this place i was told a tale some time ago two young french employés a doctor and an engineer were sent up to the mines and fell victims to the magical influence of the name quoth jules to alphonse my friend we will land we will call a fiacre we will drive to the local three provincial brothers we will eat a succulent repast and then for a few happy hours we will forget blackland and these ignoble blacks so they toiled up the stiff and slippery slope and found a scatter of cratehuts crowning a bald head of yellow argil speechless with rage and horror at the sight of the depôt they rushed headlong into the canoe returned without a moments delay to axim and finding a steamer in the bay incontinently went on board flying the dark continent for ever  we housed ourselves in messieurs swanzy and crockers establishment at tumento the climate appeared wholesome the river brought with it a breeze and we were evidently entering the region of woods between the mangroveswamps of the coast and the grasslands of the interior  at tumento i met after some twenty years mr dawson of cape coast castle the last time it was at dahoman agbóme in company with the rev mr bernasko who died 1872 of dropsy and heartdisease he is now in the employment of the tákwá or french company and his local knowledge and old experience had suggested working the mines to m bonnat some forty years ago the english merchants of cabo corso used to send their people hereabouts to dig and more recently mr carter had spent they say 4000l upon the works he was followed by another roving englishman who was not more successful the liberation of pawns and other antiabolitionist fads had so raised the wagerate that the rich placers were presently left to the natives we exchanged reminiscences and he at once started down stream for axim  as we were unable to work mr grant proceeded to inspect the concession called insimankáo the asamankáo of m zimmermann it is the name of the village near which sir charles macarthy was slain our authorities translated it ive got you as the poor man said to the gold or the cruel chief to the runaway serf mr dawson who is uncle by marriage to mr grant had also suggested this digging our good manager now an adept at prospecting found the way very foul and the place very rich it was afterwards as will be seen visited by mr oliver pegler and lastly by cameron  amongst the few new faces seen at tumento were two krambos moslems and writers of charms and talismans a patent improved metallic book which looked in strange company contained their fetish and apparently composed their travelling kit both hailed from about tinbukhtu but their arabic was so imperfect that i could make nothing of their route these men acquire considerable authority amongst the pagan negroes who expect great things from their grígrís they managed to find us some eggs when no one else could this hibernian race of gold coast blacks had eaten or sold all its hens and had kept only the loudcrowing cocks the presence of these two youths convinced me that there will be a mohammedan movement towards the gold coast a few years may see thousands of them with mosques by the dozen established upon the seaboard the revival of elislam shows itself nowhere so remarkably as in africa  at tumento cameron found himself growing rapidly worse he suffered from pains in the legs and owned that even when crossing africa during his three years of wild life he remembered nothing more severe in my own case there was a severe tussle between dr warburg and feverfiend the attacks had changed from a tertian to a quotidian and every new paroxysm left me like the possessed of holy writ after the expulsion of devils utterly prostrate during the three days struggle i drained two bottles of warburg the admirable drug won the victory but it could not restore sleep or appetite  seeing how matters stood and how easily bad might pass to worse i proposed the proceeding whereby a man lived to fight another day we were also falling short of ready money and the tornadoes were becoming matters of daily occurrence after a long and anxious powwow cameron accepted and it was determined to run down to the coast and there collect health and strength for a new departure no sooner said than done on march 8 we left tumento in our big canoe passed the night at riverside house and next evening were inhaling not a whit too soon the inspiriting seawhiffs of axim  the rest of my tale is soon told  cameron recovered health within a week and resolved to go north again his object was to inspect for the second time the working mines about tákwá and to note their present state also to make his observations and to finish his map he did not look in full vigour and knowing his caledonian tenacity of purpose i made him promise not to run too much risk by overpersistence after a dîner daxim and discussing a plumpudding especially made for our christmas by a fair and kind friend at trieste he set out ancobrawards on march 16 he would have no krumen so our seven fellows who refused to take service in the effuenta mine were paid off and shipped for we country the thirty hands ordered in midjanuary appeared in midmarch and were made over to mr maclennan my companion set out with faithful joe mr dawson the stuffer and his dog nero i did not hear of him or from him till we met at madeira  my case was different i could not recover strength like my companion who is young and who has more of vital force to expend this consideration made me fearful of spoiling his work a sick traveller in the jungle is a terrible encumbrance i therefore proposed to run south and to revisit my old quarters fpo and the oil rivers in the b and a ss loanda captain brown the same which would pick up my companion after his return to axim  life on the coast was not unpleasant despite the equinoctial gales which broke on march 19 and blew hard till march 25 i had plenty of occupation in working up my notes and i was lucky enough to meet all the managers of the working mines who were passing through axim from messieurs crocker wásá maclennan effuenta creswick gold coast company and bowden tákwá footnote alias the african gold coast company whose shareholders are french and english it has lately combined with the mine dor dabowassu abosu the capital being quoted at five millions of francs thus the five working mines are reduced to four while the izrah and others are coming on may 1882 i had thus an opportunity of gathering much hearsay information and was able to compare opinions which differed widely enough i also had long conversations with mr a a robertson lately sent out as trafficmanager to the izrah and with mr amondsen the danish sailor then en route to the hapless akankon mine mr paulus dahse who was saved from a severe sickness by dr roulston and by his brotherinlaw mr wulfken eventually became my fellowpassenger to madeira where i parted from him with regret during long travel and a residence of years in various parts of the gold coast he has collected a large store of local knowledge and he is most generous in parting with his collection  but when prepared to embark on board the loanda which was a week late my health again gave way and i found that convalescence would be a long affair madeira occurred to me as the most restful of places and there i determined to await my companion the ass winnebah captain hooper anchored at axim on march 28 the opportunity was not to be lost and on the same evening we steamed north regaining health and strength with every breath  the ass winnebah could not be characterised as comfortable mr purser denny did his best to make her an exception to the starvation rule but even he could not work miracles she is built for a riverboat and her main cabin is close to the forecastle she was crowded with kruboys and all her passengers were doubled up a full regiment of parrots was on board whose daily deaths averaged twenty to thirty the birds being worth ten shillings each our engines were driven as they probably had never been driven before and the clacking of the safetyvalve never ceased  the weather however was superb we caught the northeast trade a little north of cape palmas and kept it till near grand canary on april 13 greatly improved by the pleasant voyage and by complete repose i rejoiced once more in landing at the fair isle madeira  and now cameronus loquitur    chapter xxii  to insimankÁo and the butabuÉ rapids  leaving axim on march 16 i slept at kumprasi and remarked a great change in the bar of the ancobra river during the dry season it had been remarkably good but now it began to change for the worse and soon it will become impassable for three or four days at a time my surfboat when coming across it shipped three seas on my return down the river april 15 the whole sandbank to the west of the mouth had been washed away forming dangerous shoals the sea was furiously breaking and burning as the old dutch say and the waves which entered the river were so high that canoes were broken and boats were seriously damaged  i stored my goods in the surfboat and set out in our big canoe early next morning a string of dugouts was next passed loaded with palmkernels maize and bananas it appeared as if they were all bound for the market at axim i took specimens of swish and stone from rosss hill the top soil showed good signs of gold and the grains were tolerably coarse here a floating powerengine would soon bare the reefs and warp up the swamp messieurs allan and plisson who were floating down in a surfboat gave me the news that the steamlaunch effuenta had at last succumbed in the struggle for life  i landed at akromási a village where the true bamboocane grows and found the soil to be a grey sandy clay there were many womens washings near the settlement shortly before reaching the ahenia river we saw the landingplace for the valuable apatim concession they told me on enquiry that the stream is deep and has been followed up in a surfboat for a mile or two it may therefore prove of use to mr irvines property apatim  at halfpast five that evening i reached akankon and slept well at riverside house mr morris had begun levelling the ground and building new quarters for general use i gave him some slips of bamboo and roots of bahamagrass as that planted had grown so well  next morning we got under way early 650 and proceeded up the river the canoemen seeing pots of palmwine on the banks insisted upon landing to slake their eternal thirst the mode in which the liquor is sold shows a trustfulness on the part of the seller which may result from firm belief in his fetish any passerby can drink wine à discrétion and is expected to put the price in a calabash standing hard by beyond the yengéni river i saw for the first and only time purple clayslate overlying quartz collecting here and there specimens of geology and suffering much from the sun for i still was slightly feverish i reached the great central depôt at 4 pm  tumento was found by observation to lie in n lat 4º 12 20 and in w long gr 2º 12 25 consequently it is only eighteen direct geographical miles from the sea the mouth of the ancobra being in w lat 2º 54 some make the distance thirty and others sixty miles the latter figure would apply only by doubling the windings of the bed  this ascent of the river convinced me more than ever that enfrámadié is the proper terminus of its navigation i passed the next day at tumento which proved to be only half the distance usually supposed along the ancobra bed from its mouth the time was spent mainly in resting and doctoring myself at night the rats holding high carnival kept me awake till 3 am and i heard shots being continually fired from a native mine whose position was unknown the natives now know how to bore and blast consequently thefts of powder drills and fuses become every day more common my first visit march 20 was to the insimankáo concession i left the surfboat behind and put my luggage into small canoes hired at tumento myself proceeding in the large canoe we shoved off from the beach at 850 am the ancobra had now after the late rains a fair current instead of being almost dead water otherwise it maintained the same appearance the banks are conglomerate grey clay and slate gravel sand shingle and pebbles of reddish quartz bedded in earth of the same colour succeeding one another in evervarying succession only two reefs neither of them important projected from the sides  after an hour and a half paddling we reached the fura which i should call a creek it is not out of the mangroveregion the bed is set in high steep banks submerged during the rains and the narrowness of the mouth compared with the upper part made it run after the late showers into the ancobra like a millrace in fact the paddlers were compelled to track in order to make headway after ten minutes 200 yards we reached a landingplace all jungle with rotting vegetation below i do not think that as a waterway the fura creek can be made of any practical use but it will be very valuable for hydraulicking canoes and small surfboats may run down it at certain seasons but the flow is too fast and the bed is too full of snags and sawyers to be easily ascended  at the landingplace i mounted my hammock and struck the path which runs over level ground pretty thick with secondgrowth the chief bimfú who met me at tumento had broken his promise to guide me and had neglected to clear the way on a largish creek which was nearly dry i saw a number of womens washings then we passed on the right a hillock seventy to eighty feet high where quartz showed in detached and weathered blocks beyond it were native shafts striking the auriferous drift at a depth of eight to ten feet a few yards further on the usual washings showed that the top soil is also worth working  another halfhour brought us to about a dozen native shafts in the usual chimney shape they were quite new and had been temporarily left on account of the rise of the water which was here twentyfour feet below the surface the top soil is of sandy clay and the goldcontaining drifts varying in thickness they told me from two to four feet consisted of quartz pebbles bedded in red loam the general look of the stratum and the country suggested an old lagoon  an hour and a half of hammock brought me from the landingplace of the fura creek to the village of insimankáo rain was falling heavily and prevented all attempts at observation the settlement is the usual group of swish and bamboo boxhuts nestling in the bush a small clean birdcage divided into two compartments with standing bedstead was assigned to me next morning i walked to the insimankáo mine by a path leading along and in places touching the bank of the fura creek which runs through the whole property after thirtythree minutes we reached the marked tree here the land begins to rise and forms the insimankáo hill whose trend is to northnortheast mr walker calls it etiakaah or echiakarah meaning when you hear of its fame you will come it is the usual mound of red clay fairly wooded and about 150 feet high the creek runs about 100 yards west of the pits the reefs seemed to be almost vertical with a strike to the northnortheast and the walls showed slate ironoxide and decomposed quartz the main reef footnote mr o pegler arsm describes it as a very powerful reef outcropping boldly from a hill at a short distance from the native village the strike being northnortheast to southsouthwest and the vein having a great inclination at the crest of the hill it presents a massive appearance and is many feet in widthin some places between twenty and thirty feet this diminishes towards the native pits and there the vein diverges into two portions both presenting a decomposed appearance the casing on both foot and hanging wall having a highly talcose character this engineer also washed gold specks from the loose soil finally he notes that the massive quartzoutcrop is homogeneous and crystalline giving only traces of gold but that the stone improves rapidly with depth was from eight to ten feet thick and i believe that there are other and parallel formations but the ground is very complicated and for proper study i should have required borings and crosscuts  there were two big rough pits called shafts i descended into the deeper one which was fourteen to fifteen feet below ground the walls would repay washing on a large scale and the look of the top soil reminded me of the descriptions of old california and australia when there were rushes of miners to the goldfields carrying for all machinery a pick a pan and a tin billy  the insimankáo concession contains 1000 fathoms square the measurements being taken from a marked tree on the northwestern slope of the hill with the long name the position is n lat 5º 18 15 and the long w gr 2º 14 03 west of the centre the fura creek receives a small tributary mr walker took fair samples from the welldefined reef and the outcropping boulders whose strike is from northnortheast to southsouthwest he notes that the land egwira which lies between wásá and aowin was long famous for its miningindustry and that it appears in old maps as a republick rich in gold we heard of the abenje mine on the same reef four to five miles east of insimankáo and he declares that it has been abandoned because the population is too scanty  i left this mining property convinced that working it will pay well the only thing to be guarded against is overlapping the french concession of mankuma which lies immediately to the east  from the mine i walked back to the village breakfasted and returned in the canoes to the sluicelike mouth of the fura greek i then ascended the ancobra in order to inspect the butabué rapids said to be the end of canoenavigation we passed on the right a reef and a shallow of conglomerate washed out of the banks and forming a race there is another reef with its rip at aroásu in the early part of the afternoon we got to the village of ebiásu which means not dark here the equinoctial showers began to fall heavily and i was again obliged to sleep without observations the village is built upon a steep bank of yellow clay with rich red oxides it stands forty feet above the present level and yet at times it is flooded out  leaving ebiásu next morning i found the banks of sand clay and small pebbles beginning to shelve we passed over slaty rocks in the bed and the depth of water was often not more than three feet womens washings were seen on the left bank and the river had risen after they had been worked we could not approach them on account of the reefs and the current the opposite bank about five minutes further up is of soft sandstone and here a native tunnel of forty to fifty feet had been run in from the river to communicate with a shaft my men were nervous about leopards and i had to encourage them by firing my rifle into the hole the normal formation continued and here the land is evidently built by the river there are few hills and the present direction of the bed has been determined by the rocks and reefs the outliers of the old true coast these features may have been lower than they are now and owe their present elevation to upheaval immature conglomeratethat is a pudding of pebbles and hardened clayseems to have been deposited in the synclinal curve of the bedrock principally slate overlying both are the top soil and the sands the latter often resembling the washed out tailings of stamped rock  passing the village abanfokru i found myself amongst the extensive concessions of the french who have taken the alluvial grounds for washing and working m bonnats map gives the approximate positions and dimensions and the several sites are laid down by m dahse i shall have more to say about this section on my return  navigation now becomes more intricate and difficult owing to rocks and reefs rips and rapids a large stony holm about midstream is called eduásim meaning thief in river i need not repeat from my map the names of the unimportant settlements at the mouth of the abonsá the bed widens to nearly double and the northeasterly direction shifts to due north this great drain falling into the left bank lies between five and six miles above the fura creek i shall have more to say about it when describing my descent two miles further north brought us to the beginning of the rapids which apparently end the boatnavigation the only canoes are used for ferrying i saw no watertraffic and there were no longer any fishweirs moreover the country has been deserted i was told since the arrival of strangers the natives have probably been treated with little consideration a quarter of an hours hauling all hands being applied to the canoe took us about fifty yards over the impayim rapid whose fall is from four to five feet deep immediately after the butabué influent on the right bank the bed bends abruptly east and we reached the farfamed rapids of that name here the whole surface as far up as the eye can see is a mass of rocks and of broken surging water the vegetation of the banks bound together by creepers llianas and rattans is peculiarly fine i landed upon one of the rocks sketched the butabué whose name none could explain and returned down stream to the great central depôt tumento  i can say little about the river ancobra above the rapids except that it resumes its course from the northnortheast and the north apparently guided by the hills the sources are now only a few miles distant but the stream is unnavigable and they must be reached on foot the late m bonnat walked up by a hunters path now killed out to the ruins of bush castle which jeekel calls fort ruyghaver he there secured possession of the rich asamán mines which the work was intended to defend there is some fetish there and the place is known as the burialground of the kings i was also told that four or five marches off a cache of treasure described to be large had been made during the ashantigyáman war and had been defended by the usual superstitions fetish may have lost much of its power on the coast in the interior however it is still strong and few white men live long after being placed under its ban    chapter xxiii  to effuenta crockerville and the aji bipa hill  at tumento the halt of a day march 22 was necessary in order to hire carriers and get ready for the march eastward here too i washed sundry specimens of soft earth from various parts of the riverbanks finding colour of gold in all except the grey clay our mohammedan friends were there the eldest called upon me and was exceedingly civil besides being to a certain extent useful for the hire of a shilling and two cakes of cavendish he found me eggs in a village some three miles off and he ended by writing me a safy which would bring me good luck in all my undertakings it consists of the usual koranic quotations in black and of magic numbers in pink ink  dr roulston and mr higgins the new district commissioner for tákwá entered tumento about 3 pm the carriers hired in addition to my canoemen would now be wanted said the cunning old chief for the government man with whom he wished to stand well as the porters had received an advance of pay i objected to this proceeding the fresh arrivals had to find other hands and were not very successful in the search their detachment of twentyfive haussa soldiers who had escorted to the coast dr duke the acting commissioner lately invalided were sent abroad in all directions to act pressgang and the natural lawlessness of the race came out strong the force is injured by enlisting haussas who are not haussa at all merely semisavage and halfpagan slaves on detached duty they get quite out of hand and they by no means serve to make our government popular by the rules of the force they should never be absent from headquarters for more than six months their transport costs next to nothing as they march by bushpaths and yet they are kept for years on outpostduty where it would require a glover to discipline them and to make them steady soldiers they live by plunder a private on a shilling a day will eat three fowls each worth 9d to 10d and drink any taken amount of palmwine there are no means of punishment or even of securing a criminal the colony cannot afford irons or handcuffs there is no prison and a haussa placed under arrest in a bamboohut cuts his way out as easily as a rat from a birdcage  one of these men was accused of murdering a woman in one of the villages on the way his comrades brought in husbands wives and children indiscriminately not sparing even the chiefs bimfú of insimankáo was among the number next morning however he threw his pack bolted to the bush and eventually reported his grievances to axim the second headman of tumento when pressed managed to secure a very small load but as payment is by weight 6d per 10 lbs from the river to effuenta and no subsistence is allowed his gains were small in proportion he received for three days only 9d the ordinary value of porters rations  next day march 23 we left tumento at 730 am the caravan consisted of thirtytwo men all toldcanoemen from axim tumento bearers boatswain and my three bodyservants all were under the command of joe the indefatigable who formed a kind of bodyguard of guncarriers out of the porters that carried the lightest packs mr dawson assisted me in collecting paul prepared to shoulder a bed and the boatswain was ordered to catch butterflies the cries of bátli basky and bokkus bottle basket and box continually broke the silence of the bush and gladdened the collectors ears i was still able to dispense with the hammock  in the first few minutes the path trends southwards it then assumes and keeps an easterly direction here is a waterparting the many little beds mostly full of water flow either north towards the abonsá or south and westwards to the ancobra they are divided by detached hills or rather oblong mounds of the same formation as the beds quartz gravel and red clay all disposed in the usual direction womens washings were seen everywhere along the road and in some places oozings of iron from the soil heavily charged the streamlets some of the quartzboulders were coloured outside like porphyry by the oxide about threequarters of the way from tumento to apankru is a hill rich in outcrops of quartz i believe it to be french property  these

dangers of snags rapids and heavy currents here it rises high during the floods and sometimes it swamps the lower courtyards  i put up at mr crockers establishment which was as usual nice and clean and the officials went on to effuenta the native clerk took good care of me probably moved thereto by mr joe who addressed him here gib me key i want house for my master during the evening in the intervals of heavy rain i obtained a latitude by castor apankru lies in north latitude 5º 13 55 and its longitude by calculation is 0º 20 6 west  the next morning march 24 was dark and threatening at 630 am we struck into the path a mere bushtrack the corduroys and bridges made by the swanzy house having completely disappeared this want of public feeling of solidarity amongst the several mining companies should be remedied with a strong hand these men seem not to know that rivalry may be good in buying palmoil but is the wrong thing in mining such a jealousy assisted in making the spanish proverb a silver mine brings wretchedness a gold mine brings ruin even in england i have met with unwise directors who told me oh you must not say that or people will prefer such and such a mine but speaking generally employers are aware that unity of interest should produce solidarity of action the local employés like to breed divisions in order to increase their own importance this should be put down with a strong hand and all should learn the lesson that what benefits one mine benefits all many of the little streams run between steep banks and in the rainy season mud and water combine to make the line impracticable yet there is nothing to stand in the way of a cheap tram and perhaps this would cost less and keep better than a metalled road the twisting of the track without rhyme or reason reminded me of the snakiest paths in central africa our course as the map shows was in every quadrant of the compass except the southwestern  on our left or north ran the aunábé m dahses

african story of amazon settlements messieurs zweifel and moustier footnote voyage c p 115 were told by a kissi man that twelve marches behind their country is a large town called nahalo occupied only by the weaker sex a man showing himself in the streets or met on the road is at once put to death however some of the softerhearted have kept them prisoners and the result may easily be divined all the male issue is killed and only the girls are kept  many large womens washings of old date give us a hint how the country should be worked all along the line of the aunábé white sands the tailings of natural sluices have been deposited the black sand sinking by its own weight i was unable to find out the extent of the french concessions and look forward to the coming day of compulsory definition of boundaries and registration in government offices these grants are mingled in inextricable confusion with those secured by surgeonmajor dr james africanus beale horton esq  soon after kwansakru we exchanged the ordinary path for a mere thread in the bush leading to the southern end of tebribi hill the name according to mr sam means when you hear it shakes signifying that the thunder reverberates from the heights owing to its steep side and gives it a tremulous motion this abrupt clifflike side is the western where the schistose gneiss is exposed for a thickness of 60 feet and more the stone is talcose puddinged in places with quartz pebbles and everywhere showing laminations of black sand the long oval mound of red clay overgrown with trees and rising 295 feet above sealevel is all auriferous but there are placers richer than their neighbours tebribi was the favourite washingground of the apinto wásás but the old shafts were all neglected after the dutch left and no deep sinking was known within the memory of man until the last twelve years i passed a pit on the western flank the winch had been removed and my people found it impracticable we descended to it by cut steps and followed a cornice mainly artificial for a short distance to where its mouth opened this hole had been sunk 70 to 80 feet deep in the talcose stone and it would have been far easier and better to have driven galleries and adits into the face of the rock  we took fourteen minutes to clamber up the stiff side in the pelting rain with a tornado making ready to break ten minutes more along the level and a total of three hours placed us at mr crockers bellevue house i had been asked to baptise it and gave the name after a place in sevenoaks which overlooks the wooded expanse of the kentish weald the place being locked up we at once committed burglary i occupied one of the two boarded bedrooms with plank walls and my men established themselves in the broad and wellthatched verandah when the view cleared we saw various outliers of hill all running nearly parallel and striking north with more or less easting the temperature was delightful and between the showers the breezes were most refreshing at night a persistent rain set in and ruined all chance of getting sights  the next morning broke dull and grey with curtains of smoky fog and mist hanging to the hills and the heavy wet made the paths greasy and slippery leaving bellevue house we walked along the whole length of the ridge in half an hour and descending the northwestern slope we struck the main thoroughfaresuch as it is reaching the level we found more womens washings and the highly auriferous ground looked as if made for the purpose of hydraulic mining  another halfhour along the lower flat led us to burnettville crockers ruhe no 3 it is a large nativebuilt house fronted by long narrow quarters for negroes on the other side of the road the path crossed several streamlets trending north to the aunábé and a bad mud which had seen corduroy in its better days blocks of quartz and slate protruded between the patches of bog we then traversed fairly undulating and wellwooded ground claystone coated with oxide of iron we crossed another small stream flowing northwards and we began the ascent leading to government house tákwá it is also known as mount pleasant prospect mount and vinegar hill  the site facing the effuenta mine is the summit of a long thin line about 275 feet high this queer specimen of official headquarters was built by the united genius of the owners of the ground mr commissioner cascaden and dr duke as before said the really comfortable house of boarding has been bequeathed to the white ants at axim by the government of the golden land too poor to pay transport commissioner and doctor receive no houseallowance and according to popular rumour which is probably untrue were graciously told that they might pig in a native hut in or about tákwá consequently they built this place and charge a heavy rent for it  government house is a large parallelogram of bamboo the roof is an intricate mass of branches and treetrunks with a pitch so flat that it admits every shower mr higgins was at once obliged to expend 10l12l in removing and restoring the housecover under it are built two separate and independent squares of wattle with plank floors raised a foot or so off the ground these dull and dismal holes which have doors but no windows serve as sleepingplaces the rest of the interior goes by the name of a sittingroom the outer walls are whitewashed on both sides and between them and the two wattle squares is a space of 6 to 8 feet adding to the disproportionate appearance of the interior had it been divided off in the usual way the tenement would have been much more comfortable there is a scatter of ragged huts grandiosely designated as the barracks on the level space where the haussas parade when mr higgins was making himself watertight these lazy loons had the impudence to ask that he would either have their lines mended or order new ones to be built i would have made them throw down their ramshackle cabins knock up decent huts and keep them in good order  leaving government house i descended the steep incline of vinegar hill passed through the little esanuma village and crossed two streams flowing south one is easily forded the eastern has a corduroy bridge 176 ft long built to clear the muds on either side i shall call this double water the tákwá rivulet and shall have more to say about it on my return  another steep ascent placed me at the effuenta establishment i was now paying my second visit to the farfamed tákwá ridge it is a long line running parallel with vinegar hill but instead of being regular like its neighbour it is broken into a series of small crests looking on the map like vertebræ these heights being parted by secondary valleys some of which descend almost to the level of the flowing water westward the hogsback is bounded by the tákwá rivulet rising in the northern part of the valley eastwards there is a corresponding feature called by the english quartz creek it breaks through the ridge in the southern section of the effuenta property and unites with the tákwá my aneroid showed the height of the crest to be 260 feet above sealevel and about 160 above the valley mr wyatt has raised it to 1400 feeta curious miscalculation  at effuenta i found mr maclennan the manager whom we last met at axim owing to the drownedout state of government house he had given hospitality to messieurs higgins and roulston and i could not prevent his leaving his own sleepingroom for my better accommodation i spent two days with him inspecting the mine and working up my notes during this time mr bowden of tákwá and mr exmissionary dawson passed through the station and i was unfortunate in missing the former  effuenta house is a long narrow tenement of bamboo and thatch divided into six or seven rooms and built upon a platform of stone and swish raised seven feet off the ground all the chambers open upon a broad verandah which shades the platform the inmate was talking of rebuilding as the older parts were beginning to decay he had just set up in his compound two singleroom bamboo houses with plank floors raised four feet off the ground these were intended to lodge the european staff other bamboo huts form the offices and the stores the kru quarters are at the western base of the hill a few hands however live in the two little villages upon the tákwá rivulet the sierra leone and akra artificers occupy their own hamlet between the kru lines and the stamps last year there was a garden with a small ricefield but everything was stolen as soon as it was fit to gather  next morning mr maclennan led me to the diggings this concession which is the southernmost but one upon the tákwá ridge contains one thousand by two thousand fathoms and desultory work began in 1880 the rock a talcose gneiss all laden with gold runs along the whole length of the hill striking as usual north 6º east true in places it forms a basset or outcrop cresting the summit and the eastern flank is cliffy like that of the tebribi to get at the ore three shafts have been sunk on the western slope of the ridge just below the highest part and a passage is being driven to connect the three a rise for ventilation and for sending down the stone connects this upper gallery with a lower one and the latter is being pushed forward to unite the three tunnels pierced horizontally near the foot of the hill at right angles to the lode there is also a fourth tunnel below the managers house which will be joined on to the others the three tunnels open westward upon a tramway along which the ore is carried to the stamps i judged the output already made to be considerable but could not make an estimate as it was heaped up in different places  the stampmill lying to the extreme north of the actual workings is supplied with water by a leat from the eastern tákwá rivulet the twelve head of stamps on applebys gravitation system are driven by a belleville boiler and engine this has the merit of being portable and the demerit of varying in effective power owing to the smallness of the steamchest the battery behaves satisfactorily only the pump which is worked by the camshaft wants power to supply the whole dozen consequently another and independent pump has been ordered krumen who will never i think make good mineworkmen are constantly employed in washing the blankets as soon as they are charged and the resulting black sand is carried to the washinghouse to be panned or rather calabashed by native women in time we shall doubtless see concentrating bundles and amalgamating barrels  the three ironframed stampboxes discharge their sludge into two parallel mercury or amalgamboxes which mr appleby declares will arrest 75 to 80 per cent of free gold it then passes on to the distributing table the flow to the strakes being regulated by small sluices of the latter there is one to each width of green baize or of miningcloth made for the purpose the overflow of the sluices runs into a large tailingtank of boardwork with holes and plugs at different levels to tap the contents these tailings are also washed by women  finally the mercury is squeezed through leathers and the hard amalgam is sent for treatment to england retorting is not practised at present in any of the mines the only reductiongear belongs to the gold coast mining company and some time must elapse before it is ready for use my discovery of native cinnabar will then prove valuable  the effuenta can now bring to bank with sufficient hands at least a hundred tons a day of good paying ore whereas the stamps can crush at most onetenth when this section of the lode about 200 fathoms shall be worked there will still be the balance of 1000 but even this fifth of the property will supply material for years the proportion of gold greatly varies and i should not like to hazard a conjecture as to average but an ounce and a half or two ounces will not be above the mark  at present the manager works under the difficulty of wanting european assistants his miningengineer and one mechanic lately left him to return home and he has only a white bookkeeper an english workingminer and a mechanic besides a man who made his way from the coast on foot and who is now doing good honest work the progress made by mr maclennan during his ten months of charge has been most creditable he has literally opened the mine the works of which were begun by m dahse he has personally supervised the transport and erection of all the machinery and at present in addition to the ordinary managerial routine he has to act as chief of each and every department owing to his brave exertions the future of the effuenta mine is very promising it will teach those to come how to do it in contrast with another establishment which is the best guide how not to do it if the board prove itself efficient this property will soon pay a dividend but halfhearted measures will go far to stultify the able and energetic work i found on the spot footnote this forecast has been unexpectedly verified with the least possible delay perfect communication has been established between the shafts and levels and the mine can now october 1882 turn out 100 tons a day at five shillings but imperfect pumps have been sent out and the result is a highly regretable block of the value of the mine there can be no doubt  the northern extremity of the tákwá ridge whose length may be nine to ten miles remains unappropriated as far as can be known the furthest concession has been made i am told to mr creswick south of the section in question lies a property now in the hands of the late m bonnats executors the grant was given to him as a weddingpresent by his friends the chiefs report says that from this part of the lode which is riddled with native pits came some of the specimens that floated the g c m company succeeds in due order the african gold coast company french and english which was brought out in 1878 it is popularly and locally known as the tákwá not tarcquah mine from the large native village which infests its grounds i have described the effuenta its southern neighbour beyond this again is a strip belonging to the francoenglish company and lastly at the southern buttend divided by a break from the main ridge lies the tamsoomewoosoo mines of wassaw the latter has lately been companyed under the name of the tacquah gold mines company by dr j a b horton and mr ferdinand fitzgerald of the famous african times when its directors inform us that twenty ounces of gold lately arrived from a neighbouring mine the produce of stamping of twentyfive tons of ore similar to that of tamsoomewoosoo they may not have been aware that the produce in question was worked from the alluvial drift discovered about the end may 1881 in the northwestern corner of the swanzy estates this drift has no connection with the tákwá ridgelodes  after morning tea on march 28 i bade a temporary adieu to my most hospitable host and walked along the ridgecrest to the establishment of the francoenglish or african gold coast company here i found only one person dr burke an independent practitioner who is allowed lodging but not board m haillot of paris formerly accountant and bookkeeper was in temporary charge of this mine and of abosu during mr bowdens absence i shall give further detail on my return march passing through the spiritreeking tákwá village where nearly every hovel is a shebeen i walked along the valley separating the ridge from its western neighbour vinegar hill and in half an hour entered the huts belonging to the gold coast mining company footnote these gentlemen are still october 1882 doing hard and successful work at the mines here i breakfasted with the brothers gowan who had been left in charge by mr creswick my notes on this establishment must also be reserved for a future page  twentyfive minutes walking brought me to where the main road a mere bushpath strikes across a gully separating two crests of the tákwá ridge then came a good stretch of level ground composed of sand and gravel of stained quartz clothed with the ordinary secondgrowth when this ended i passed over the northern heads of two small buttes which lie unconformably the direction of their main axes lies northnorthwest whereas all their neighbours trend to the northnortheast the climb was followed by a second level bounded on the left or north by the abo yáo hill the emplacement of the mines dor daboassu two branch paths lead up to it from the main line of road near the western is a place chosen as a cemetery for europeans as usual it is neglected and overgrown with bush  presently i arrived at the village of abosu a walk of about two hours from the tákwá mine ten months ago it contained forty to fifty head of negroes now it may number 3000 although the may emigration had begun when the workmen return to their homes being unable to labour in the flooded flats there was the hum of a busy buzzing crowd sinking pits and shafts some in the very streets and outside their own doors this alluvial bed must be one of the richest in the country and it is wholly native property under king angu of apinto there is little to describe in the village every hut is a kind of store where the most poisonous of intoxicants the stinkingest of pomatum and the gaudiest of pockethandkerchiefs are offered as the prizes for striking gold there are also a few goldsmiths shops where the precious metal is adulterated and converted to coarse rude ornaments the people are able fences and powder fuses and miningtools easily melt into strong waters hence abosu is a paradise to the fanti police and to the haussa garrison of tákwá  i looked about abosu to prospect the peculiarities of the place where the sierra leonite and the cape coast anglonigger were conspicuous for cheek and general offensiveness these ignoble beings did not spare even poor nero they blatantly wondered what business i had to bring such a big brute in order to frighten the people resuming my way along the flat by a winding path i came upon a model bit of corduroying over a bad marsh crossed the bridge and suddenly sighted mr f f crockers coffeemill stampingbattery it lies at the southwestern end of a butte one of a series disposed in parallel ranges and trending in the usual direction all have quartzreefs buried in red clay and are well wooded with here and there small clearings the names are moderncrockers reef to the east sams reef and so forth  then i passed an admirably appointed sawmill at this distance from the coast where transport costs 24l to 26l a ton carpenters work must be done upon the spot a wide clean road metalled with gravel and in places bordered by pineapples led to storehouses of bamboo and thatch built on either side of the way after walking from effuenta seven and a half geographical miles in three hours and fortyfive minutes i reached the establishment known as crockerville it dates from 1879 and in 1880 it forwarded its first remittance of 11l 10s to england the village was laid out under the superintendence of mr sam the ablest native employé it has ever been my fortune to meet he is the same who when districtcommissioner of axim laid out the town and planted the streetavenues in conversation with me he bitterly derided the native association formed at cape coast castle for obtaining concessions and for selling them to the benighted white man he resolved not to put his money in a business where all would be at loggerheads within six months unless controlled by an european  the houses are bamboo on stone platforms one block is occupied by the owner and a parallel building lodges mr sam and his wife the two being connected by an open dininghall the kitchen and offices lie to the north and east further west are quarters for european miners and others again for mr turner now acting manager and his white clerk furthest removed are the black quarters the huts forming a street  crockerville at present is decidedly short of hands the number on the books all told black and white is only sixtytwo when the whole property comes to be worked divided and subdivided it will require between a thousand and fifteen hundred the hands are mostly country people including a few gangs employed to sink shafts one gang lately deserted for the following reason two men were below charging the shots from a heap of loose powder whilst their friends overhead were quietly smoking their pipes a firetick thrown across the shaft burnt a fellows fingers and he at once dropped it upon his brethren underground they were badly scorched and none of the gang has been seen since i mention this accident as proving how difficult it is to manage the black miner the strictest regulations are issued to prevent the fatuous nigger killing himself but all in vain he is worse if possible than his white confrère if i had the direction all the powderwork should be done by responsible europeans i would fire by electricity the battery remaining in the managers hands and no native should be trusted with explosives  here i fell amongst old acquaintances and was only too glad to remain with them between friday and thursday mr turner gave me one of his bedrooms and mr crockers sittingroom was always open by day we messed together clerks mechanics and all in the open dininghall this is mr crockers plan and i think it by far the best the masters eye preserves decorum and his presence prevents unreasonable complaints about rations the french allow each european employé 4s 9d a day for food and hire of servants and attempt most unfairly to profit by the sale of provisions and wines the consequence is that everything is disjointed and uncomfortable some starve themselves to save money others overdrink themselves because meat is scarce and all complain that the sum which would suffice for many is insufficient for one  the swanzy establishment has set up an exceptionally light battery of twelve stamps made in sections for easier transport neither here nor in any of the mines have stonebreakers or automatic feeders yet been introduced the stuff is all handspalled one small belleville drives the stamps another works the tangye pump and a third turns the sawmills i will notice a few differences between the swanzy system and that of effuenta the wooden framework of the stampmill is better than iron the camshaft here carries only single not double cams a decided disadvantage in order to strike the same number of blows per minute it has to make double the number of revolutions moreover by some unhappy mistake it is too far from its work and the result is a succession of sharp blows on the tappets with injury to all the gear on the other hand proper fingers are fitted to the stamps this is far better than supporting them by a rough chock of wood at crockerville as at effuenta only six of the twelve stamps were working there the pump was at fault here the blankettables had not been made wide enough i could hardly estimate the total amount of ore brought to grass or its average yield specimens of white quartz with threads strings and lobs of gold have been sent to england from crockers reef the best tailings are reserved either for treatment on the spot or for reduction in england the mine as regards present condition is in the stage of prospecting upon a large and liberal scale the stamps are chiefly used to run through samples of from 50 to 100 tons taken from the various parts of the property in this way the most exact results can be obtained during my visit they were preparing to work a hundred tons from aji bipa the fourth and furthest butte to the northwest  i visited this mound in company with mr sam who interpreted the name to be that of the gambogefruit we descended as we had ascended by the stampingbattery crossed the bridge and then struck northwards over the third hillock to no 4 unlike crockers reef aji bipa does not show visible gold its other peculiarities will best be explained by the report i wrote on the spot  this property is situated near crockerville and can always be easily reached from that place in fact the southern boundary marches with the northern limit of the crockerville estate the rich goldbearing lode is situated on the western slope of the hill and can be seen in all the three shafts which have been sunk the formation of the hill seems in many respects to correspond with the lingula flags at and near clogau dolgelli and gogafau this formation is practically the same as that of the range of hills on which the concessions of the gold coast mining company of the african gold coast mining company of the effuenta company of the mines dor daboassu abosu and the tamsu concessions are situated and also as that of tebribi hill but each of the three areas has its own marked features in all the rocks are talcose and show a sort of conglomerate of quartz pebbles in some cases waterworn and in others angular bedded in a mixture of quartz and granite detritus this has in the three areas undergone varying degrees of pressure and has been upheaved at different angles in some cases the pressure and heat have been so great that the rock assumes a distinctly gneissic character  at aji bipa the lode runs n 38º e mag in the centre shaft and n 40 e in the southern shaft a sort of fault occurring in the centre shaft in the northern shaft i should put it at 38º but from the way in which the neighbouring rock had cleaved it was difficult to get the strike accurately the dip is the same in all three shafts viz 82º the lode being so near vertical it can be clearly traced for the whole depth of the shafts and is very well defined the hanging eastern wall is highly coloured with iron oxides and contains many quartz crystals which are throughcoloured with the same and i do not think it at all unlikely that garnets and other gems may be found in it one or two minute crystals showed a green colour and might be tourmaline or emerald but perhaps it was only a surfacecolour caused by the presence of copper the foot wall is very well marked by a strip of whitish yellow clay about an inch in thickness the rock on both sides of the lode is goldbearing and is evidently as well as the real lode formed of the debris of old quartz and granites talcose flakes are frequent and in some places it seems to be clearly gneiss although with a small plant it might not be profitable to treat this still with large and suitable machinery it may be made to pay and the trouble of separating the rich lode from the inferior stone avoided one remarkable trait in the lode is the manner in which it splits into blocks and slabs all the faces of the quartz pebbles being cloven in precisely the same plane  the length of the concession along the line of lode is 2780 feet and from the way in which the lode stands on the western slope of the hill and the dip being eastward i am of opinion that if a drift were put through the hill other and parallel lodes would be found of course this can only be proved by experience  the thickness of the lode where i measured it varied from 2212 to 25 inches in the southern shaft and although i saw one pinch in the northern and the fault in the centre one it can easily be traced and worked and should prove most profitable in the centre shaft it is 24 inches and in the northern 30 inches  a curious sort of black substance occurs close to the line of clay which defines the under side of the lode and may be remnants of some vegetable material but with the means at my disposal i will not give any decided opinion  over the rock which forms the main body of the hill lie the usual red clay and oxidised quartz gravels which if treated by hydraulic mining ought as it contains gold to prove a paying stuff moreover washing off the surfacedirt would lay bare the rock and render all afterwork easy and simple  the alluvials in the bottoms should here prove unusually rich and means might be adopted by which they should be raised mechanically and then flumed down again  ample water supply exists both for hydraulic mining and reefworking there are good sites for all necessary machinery and building and timber as usual is to be had in any quantity that may be required  the question of transport is of course a most important one and in the present state of the roads and country very expensive but from the routesurvey i have made i am convinced that a cheap and efficient service to the mines of this and neighbouring districts would be easily organised and that instead of paying as at present the absurd price of 4s or 5s per ton per mile it could be reduced to an average of from 4d to 6d the shafts now open are       south  45 feet deep 9 feet by 4 feet 9 inches       centre 36 feet deep 8 feet 6 inches by 4 feet 2 inches       north  45 feet deep 8 feet by 5 feet 10 inches  this is both a most valuable and interesting piece of country to work and i hope that it may soon be provided with all necessary staff plant and machinery  rich returns may be confidently expected and under proper management should prove a most paying business  the exploratory works now existing have been done in an honest and businesslike manner like all i have seen where mr crocker and mr turner have worked and the zeal and intelligence displayed by mr sam could scarcely be equalled and certainly not surpassed  i have not said anything about the quantity of gold to the ton as the experimental crushings at crockerville will enable a much more accurate idea to be formed than any i could make from the handwashings i saw done  the boxes of specimens sealed by me are the result of blasts and excavation done whilst i was on the spot  footnote temperature etc at crockerville date        thermometer     bar    rainfall             max   min

daboassu this being my second visit the first on the previous sunday had been more interesting in the point of anthropological than of geological study the day of rest had been devoted to a general jollification by most of the whites and the blacks had ably followed suit the best example was set by the doctor attached he was said to have emptied sixtytwo bottles of cognac during his twentythree days of steamerpassage but brandy proving insufficient he had recourse to opium chloral and bromide of potassium a pint and a half of laudanum barely sufficing for the week i need hardly say where the abuse of stimulants and opiates lands a man either in western africa or in england  from the abosu village and its abominations i turned sharp to the northwest and ascended the steep western flank of abo yáo whose highest point is 312 feet above sealevel the distance from crockerville is a mile and threequarters or a mile in a straight line and from tákwá about six m dahse increases the latter to nine miles the difference of latitude being three and a quarter miles and of longitude four my map will be the first to correct these distances which are exaggerated by the native carriers to get more pay  the summit of abo yáo commands an extensive view to the north here the range of vision is about sixteen miles over the greenest of second growths and the whole is dotted with buttes of red clay somewhat lower than on the stone abosu it is easy to see that here again we have an ancient archipelago like that which formerly fringed the shore of axim but of older formation in fact i should not expect to find a true coast before entering the grassy zone north of the great belt of forest each hill must carry at least one core of auriferous reef the intervening valleys gullies and gulches seldom more than a hundred feet above oceanlevel have been warped up by gradual deposition from the north and are doubtless full of rich alluvium this might be worked by steamnavvies and washed upon the largest possible scale the result would be excellent ground for plantations  i look upon abosu as an eastern outlier of the greater tákwá ridge but although the hill preserves the normal direction the reef lies almost at right angles to it crossing the upper end and striking from north 40º west to south 40º east i am unable to divine what caused this curious dislocation the gold matrix is still the tákwá gneiss rarely showing visible metal possibly the present diggings have struck only a large branch or a break  here miningoperations have been extensive and about 1800 tons of rich stuff have already been brought to bank the diggings begin with an open cut of 110 feet this leads to a tunnel in the rock partly timbered by which the lode with a dip of 41º is bisected eastward from the tunnel a gallery has been driven 147 feet along the vein and westwards there is a similar passage of 202 feet about 140 feet on either side of the tunnel two rises one 16 the other 12 feet long are being driven up the slope of the reef on the hillside above the tunnel a shaft 80 feet deep has been sunk but it has not struck the vein for some peculiar reason the bottom is made broader than the top and the miningcaptain has a shrewd idea that like the native pits of similar form it may end by caving in again a second tunnel has just been opened in the southern end of the butte the engineer hoping to find the main lode lying conformably or north with easting  a little above the northern foot of the abo yáo the native workmen are employed in making a large platform or terrace for stamps and other machinery now it is about 150 × 40 yards as yet there is no power a large open shed of timberposts with a roofing of corrugated iron stands ready to receive the expected sawmill the only actual industry is digging  at abosu the personnel is lodged in bamboohouses scattered over the hillside and the settlement contrasts dismally with the orderly comfort of crockerville m haillot acting manager of abosu and tákwá leads a caravanlife between the two fortunately for him the distance is inconsiderable i here met mr symonds a cornish miner who has worked in mexico and who speaks spanish fluently enabling him to converse with m plisson he was one of our fellowpassengers and he rejoiced exceedingly to see me he and his youngster mr mitchell who suffers from chestcomplaint praised the prospects of the mine but did not enjoy their pay being cut for passage and the system of rationmoney another unwise plan adopted by the french company is to stipulate upon twenty workingdays each of ten hours per mensem in default of which salaries undergo proportional deduction this makes the miner work even when he is unfit for exertion white labour however is confined to superintendence and to laying out and building tunnels a swiss m schneuvelly acts as general superintendent and he is assisted by two french ouvriers the hands are chiefly krumen the style of working is decidedly loafy and the pipe is touched at all hours and in all places  north of abosu lies the dahse concession a square of 1000 fathoms to be worked by an anglogerman company i know it only by hearsay and by seeing it upon the owners map  m haillot invited me to be his guest and i spent my day in the mine next morning april 8 we retraced our steps towards tákwá halting by the way at the northernmost establishment on the ridge the gold coast mining company limited this concession an area of 1000 x 500 fathoms on the west of the hillheight does not as yet show much progress and the works seem to have increased but little since last year there are two shafts and two tunnels to strike the lode the ore brought to grass was not in large quantities although i had heard to the contrary the stone is said to be abnormally rich yielding seven ounces of gold to the ton but i did not think it richer than its neighbours and i suspect that it will have to be rated at oneseventh the managers house also on the west of the hill consists of one large room of plankage raised on posts and thatched the brothers gowan who are working exceedingly hard and mr kenyon who is leaving for england were the only white men i saw the hands are chiefly kruboys and the artificers sierra leonites since mr creswicks departure for europe some changes have been made mr growan the acting manager has transferred the future works to a higher level and has fitted up a reductionoffice where there is at present nothing to reduce crucibles and chemicals are ranged round a long room with an iron roof the tenant has borrowed a mortarbox two stampheads shoes and dies and has fitted them with wooden stems and camshafts he proposes to drive them by twoman power in order to crush three tons of ore per diem and to test a new patent amalgamator  i breakfasted with the scanty staff and then walked down the western valley to the tákwá establishment the oldest of the new miningindustries in the protectorate i place the african gold coast company by calculation in n lat 18º 20 and w long gr 1º 57 40 it is therefore fifteen direct geographical miles from tumento instead of thirty twentyseven not sixty from axim and thirtyfive from dixcove formerly supposed to be the nearest port this position will make an important difference in sundry plans and projects which were made under old and erroneous ideas of its topography at present the cost of transport from tumento to effuenta is 6d for 10 lbs 8d to tákwá and 10 d to abosu  the head of the valley shows a single stream the babeabárbawo or tákwá rivulet rising close to the works of the gold coast company it is swollen by small tributaries from either side and just below the settlement an eastern dam with a small sluice has been thrown across the valley of the francoenglish company as there is plenty of water in and near the mine they should cut at once this abominable dam which forms a pestilential swamp the cesspool of the neighbourhood the tákwá settlement a line of bamboo and swish huts well built enough lies like a hamlet in congoland along the winding road it is bare of trees but here and there a shaft yawns before the doors m dahse makes the population before 1879 to have been 6000 souls and in 1881 about 3000 i should reduce the latter figure to 600 and propose for 1882 before the may emigration 1500 to 1600 the people are coastmen and islanders of every tribe with a fair sprinkling of dissolute ruffians white blackmen from sierra leone and akra drunken fanti policemen and plundering haussa soldiers the exmanager of the effuenta mine says in allusion to his early residence there so wird einem das leben daselbst zu einer wahren hölle and he rightly describes the peculiar industries of these true infernal regions as schnappskneipen spielhöllen und schlimmeres almost every house combines the pub and the agapemone all the chief luxuries of the coastfactories are there and the blay basket of sierra leone comes out strong brilliant cottons and kerchiefs hang from the normal line there is pomatum for the lucky dandy and tallow for the miner down in his luck whilst golddust is conjured from pouch or pocket by pipes and tobacco needles and thread beads knives and other notions  the northern part of this veritable nigger diggers delight is now comparatively deserted some chief died there and the people have crowded into the main body of the settlement the village of kwábina angu king of eastern apinto is now joined to tákwá i could not distinguish the palast of king kwámi enimill who rules western wásá and whose capital is akropong  m haillot had preceded me in a hammock and welcomed me to his quarters he occupied one of the three or four raised plankhouses another lodged dr burke and a third m voltaire mr carlyon another young cornishman who came out with us and sundry french ouvriers a large bamboohouse had been built for a general restaurant it became a barrack during the ashanti scare and now it is quite unused standing farther back are the very respectable tenements of the same material with broad verandahs occupied at times by mr exmissionary dawson and family the negro quarters are mostly in the tákwá village  the father of the african mines dating from 1878 lies on the northern third of the celebrated tákwá ridge and its concession embraces an area of 1000 x 2000 fathoms the rich auriferous reef is the backbone of a long narrow line of hill whose diameter ranges between 1000 feet to 600 where it is pinched the lode strikes to the northnortheast with a dip of 47º west the angle of underlay i may remark greatly varies in these gold coast reefs some are nearly vertical 82º others are moderately inclined 20º to 50º and others run almost flat the richest part not including the brokenoff ore is from eighteen inches to two feet broad it is decidedly more than one to two hundred years old as reported home by a scientific official on the spot the coffins or abandoned native diggings must date from at least two centuries ago the natives scraped off the goldbearing stone till the water drove them out the formation is upper silurian or lower devonian a transition to gneiss but not highly metamorphic no fossils have yet been found if any exist they would be microscopic where talcose it is bluish and shows streaks of black sand titaniferous iron the grey sand washes to white there are potholes which have been filled with either a pudding or a breccia of quartz in places the gneiss has been so little changed by heat and pressure that it forms arenaceous flags and shales it suggests a deposit in some ancient lagoon alternately fresh and salt a hard fissile slate of purple colour is based upon the groundrock of grey granite there is also a modern clayslate which lies unconformably to the older and through it the great veins of gneiss and quartz seem to pass the alluvial detritus which fills up the valleys to their present level is formed by the diluvium of the hills in parts these bottoms show strata from one to three feet thick of waterrolled pebbles bedded in clay here and there the couch must be a hundred feet deep and the whole should be raised for washing by machinery these strata were apparently deposited in a lagoon of more modern date  the gold is sometimes visible in the gneiss and i have seen pieces whose surface is dotted with yellow spots resembling pyrites it is often in the form of spangles called floatgold and flourgold select specimens have yielded upwards of eight ounces to the ton if the blanketings and first tailings be properly treated it should afford an average of at least an ounce and a half per ton treating a hundred tons a day gives a sum of 30000 per annum and assuming 6l of gold to the ton we have a total of 180000l the working of this section of the mine should not exceed 30000l a year which leaves a net gain of 150000l  the bergwerke consist of four tunnels driven into the lower part of the western hillside further down than the bottom of the abandoned native workings they are eccentrically disposed in curves and other queer figures all abut upon galleries running in sections along the lodeline and intended ultimately to connect the total length may be a thousand feet being cut in the gneiss they require no timbering but the floors are little raised above the level of the rivulet and water percolates through roofs and walls the latest tunnel has been driven past the new gallery and has struck a second lode this has never been worked by the natives and stoping to above the springs may be found advisable ventilation is managed by means of the old abandoned native shafts a very large quantity of ore is brought to bank i found it hard to form an estimate because it was in scattered heaps overgrown with vegetation but i should not be surprised if it amounted to 5000 tons this means that want of proper machinery has resulted in a dead capital of from 20000l to 30000l  a space has been cleared on the level of the trams uniting the mouths of the tunnel and here will be placed the elephantstamps actually on their way out they have now two batteries each of six head worked by the same shaft the steamengine as usual is the belleville the material is bad the gratings on the levels of the dies have been smashed by the stones bombarding them and the illconstructed foundations of native wood are eaten by white ants yet they have done duty for only eighteen months the sludge was treated in fancy amalgamators especially in one with a pan and revolving arms probably evolved out of the inner consciousness of some gentleman in paris the result was discharging upwards of 1500 lbs of mercury into the valley below a little amalgam was obtained and proved that the rock does contain golda fact perfectly well known for centuries to the natives  the history of the african gold coast mine in the hands of francoenglish shareholders has already been noticed m bonnat preferred reworking the old native diggings to the virgin reefs lying north and south of them some of the latter can be worked for years without pumping on the others the plant will be expensive but the company instead of mining has gone deeply into concessionmongering and their grants are scattered broadcast over the country one of them the mankuma near aodua the capital of eastern apinto extends twentysix miles with a depth of 500 yards on either bank of the ancobra river above the mouth of the abonsá influent these gigantic areas will give rise to many lawsuits and no man in the country has power to make such a grant the ownership of the land is vested in a squirearchy so to speak and only the proprietors have a right to sell or lease when gold is worked the squire takes his royalty from the miner and he or his chiefs must in turn pay tribute to the king hence the money may pass through three or four hands before reaching its final destination  these indiscriminate concessions will be very injurious to the future of the protectorate and should be limited by law at present the only use is to sell them to syndicates and companies and so to pay a fictitious dividend to the actionnaires evidently such a process is rather on the bear and bull system of the stockmarket than legitimate mining  i was well acquainted with the late m bonnat a bright cheery little frenchman of great energy some knowledge of the fanti or rather the ashanti language and perfect experience of the native character born at a village near macon he began life as a cook on board a merchant ship he soon became agent to some small french trading firm and then pushed his way high up the unexplored volta river here the ashantis barred his passage and eventually took him prisoner as he attempted to cross their limits he was carried to kumási where he remained in confinement for three years when the war of 18731874 set him at liberty he passed through wásá to europe and by his local information and that gathered in captivity he secured the public ear for the goldmines his later proceedings are well known and some of their unfortunate results are best unrelated  i met m bonnat last in june 1881 he was then going up to tákwá in company with messieurs bowden and macarthy and i was canoeing down the ancobra on my way home he was suffering severely from a carbuncular boil on the thigh which he refused to have properly opened his death which occurred within a fortnight is usually attributed to pleuropneumonia but i rather think it was due to bloodpoisoning he had been exposing himself recklessly for some months and two drenchings in the rain brought him to his end yet there are people who remember his visit to the forbidden fetishvalley of apatim the father of the modern goldmines the frenchman who taught englishmen how to work their own wealth lies buried at tákwá i did not see his tomb  the two french mines tákwá and abosu have at last agreed to join hands and to become one the capital has been fixed at 250000l and paris will be the headquarters mr arthur bowden the manager has been sent for to and has now returned from france it is to be hoped that his extensive experience will instil some practical spirit into the new directory    chapter xxv  return to axim and departure for europe  i awoke on saturday april 9 in bad condition and during the afternoon had my third attack of fever the effect of the dam and its miasma wanting change of air and looking forward to effuenta i set off in my hammock and found my friends the tertian lasted me till monday sunday being an offday and as the tuesday was wet and uncomfortable i delayed departure till wednesday morning my warburg had unfortunately leaked out the paper cover of the phial was perfect but of the contents only a little sediment remained treatment therefore was confined to sulphate of quinine and a strychnine and arsenic pill arseniate of quinine would have been far better but the excellent preparation is too economical for the homepharmist and has failed to secure the favour of the coastdoctors one of my friends has made himself almost feverproof by the liberal use of arsenic but i can hardly recommend it as the result must be corrected by an equally liberal use of allans antifat burton who has studied its use amongst the styrian arseniceaters denies that this is the common effect he found that it makes the mountaineer preserve his condition wind and complexion arms him against ague and adds generally to his health he is still doubtful however whether it shortens or prolongs life  on wednesday april 12 i left effuenta after morning tea my hospitable host had nearly seen the last of his stores to which he had made me so cordially welcome and there were no signs of fresh supplies although they had long been due this is hardly fair treatment for the hardworking employé let the company look to it with a certain tightening of the heart i made over my canine friend nero to dr roulston he had lost all those bad habits which neglected education had engrafted upon the heat of youth he now began to show more fondness for sport than for sheepworrying and he retrieved one bird carrying it with the utmost delicacy of mouth  i set out on foot for vinegar hill and found that the steep eastern ascent from the tákwá ridge had been provided with a series of cut steps by mr commissioner in these lands as elsewhere new brooms sweep clean but they are very easily worn out this place has been for years the black beast of travellers especially in rainy weather when the rapid incline becomes so slippery that even the most surefooted slither and slide  after crossing the abonsá hill i took to my hammock and was carried through rain and a very devilry of weather into the abonsá village the whole path was shockingly bad and muddy once more i became a lodger of mr crockers his house being as usual far the best gave us good shelter for the night  next morning 730 we set out down the abonsá stream in a small canoe belonging to mr maclennan the natives made the usual difficulties the craft which was quite sound could not float and amongst other things she had no paddles for this however i had provided by making my men cut them last evening almost immediately after leaving this head of navigation barred above by a reef and a fall we saw that eternal mangrove presently the aunábé creek broke the line of the right bank our course was as usual exceedingly tortuous turning to every quadrant of the compass and during the last fortnight the waterlevel had risen four feet the formation of the trough is that of the ancobra and the bed bristles with rocks in a distance of seven miles and a half by course there were four small breaks and one serious rapid about a hundred yards long where the decline exceeded five feet here the men had to get overboard and to ease the canoe down the swirling waters which dashed heavily on the rocks the snags were even thicker than on the upper ancobra and were far more dangerous than on the st johns in places the mangrove fallen from the banks had taken root in the riverbed in fact unless some exertion be soon made even the present insufficient channel will be blocked up  at the abonsá embouchure mr wyatts map copied from m dahse shows an island backed by a ridge running nearly eastwest i found no riverholm and only a small broadening of the ancobra to about double its usual breadth the banks at the sharp angle of junction are however low and perhaps my predecessor saw them when flooded the mankuma hill on the right bank belonging to the francoenglish company is somewhat taller than its neighbours as usual in this siltedup archipelago it trends from the northeast to the southwest  i had already shot the ancobra river when paddling up and was not over lucky when coming down the big kingfisher did not put in an appearance and the sunbirds equally failed me the smallest item of my collection measures two and a quarter inches and is robed in blue crimson and sulphur i was fortunate enough to bring home four specimens of a rare spurplover lobivanellus albiceps they are now in mr sharps department of the british museum i killed a few little snakes and one large green treesnake two crocodiles both lost in the river and an iguana which found its way into the spiritcask a tzetzefly glossina morsitans was captured in effuenta house curiously deserting its usual habit of junglelife in preference to a home on clear ground its daggerlike proboscis in the grooved sheath with a ganglion of muscles at the base assimilated it to the dreaded and ferocious cattlescourge which extends from zanzibar to the tanganyika lake and from kilwa quiloa to the transvaal my kind friend and hospitable host dr now sir john kirk who did the geography and natural history for the lamentable zambeze expedition met it close to the victoria falls burton also sent home a specimen from the gold coast east of accra  mr maclennan gave me sundry beetles but insisted on retaining one which is the largest i ever saw the huntingdog must scour the bush in packs for the voice is exactly that of hounds the laugh of the hyæna and the scream of the buzzard are commonly heard the track of a bushcow once crossed my path the halves of the spoor were some five inches long by three wide and the hoofs knuckled backwards so as to show false hoofs of almost equal size i was unable to procure for dr günther a specimen of the bushdog as the kruboys call it last year i was bringing home a live one in the ss nubia but one day the fellow in charge reported that it was dead and had been thrown overboard i hold it to be a tailless lemur the galago of the east coast the french name is orson the popular idea being that it is an ursine the fanti peoples whose folklore is extensive and who have some tale about every bird beast and fish thus account for the loud cries which we heard at night in every bush king leo having lost his mother commanded by proclamation all his subjects to attend her funeral and none failed save orson one evening his feline majesty when going his rounds found the delinquent upon the ground and roughly demanded the reason why orson shuffling towards the nearest tree pleaded in all humility o king is thy beloved parent really deceased i never heard of it i am so sorry i would never have failed to show the respect due to the royal house when he had climbed the foot of the tree his tone began to alter but sire if thy majesty hath lost a mother i see no cause compelling me to attend her funeral and when quite safe the change was notable bother the old woman very glad she is dead and may her grave be defiled these people know the stuff of which courtiers are made  my collection of specimens from the mines and the riverbeds filled a dozen cases the butterflies of which we collected a large number were all spoilt by the moth for want of camphor insectpowder had been our only preservative i had also a thirtygallon cask of plants preserved in spirits two boxes well stuffed a large case of orchids and a raceme of the bamboopalm raphia vinifera whose use has still to be found the animals including insects in tubes filled nearly two kegs and three bottles and i had two small cases of stuffed birds the handiwork of mr dawson  of stoneimplements i was lucky enough to secure thirtysix and made over four of them to my friend professor prestwich they are found everywhere throughout the country but i saw no place of manufacture except those noted near axim mr sam of tumento promised to forward many others to england the native women search for and find them not only near the beds of streams but also about the alluvial diggings nearly all are shaped like the iron axe or adze of urúa in central africa a long narrow blade with rounded top and wedgeshaped edge this tool is either used in the hand like a chisel or inserted into a conical hole burnt through a treebranch and the shape of the aperture makes every blow tighten the hold the people mount it in two ways either as an axe in line with or as an adze at a right angle to the helve  at akankon i obtained from mr amondsen a stoneimplement of novel shape not seen by me elsewhere a bit of the usual closegrained trap had been cut into a parallelopiped seven and a half inches long with a flat head one inch and a half in diameter and a beveledge of two inches and onethird along the slope this part had been chipped ready for grinding and the article was evidently unfinished one side still wanted polishing and the part opposite the bevel showed signs of tapering as if a point instead of an edge had been intended at axim i split off by gads and wedges a large slice of the grooved rocks described by burton it came home with me and is now lodged in the british museum  the rest of my story is told in a few words i canoed safely down the ancobra river and reached axim on april 14 this return was made sad and solitary by the absence of my canine friend nero  a week soon passed away at the port of the goldregion mr grant presently returned from his excursion to the west he showed me fine specimens of gold collected at newtown the english frontiersettlement immediately east of french assini i had also warned him to look out for and he succeeded in finding beds of bitumen permeated with petroleum this material will prove valuable for fuel and for asphalting if not for sale my time was wholly taken up with papering and repacking my collection which had now assumed formidable proportions and time fled the faster as the days were occupied in also fighting an impertinent attack of ague and fever  on april 24 the b and a ss loanda captain brown anchored in the roads mr grant accompanied me on board and showed himself useful and energetic as usual at cape palmas we shipped the honourable doctor and professor blyden he pointed out to me certain hillocks on the coast about grand bassá where he said gold had lately been found the lay of the land and the strike and shape of the eminences reminded me strongly of those i had left behind me the secretary of the interior who had been compelled to leave his college assured me that if wiser counsels prevail liberia will abandon her old japanese policy of exclusion and will open her ports to european capital and enterprise at sierra leone i called upon governor havelock who was recovering from the accident of a dislocated shoulder both he and the governess were in the best of health at madeira on may 12 my companion burton joined us and we had a week of dull passage to liverpool as we left on friday and carried a reverend gentleman on board the cranky old craft was sorely tossed about for two successive days and we were delayed off the liverpool bar arriving on the 20th instead of the 18th of may 1882    conclusion  the journey and the voyage ended as such things should do with a dinner of welcome at the adelphi given to us by our hospitable friend mr james irvine and here we had the first opportunity of delivering the message which we had brought home from the golden land     appendix i  §1 the ashanti scare  that fears of an ashanti attack upon the mines of the gold coast protectorate are rather fanciful than factual we may learn from the details of the blue book gold coast 1881 the threatened ashanti invasion popularly termed the ashanti scare did abundant good by showing up the weakness of that once powerful despotism and the superiority in numbers and in equipment of the coastlanders over the inlanders it is true that there are tribes like the awunahs of the volta and villages like béin in apollonia which still sympathise with our old enemy but only the grossest political mismanagement like that which in 1876 abandoned our ally the king of juabin to the tender mercies of his ashanti foeman aided by the unwisest economy which starves everything to death save the treasurechest will ever bring about a general movement against us  on december 1 1880 died to the general regret of native and stranger mr ussher governor and commanderinchief of the gold coast a veteran in the tropics and an excommissariat officer whose political service dated from 1861 in british india a change of rulers is always supposed to offer a favourable opportunity for doing something often in the shape of a revolt or a campaign the same proved to be the case in west africa where the ashanti is officially described as crafty persistent mendacious and treacherous  it may easily be imagined that after the english victories at amoaful and ordusu in 187374 the african despotism sighed for la revanche the treaty of fománá concluded february 13 after the capture february 4 and the firing february 6 of kumasi between sir garnet wolseley and the representative of the king kofi kalkali or kerrikerri subsequently dethroned stripped her of her principal dependencieslopped off in fact her four limbs these were the everhostile province of denkira auriferous akim adansi and lastly assin now part of our protectorate the measure only renewed the tripartite treaty of april 27 1831 when king kwáko dúa in consideration of free access to the seaboard and in friendship with the unfortunate and illtreated governor george maclean renounced all right or title to any tribute or homage from the kings of denkira assin and others formerly his subjects but nulla fronti fides is the rule of the hideous little negro despotism which in 1853 again invaded the coveted lands on its southern frontier assin  the treaty of 1874 moreover compelled ashanti formally to renounce all pretensions to sovereignty over elmina and the tribes formerly in connection with the dutch government it vetoed her raids and forays upon neighbouring peoples like dahome she had her annual slavehunts and the captives were sold for golddust to the inner tribes the young officers who replaced the veterans of the war would naturally desire in kafir parlance to wash their spears nor are they satisfied with the defeats sustained by their sires i believe wrote winwood reade that sir garnet wolseley attained the main object of the expedition namely the securing of the protectorate from periodical invasion yet still i wish that the success had been more definite and complete the wish is echoed by most people on the coast and the natives still say white man he go up kumasi he whip black boy and then he run away  it is regretable that the commanderinchief if he could not occupy kumasi himself did not leave sir john h glover in charge and especially that he did not destroy the bantama royal place of human sacrifice footnote sir garnet wolseleys admirable conduct of the egyptian campaign where he showed all the qualities which make up the sum of generalship have wiped out the memory of his failures in ashanti and kafirland better still he has proved that the british soldier can still fight a fact upon which the disgraceful zulu campaign had cast considerable doubt but the public ignores a truth known to every professional under an incompetent or unlucky commander all but the best men will run the worst will allow themselves to be led or driven to victory by one they trust compare the egyptian troops under old ibrahim pasta and under arabi the felahpasha or at least remove from it the skull of sir charles macarthy footnote captain brackenbury throws doubt upon the skull being preserved in the bantama but his book is mainly apologetic and we may ask if the cherished relic be not there where is it the native legend runs thus and they took him ie macarthy and cut off his head and brought it to their camp and removed the brains but the skull which was left they filled it with gold and they roasted the whole body and they carried it to ashanti and the head which they bore to ashanti has become their fetish which they worship till this daynative account of macarthys death zimmermanns grammar of the accra or ga language stuttgart 1858 and yet we now learn that the campaign did good work captain lonsdale who has spent some time in kumasi reports that the caboceers have built huts instead of repairing their palaces moreover he declares that the story of sacrificing girls to mix their blood with houseswish is a pure fabrication the ashantis would no longer dare to do anything so offensive to the conqueror  last on the list of solid ashanti grievances is her exclusion from the seaboard unknown to history before ad 1700 the despotism first invaded the coast in 1807 when king osai tutu kwámina pretended a wish to recover the fugitive chiefs chibbu and aputai these attacks succeeded one another at intervals of ten years say the fantis the main object was to secure a port on the coast where the inlanders could deal directly with the white man and could thus escape the unconscionable pillaging often fifty per cent and more of the fanti middleman this feeling is not indeed unknown to europe witness montenegro i see no reason why the people should not have an ashantimile at the volta mouth and i shall presently return to this subject  hardly was governor ussher buried than troubles began mr edmund watt a young districtcommissioner at cape coast castle officially reported to lieutenantgovernor w b griffith subsequently administrator of lagos that opoku king of bekwa becquah had used language tending to a breach of the peace this commanderinchief of the ashanti forces in 187374 had publicly sworn in his sober senses at kumasi and in presence of the new king kwámina osai mensah that he would perforce reduce adansi the hillcountry held to be the southern boundary of ashantiland such a campaign would have been an infraction of treaty or at least a breach of faith although the province is not under the protection of the colonial government king kofi kalkali footnote this ruler succeeded his father king kwáko dúa in 1868 and his compulsory abdication is considered to have been an illadvised measure had promised to respect its independence and to leave it unmolested  lieutenantgovernor griffith lost no time in forwarding the report to the colonial office adding sundry disquieting rumours which supported his suspicions missionaries and merchants had observed that certain messengers or envoys sent from kumasi to acknowledge the presents of the late governor ussher were lingering without apparent reason about cape coast castle after being formally dismissed moreover their residing in the house of prince ansah a personage not famous for plain dealing boded no good  a new complication presently arose prince owusu nephew of the king and heir to the doughty gyáman kingdom fled from kumasi to the protectorate and reached elmina on january 18 he appeared in great fear and declared that a son of the chief amankwá kwomá and three courtcriers or official heralds were coming down to the coast on a solemn mission to demand his extradition they carried he said not the peaceful cane with the gold or silver head but the mysterious gold axe opinions at once differed as to the import and object of this absurd implement according to some its mission portended war and it had preceded the campaigns of 1863 and 1873 others declared that it signified a serious palaver being a strong hint that the king would cut through and down every obstacle strange to say the first ashanti messengers were never called upon to explain before the public what the gold axe really did mean  the colonial office acted with spirit and wholesome vigour it was urged on by mr griffith whose energetic reports certainly saved the protectorate grave troubles he has thereby incurred much blame ridicule and obloquy nor has he received due credit from those under whom he served  the newlyappointed governor and commanderinchief of the gold coast sir samuel rowe at once ordered out to relieve mr griffith left england in midfebruary he was accompanied by a staff of seven officers temporarily employed reinforcements were hurried from sierra leone and the west indies the admiralty was applied to for the reunion of cruisers upon the gold coast waters estimates of native allies were drawn up showing that 20000 halfarmed men could be brought into the field against the 30000 of ashanti the loyal and powerful chief kwámina blay of atábo in amrehía or western apollonia offered 6000 muskets and an additional 1000 hands if the government would supply arms and ammunition  on january 19 the ambassador with the gold axe presented himself at elmina he was accompanied by saibi enkwiá who had signed the treaty at fománá a village in assin between kumasi and the bosom prah river the envoy formally demanded possession of prince owusu and of one amangkrá an ashanti trader who had aided him to escape saibi enkwiá added by way of threat the king said if the governor would not order the return of owusu to kumasi he would attack the assins he further explained that these assins were the people who always caused palavers between the ashantis and the protectorate to which they belonged  naturally the ignominious demand was refused the messengers left for kumasi and lieutenantgovernor griffith telegraphed from madeira to england january 25 war imminent with ashanti it was considered suspicious that all the inlanders were disappearing from the coast this was afterwards explained they were flocking north for the native christmas the yamcustom or great festival of the year  our preparations were pushed forward the more energetically as time appeared to be tight the ashantis were buying up all the weapons they could find when the sale of arms ammunition and salt was prohibited detachments were despatched to the mansu and prahsu stations the latter is upon the bosom abosom or sacred prah the frontier between ashanti and the protectorate to cross which is to pass the rubicon here as at other main fords and ferries defensive works were laid out arrangements were made for holding nine out of the eighteen forts abandoning the rest and accra was strengthened as the central place the companies or native levies who with a suspicious unanimity applied for guns and gunpowder lead and flints were urged to the duty of defence five cruisers under commander now captain rn j w brackenbury were stationed off the three chief castles elmina cape coast and anamabo and the naval contingent was drilled daily on shore the haussa constabulary was reinforced the first west india regiment sent down men from sierra leone and the second 500 rank and file from barbadoes in fact such ardour was shown that the ashantis scared out of their intentions of scaring began to fear another english invasion the white men intend to take kumasi again they said and perhaps the reflection that 48000 ounces of gold were still due to us suggested a motive they had been making ready for offence now they prepared for defence  about midfebruary the situation notably changed messieurs buck and huppenbauer two german missionaries who were making a preachingtour reported from kumasi that king mensah was afraid of war and that his kingdom was on the point to go asunder the despot with african wiliness at once threw the blame of threatening assin upon his confidant saibi enkwiá no one believed that an ashantiman would thus expose himself to certain death but the explanation served for an excuse the king also asserted that his gold axe meant simply nothing thereupon the officials of the protectorate began looking forward to an ample apology and to a fine of golddust for the disturbing of their quiet days in fact they foresaw peace with honour  governor sir samuel rowe with his usual good fortune landed at elmina on march 9 exactly the right time the attempt to intimidate had ignobly failed and had recoiled upon the attempter king mensah in order to remove all suspicions of intending a campaign had resolved to send coastwards the most important and ceremonious mission of the age it was to conclude a kind of paix des dames queen kokofu had threatened that in case of hostilities she would go over to the british the queenmother a power in the country which has often kept the peace for it and plunged it into war threatened to take her own lifeand here such threats are always followed by action in fact the peaceparty had utterly overthrown the warparty  the mission left kumasi in may it was headed by prince bwáki stepfather to the two royal brothers kofi kalkali and kwábina osai mensah and the number as well as the high rank of the retinue made it remarkable at prahsu where the envoys were met by governor rowe a preliminary conversation took place despite the usual african and barbarian fencing and foiling the englishman carried the day the message must be delivered with all publicity and proper ceremony in the old palaverhall of historic elmina castle  a conclusive interview took place on may 30 prince bwáki explained that mistakes had been made but that the mistakes had not been alone those of his king and soninlaw he declared that the messenger saibi enkwiá had exceeded his powers in threatening assin the king he said had sworn by god and earth that is by the spirits above and by the ghosts below that he had sent no such message at the same time the king confessed being partly to blame as the message had been delivered by his own servant in the matter of the gold axe however the mistake was the mistake of the lieutenantgovernor griffith  the prince further explained that ashanti has two symbols of war a peculiar sword and a certain cap whereas the gold axe being fetish and endowed with some magical and mysterious power is never sent on a hostile errand he offered in the kings name as further evidence of friendly feeling to surrender the socalled golden axe which important symbol of ashanti power had been forwarded from headquarters with an especial mission it was delivered on the express understanding that it should be despatched to england for the acceptance of hb majesty and not be kept upon the coast exposed to the ribaldry of the hostile fantis the weapon said prince bwáki is so old that no one knows its origin and it is held so precious that in processions it precedes the great royal stool or throne of ashanti the leopardskin bound with gold upon the handle symbolises courage in the field the gold is wealth and the iron is strength  finally the unhappy gold axe after being publicly paraded upon a velvet cushion through the streets of elmina was entrusted to captain knapp barrow who returned to england by the next steamer it was duly presented and found its way to the south kensington museum after faring very badly at the hands of the society journals and other members of the fourth estate footnote for instance the gold axe of king koffee of ashantee lately sent for an unexplained reason to the queen is described as a triangular blade of iron apparently out from a piece of boilerplate roughly stuck into a clumsy handle of african oak the handle is covered with leopardskin part of which immediately above the blade is deeply soiled apparently with blood bands of thin gold enriched with uncouth chevrons and lunettes en repoussé are placed round the handle the sheath of the blade which is of tiger leopard skin accompanies this hideous implement and attached to it is the sole element which has anything like artistic merit this is a nondescript object of beaten gold in shape something like a large cockleshell with curved horns extending from the hinge and not inelegantly decorated with lines and punctures en repoussé and open work of quasiscrolls needless to say it was an utter impostor the real golden axe is great fetish and never leaves either kumasi or indeed the presence of the king  the ceremony of delivering the message in the palaverhall was satisfactory prince bwáki grasped the knees of governor rowe the official sign of kneeling he expressed the devotion of his liege lord to the majesty of england and finally he offered to pay down at once two thousand ounces of gold in proof of ashantian sincerity all these transactions were duly recorded the promises in the form of a bond  the play was now played out cruisers and troops dispersed and golden peace reigned once more supreme prince owusu a drunken dissolute eupatrid who had caused the flutter when ordered on board a manofwar for transportation to a place of safety relieved the gold coast from further trouble he was found hanging in the bush behind elmina castle most men supposed it to be a case of suicide a few of course surmised that he had been kidnapped and murdered by orders from kumasi  since that time to the present day our protectorate has been free from scare the affair as it happened did abundant good by banishing all fear for the safety of the wásá wassaw diggings during the worst times not a single english employé of the mines had left his post to take refuge in the axim fort this does them honour as some of the establishments lay within handy distance of the ferocious black barbarians  the native chiefs especially king blay proved themselves able and willing to aid us in whatever difficulties might occur the kingdom of gyáman further showed that it can hold its own against shorn ashanti or rather that it is becoming the more powerful of the two the utter failure of the scare is an earnest that under normal circumstances while king mensah a middleaged man occupies the stool we shall hear no more of threatened ashanti invasions  but the true way to pacify the despotism is to allow ashanti to make a beachin other words to establish a port this measure i have supported for the last score of years but to very little purpose the lines of objection are two the first is in the mercantile as all the world knows commercial interests are sure to be supported against almost any other in a reformed house of commons and in the long run they gain the day the coasttribes under our protection are mere brokers and gobetweens backed up and supported by the wholesale merchant because he prefers quieta non movere and he fears lest the change be from good to bad i on the other hand contend that both our commerce and customs would gain in quantity as well as in quality by direct dealings with the peoples of the interior the second or sentimental line belongs to certain newspapers and even their intelligence can hardly believe the ad captandum farrago which they indite the favourite bunkum is about baring the christian negros throat to the ashanti knife but the fantis and other coasttribes were originally as murderous and bloodthirsty in their battles and religious rites as their northern neighbours if there be any improvement it is wholly due to the presence and the pressure physical as well as moral of europeansof christians if you like even whydah is not bloodstained like agbóme because it has been occupied by a few slavers white and brown why then should the ashantis be refused the opportunity and the means of amendment ten years experience in africa teaches me that they would be as easily reformed as the maritime peoples and it is evident that the sentimentalist if he added honesty and common sense to the higher quality should be the first to advocate the trial  but i would not allow the ashantis to hold a harbour anywhere near elmina they should have their mile and beach east of the volta river where they would soon effect a lodgment despite all the opposition of their sanguinary friends and our ferocious enemies the awunah and the krepi crepee savages  i will end this paper with a short notice of the kingdom of gyáman generally written gaman and too often pronounced gammon its strength and vigour are clearly increasing it is one of the richest of goldfields and it lies directly upon the route to the interior of late years it has almost faded from the map but it is described at full length in the pages of barbot 1700 and bosman 1727 of bowdich 1818 and of dupuis 1824 they assign to it for limits mandengaland to the north and west to the south aowin and bassam and the tando or eastern fork of the assini to the east this tando which some moderns have represented as an independent stream divides it from ashantiland lying to the south and the southeast dupuis places the old capital bontuko whence the gyámans were formerly called bontukos eight stages northwest of kumasi and the new capital huraboh five marches beyond bontuko the country level and grassy begins the region north of the great forestzone which subtends the maritime mangrove swamps it breeds horses and can command moslem allies equestrian races feared by the ashantis  the gyámans according to their tradition migrated or rather were driven southwards from their northern homes this was also as i have said the case with the fantis and ashantis the latter occupied their present habitat about 1640 and at once became the foes of all their neighbours king osai tutu the great first of ashanti despotkings 1719 made gyáman tributary the conquest was completed by his brothersuccessor osai apoko 1731 who fined abo the neighbourking in large sums of gold and fixed an annual subsidy gyáman however rebelled against osai kwájo cudjoe the fourth of the dynasty 1752 and twice defeated him with prodigious slaughter the ashanti invader brought to his aid moslem cavalry and succeeded in again subjugating the insurgents the conquered took no action against the fifth king but they struck for independence under osai apoko ii 1797 aided by moslem and other allies they crossed the tando and fought so sturdily that the enemy liberally bestowed upon them the titles of warlike and courageous the ashantis at length compelled the moslems of their country to join them and ended by inflicting a crushing defeat upon the invaders  osai tutu kwámina on coming to the throne 1800 engaged in the campaign against gyáman called for distinction the first bontuko war he demanded from king adinkara his ancestral and royal stool which was thickly studded and embossed with precious metal the craven yielded it and purchased peace his brave sister presently replaced it by a seat of solid gold this the ashanti again requisitioned together with a large gold ornament in the shape of an elephant said to have been dug from some ruins the amazon replied with some detail and in the spade language that she and her brother should exchange sexes and that she would fight à loutrance whereupon the ashanti with many compliments about her bravery gave her twelve months to prepare for a campaign  in 1818 dupuis found ashanti engaged in the second bontuko war with adinkara who had again thrown off his allegiance but smallpox was raging in the capital and this campaign ended 181920 with the defeat and death of the womanly monarch with a massacre of 10000 prisoners and with the sale of 20000 captives thus gyáman was again annexed to ashantiland as a province instead of enjoying the rank of a tributary kingdom and the conquerors dominions extended from cape lahou w long 4º 36 through gyáman to the volta river e long 0º 42 18 a coastline of some 318 direct geographical miles  gyáman however seems to have had a passion for liberty she fought again and again to recover what she had lost in 1820 and on more occasions than one she was successful in battle during the ashanti scare the sturdy kingdom was preparing for serious hostilities and a little war of six or seven months had already been waged between the neighbours the late prince owusu before mentioned deposed before the authorities of our protectorate as follows at kumasi i was ordered to eat the skull of the late king of gyáman which was kept there as a trophy from the conquest of gyáman but i did not do it he also asserted that in 1879 a white man nielson and his interpreter huydecooper had been sent by an intriguer to gyáman bearing a pretended message from the british government and the fanti chiefs enjoining the king to conclude peace with the ashantis and to restore their 3700 captives neither of these men saw the ruler of gyáman and it is believed that nielson having begun a quarrel by firing upon the people was killed in the fray  at this moment gyáman is battling with her old enemies and threatens to be a dangerous rival if not a conqueror here then we may raise a strong barrier against future threats of ashanti invasion and make security more secure the political officers of the protectorate will be the best judges of the steps to be taken and if they are active and prudent we shall hear no more of the kumasi bugbear                                       §2 the labourquestion in western africa  in their present condition our african colonies are colonies only because they are administered by the colonial office  most of these stationsfor such they should be termedwere established for slaving purposes by the portuguese and were conquered by the dutch thence they passed into the hands of england who vigorously worked the black traite for the benefit of her west indian possessions  the colonies in question however saw their occupation gone with negro emancipation and they became mere tradingports and posts for collecting groundnuts palmoil and golddust philanthropy and freedom expected from them great things but instead of progressing they have gradually and surely declined the public calls them pesthouses and the government pronounces them a bore travellers propose to make them over to liberia or to any power that will accept such white elephants  remains now the task of placing upon the path of progress these wretched west african colonies and of making them a credit and a profit to england instead of a burden and an opprobrium  immigration i find is le mot de lénigme  between 1860 and 1865 i studied the labourquestion in west africa and my short visit in 1882 has convinced me that it is becoming a vital matter for our four unfortunate establishments bathurst sierra leone the gold coast and lagos  a score of years ago many agreed with me that there was only one solution for our difficulties a system of extensive coolieimportation but in those days of excited passions and divided interests when the export slavetrade and the émigration libre were still rampant on either coast it was by no means easy to secure a fair hearing from the public not a small nor an uninfluential section the philanthropic and the missionary raised and maintained the cuckoocry africa for the africansworthy of its successor ireland for the irish others believed in imported labour which has raised so many regions to the height of prosperity but they did not see how to import it and the general vis inertiæ peculiar to hepatic tropical settlements together with the unwillingness or rather the inability to undertake anything not absolutely necessary made many of the colonists look upon the proposal rather as a weariness to the flesh than a benefit a chosen few steadily looked forward to it but they contented themselves with a theoretical prospect and perhaps wisely did not attempt action  the condition of the coast however has radically changed during the last two decades the export slavetrade has died the death never to resurrect the immense benefits of immigration are known to all men theoretically and practically india and china have thrown open their labourmarkets and finally the difficulty of finding hands for agriculture especially in western africa has now come to a crisis  here i must be allowed a few words of preliminary explanation in this matter the reverse of europe africa whose social system is built upon slavery holds fieldwork and indeed all manual labour degrading to the free man the idea of a bold peasantry its countrys pride is utterly alien to nigritia the husband hunts fights and tradesthat is to say peddleshe leaves sowing and reaping to his wives and his chattels even a slave will rather buy him a slave than buy his own liberty i am free enough he says all i want is a fellow to serve me the natives of the dark continent are perfectly prepared to acknowledge that work is a curse and so far scripturally they deem      labour the symbol of mans punishment  no spaniard of the old school would despise more than a negro those newfangled notions glorifying work now familiar to stirring and bustling north europe nor will these people exert themselves until like the barbadians they must either sweat or starve example may do something to stir them but the mere preaching of industry is hopeless i repeat their beau idéal of life is to do nothing for six days in the week and to rest on the seventh they are quite prepared to keep after their fashion 365 sabbaths per annum  in the depths of central africa where a european shows a white face for the first time the wildest tribes hold markets once or twice a week these meetings on the hillside or the lakebank are crowded and the din and excitement are extreme armed men women and children may be seen dragging sheep and goats or sitting under a matshade through the livelong days before their baskets and bits of native homespun the whole stock in trade consisting perhaps of a few peppers a heap of palmnuts or strips of manioc like pipeclay this savage scene is reflected in the comparatively civilised stations all down the west african coast where the inexperienced and ardent philanthrope is apt to suppose that the lazy feckless habits are not natureimplanted but contracted by contact with a more advanced stage of society  again in many parts of africa the richest lands and those most favourably situated are either uninhabited or thinly peopled the result of intestine wars or of the export slavetrade mr administrator goulsbury of bathurst during his adventurous march from the gambia to the sierra leone river crossed league after league of luxuriant ground and found it all desert he says footnote blue book of 1882 quoted in chap x i think the fact has never been sufficiently recognised that africa and especially the west coast of the continent is but very sparsely populated it is not only very limited but is i believe if not stationary actually decreasing in numbers i commend this fact to the consideration of those who indulge in daydreams as to the almost unlimited increase of commerce which they fondly imagine is to be the result and reward of opening up the interior of the country  in regions richer than the upper gambia the disappearance of man is ever followed by a springing of bush and forest so portentous that a few hands are helpless and hopeless such is the case with the great wooded belt north of the gold coast where even the secondgrowth becomes impenetrable without the matchet and where the swamps and muds bred and fed by torrential rains bar the transit of travellers the whydah and gaboon countries are notable specimens of once populous regions now all but deserted  nothing more surprising to men who visit africa for the first time than the overwealth of labour in madeira and its penury on the western coast at bathurst they find ships loading or unloading by the work of the golah women whose lazy husbands live upon the hardlyearned wage they see the mailsteamers landing ton after ton of chinese rice shipped viâ england the whole country with its humid surface and its reeking damphot climate is a natural ricebed the little grain produced by it is far better than the imported but there are no hands to work the ground it is the same with salt which is cheaper when brought from england no man has the energy to lay out a salina and if he did its outlay under free trade would be greater than its income  steaming along the picturesque face of the sierra leone peninsula the stranger remarks with surprise that its most fertile ridges and slopes hardly show a field much less a farm and that agriculture is confined to raising a little gardenstuff for the townmarket the peasant the hand is at a discount the sierra leonite is a peddlerborn who aspires to be a trader a merchant or he looks to a learned profession especially the law the term gentlemanfarmer has no meaning for him of late years a forcing process has been tried and a few plantations have been laid out chiefly for the purpose it would appear of boasting and of vaunting the newgrown industry at home mr henry m stanley remarks footnote coomassie and magdala p 8 in almost every street in sierra leone i heard the voice of praise and local prayer from the numerous aspirants to clerkships and civil service employ but i am compelled to deny that i ever heard the sound of mallet and chisel of mortar pestle and trowel the ringing sound of hammer on anvil or roar of forge which to my practical mind would have had a far sweeter sound there is virgin land in the neighbourhood of sierra leone yet untilled there are buildings in the town yet unfinished there are roads for commerce yet to be made the trade of the african interior yet waits to be admitted into the capacious harbour of sierra leone for the enrichment of the fond nursingmother of races who sits dreamily teaching her children how to cackle instead of how to work  the same apathy to agriculture prevails in liberia for the last forty years large plantations have been laid out on the noble st paul river between cape mount and mount mesurado the coffeeshrub like the copaltree belts africa from east to westfrom harar where i saw it through karagué where it grows wild the bean not being larger than a pins head to manywema in the congo valley and to the west coast especially about the rio nunez north of sierra leone it is of the finest quality second only to the mocha but what hope is there of its development the váy tribe which holds the land is useless the rare new comers from america will work but the older settlers will not and there is hardly money enough to pay krumen  on the gold coast there is no exceptional scarcity of population under normal circumstances the labourmarket is sufficiently supplied but a strain soon exhausts it sir garnet wolseley found his greatest difficulty in the want of workmen he was obliged to apply for 500 british navvies and at one time he thought of converting the first and second west india regiments with woods and russells men into carriers on the other hand the conduct of the women was admirable as the conqueror said in the mansion house he hardly wondered at the king of dahome keeping up a corps of amazons i shall presently return to the goldmines  at lagos m colonna consular agent for france informs me that by his firm alone 600 hands are wanted for fieldservice and that the number might rise to a thousand he would also be glad to hire artisans blacksmiths and carpenters masons and marketgardeners the yorubas from the upper country who will engage for three years demand from a franc to a shilling per diem rations not given labour ranges from sixteen to twentyfour francs per mensem and coolies could not command more than twentyfive francs including subsistence here kruboys are much used m colonna pays his firstclass per mensem 5 each 5 francs 20 centimes his second class 4 and his third 3 returning to the gold coast i find two classes of working men the countrypeople and the kruboys the sierra leonites are too few to be taken into consideration at present when there are only five working mines none of which are properly manned labour is plentiful and cheap it will be otherwise when the number increases as it will soon do to fifty and a hundred upwards of seventy concessions have already been granted and i know one house which has or soon will have half a dozen ready for market then natives and kruboys will strike for increased wages till even diamondmines would not pay the gold coast contains rich placers in abundance if they fail it will be for want of hands or because the cost of labour will swallow up profits  the countrypeople fantis accramen apollonians of béin and others will work and are well acquainted with goldworking but they work in their own way and save under exceptional conditions they are incapable of regular and continuous labour it gives one the heartache to see their dawdling idling shuffling shiftless style of spoiling time they are now taking to tribute piece and contract work the french mines supply them with tools and powder and by way of pay and provisions allow them to keep twothirds of the produce it is evident that such an arrangement will be highly profitable to the hands who will pick the eyes out of the mine and who will secrete all the richest stuff leaving the poorest to their employers no amount of european surveillance will suffice to prevent free gold in stone being stolen hence the question will arise whether despite the price of transport reduction in england will not pay better  the kruboys in the north and the kabinda boys in the south have been described as the irishmen of west africa they certainly do the most work and tradingships would find it almost impossible to trade without them during the last twenty years they have not improved in efficiency even on board menofwar in 186165 the gangs with their headmen willingly engaged for three years now they enlist only for a year they carefully keep tallies and after the tenth monthly cut they begin to apply for leave thus the mens services are lost just as they are becoming valuable it is the same with the accramen when the mines learn the simple lesson lunion fait la force they will combine not to engage krumen for less than two years  there are two great centres at which kruboys are hired the first is sierra leone where they demand from all employers what the mailsteamers paythe headmen halfacrown and the hands a shilling a day besides rations the second is the kru coast in 1850 the boys received 5s per mensem in goods which reduced it to 3s they had also daily ricerations sunday beef and at times a dash of tobacco a cap a blanket or a waistcloth in 1860 the hire rose to 9s in kind or 4s 6d in coin about this time cruisers began to pay them the monthly wages of ordinary seamen 1l 10s with white mans rations or compensationmoney amounting to another 12l a year in 1882 headmen engage for the oil rivers at 1l and boys for 10s to 12s for the goldmines of wásá they have learned to demand 1s 3d per diem and at the cheapest 1l a month the headmen receiving double  the krumarket does not supply more than 4000 hands and yet it is already becoming tight in a few years demand will be excessive  footnote the usual estimate of the kruhands employed out of their own country is as follows for the oil rivers     150 each for brass and bonny new calabar and camarones     150200 for the niger and     150 for fernando po and the portuguese islands  12001500 at lagos                                                 1000 on board the 25 bristol ships at 20 each

          total 3861 say 4000  the following notes were given to me by the managers of mines whom i consulted upon the subject  mr crocker prefers fantis elminas and others and he can hire as many as he wants at cape coast castle alone there are some eighty hands now unemployed he pays 36s without rations per month of four weeks he has about a score of kruboys picked up on the beach these are fellows who have lost all their money and who dare not go home penniless their headman receives per mens 350 and in exceptional cases 4 the better class of boys get from 250 to 3 and lesser sums are given to the small boys whose principal work is stealing skulking  mr creswick has a high opinion of krumen working in the mines and has found sundry of them to develop into excellent mechanics the men want only good management under six europeans himself included he employs a hundred hands and from eight to ten mechanics the first headman draws 37s 6d the second 22s fullgrown labourers 18s and small boys from 4s to 6s and 9s  mechanics wages range between 1l 5s and 4l all have rations or subsistence which here means 3d a day  mr maclennan has a few fanti miners whom he pays at the rate of 6d per halfday his full muster of krumen is 120 the headmen receive 27s 6d rising after six months to 35s the first class of common boys get 20s the second from 13s 6d to 15s and the third mostly small boys between 5s and 10s his carpenters and blacksmiths who are gold coasters and sierra leonites draw from 2l 10s to 3l the rations are as usual 112 lb of rice per day with 1 lb of sunday beef whose brine is converted into salt  mr a bowden manager of the tákwá and abosu mines also employs a mixed multitude his sierra leone carpenters and blacksmiths draw 3l 10s to 4l 10s per month without rations and his native mechanics 3l to 3l 10s the fanti labourers are paid as usual a shilling per diem and find themselves the kruboys besides being lodged and fed 112 lb rice per day and 1 lb beef or fish per week draw in money as follows headman 2l second ditto 1l 7s to 1l 12s miners 18s to 20s and labourers 9s to 16s  this state of the labourmarket is i have said purely provisional it will not outlast the time when the present concessions are in full exploitation and this condition of things i hope soon to see we can then draw from the neighbouring countries from yoruba to the northeast and perhaps but this is doubtful from the baasás footnote a manly and powerful race who call themselves americans and will have nothing to do with the english and the drewins to the west but we must come sooner or later and the sooner the better to a regular coolieimmigration east african indian and chinese  the benefit of such an influx must not be measured merely by the additional work of a few thousand hands it will at once create jealousy competition rivalry it will teach by examplethe only way of teaching africansthat work is not ignoble but that it is ignoble to earn a shilling and to live idle on threepence a day till the pence are exhausted its advantages will presently be felt along the whole western coast and men will wonder why it was not thought of before the french as they are wont to do in these days have set us an example already in early 1882 the papers announced that a first cargo of 178 chineseprobably from cochinchinahad been landed at saintlouis de senegal for the proposed senegambian railway  the details of such an immigration and the measures which it will require do not belong to this place suffice it to say that we can draw freely upon the labourbanks of macáo bombay and zanzibar the intelligent thrifty and industrious chinese will learn mining here as they have learnt it elsewhere with the utmost readiness the east indian will be well adapted for lighter work of the garden and the mines finally the sturdy wásawahili of the east african coast will do as carriers and labourers three times the work of pantis and apollonians  i need hardly say that captain cameron and i would like nothing better than to organise a movement of this kind we would willingly do more good to the west african coast than the whole tribe of its socalled benefactors     §3 golddigging in northwestern africa  a sketch of its origin  the mineral wealth of central africa has still to be studied at present we are almost wholly ignorant of it we know however that the outlying portions of the continent contain three distinct and grand centres of miningindustry the first worked is the northeastern cornerin fact the nilevalley and its adjacencies where fayzoghlú still supplies the noble metal the second also dating from immense antiquity is the whole west african coast from morocco to the guinea gulf both included the third and last the southeastern goldfields have been discovered by the portuguese in comparatively modern days  in this paper i propose to treat only of the western field its exploitation began early enough to be noticed by herodotus the oldest of greek prosewriters he tells us lib iv 196 c that the carthaginians received gold from a black people whose caravans crossed the sahará or great desert and that they traded for it with the wild tribes of the west coast his words are as followsthere is a land in libya and a nation beyond the pillars of hercules the straits of gib which they the carthaginians are wont to visit where they no sooner arrive but forthwith they break cargo and having disposed their wares in an orderly way along the beach leave them and returning aboard their ships raise a great smoke  the natives when they see the smoke come down to the shore and laying out to view so much gold as they think the worth of the wares withdraw themselves afar the carthaginians upon this come ashore and look if they deem the gold sufficient they take it and wend their way but if it does not seem to them sufficient they go aboard once more and wait patiently then the others draw near and add to their

the southwest wangara ungura or unguru bordering on the niger and supposed to correspond with modern mandengaland in the lowlands after the annual floods the natives dug and washed the diluvial deposits for the precious metal exactly as is now done upon the gold coast and they burrowed into the highlands which surround in crescentform the headwaters of the great river joliba presently tinbukhtu succeeded according to leo africanus 1500 gháná as the converging point of the trade and made the name for wealth which endures even to the present day its princes and nobles lavishly

são jorje da mina by diego dazembuja sent out ad 1481 to superintend the construction but about 1622 the falling in of some unbraced and untimbered shafts and the deaths of many miners induced gweffa the king to put gold in fetish making it an accursed thing and it has not been worked since that time  thus portugal secured to herself the treasures which made her the wealthiest of european kingdoms but when she became a province of spain under d philip ii her eastern conquests were systematically neglected in favour of the castilian colonies that studded the new world the weak lusitanian garrisons were massacred on the gold coast as in other parts of africa and the hollanders the waterbeggars who had conquered their independence from spain proceeded to absorb the richest possessions of their quondam rivals elmina the capital fell into dutch hands 1637 and till 1868 holland retained her forts and factories on the gold coast  in their turn the english and the french who had heard of the fabulous treasures of the joliba valley and the tinbukhtu mart began to claim their share as early as 1551 captain thomas wyndham touched at the gold coast and brought home 150 lbs of the precious dust the first english company for exploring the gambia river sent out 1618 their agent richard thompson this brave and unfortunate explorer was rancorously opposed by the portuguese and eventually murdered by his own men he was followed 1620 by richard jobson to whom we owe the first account of the gambia river he landed at various points armed with mercury aqua regia nitric acid

states washed the sands and examined the rocks even beyond the falls of barraconda after having often been deceived as has occurred to many prospectors since his day he determined that gold never occurs in low fertile wooded lands but in naked and barren hills which embed it in their reddish ferruginous soil hence it was long and erroneously determined that bare rocks in the neighbourhood of shallow alluvia characterise rich placers and that the wealthiest miningregions are poor and stunted in vegetation california and australia the gold coast and south africa are instances of the contrary wásá however confirms the old opinion that the strata traversed by lodes determine the predominating metal as quartz produces gold hard blue slate lead limestone greenstone and porphyry

jobson succeeded in extracting 12 lbs from a single site he declares that at length he arrived at the mouth of the mine itself and found gold in such abundance as surprised him with joy and admiration unfortunately he leaves us no notice of its position it is probably lost like many of the old brazilian diggings the gambia river still exports small quantities of dust supposed to have been washed in the ghauts or seasubtending ridges of the interior most of it however finds its way to the wealthier and more prosperous french colony  whilst the english chose the gambia the french preferred senegal where they founded 1626 st louis called after louis xiv the sieur brue directorgeneral of the senegal company made a second journey of discovery in 1698 and reached with great difficulty the goldmines of desert and dreary bambúk there he visited the principal districts and secured specimens of what he calls the ghingan or golden earth he proposed a third incursion but the absolute apathy of his countrymen proved an insuperable obstacle  m golberry describes bambúk in gloomy and sombre colours its gold is distributed amongst low ranges of peeled and sterile hills probably this results from fires and disforesting it occurs in the shape of spangles grains and pépites nuggets whose size increases with the depth of the digging in the matakon mine the dust adhered to fragments of iron emery and lapis lazuli from which it was easily detached and washed the less valuable semayla placer produced dust in a hard reddish loam mixed with still more refractory materials it was crushed in mortars with rude wooden dollies or with grainpestles the pits six feet in diameter reached a depth of from ten to twelve yards where they were stopped by a bed of hard reddish marle this the frenchman held to be the hanging wall of a much richer lode the people used ladders but they neglected to collar or brace the mouth and the untimbered pitsides often fell in hence fatal accidents attributed to the earthspirits they held gold to be a capricious elf and when a rich vein suddenly ran barren they cried out there he is off  in later days mungo park drew attention by his famous first journey 179597 to the highlands of the mandingoes mandengaland and revived interest in the provinces of shronda konkodu dindiko bambúk and bambarra here the natives collect dust by laborious washings of detrital

mineral discoveries of california and australia it continued to be the principal source of supply to the civilised world  the older writers give us ample details about golddigging and trading two centuries ago bosnian letter vi shows that the people prospected for the illustrious metal in three forms of ground the first was in or between particular hills where they sank pits the second was about the rivers and waterfalls and the third was on the seashore near the mouths of rivulets after violent nightrains he ends his letter with these sensible words i would refer to any intelligent metallist whether a vast deal of ore must not of necessity be lost here from which a great deal of gold might be separated from want of skill in the metallic art and not only so but i firmly believe that vast quantities of pure gold are left behind for the negroes only ignorantly dig at random without the least knowledge of the veins of the mine footnote the origin of these mineral veins is still disputed science being as yet too young for the task of solving the mystery probably as mr davies remarks the mode of the origin and means of the deposition are not one only but many and we have the huttonian igneous and wernerian aqueous theories the sublimation of necker the electricity of mr r w fox the infiltration and gravitation of fluid metals towards cracks vughs cavities and shrinkages and the law of replacement if a steel plate be removed atom by atom says mr r brough smyth gold fields of victoria melbourne 1869 and each atom be replaced by a corresponding atom of silvera fact established by direct experimentit will be readily seen that a mineral vein may be formed in the same way and i doubt not that if the land belonged to europeans they would soon find it to produce much richer treasures than the negroes obtain from it but it is not probable that we shall ever possess that liberty here wherefore we must be content with being so far masters of it as we are at present

staggered forwards others described the movement as rising and falling like the waters of a lagoon i looked with apprehension at the sea but the direction of the shock was apparently from westnorthwest and the line was too oblique to produce one of those awful earthquakewaves seventy feet high which have swept tall ships over the roofs of cities we ran as fast as we could to the town

and by the coalescence of grains as a snowball is constructed mr sellwyn still holds that nuggets and particles of alluvial gold may gradually increase by the deposition of metallic gold analogous to the electroplating process from the meteoric waters that circulate through the driftsgold fields of victoria p 357 i have noted that a smoke or thin vapour guides to the unknown placer and that white

gold coast if so rich has not been worked before this time these notes will afford a sufficient reply  b the kong mountains  this range which has almost disappeared from the maps may have taken its name either from the town of kong on the southern versant or it may be a contraction of the kongkodu the mountainland described by mungo park messieurs j zweifel and m moustier footnote expédition c a verminck voyage aux sources du niger marseille 1880 who did not reach the niger sources in 1879 explain kong as the kissi name of the line which trends from northwest to southeast and which divides koronkoland from konoland when nearing their objective they sighted the kongapex mount daro measuring 1240 mètres older travellers make it a latitudinal chain running nearly eastwest with its centre about the meridian of cape coast castle and extending 500 to 600 miles on a parallel of north latitude 7º8º westward it bends north behind cape palmas and like the ghauts of hindostan follows the line of seaboard i have before noticed the traditions of mount geddia an occidental kilimanjáro about the parallel of sierra leone the feature splits into a network of ranges curves and zigzags which show no general trend the eastern faces here shed to the niger the western to the various streams between the rokelseli the gambia and the senegal and the last northern counterforts sink into the sahará desert the western versant supplies the gold of senegambia the southern that of ashanti and wásá the superficial dust is washed down by rains floods and rivers and the dykes and veins of quartz mostly running northsouth are apparently connected with those of the main range  that such a chain must exist is proved by the conduct of the gold coast streams the ancobra for instance which often rises and falls from twenty to forty feet in twentyfour hours suggests that its sources spring from an elevated plane at no great distance from the sea the lands south of the kong mountains are grassy and hilly with extensive plains this is known through the donko slaves common on the coast many of them come from about salagha the newlyopened mart upon the upper volta they declare that the land breeds ostriches and elephants cattle and camels horses and asses moreover it is visited by the northern peoples who cross the sahará i have already noticed the grasslands of gyáman  captain clapperton on his second journey setting out from badagry to busa boussa crossed a hillrange which would correspond with the kong it is described as about eighty miles broad and is said to extend from behind ashanti to benin the traveller who estimated the culminating point not to exceed 2600 feet found the rugged passes hemmed in by denticulated walls and tons of granite 600 to 700 feet high and sometimes overhanging the path the valleys varied in breadth from a hundred yards to half a mile a comparatively large population occupied the mountainrecesses where they planted fine crops of yams millet and cotton the strangers were made welcome at every settlement ascending hill after hill they came to chaki a large town on the very summit of the ridge the caboceer had a house and a stock of provisions ready for his guests put many questions and earnestly pressed them to rest for two or three days when the whole chain was crossed they fell into the plains of yaruba yoruba  the next eyewitness is mr john duncan who visited dahome in 1845 king gezo allowed him a guard of a hundred men in order to explore with safety the mahi or kong mountains his son and successor was not so generous he systematically and churlishly refused all travellers myself included permission to pass northwards of his capital the lifeguardsman found the chain which is distant more than a hundred miles from agbóme differing from his expectations in character appearance and even position the grand imposing line looked from afar like colossal piles of ruins a nearer view showed immense blocks some of them 200 feet long eggshaped and lying upon their sides nearly all the settlements had chosen the summits doubtless for defence mr duncan crossed the whole breadth of these kong mountains and pushed 180 miles beyond them over a level land which must shed to the niger  these descriptions denote a range of granite the rock which forms the groundfloor of the sierra leone peninsula and the gold coast possibly varied by syenites and porphyries it would probably contain like the seasubtending mountains of midian large veins of eminently metalliferous quartz outcropping from the surface and forming extensions of the reefs below from the coastline the land gradually upslopes towards the spurs of the great dividing ridge and thus we may fairly expect that the further north we go the richer will become the diggings  the kong mountains are apparently cut through by the niger south of iddah where the true coast begins travellers describe the features almost in the words of clapperton and denhamthe towering masses of granite which contrast so strongly with the southern swamps upstanding outcrops resembling cathedrals and castellations in ruins boulders like footballs of enormous dimensions pyramids a thousand feet high and solitary cones which rise like giant ninepins we know too little of the lands lying southeast of the confluence to determine the sequence of the

this is a fair evidence of that instinctive faculty which produces a general resemblance of rude stoneimplements from england to australia there are six methods for getting the precious metalsurfacing or washing shallowsinking sluicing or removing the earth through natural and artificial channels deep sinking tunnelling and quartzmining  the preceding notes show that the natives of the gold coast and of west africa generally are adepts at procuring their gold by surfacing washing with the calabash or wooden bowl the rich alluvial formations that underlie the topsoil this is the rudest form of machinery preceding in california the cradle the torn and the sluice westerns made their pans of brass or copper about sixteen inches in diameter and nearly two inches deep in the middle where the gold gravitates panning in africa is womens work and the process has been described in the preceding pages  but the natives as has been shown can also work quartz an art well known to the ancient egyptians they either pick up detached pieces showing visible gold or they sink pits and nibble at the walls of the reefs but whereas the nilepeoples pounded the stone in mortars and washed the dust on sloping boards here the matrix must be laboriously levigated a handful of broken quartz is placed upon the cankeystone with which the gudewife grinds her mealies it is a slightly hollowed slab of granite or hard conglomerate some two feet square sloping away from the worker and standing upon a rude tripod of treebranches secured by a lashing of tietie the stuff is then rubbed with a handstone not unlike a bakers roll and a slight deviation is given to it as it moves fore and aft the reduced stone is caught in a calabash placed at the lower end of the slab this is usually nightwork and all the dark hours will be wasted in grinding down a cubic foot of stone  the late m bonnat had probably read mr andrew swanzys evidence before the house of commons in 1816 gold is procured in every part of the country it appears more like an impregnation of the soil than a mine his long captivity at kumasi where to a certain extent he learned the oji speech familiarised him with the native processes and thus a frenchman taught englishmen to work gold in a golden land where they have been domiciledtrue fainéantsfor nearly three centuries he came out in the dries of 1877 with the intention of dredging the ancobra river where the natives dive for the precious metal he was working in western apinto a province of wásá under kofi blay a vassal of king kwábina angu when he was visited january 1878 by majorgeneral wray ba colonel lightfoot and mr hervey who were curious to see the work they remained only till the return of the mailsteamer or about five weeks the general left with some firstrate sketches the colonel caught a fever which killed him at madeira and the esquire who bears a name well known in australia returned to the gold coast for the purpose of writing not unprofitable reports m bonnat was presently informed of the tákwá ridge mines well known for a century at least to cape coast castle and ever the principal source of the axim currency they were still worked in 1875 by the people who drew their stores from axim a fiveweeks residence convinced him that they were rich enough to attract capital he went to europe and was successful in raising it thus began the tákwá mines where by a kind of irony of fate the beginner was buried  m bonnat wisely intended to open operations with wetworking at axim i was shown a model flume made to order after the plans of a m boisonnet or as he signs himself boisonnet he was reported to be a large landedproprietor who had made a fortune by mining in french guiana he proposed for m bonnat and himself to secure the monopoly of washing the protectorate with this flumea veritable french toy uselessly complicated and yet to be used only upon the smallest scale we must go for our models to california and australia not to french guiana  the following will be the implements with which the natives of the future must do their work on the gold coast  the pan begat the cradle a wooden box on rockers shaped like the article which gave its name it measures three feet and a half by eighteen inches and is provided with a movable hopper and slides placed in a sloping position it is worked to and fro by a perpendicular staff acting as handle and the graingold a metal seven times heavier than granite collects where the baby should be as some flourgold is here found the cradlebottom should be cut with crossgrooves to hold mercury and the latter must be tempered with sodium or other amalgam  the cradle begat long tom and broad tom the tom proper being the upper box with a grating to keep out the pebbles long toms body is a wooden trough from twelve to fourteen feet long by a foot or a foot and a half broad with ripples riffles or crossbars there is usually another grating at the lower end to intercept the smaller stones the machine is fixed in a gently sloping position at an angle determined by circumstances the washdirt is lifted into the upper end by manual labour when stiff it must be stirred or shovelled and a stream of water does the rest the greater gravity of the gold causes it to be arrested by the riffles instead of the bars grooves may be cut and filled with quicksilver when the sludge is very rich rough cloths rubbed with mercury or even sheepskins the lineal descendants of the golden fleece may be used broad tom alias the victoria jenny lind is made about half the length of its long brother the upper end is only a foot wide broadening out to three below  tom begat the sluice which is of two kinds natural and artificial the former is a ditch cut in the floor with a talus of one to forty or fifty the bottom which would soon wear away is revetted with rough planks and paved with hard stones weighing ten to twenty pounds the grain being placed vertically with a full head of water 400 cubic yards a day can easily be washed the gold as usual gravitates through the chinks to the bottom and finally is cradled or panned out it is most efficiently treated when the sluice is long it demands six times more water than the artificial article but it wants less manual labour this last property should recommend it to the gold coast here i repeat machinery must be used as much and manual labour as little as possible  the artificial or portable boxsluice is a series of troughs each about twelve feet long like the upper compartment of long tom they are made of halfinch boards rough from the saw the lower end being smaller to fit into its prolongation each compartment is provided with a loose metal bottom pierced with holes to admit the dust the true bottom below it has crossriffles and above it are bars or gratings to catch the coarser stones these sluices are mounted on trestles and the latter are disposed upon a slope determined by the quantity of water the average fall or grade may be 1 to 50 in australia four men filling a long tom or raised boxsluice will remove and wash twentyfour cubic yards of ground per day when the ore is fine mercury may be dropped into the upper end of the sluice and it picks up the particles tailing as it goes before the two metals have run far down both stop at the first riffle or restingplace  the auriferous clays of the gold coast are thinly covered with humus and are not buried as in australia by ten to thirty feet of unproductive topdrift the whole therefore can be run through the sluices before we begin mining the underlying strata washing will be easier during the rains when the dirt is looser in the dries hard and compact stuff must be loosened by the pick and spade or by blasting there will not be much loss by floatgold flourgold or paintgold the latter thus called because it is so fine as to resemble gilding spangles and specks are found but the greater part of the dust is granular increasing to shotty gold the natives divide the noble ore into dustgold and mountaingold the latter would consist of nuggets lobs or pépites and of crystals varying in size from a pins head to a pea the form is a cube modified to an octahedron and a rhombic dodecahedron these rich finds are usually the produce of pockets or jewellers shops i am not aware if there be any truth in the rule generally accepted the forms of gold are found to differ according to the nature of the underlying rock if it is slate the grains are cubical if granite they are flat plates and scales  and lastly the sluice begat the jet or hydraulicking proper which is at present the highest effort of placermining we thus reverse the primitive process which carried the washdirt to the water we now carry the water to the washdirt in california i found the miners washing down loose sandstones and hillocks of clay passing the stuff through sluices and making money when the gold averaged only 9d and even 4d to the ton a man could work under favourable circumstances twenty to thirty tons a day an australian company mentioned by mr r brough smyth with 200 inches of water directed by ten hands hydraulicked in six days 224000 cubic feet of dirt the results greatly vary in some places a man will remove 200 cubic yards a day and in others only 50  hydraulic mining on the gold coast owing to the conformation of the country will be a far simpler and less expensive process than in california or australia in the latter water has first to be bought and then to be brought in pipes flumes leats or races from a considerable distance sometimes extending over forty miles it is necessary to make a reservoir for a fall the water then rushes through the flexible hose and is directed by a nozzle against the face of the excavation the action is that of a fireman playing upon a burning house most works on mining insist upon those reservoirs and never seem to think of washing from below by the forcepump  i have shown that the surface of the lands adjoining the ancobra is a series of hummocks rises and falls sometimes though rarely reaching 200 feet that water abounds and that it is to be had gratis in every bottom there is a drain sometimes perennial but more often a blind gully or creek footnote the gully feeds a creek the creek a river which runs only during the rains and in the dries carries at most a succession of pools here nortons abyssinian tubes sunk in the bed after it has been carefully worked by the steamnavvy for the rich alluvium underlying the surface would act like pumps and dams would form huge tanks nor would there be any difficulty in making reservoirs upon the ridgetops with launders or gutters to collect the rain thus work would continue throughout the year and not be confined as at present to the dry season a pressure of 100 to 200 lbs per square foot can easily be obtained and the force of the jet is so great that it will kill a man on the spot the hose should be of heavy duck double if necessary rivetted and strengthened by metal bands or ringsin fact the crinolinehose of australia leather would be better but hard to repair in case of accidents by rats guttapercha would be expensive and perhaps thin metal tubes with flexible joints may serve best the largest hose carried by ironclads measures 19 to 20 inches in diameter and is worked by 30 to 40 horsepower other vessels have a 15inch hose worked by manual labour fifty men changed every ten minutes and will throw the jet over the royal yards of a firstclass manofwar the floating powerengines attached to the dockyard reserves would represent the articles required  with a diameter of from ten to fifteen inches and a nozzle of three to four inches a crinolinehose will throw a stream a hundred feet high when worked by the simplest steampower process and tear down a hill more rapidly than a thousand men with shovels the cost of washing gravel sand and clay did not exceed in our colonies 1d to 2d per ton and thus the working expenses were so small that 4d worth of gold to the ton of soft stuff paid a fair profit lastly there is little danger to the miner and this is an important consideration  it is well known that california was prepared for agriculture and viticulture by hydraulicking and other mining operations it will be the same with the gold coast whose present condition is that of the lincolnshire fens and the batavian swamps in the days of the romans let us only have a little patience and with patience perseverance which dear my lord keeps honour bright the waterjet will soon clear away the bush washing down the tallest trees it will level the ground and will warp up the swamp till the surface assumes regular raised lines we run no risk of covering the face of earth with unproductive clay here the ground is wanted only as a base for vegetation sun and rain do all the rest and thus we may hope that these luxuriant wastes will be turned into fields of bustling activity and will tell the tale of cameron and me to a late posterity  but gold is not the only metal yielded by the gold coast i have already alluded in the preceding pages to sundry silverlodes said to have been worked by the old hollanders as is well known there is no african gold without silver and this fact renders the legend credible even in these dullest of dull days 63337l worth was the export of 1880 iron is everywhere the land is stained red with its oxide and manganese with cobalt has been observed i have mentioned that at akankon my companion showed me a large vein of cinnabar copper occurs in small quantities with tin this metal is found in large veins streaking the granite according to m dahse who gave me a fine specimen containing some ten and a half per cent of metal he has found as much as twelve per cent when at home 2 to 212 per cent pays footnote the present percentage of blocktin derived from all the tinore  of cornwall is estimated at 2 per cent or nearly 45 lbs to the ton of oredavies p 391 the aspect of the land is diamantiferous footnote i hear with the greatest pleasure that a syndicate has been formed for working the diamonddiggings of golconda a measure advocated by me for many years suffice to say here that the hindús rarely went below 60 feet because they could not unwater the mine and that the brazilian finds his precious stones 280 feet below the surface moreover the indian is the only true diamond the brazilian is a good and the cape a bad natural imitation and it has been noticed that a crystal believed to be a diamond has been found in auriferous gravel in these granitic gneissose and quartzose formations topazes amethysts and sapphires garnets and rubies will probably occur as in the similar rocks of the great brazilian mininggrounds the seedpearl of the coastoyster may be developed into a tolerable likeness of the farfamed pearshaped margarita of arabian katifah which was bought by tavernier for the sum then enormous of 110000l  pearlculture is an art now known even to the wild arab fisherman of the far midian shore lastly the humble petroleum precious as silver to the minerworld has been found in the
