14392311	twice told tales                            sunday at home                        by nathaniel hawthorne    every sabbath morning in the summer time i thrust back the curtain to watch the sunrise stealing down a steeple which stands opposite my chamberwindow  first the weathercock begins to flash then a fainter lustre gives the spire an airy aspect next it encroaches on the tower and causes the index of the dial to glisten like gold as it points to the gilded figure of the hour  now the loftiest window gleams and now the lower  the carved framework of the portal is marked strongly out at length the morning glory in its descent from heaven comes down the stone steps one by one and there stands the steeple glowing with fresh radiance while the shades of twilight still hide themselves among the nooks of the adjacent buildings  methinks though the same sun brightens it every fair morning yet the steeple has a peculiar robe of brightness for the sabbath  by dwelling near a church a person soon contracts an attachment for the edifice  we naturally personify it and conceive its massive walls and its dim emptiness to be instinct with a calm and meditative and somewhat melancholy spirit  but the steeple stands foremost in our thoughts as well as locally  it impresses us as a giant with a mind comprehensive and discriminating enough to care for the great and small concerns of all the town  hourly while it speaks a moral to the few that think it reminds thousands of busy individuals of their separate and most secret affairs  it is the steeple too that flings abroad the hurried and irregular accents of general alarm neither have gladness and festivity found a better utterance than by its tongue and when the dead are slowly passing to their home the steeple has a melancholy voice to bid them welcome  yet in spite of this connection with human interests what a moral loneliness on weekdays broods round about its stately height  it has no kindred with the houses above which it towers it looks down into the narrow thoroughfare the lonelier because the crowd are elbowing their passage at its base  a glance at the body of the church deepens this impression  within by the light of distant windows amid refracted shadows we discern the vacant pews and empty galleries the silent organ the voiceless pulpit and the clock which tells to solitude how time is passing  timewhere man lives notwhat is it but eternity  and in the church we might suppose are garnered up throughout the week all thoughts and feelings that have reference to eternity until the holy day comes round again to let them forth  might not then its more appropriate site be in the outskirts of the town with space for old trees to wave around it and throw their solemn shadows over a quiet green  we will say more of this hereafter  but on the sabbath i watch the earliest sunshine and fancy that a holier brightness marks the day when there shall be no buzz of voices on the exchange nor traffic in the shops nor crowd nor business anywhere but at church  many have fancied so  for my own part whether i see it scattered down among tangled woods or beaming broad across the fields or hemmed in between brick buildings or tracing out the figure of the casement on my chamberfloor still i recognize the sabbath sunshine and ever let me recognize it  some illusions and this among them are the shadows of great truths  doubts may flit around me or seem to close their evil wings and settle down but so long as i imagine that the earth is hallowed and the light of heaven retains its sanctity on the sabbathwhile that blessed sunshine lives within menever can my soul have lost the instinct of its faith  if it have gone astray it will return again  i love to spend such pleasant sabbaths from morning till night behind the curtain of my open window  are they spent amiss  every spot so near the church as to be visited by the circling shadow of the steeple should be deemed consecrated ground today  with stronger truth be it said that a devout heart may consecrate a den of thieves as an evil one may convert a temple to the same  my heart perhaps has not such holy nor i would fain trust such impious potency  it must suffice that though my form be absent my inner man goes constantly to church while many whose bodily presence fills the accustomed seats have left their souls at home  but i am there even before my friend the sexton  at length he comesa man of kindly but sombre aspect in dark gray clothes and hair of the same mixturehe comes and applies his key to the wide portal  now my thoughts may go in among the dusty pews or ascend the pulpit without sacrilege but soon come forth again to enjoy the music of the bell  how glad yet solemn too  all the steeples in town are talking together aloft in the sunny air and rejoicing among themselves while their spires point heavenward  meantime here are the children assembling to the sabbath school which is kept somewhere within the church  often while looking at the arched portal i have been gladdened by the sight of a score of these little girls and boys in pink blue yellow and crimson frocks bursting suddenly forth into the sunshine like a swarm of gay butterflies that had been shut up in the solemn gloom  or i might compare them to cherubs haunting that holy place  about a quarter of an hour before the second ringing of the bell individuals of the congregation begin to appear  the earliest is invariably an old woman in black whose bent frame and rounded shoulders are evidently laden with some heavy affliction which she is eager to rest upon the altar  would that the sabbath came twice as often for the sake of that sorrowful old soul  there is an elderly man also who arrives in good season and leans against the corner of the tower just within the line of its shadow looking downward with a darksome brow  i sometimes fancy that the old woman is the happier of the two  after these others drop in singly and by twos and threes either disappearing through the doorway or taking their stand in its vicinity  at last and always with an unexpected sensation the bell turns in the steeple overhead and throws out an irregular clangor jarring the tower to its foundation  as if there were magic in the sound the sidewalks of the street both up and down along are immediately thronged with two long lines of people all converging hitherward and streaming into the church  perhaps the faroff roar of a coach draws nearera deeper thunder by its contrast with the surrounding stillnessuntil it sets down the wealthy worshippers at the portal among their humblest brethren  beyond that entrance in theory at least there are no distinctions of earthly rank nor indeed by the goodly apparel which is flaunting in the sun would there seem to be such on the hither side those pretty girls  why will they disturb my pious meditations  of all days in the week they should strive to look least fascinating on the sabbath instead of heightening their mortal loveliness as if to rival the blessed angels and keep our thoughts from heaven  were i the minister himself i must needs look  one girl is white muslin from the waist upwards and black silk downwards to her slippers a second blushes from topknot to shoetie one universal scarlet another shines of a pervading yellow as if she had made a garment of the sunshine  the greater part however have adopted a milder cheerfulness of hue  their veils especially when the wind raises them give a lightness to the general effect and make them appear like airy phantoms as they flit up the steps and vanish into the sombre doorway  nearly allthough it is very strange that i should know itwear white stockings white as snow and neat slippers laced crosswise with black ribbon pretty high above the ankles  a white stocking is infinitely more effective than a black one  here comes the clergyman slow and solemn in severe simplicity needing no black silk gown to denote his office  his aspect claims my reverence but cannot win my love  were i to picture saint peter keeping fast the gate of heaven and frowning more stern than pitiful on the wretched applicants that face should be my study  by middle age or sooner the creed has generally wrought upon the heart or been atempered by it  as the minister passes into the church the bell holds its iron tongue and all the low murmur of the congregation dies away the gray sexton looks up and down the street and then at my windowcurtain where through the small peephole i half fancy that he has caught my  eye  now every loiterer has gone in and the street lies asleep in the quiet sun while a feeling of loneliness comes over me and brings also an uneasy sense of neglected privileges and duties o i ought to have gone  to church  the hustle of the rising congregation reaches  my ears  they are standing up to pray  could i bring my heart into unison with those who are praying in yonder church and lift it heavenward with a fervor of supplication but no distinct request would not that be the safest kind of prayer  lord look down upon me in mercy  with that sentiment gushing from my soul might i not leave all the rest to him  hark  the hymn  this at least is a portion of the service which i can enjoy better than if i sat within the walls where the full choir and the massive melody of the organ would fall with a weight upon me at this distance it thrills through my frame and plays upon my heartstrings with a pleasure both of the sense and spirit  heaven be praised i know nothing of music as a science and the most elaborate harmonies if they please me please as simply as a nurses lullaby the strain has ceased but prolongs itself in my mind with fanciful echoes till i start from my revery and find that the sermon has commenced  it is my misfortune seldom to fructify in a regular way by any but printed sermons  the first strong idea which the preacher utters gives birth to a train of thought and leads me onward step by step quite out of hearing of the good mans voice unless he be indeed a son of thunder  at my open window catching now and then a sentence of the parsons saw i am as well situated as at the foot of the pulpit stairs  the broken and scattered fragments of this one discourse will be the texts of many sermons preached by those  colleague pastorscolleagues but often disputantsmy mind and heart  the former pretends to be a  scholar and perplexes me with doctrinal points the latter takes me on the score of feeling and both like several other preachers spend their strength to very little purpose i their sole auditor cannot always understand them  suppose that a few hours have passed and behold me still behind my curtain just before the close of the afternoon service  the hourhand on the dial has passed beyond four oclock  the declining sun is hidden behind the steeple and throws its shadow straight across the street so that my chamber is darkened as with a cloud  around the churchdoor all is solitude and an impenetrable obscurity beyond the threshold  a commotion is heard  the seats are slammed down and the pewdoors thrown backa multitude of feet are trampling along the unseen aislesand the congregation bursts suddenly through the portal  foremost scampers a rabble of boys behind whom moves a dense and dark phalanx of grown men and lastly a crowd of females with young children and a few scattered husbands  this instantaneous outbreak of life into loneliness is one of the pleasantest scenes of the day  some of the good people are rubbing their eyes thereby intimating that they have been wrapped as it were in a sort of holy trance by the fervor of their devotion  there is a young man a thirdrate coxcomb whose first care is always to flourish a white handkerchief and brush the seat of a tight pair of black silk pantaloons which shine as if varnished  they must have been made of the stuff called everlasting or perhaps of the same piece as christians garments in the pilgrims progress for he put them on two summers ago and has not yet worn the gloss off  i have taken a great liking to those black silk pantaloons  but now with nods and greetings among friends each matron takes her husbands arm and paces gravely homeward while the girls also flutter away after arranging sunset walks with their favored bachelors  the sabbath eve is the eve of love  at length the whole congregation is dispersed  no here with faces as glossy as black satin come two sable ladies and a sable gentleman and close in their rear the minister who softens his severe visage and bestows a kind word on each  poor souls  to them the most captivating picture of bliss in heaven isthere we shall be white  all is solitude again  but harka broken warbling of voices and now attuning its grandeur to their sweetness a stately peal of the organ who are the choristers  let me dream that the angels who came down from heaven this blessed morn to blend themselves with the worship of the truly good are playing and singing their farewell to the earth  on the wings of that rich melody they were borne upward  this gentle reader is merely a flight of poetry  a few of the singing men and singing women had lingered behind their fellows and raised their voices fitfully and blew a careless note upon the organ  yet it lifted my soul higher than all their former strains  they are gone the sons and daughters of musicand the gray sexton is just closing the portal  for six days more there will be no face of man in the pews and aisles and galleries nor a voice in the pulpit nor music in the choir  was it worth while to rear this massive edifice to be a desert in the heart of the town and populous only for a few hours of each seventh day  o but the church is a symbol of religion  may its site which was consecrated on the day when the first tree was felled be kept holy forever a spot of solitude and peace amid the trouble and vanity of our weekday world there is a moral and a religion too even in the silent walls  and may the steeple still point heavenward and be decked with the hallowed sunshine of the sabbath morn
