minutes husband and wife stood together    preface   in the worlds history there is no more striking example of heroic bravery and firmness than that afforded by the people of the province of poitou and more especially of that portion of it known as la vendee in the defence of their religion and their rights as free men at the commencement of the struggle they were almost unarmed and the subsequent battles were fought by the aid of muskets and cannon wrested from the enemy with the exception of its forests la vendee offered no natural advantages for defence it had no mountains such as those which enabled the swiss to maintain their independence no rivers which would bar the advance of an enemy and although the woods and thickets of the bocage as it was called favoured the action of the irregular troops these do not seem to have been utilized as they might have been the principal engagements of the war being fought on open ground for eighteen months the peasants of la vendee in spite of the fact that they had no idea of submitting either to drill or discipline repulsed the efforts of forces commanded by the best generals france could furnish and which grew after every defeat until at length armies numbering in all over two hundred thousand men were collected to crush la vendee  the losses on both sides were enormous la vendee was almost depopulated and the republicans paid dearly indeed for their triumph no fewer than one hundred thousand men having fallen on their side la vendee was crushed but never surrendered had the british government been properly informed by its agents of the desperate nature of the struggle that was going on they might by throwing twenty thousand troops with supplies of stores and money into la vendee have changed the whole course of events have crushed the republic given france a monarch and thus spared europe over twenty years of devastating warfare the expenditure of enormous sums of money and the loss of millions of lives  g a henty    chapter 1 a french lugger   some half a mile back from the sea near the point where the low line of sandy hill is broken by the entrance into poole harbour stood in 1791 netherstock which with a small estate around was the property of squire stansfield the view was an extensive one when the weather was clear away to the left lay the pine forests of bournemouth and christ church and still farther seaward the cliffs of the isle of wight from totland bay as far as saint catherine point close at hand to the south was studland bay bounded by handfast point looking towards the right was a great sheet of shallow water for the most part dry at low tide known as poole and wareham harbours with its numerous creeks and bays  netherstock was an old house with many nooks and corners the squire was a justice of the peace but unless there was some special business on he seldom took his place on the bench he was a jovial man who took life easily he was popular among his neighbours especially among the poorer classes for whom he had always a pleasant word as he rode along and who in case of illness knew that they could always be sure of a supply of soup or a gill of brandy at netherstock  among those of his own class it was often a matter of wonder how james stansfield made both ends meet the family had for two or three generations been of a similar temperament to that of the present holder men who spent their money freely and were sure to be present whenever there was a horse race or a main of cocks to be fought or a prizefight to come off within a days ride of netherstock gradually farm after farm had been parted with and the estate now was smaller by half than it had been at the beginning of the century  james stansfield had however done nothing further to diminish it he had a large family but they could hardly be said to be an expensive one seeing that little was spent upon the fashion of their clothes and beyond the fact that the curate in charge of the little church in the village of netherstock came over every morning for two or three hours to give the boys and girls the elements of education they went very much their own way mrs stansfield had died five years before this polly the eldest girl aged twenty acted as mistress of the house next to her at intervals of little more than a year came ralph and john two strongly built young fellows both fearless riders and good at all rustic games what supervision the farm work got was given by them  patsey the second girl was generally admitted to be the flower of the stansfields she was bright pretty and good tempered she was in charge of the dairy and the netherstock butter was famous through the country round and always fetched top prices at the market the youngest of the family was leigh who was now fourteen he was less heavily built than his brothers but their tutor declared that he was the quickest and most intelligent of his pupils and that if he had but a chance he would turn out a fine young fellow  the boys were all fond of boating and sailing which was natural enough as the sea washed two sides of the estate they had two boats one of these lay hauled up on the sands a mile to the east of the entrance to the harbour she was a good sea boat and when work was slack about the place which indeed was the normal state of things they would often sail to weymouth to the west or eastward to yarmouth or lymington sometimes even to portsmouth the other boat which was also large but of very shallow draught of water lay inside the entrance to the harbour and in her they could go either north or south of brownsea island and shoot or fish in the many inlets and bays there were few who knew every foot of the great sheet of water as they did and they could tell the precise time of the tide at which the channels were deep enough for boats drawing from two to three feet of water  the most frequent visitor to netherstock was lieutenant or as he was called in courtesy captain whittier the officer in command of the coast guard station between poole and christ church his principal station being opposite brownsea island the narrowest point of the entrance to the harbour he was a somewhat fussy little officer with a great idea of the importance of his duties mingled with a regret that these duties did not afford him full scope for proving his ability  smuggling has almost ceased to exist along here he would say i do not say that across the harbour something that way may not still be done for the facilities there are very much greater than they are on this side still my colleague there can have but little trouble for i keep a sharp lookout that no boat enters by the passage south of the island without being searched of course one hears all sorts of absurd reports about cargoes being run but we know better and i believe they are only set on foot to put our officers from swanage westward and beyond christ church down to hurst castle off their guard  no doubt captain no doubt james stansfield would agree still i fancy that although times are not what they were it is still possible to buy a keg of brandy occasionally or a few yards of silk or lace that have never paid duty  yes no doubt occasionally some small craft manages to run a few kegs or bales and unfortunately the gentry instead of aiding his majestys representatives keep the thing alive by purchasing spirits and so on from those who have been concerned in their landing  well you know captain whittier human nature is pretty strong if a pedlar comes along here with ribbons and fallals and offers them to the girls at half the price at which they could buy them down at poole you can hardly expect them to take lofty ground and charge the man with having smuggled them  i do not think the young ladies are offenders that way the officer said for i have never yet seen them in foreign gear of any sort i should if you will allow me to say so be more inclined were you not a justice of the peace to suspect you of having dealings with these men for your brandy is generally of the best  i dont set up to be better than my neighbours captain the squire said with a laugh and if the chance comes my way i will not say that i should refuse to buy a good article at the price i should pay for a bad one in the town  your tobacco is good too squire  yes i am particular about my tobacco and i must say that i think government lays too high a duty on it if i had the making of the laws i would put a high duty on bad tobacco and a low duty on a good article that would encourage the importation of good wholesome stuff  i suppose you have heard no rumours of any suspicious looking craft being heard of off the coast  no i think that they carry on their business a good deal farther to the west now my post is becoming quite a sinecure the henriette came into poole this morning but we never trouble about her she is a fair trader and is well known at every port between portsmouth and plymouth as such she always comes in at daylight and lays her foresail aback till we board her and send a couple of men with her into poole or wareham her cargo is always consigned to wellknown merchants at all the ports she enters and consists of wines for the most part though she does occasionally bring in brandy  he is a fine young fellow the skipper jean martin i believe his father is a large wine merchant at nantes i suppose you know him squire  yes i have met him several times down in the town and indeed have bought many a barrel of wine of him he has been up here more than once for i have told him whenever he has anything particularly good either in wine or spirits to let me know he talks a little english and my girls like to have a chat with him about what is going on on his side of the water he offered the other day to give leigh a trip across to nantes if i was willing  things seem to be going on very badly in paris by what he says but he does not anticipate any troubles in the west of france where there seems to be none of that ill feeling between the different classes that there is in other parts  the departure of captain whittier was always followed by a broad smile on the faces of the elder boys breaking occasionally into a hearty laugh in which the squire joined  i call him an insufferable ass ralph said on this particular evening it would be difficult as father says to find an officer who is as far as we are concerned so admirably suited for his position  that is so ralph there is scarcely a man woman or child in this part of dorsetshire who does not know that there are more goods run on that piece of water over there than on the whole south coast of england i sincerely trust that nothing will ever bring about his recall personally i would pay two or three hundred a year out of my own pocket rather than lose him there is no such place anywhere for the work why there are some fourteen or fifteen inlets where goods can be landed at high water and once past the island i dont care how sharp the revenue men may be the betting is fifty to one against their being at the right spot at the right time  if the passage between our point and the island were but a bit wider it would be perfect but unfortunately it is so narrow that it is only on the very darkest night one can hope to get through unnoticed however we can do very well with the southern channel and after all it is safer we can get any number of boats and the henriette has only to anchor half a mile outside the entrance we know when she is coming and have but to show a light directly she makes her signal and the boats will put out from radhorn passage and hamworth while messengers start for bushaw and scopland and creach and a dozen farmhouses and the carts are sure to be at the spot where they had been warned to assemble by the time the boats come along with the kegs and everything is miles away in hiding before morning  if it is a dark night the henriette makes off again and comes boldly in the next afternoon if one of the revenue boats either from here or studland happens to come across her before she gets up anchor there she isthe crew are all asleep with the exception of a man on watch she is simply waiting to come in when there is light enough to enable her to make her way up the passage  james stansfield was in fact the organizer of the smuggling business carried on at poole and the adjacent harbours there was not a farmhouse among the hills to the south of the great sheet of water with which he was not in communication winter was the season at which the trade was most busy for the short summer nights were altogether unsuited for the work and when the cold weather drove the wildfowl in for shelter there was splendid shooting and ralph and john were able to combine amusement with business and to keep the larder well stocked  the night signals were made from a cleft in the sand hills half a mile from the house the light being so arranged that it could not be seen from brownsea island though visible to those on the south side from studland right away over the hills to corfe castle even to wareham it was shown but for half a minute just as the bells of poole church struck nine at that hour when the lugger was expected there was a lookout at the door of every farmhouse and the moment the light was seen preparations were made for the landing at the spot of which notice had been given by one or other of the boys on the previous day then from quiet little inlets the boats would put off noiselessly directly there was water to float them for it was only at high tides that the shallows were covered they would gather in the channel south of brownsea where the boys and often their father would be in their boats in readiness until a momentary glimmer of a light so placed on board the lugger that it could only be seen from the spot where they were awaiting it showed the position of the craft and their readiness to discharge cargo  it was exciting work and profitable and so well was it managed that although it had been carried on for some years no suspicion had ever entered the minds of any of the revenue officers sometimes many weeks would elapse between the visits of the lugger for she was obliged to make her appearance frequently at other ports to maintain her character as a trader and was as such well known all along the coast  it was only a year since the henriette had taken the place of another lugger that had previously carried on the work but had been wrecked on the french coast she had been the property of the same owner or rather of the same firm for jean martin who had been first mate on board the other craft had invested some of his own money in the henriette and assumed the command it was noticed at poole that the henriette used that port more frequently than her predecessor had done and indeed she not infrequently came in in the daytime with her hold as full as when she had left nantes  it was on one of these occasions that jean martin on coming up to netherstock had a long talk with the squire  so you want my daughter patsey the latter said when his visitor had told his story well it has certainly never entered my mind that any of my girls should marry a frenchman i dont say that i have not heard my boys making a sly joke more than once when the henriette was seen coming in and i have seen the colour flying up into the girls face but i only looked at it as boys nonsense still i dont say that i am averse to your suit we may be said to be partners in this trade of yours and we both owe each other a good deal during the last eight years you must have run something like forty cargoes and never lost a keg or a bale and i doubt if as much could be said for any other craft in the trade  still one cant calculate on always being lucky i dont think anyone would turn traitor when the whole countryside is interested in the matter and i wouldnt give much for the life of anyone who whispered as much as a word to the revenue people still accidents will take place sometimes your father must have done well with the trade and so have i  at any rate i will leave it in patseys hands i have enough of them and to spare and of course you will be able to bring her over sometimes to pay us a visit here  i think too that your offer of taking leigh over with you helps to decide me in your favour they are all growing up and if anything were to put a stop to our business this place would not keep them all and it would be a great thing for patsey to have her brother as a companion when you are away the boy would learn french and in your fathers business would get such a knowledge of the trade with nantes as should serve him in good stead at any rate he will learn things that are a good deal more useful to him than those he gets from the curate  well you know you will find her in the dairy as usual you had better go and see what she says to it  it is probable that jean martin had already a shrewd idea of what patseys answer would be and he presently returned to her father radiant patsey indeed had given her heart to the cheery young sailor and although it seemed to her a terrible thing that she should go to settle in france she had the less objection to it inasmuch as the fear that the smuggling would be sooner or later discovered and that ruin might fall upon netherstock was ever present in her mind and in that of her elder sister  to her brothers engaged in the perilous business it was regarded as a pleasant excitement without which their lives would be intolerably dull it was not that she or they regarded the matter in the light of a crime for almost everyone on that part of the coast looked upon smuggling as a game in which the wits of those concerned in it were pitted against those of the revenue men it brought profit to all concerned and although many of the gentry found it convenient to express indignation at the damage done to the kings revenue by smuggling there were none of them who thought it necessary to mention to the coast guard when by some accident a keg of brandy or a parcel with a few pounds of prime tobacco was found in one of the outhouses  patsey had suffered more than her sister being of a more lively imagination and being filled with alarm and anxiety whenever she knew that her father and the boys were away at night then too she was very fond of leigh and had built many castles in the air as to his future and the thought that not only would he be with her but would be in the way of making his road to fortune was very pleasant to her she knew that if he remained at netherstock he would grow up like his brothers his father might from time to time talk of putting him into some business but she understood his ways and was certain that nothing would come of it  martin had before expressed to her his doubt as to whether her father would consent to her going away with him but she had no fear on the subject in his quiet easygoing way he was fond of his children and would scarcely put himself out to oppose vehemently anything on which they had set their hearts he had too more than once said that he wished some of them could be settled elsewhere for a time of trouble might come and it would be well to have other homes where some of them could be received  patsey has consented jean martin said joyously as he rejoined the squire  well that is all right i think myself that it is for the best of course it must be understood that in the matter of religion she is not to be forced or urged in any sort of way but is to be allowed to follow the religion in which she has been brought up  i would in no way press her sir we have protestants in france just as there are catholics here though i must admit that there are not many of them in la vendee still the days when people quarrelled about religion are long since past and certainly at nantes there is a protestant congregation though away in the country they would be difficult to find however i promise you solemnly that i will in no way try to influence her mind nor that of the boy he will still of course look upon england as his home and i should even oppose any attempt being made to induce him to join our church you have plenty of frenchmen in this country and no question as to their religion arises it will be just the same with us  six weeks later the henriette returned in her came monsieur martin whose presence as a witness of the ceremony was considered advisable if not absolutely necessary he had too various documents to sign in presence of the french consul at southampton giving his formal consent the marriage was solemnized there at a small catholic chapel and it was repeated at the parish church at poole and the next day the party sailed for nantes  it was two months before the lugger again came in to poole when it returned it took with it the squire and polly to whom monsieur martin had given a warm invitation to come over to see patsey in her new home  they found her well and happy monsieur martins house was in the suburbs of nantes it had a large garden at the end of which facing another street stood a pretty little house that had been generally used either as the abode of aged mothers or unmarried sisters of the family or for an eldest son to take his wife to but which had now been handed over to jean and his wife this was very pleasant for patsey as it united the privacy of a separate abode with the cheerfulness of the family home she had her own servant whose excellent cooking and above all whose scrupulous cleanliness and tidiness astonished her after the rough meals and haphazard arrangements at netherstock  whenever she felt dull during jeans absences she could run across the garden for a talk with his mother and sister at meals and in the evening she had leigh who spent most of his time at the cellars or in the counting house of monsieur martin learning for the first time habits of business and applying himself eagerly to acquiring the language  the squire was put up at monsieur martins and polly slept in the one spare room at her sisters all the party from the pavilion going over to the house to the midday meal and supper the squire and polly were much pleased with their visit it was evident that patsey had become a prime favourite with her husbands family jeans sister louise was assiduous in teaching her french and she had already begun to make some progress louise and her mother were constantly running across to the little pavilion on some errand or other and patsey spent as much of her time with them as she did in her own house  jeans absences seldom exceeded ten days and he generally spent a week at home before sailing again he had driven her over to stay for three or four days at a small estate of his own some forty miles to the southeast of nantes in the heart of what was called the bocagea wild country with thick woods narrow lanes high hedges and scattered villages and farms much more english in appearance than the country round nantes the estate had come to him from an aunt everything here was very interesting to patsey the costumes of the women and children the instruments of husbandry the air of freedom and independence of the people and the absence of all ceremony interested and pleased her she did not understand a single word of the patois spoken to her by the peasants and which even jean had some difficulty in following although he had spent a good deal of his time at the little chateau during the lifetime of his aunt  should you like to live here when not at sea jean asked patsey  yes i would rather live here than at nantes next to a life at sea i should like one quite in the country there is plenty to do here there is the work on the place to look after there is shooting there is visiting and visiting here means something hearty and not like the formal work in the town here no one troubles his head over politics they may quarrel as they like in paris but it does not concern la vendee  here the peasants love their masters and the masters do all in their power for the comfort and happiness of the peasants it is not as in many other parts of france where the peasants hate the nobles and the nobles regard the peasants as dirt under their feet here it is more like what i believe it was in england when you had your troubles and the tenants followed their lords to battle at any rate life here would be very preferable to being in business with my father in nantes i should never have settled down to that and as my elder brother seems specially made for that sort of life fortunately i was able to go my own way to take to the sea in the lugger and become the carrier of the firm while taking my share in the general profits  how is it that your brother does not live at home it would seem natural that he should have had the pavilion when he married  he likes going his own way jean said shortly as far as business matters go he and my father are as one but in other matters they differ widely jacques is always talking of reforms and changes while my father is quite content with things as they are jacques has his own circle of friends and would like to go to paris as a deputy and to mix himself up in affairs  though none of us cared for the lady that he chose as his wife she had money and there was nothing to say against her personally none of us ever took to her and there was a general feeling of relief when it was known that jacques had taken a house in the business quarter  he looks after the carrying business of course my lugger does but a very small proportion of it we send up large quantities of brandy to tours orleans and other towns on the loire and have dealings with brittany and normandy by sea and with the gironde he looks after that part of the business my father does the buying and directs the counting house though my art is a very inferior one i have no reason to complain of my share of the profits  the first eighteen months of patseys married life passed quietly and happily she could now speak french fluently and having made several stays at the country chateau could make herself understood in the patois leigh spoke french as well as english fortunately he had picked up a little before leaving home partly from his tutor partly from endeavouring to talk with french fishermen and sailors who came into poole he frequently made trips in the henriette sometimes to havre and rouen at others to bordeaux he had grown much and was now a very strong active lad he got on very well with monsieur martin but kept as much apart as he could from his eldest son for whom he felt a deep personal dislike and who had always disapproved of jeans marriage to an englishwoman  jacques martin was the strongest contrast to his brother he was methodical and sententious expressed his opinion on all subjects with the air of a man whose judgment was infallible and was an ardent disciple of voltaire and rousseau it was very seldom that he entered his fathers house where his opinions on religious subjects shocked and horrified his mother and sister he lived with an entirely different set and spent most of his time at the clubs which in imitation of those of paris had sprung up all over the country  what is all the excitement about jean leigh asked his brotherinlaw one evening there are always fellows standing on casks or bales of timber along the wharf shouting and waving their arms about and sometimes reading letters or printed papers and then those who listen to them shout and throw up their caps and get into a tremendous state of excitement  they are telling the others what is being done at the assembly  and what are they doing there jean  they are turning things upside down  and is that good  well there is no doubt that things are not as well managed as they might be and that there is a great deal of distress and misery in some parts of france the taxation has been very heavy and the extravagance of the court has excited an immense deal of anger it is not the fault of the present king who is a quiet fellow and does not care for show or pageants but it is rather the fault of the kings who preceded him especially of louis the fourteenthwho was a great monarch no doubt but a very expensive one to his subjects and whose wars cost an enormous sum  you see it is not in france as it is with you the nobles here have great power their tenants and serfsfor they are still nothing but serfsare at the mercy of their lords who may flog them and throw them into prison almost at their pleasure and will grind the last sou out of them that they may cut a good figure at court  in this part of france things are more as they are in england the nobles and seigneurs are like your country gentlemen they live in their chateaux they mix with their people and take an interest in them they go to their fetes and the ladies visit the sick and in all respects they live as do your country squires paying a visit for a few weeks each year to paris and spending the rest of their time on their estates but it is not from the country that the members of the assembly who are the most urgent for reforms and violent in their speech come but from the towns there were two writers voltaire and rousseau who have done enormous mischief both of them perceived that the state of things was wrong but they went to extremes made fun of the church and attacked institutions of all sorts their writings are read by everyone and have shaken peoples faith in god and in all things as they are  i do not say that much improvement could not be made but it will never be made by sudden and great changes nor by men such as those who are gradually gaining the upper hand in the assembly the people ought to have a much stronger voice than they have in their own taxation they see that in england the ministers and parliament manage everything and that the kingalthough his influence goes for a good deal and he can change his ministers as often as he likesmust yet bow to the voice of parliament i think that that is reasonable but when it comes to a parliament composed largely of mere agitators and spouters i for my part would rather be ruled by a king  but what is it that these people want jean  i do not think they know in the least themselves beyond the fact that they want all the power that they want to destroy the nobility overthrow the church and lay hands on the property of all who are more wealthy than themselves naturally the lowest classes of the towns who are altogether ignorant believe that by supporting these men and by pulling down all above them it would no longer be necessary to work they want to divide the estates of the nobles take a share of the wealth of the traders and of the better class of all sorts in fact they would turn everything topsyturvy render the poor all powerful and tread all that is good and noble under their feet the consequence is that the king is virtually a prisoner in the hands of the mob of paris the nobles and better classes are leaving the country thousands of these have already been massacred and no one can say how matters will end  here in nantes there is as you see a feeling of excitement and unrest and though as yet there has been no violence no one could venture to predict what may take place if the moderate men in the assembly are outvoted by the extremists and all power falls into the hands of the latter but i still hope that common sense will prevail in the long run i regard the present as a temporary madness and trust that france will come to her senses and that we shall have the satisfaction of seeing the scoundrels who are now the leaders of the mob of paris receive the punishment they deserve  however as far as we are concerned i have no uneasiness for if troubles break out at nantes we can retire to my chateau in the thickest and most wooded part of la vendee where there is no fear that the peasants will ever rise against their masters    chapter 2 the beginning of troubles   things are getting more and more serious patsey said jean one evening i dont know what will come of it the excitement is spreading here and there can be no doubt that there will be very serious troubles ere long the greater portion of the people here are with the assembly and approve of all these decrees against the priests and the persecution of the better classes you know what has taken place in paris and i fear that it will be repeated here  we are split up my father dear good man thinks that he has only to attend to his business and to express no opinion whatever about public affairs and that the storm will pass quietly over his head my brother has thrown himself heart and soulthat is to say as far as he has a heart to throwinto what he calls the cause of the people and which i consider to be the cause of revolution of confiscation of irreligion and abomination generally  i am told that my name has freely been mentioned in his club as that of a dangerous man with opinions contrary to the public good i hear too that that brother of mine was there at the time and that he got up and said that in a case like this his voice must be silent that true patriots place their country before all things and then affected to speak mildly in my favour but at the same time doing me as much harm as he could i believe the fellow is capable of denouncing his own father  from the bocage i hear that the whole country is in confusion the people of course side with their priests the nobles and land owners are naturally royalists and are furious that the king should be held in what is practically subjection by men of low degree and who although they may have some virtuous men among them have also sanguinary scoundrels who gradually gain in power and will soon be supreme  they however can do nothing at present the peasants know nothing about the king to them he is a mere name but this persecution of their priests angers them greatly and if as is said orders have been given to raise an army and to drag men away from their homes whether they like to go or not you may be sure that ere long there will be trouble there  now you see dear i am a sort of double character at sea i am captain jean martin a peaceful trader with as you know but little regard for the revenue laws of your country on the other hand in la vendee i am monsieur jean martin a landed proprietor and on friendly terms with all the nobles and gentry in my neighbourhood it is evident that i cannot continue to play this double part already great numbers of arrests have been made here and the prisons are half full i hear that a commissioner from the assembly is expected here shortly to try these suspects as they are called and from what we know already we may be sure that there will be little mercy shown  they are almost all people of substance and the people as they call themselves are on principle opposed to men of substance now if i remain here i have no doubt that i shall be denounced in a very short time and to be denounced is to be thrown into prison and to be thrown into prison is equivalent to being murdered i have no doubt patsey that you would share my fate the fact that you are an englishwoman was among the accusations brought against me in the club and although so far as i can see the majority of these scoundrels have no religion whatever they venture to make it a matter of complaint that you are a protestant  i have seen this coming on for some time and must now make my choice either i must take you and the child over to england and leave you there with your father until these troubles are over while i must myself go down and look after my tenantry and bear my share in whatever comes or you must go down there with me  certainly i will go down with you jean it is your home and whatever dangers may come i will share them with you it would be agony to be in england and to know nothing of what is passing here and what danger might be threatening you we took each other for better or worse jean and the greater danger you may be in the more it will be my duty to be by your side  i should be very happy down at the chateau more happy than i have been here with you for some time past for one cannot but be very anxious when one sees ones friends thrown into prison and knows that you are opposed to all these things and that it may be your turn next nothing would persuade me to leave you  very well wife so be it i am sure that there at least we shall be safe it is only in the towns that these rascals are dangerous and in a country like ours there is little fear that the knaves will venture to interfere when they see that they are stirring up a nest of hornets they have plenty of work to satisfy even their taste for confiscation and murder in the large towns there is an army gathering on the frontier and they will have their hands full ere long  and now about leigh my brother has always shown a dislike for him and as it is certain that he cannot remain here he must either return to england or go with us  i am sure that he would choose to go with us jean you say yourself that he talks french like a native now and although he has often told me that he would never settle in francefor naturally he is as horrified as i am with the doings in paris and the other great townsstill i am sure that he would choose to remain with us now you see he is strong and active and has made so many trips with you that he is almost a sailor he is within a few months of sixteen and of late he has several times said to me that he would like to go some long voyages and have some adventures before settling down in business in england as an agent of your house  i should like to have him with us jean said heartily in the first place he is a lad after my own heart full of life and go and already strong enough to take his own part in the next place although i hope for the best a man can never say exactly what will take place i may be away at times and should be glad to know that you had a protector and if he is willing to go i shall be more than willing to have him  then too it would be useful to have someone whom one could trust to carry messages my idea is that i shall not leave the lugger here for if i am denounced it would certainly be seized pierre lefaux my mate is a shrewd as well as a faithful fellow i shall appoint him captain i shall tell him to leave here at once and employ the lugger in coasting voyages making bordeaux his headquarters and taking what freights he can get between that town and rochelle brest or other ports on this coast so long as he does not return here he might even take wines across to england or brandy from charente he knows his business well and as long as we are at peace with england trade will still go on  the best thing would be for him to be at bordeaux once every fortnight or three weeks so that we shall know where to find him i have a great friend at bordeaux and shall get him to have the lugger registered in his name and give him a receipt for her purchase money so that in case the people here learn that she is trading at bordeaux he will be able to prove that she is his own property then if the very worst should come which i cannot bring myself to believe there will be a means of escape for us all to england  she will be sailing there in two or three days i have fifty thousand francs lying in my fathers hands i shall send that over by lefaux and instruct him to ask your father to go with him to the bank at poole and pay the money in to my account then if we should have to leave france we shall have that to fall back upon and the lugger i should of course transfer her to the english flag and have no doubt that we should be able to get on very fairly so you see i am preparing for all contingencies patsey  it seems very dreadful that the country should be in such a state jean  it is dreadful and i am afraid that things have by no means got to the worst yet  ah here comes leigh after supper i shall go in and have a talk with my father i have very little hope of having much success with him but at least when he sees the steps that i am taking it cannot but make him think seriously of his own position and that of my mother and sisters  leigh was delighted when he heard jeans proposal his own position had been unpleasant of late he had long since ceased to go to jacques martin for the dislike between them was mutual and do what he would he failed to give satisfaction and of late even in monsieur martins cellars and storehouses he had met with a good deal of unpleasantness and would have met with more had it not been that he had on one occasion knocked down one of the chief clerks who had sworn at him for some trifling act of carelessness as the clerk knew that the merchant would have been very angry at the insult he had offered to leigh he had not ventured to make a complaint but in many ways he had been able to cause numberless petty annoyances many of the others were inclined to follow his lead and would have done so more openly were it not that they held in respect leighs strength and readiness in the science they called le boxe  the talk that there might be troubles in la vendee heightened his satisfaction at leaving nantes and going down to stay in the country the thought of a life spent at poole or weymouth as a wine merchant and agent of the house of martin had for some time past been unpleasant to him the feeling of general unrest that prevailed in france had communicated itself to him and he thought possibly that something might occur which would change the current of his life and lead to one more suited to his natural activity and energy  you had better pack up quietly tomorrow jean said to his wife after his return from his fathers if there were any suspicion that i was thinking of going away it might bring matters to a head i will get the luggers boat down to the wharf and four sailors shall come up here and take the boxes down in one of the hand carts with a tarpaulin thrown over them i will arrange for a cart and a carriage to be waiting for us on the other side of the river  there is no moving my father he cannot persuade himself that a man who takes no part in politics and goes about his business quietly can be in any danger he has however at my mothers entreaty agreed for the present to cease buying and to diminish his stock as far as possible and send the money as fast as he realizes it across to england he says too that he will if things get worse send her and my sister to england i promised him that your father would find them a house and see that they were settled comfortably there for a time he would not believe that jacques could have been at the club when i was denounced without defending me for although himself greatly opposed to the doings in paris and annoyed at the line jacques has taken up he thought that there was at least this advantage in itthat in case of troubles coming here he would have sufficient influence to prevent our being in any way molested however there can be no question that i have to some extent alarmed him and he agreed not only to draw tomorrow my fifty thousand francs from his caisse but to send over with it a hundred thousand francs of his own fortunately he can do this without jacques knowing anything about it for although jacques and i have both a share in the business he has always kept the management of the money matters in his own hands  so that is settled as far as it can be settled fortunately the club does not meet this evening so there is no fear of a demand being made by it for my arrest tomorrow i have a friend who belongs to itnot i think because he at all agrees with its views but because like many others he deems it prudent to appear to do so it was from him that i heard what had passed there and he promised to give me warning of anything that might be said or done against me i shall go down to the lugger early and remain on board all day seeing to the stowage of the cargo we are taking on board so that no suspicion can arise that i am thinking of leaving for the country  the next evening the party started by unfrequented streets for the quay the nurse carrying the child now three months old the boxes had gone half an hour before it was nearly ten oclock and the quays were deserted monsieur martin had himself gone down in the afternoon with the money to the lugger and handed it over to jean and had a long talk with him and pierre lefaux to whom jean had also intrusted letters from himself and patsey to the squire  as soon as the party had taken their seats in the boat it was rowed two miles up the river to a point where there was a ferry across to a road leading into the heart of la vendee here a light waggon and a carriage were waiting the luggage was transferred to the former and after a hearty farewell to pierre lefaux who had himself come in charge of the boat they started on their journey and arrived at the chateau at nine oclock in the morning to the surprise of the man and woman in charge of it  here we are safe jean said as they alighted from the carriage it would take nothing short of an army to fight its way through these woods and lanes and if the assembly try to interfere with us they will find it a much easier thing to pull down the throne of france than to subdue la vendee  the news that the master had come down and that he was going for a time to live among them spread rapidly and in the course of the day some fifteen of the tenants came in to pay their respects few of them arriving without some little offering in the way of game poultry butter or other produce  our larder is full enough for us to stand a siege patsey said laughing and i know that we have a good stock of wine in the cellar jean  yes and of cider too when the tenants are in any difficulty about paying their rents i am always willing to take it out in wine or cider for my father deals in both and therefore it is as good as money but i have not sent any to nantes for the past two or three years and as you say the cellars are as full as they can hold  tomorrow leigh we will ride over and call upon some of our neighbours to hear the last news for the bocage is as far away from nantes as if it were on the other side of france and we hear only vague rumours of what is going on here  the ride was a delightful one to leigh he had only once visited the chateau before and then only for a day or two the wild country with its deep lanes its thick high hedges its woods and copses was all new to him for the country round his english home was for the most part bare and open some of the peasants carried guns over their shoulders and looked as if accustomed to use them  very few of them possess guns jean martin remarked and that they should carry them shows how disturbed a state of mind all these people are in they know that their priests may be arrested and carried off at any moment and no doubt the report that an order has been issued to raise thirty thousand men throughout france and that every town and village has to furnish its quota has stirred them up even more effectually i dont suppose that many of them think that the authorities will really try to drag men off against their will but the possibility is quite enough to inflame their minds  at the very first house they visited they received from the owner ample confirmation of jeans views  there have been continual fracases between the peasants and the military he said over the attempts of the latter to arrest the priests they can scarcely be called fights for it has not come to that but as soon as the peasants hear that the gendarmes are coming they send the priest into the wood and gather in such force that the gendarmes are glad enough to ride away unharmed of course until we see that the peasants are really in earnest and intend to fight to the last it would be madness for any of us to take any part in the matter for we should be risking not only life but the fortunes of our families and maybe their lives too you must remember moreover that already a great number of the landed proprietors have either been murdered or imprisoned in paris or are fugitives beyond the frontier  if the peasants would fight jean martin said it might not be a bad thing that there are so few whom they could regard as their natural leaders if there are only a few leaders they may act together harmoniously or each operate in his own district but with a number of men of the same rank or nearly of the same rank each would have his own ideas as to what should be done and there would be jealousy and discord  that is true the other replied of course if this were an open country it would be necessary to give us a chance of success that some sort of discipline should be established and none could persuade the peasants to submit to discipline except their own lords but in a country like this discipline is of comparatively little importance and it is well that it is so for though i believe that the peasants would fight to the death rather than submit to be dragged away by force from their homes they will never keep together for any time  i am afraid that that will be the case we must hope that it will not come to fighting but if it does it will take a large force to conquer la vendee  what has brought you down here monsieur martin  it was not safe for me to stay longer in nantes if i think a thing i say it and as i dont think well of what is being done in paris i have not been in the habit of saying flattering things about the men there in fact i have been denounced and as there is still room for a few more in the prisons i should have had a cell placed at my disposal if i had remained there many more hours so i thought that i should be safer down here till there was some change in the state of affairs  and you brought madame down with you  assuredly i had only the choice open to me of sending her across to england and of making my home there or of coming here if there had been no prospect of trouble here i might have joined the army of our countrymen who are in exile but as from all i heard la vendee was ready to take up arms i determined to come here partly because had i left the country my estates here would have been confiscated partly because i should like to strike a blow myself at these tyrants of paris who seem bent on destroying the whole of the aristocracy of france of wiping out the middle classes and dividing the land and all else among the scum of the towns  three or four months passed quietly there were occasional skirmishes between the peasants and parties of troops in search of priests who refused to obey the orders of the assembly at nantes the work of carrying out mock trials and executing those of the better classes who had been swept into the prisons went on steadily from time to time a message came to jean from his father saying that he had carried out his determination to lessen his stocks and that he had sent considerable sums of money across the channel so far he had not been molested but he saw that the public madness was increasing and the passion for blood ever growing  then came the news of the execution of the king which sent a thrill of horror through the loyal province shortly afterwards it was known that the decree for the raising of men was to be enforced and that commissioners had already arrived at saumur with a considerable force that would be employed if necessary but that the process of drawing the names of those who were to go was to be carried out by the local authorities assisted by the national guards of the towns  during the winter things had gone on quietly at the chateau there had been but little visiting for the terrible events passing in paris and in all the large towns and the uncertainty about the future had cast so deep a gloom over the country that none thought of pleasure or even of cheerful intercourse with their neighbours many of the gentry too had given up all hope and had made their way down to the coast and succeeded in obtaining a passage in smuggling craft or even in fishing boats to england  jean martin and leigh had spent much of their time in shooting game was abundant and as so many of the chateaux were shut up they had a wide range of country open to them for sport once or twice they succeeded in bringing home a wild boar wolves had multiplied in the forests for during the last three years the regular hunts in which all the gentry took part had been abandoned and the animals had grown fearless  one day soon after the news of the kings death had been received jean who had ridden over to saumur on business brought back the news that war had been declared with england  it would have made a good deal of difference to me he said if i had still been on board the lugger for of course there would be an end to all legitimate trade however no doubt i should have managed to run a cargo sometimes for they will want brandy and tobacco all the more when regular trade is at an end and prices you may be sure will go up i have no doubt too that there will be a brisk business in carrying emigrants over still of course the danger would be very much greater hitherto we have only had the revenue cutters and the coast guards to be afraid of now every vessel of war would be an enemy  as during their expeditions they were generally accompanied by half a dozen peasants who acted as beaters leigh had come to understand the patois and to some extent to speak it and he often paid visits to the houses of the principal tenants of the estate who not only welcomed him as the brother of their mistress but soon came to like him for himself and were amused by his high spirits his readiness to be pleased with everything and his talk to them of the little known country across the water  it was evident from the manner in which the drawing for the conscription was spoken of that it would not be carried out without a strong resistance sunday the tenth of march had been fixed for the drawing and as the day approached the peasants became more and more determined that they would not permit themselves to be dragged away from their homes  three days before a party of the tenants together with some from adjoining estates had come up to the chateau jean martin at once came out to them  we have come monsieur to ask if you will lead us we are determined that we will not be carried off like sheep  there you are right jean said but although i shall be ready to do my share of fighting i do not wish to be a leader in the first place there are many gentlemen of far larger possessions and of higher rank than myself who would naturally be your leaders there is the marquis de lescure at clisson and with him are several other noble gentlemen among them henri de la rochejaqueleinhe is a cavalry officer his family have emigrated but he has remained here on his estates then too you have many other military officers who have served there is monsieur de bonchamp monsieur delbee and monsieur dommaigne all of whom have served in the army if the insurrection becomes general i shall head my own tenants and join the force under some chosen commander but i shall not appear as a leader not only am i altogether ignorant of military affairs but were it known in nantes that i was prominent in the rising they would undoubtedly avenge themselves upon my relations there  it was known that artillery and gendarmes had been gathered in all the towns of la vendee two days before that appointed for the drawing jean said to leigh  i shall ride tomorrow to the castle of clisson i know monsieur de lescure he has wide influence and is known to be a devoted royalist and to have several royalist refugees now at his house i shall be able to learn from him whether his intention is to take part in the insurrection it is a long ride and i shall not return until tomorrow  if you like you can ride north to saint florent if there should be any tumult i charge you not to take any part in it you had better leave your horse at some cabaret on this side of the town and go in on foot it is possible that there will be no trouble there for they are sure to have made preparations against it and it is more likely that there will be disturbances at smaller places still it will be interesting to mark the attitude of the peasants  you see if there is to be a war it is their war the gentlemen here would have fought for the king had there been a shadow of a prospect of success and had he given the smallest encouragement to his friends to rally to his support they might even have fought against the disturbance of the clergy but they would have had no followers the peasants cared but little for the king and though they did care enough for the priests to aid them to escape they did not care enough to give battle for them they are now going to fight for their own cause and for their own liberty they have to show us that they are in earnest about it before we join them if they are in earnest we ought to be successful we ought to be able to put a hundred thousand men in arms and in such a country as this we should be able to defy any force that the convention can send against us and to maintain the right of la vendee to hold itself aloof from the doings of the rest of france  but as i said until we know that they are really in earnest we cannot afford to throw in our lot with them so if you go to saint florent keep well away from the point where the drawing is to take place watch affairs from a distance i have little doubt that those who go will go with the determination of defending themselves but whether they will do so will depend upon whether there is one among them energetic enough to take the lead that is always the difficulty in such matters if there is a fight we must as i say simply watch it it is at present no affair of ours if it begins we shall all have our work before us plenty of it and plenty of danger and excitement but for the present we have to act as spectators  it was a ride of fifteen miles to saint florent and although leigh had twice during the winter ridden there with jean he had some difficulty in finding his way through the winding roads and numerous lanes along which he had to pass during the early part of the ride he met with but few people on the way the church bells were ringing as usual and there was nothing to show that any trouble was impending but when he arrived within two or three miles of the town he overtook little groups of peasants walking in that direction some of them he saw carried pitchforks the rest had stout cudgels  saint florent stood on the loire and in an open space in the centre of the town the authorities were gathered behind them was a force of gendarmes and in the middle of their line stood a cannon  leigh had as jean had told him left his horse outside the town and now took up his place with a number of townspeople on one side of the square as the peasants arrived they clustered together at the end of the street waiting for the hour to strike at which the drawing was to begin a few minutes before the clock struck some of the gendarmes left the group in the centre of the square and advanced to the peasants they were headed by an officer who as he came up exclaimed  what do you mean by coming here with pitchforks lay them down at once  there was a low murmur among the peasants  follow me he said to his men and walking up to one of the men carrying a pitchfork he said  i arrest you in the name of the republic  in an instant a young man standing next to the one he had seized sprang forward and struck the officer to the ground with his cudgel  illustration follow me he shouted make for the gun  follow me he shouted make for the gun  with a cheer the peasants rushed forward overthrowing the gendarmes as they went the municipal authorities after hesitating for a moment took to their heels in the most undignified manner the gun had not been loaded the gendarmes round it seeing that they were greatly outnumbered followed their example and the peasants with exultant shouts seized the cannon and then scattering chased the gendarmes out of the town  never was a more speedy and bloodless victory headed by their leader whose name was rene foret the peasants went to the municipality broke open the doors took possession of the arms stored there collected all the papers they could find and made a great bonfire with them in the centre of the square then without harming anyone or doing the slightest mischief they left the town and scattered to their homes in the bocage  leigh waited until all was over returned to the cabaret where he had left his horse and rode on passing through the little town of pin a powerfullooking man some thirtyfive years old with a quiet manner broad forehead and intelligent face stepped up to him  pardon monsieur he said but you have come from saint florent  yes he replied  has aught happened there  yes the peasants attacked the gendarmes who fled leaving their cannon behind them the peasants took what arms there were in the municipality and made a bonfire of the papers they then without doing any damage dispersed to their homes  they have done well the man said they have made a beginning my name monsieur is cathelineau my business so far has been that of a hawker i am well known in this part of the country maybe sir you will hear my name again for henceforth i am an insurgent we have borne this tyranny of the butchers in paris too long and the time has come when we must either free ourselves of it or die you belong to another class but methinks that when you see that we are in earnest you will join  i doubt not that we shall leigh said i am but a lad yet but i hope that when the time comes i shall do my part  the man lifted his hat and moved off and leigh rode forward again he was struck with the earnest manner of the man he had spoken calmly and without excitement expressed himself well and had the air of a man who having determined upon a thing would carry it through  i expect i shall hear of him again he said to himself a man like that travelling round the country no doubt has a deal of influence he is just the sort of man the peasants would follow indeed as it seems to me that anyone might follow  it was late in the afternoon when he arrived home and told his sister what he had witnessed  i am not surprised leigh she said if i were a man i would take up arms too there must be an end to what is going on thousands have been murdered in paris men and women and at least as many more in the other great towns if this goes on not only the nobles and gentry but the middle class of france will all disappear and these bloodstained monsters will i suppose set to to kill each other i feel half french now leigh and it is almost too awful to think of  it seems to me that the only hope is that the peasants not only of the bocage but of all poitou anjou and brittany may rise be joined by those of other parts and march upon the towns destroy them altogether and kill all who have been concerned in these doings  that would be pretty sweeping patsey leigh laughed but you know i hate them as much as you do and though i dont feel a bit french i would certainly do all that i could against them just as one would kill wild beasts who go about tearing people to pieces it is no odds to me whether the men women and children they kill are french or english one wants to put a stop to their killing  i wish now that i had not brought you out with me leigh  in the first place patsey i deny altogether that you did bring me outjean brought me out and in the next place i dont see why you should be sorry i would not miss all this excitement for anything besides i have learned to talk french well and something of the business of a wine merchant i cant be taken in by having common spirit a year or two old passed off on me as the finest from charente or a common claret for a choice brand all that is useful even if i do not become a wine merchant at any rate it is more useful than stopping at netherstock where i should have learned nothing except a little more latin and greek  yes but you may be killed leigh  well i suppose if i had stayed at home and got a commission in the army or a midshipmans berth in the navy i might have been killed and if i had my choice i would much rather be killed in fighting against people who murder women and children who have committed no crime whatever than in fighting soldiers or sailors of another nation who may be just as honest fellows as we are  i cannot argue with you leigh but if anything happens to you i shall blame myself all my life  that would be foolish leigh said it is funny what foolish ideas women have you could not have foreseen what was coming when you came over here and you thought that it would be a good thing for me to accompany you for a time you did what you thought was best and which i think was best well if it doesnt turn out just what we expected you cannot blame yourself for that why if you were to ask me to come for a walk and a tree fell on me as we were going along and killed me you would hardly blame yourself because you asked me to come and this is just the same  at any rate if i do get killed which i dont mean to be if i can help it there is no one else who will take it very much to heart except yourself there are plenty of them at home and now that i have been away nearly two years they must almost have forgotten my existence  i consider you a very foolish boy patsey said gravely you talk a great deal too much nonsense  very well patsey abuse is not argument and almost every word that you have said applies equally well to your folly in leaving a comfortable home in a quiet country to come to such a dangerous place as this  now i hope that supper is ready for i am as hungry as a hunter    chapter 3 the first successes   the next morning at twelve oclock jean martin reached home  the war has begun he said as he leaped from his horse henri de la rochejaquelein has accepted the leadership of the peasants at clisson lescure would have joined also but henri pointed out to him that it would be better not to compromise his family until it was certain that the insurrection would become general the young count was starting just as i got to the chateau he is a splendid young fellow full of enthusiasm and burning to avenge the misfortunes that have fallen upon his family a peasant had arrived the evening before with a message from his aunt who lives farther to the south he brought news that the chevalier de charetteformerly a lieutenant in the navy and a strong royalist who had escaped the massacres at paris and was living quietly on his estate near machecoulhad been asked several times by the peasants in his neighbourhood to take the command and had accepted it and that the rising was so formidable there that it was certain the authorities in that part of poitou would not succeed in enforcing the conscription  i have told lescure that i shall be prepared to join as soon as there is a general movement here but that i should attach myself to whoever took the direction of affairs in this part for that in the first place i knew nothing of war and in the second place i have resided here so small a portion of my time that i am scarcely known save to my own tenants  after our meal we will ride round and see how they are off for arms and powder that is our great weakness i am afraid taking the whole country round that not one man in twenty possesses a gun  this indeed was found to be the case as far as those on the estate were concerned the men themselves however seemed to think little of this  we will take them from the blues several of them said confidently it does not matter a bit they will only have time to fire one volley in these lanes of ours and then we shall be among them and a pike or pitchfork are just as good at close quarters as a bayonet  that the whole country was astir was evident from the fact that the sound of the church bells rose from the woods in all directions all work was suspended and the peasants flocked into the little villages to hear the news that was brought in from several directions  cathelineau had in the course of the night gathered a party of twentyseven men who at daybreak had started out from pin setting the church bells ringing in the villages through which they passed until a hundred men armed for the most part with pitchforks and stakes had gathered round him then he boldly attacked the chateau of tallais garrisoned by a hundred and fifty soldiers having with them a cannon this was fired but the shot passed over the peasants heads and with a shout they dashed forward and the soldiers of the republic threw away their arms and fled thus cathelineaus followers became possessed of firearms some horses and to their great delight a cannon  their leader did not waste a moment but marched at once against chemille his force increasing at every moment as the men flocked in from the villages there were at chemille two hundred soldiers with three guns but some of the fugitives from tallais had already arrived there bringing news of the desperate fury with which the peasants had attacked them and at the sight of the throng approaching with their captured cannon the garrison lost heart altogether and bolted leaving their three cannon their ammunition and the greater portion of their muskets behind them  the news spread with incredible rapidity from each village they passed through boys were despatched as messengers and their tidings were taken on by fresh relays by the afternoon all the country for thirty miles round knew that cathelineau had captured tallais and chemille and was in possession of a quantity of arms and four cannon  from saint florent came the news that early in the morning a party of republican soldiers had endeavoured to arrest foret who led the rising on the previous day but that he had obtained word of their approach and setting the church bells ringing had collected a force and had beaten back those who came in search of him  close by a detachment of national guards from chollett had visited the chateau of maulevrier the proprietor was absent but they carried off twelve cannon which had been kept as family relics the gamekeeper nicholas stofflet who was in charge of the estate had served sixteen years in the army he was a man of great strength courage and sagacity and furious at the theft of his masters cannon had gathered the peasantry round and was already at the head of two hundred men  things go on apace patsey jean martin said as they sat by the fire that evening we only know what is happening within some twenty or thirty miles of us but if the spirit shown here exists throughout poitou and anjou there can be no doubt that in a very short time the insurrection will be general this cathelineau by their description must be a man of no ordinary ability and he has lost no time in showing his energy for myself i care not in the least what is the rank of my leader here in la vendee there is no broad line between the seigneurs the tenants and the peasantry at all rustic fetes they mix on equal terms the seigneurs set the example by dancing with the peasant girls and their wives and daughters do not disdain to do the same with tenants or peasantry they attend the marriages and all holiday festivities are foremost in giving aid and in showing kindness in cases of distress or illness and i feel sure that if they found in a man like cathelineau a genius for command they would follow him as readily as one of their own rank  on the fourteenth the news came that the bands of stofflet and foret had with others joined that of cathelineau jean martin hesitated no longer  the war has fairly begun he said i shall be off tomorrow morning if cathelineau is defeated we shall have the republicans devastating the whole country and massacring women and children as they did last august after a rising for the protection of the priests therefore i shall be fighting now in defence of our lives and home wife  i would not keep you at home jean i think it is the duty of every man to join in the defence against these wretches i know that no mercy will be shown by them if they conquer us but you will not take leigh with you surely  leigh uttered an exclamation  leigh must choose for himself jean said quietly he is not french and would have no concern in the matter beyond that of humanity were it not that you are here but at present our home is his your life and his also are involved if we are beaten he is young to fight but there will doubtless be many others no older and probably much less strong than he is moreover if i should be killed it is he who must bear you the news and must arrange with you your plans and act as your protector  i do not say that i should advise your leaving the chateau directly but if the republicans come this way it will be no place for you and i should say that it would be vastly better that you should at once endeavour to cross to england there are five thousand francs in gold in my bureau which are worth three or four times their value in assignats and should if you can gain the coast be amply sufficient to procure a passage for you to england  do not weep dear it is necessary to leave you on an undertaking of this kind prepared for whatever may happen at present the risk is very small as we have heard the fury of the peasants has struck such consternation into the national guards and newlyraised soldiers that they will not await their onslaught and it will not be until the convention becomes aware of the really serious nature of the storm they have raised that there will be any hard fighting still even in a petty skirmish men fall and it is right that before i go we should arrange as to what course you had best pursue in case of my death  from the first when we came here we did so with our eyes open if we had merely sought safety we should have gone to england we came here partly because it is my home and therefore my proper place and partly because in case la vendee rose against these executioners of paris every man of honour and loyalty should aid in the good cause  i know jean and i would not keep you back  the struggle has begun and if the republicans conquer la vendee we know how awful will be the persecutions what thousands of victims will be slaughtered our only hope is in victory and at any rate those who die on the battlefield will be happy in comparison with those who fall into the hands of the blues  you wish to go leigh  certainly i do the lad said i think that everyone strong enough to carry arms in la vendee ought to join and do his best i can shoot better than most of the peasantry not one in twenty of whom has ever had a gun in his hands and i am sure that i am as strong as most of them besides if i had been at home i should now the war has begun have tried to get a commission and to fight the frenchi mean the people who govern france at presentand in fighting them here i am only doing what thousands of englishmen will be doing elsewhere  very well leigh then you shall go with jean i shall certainly be glad to know you are together so that if one is wounded or ill the other can look after him and bring him here i shall do the best i can while you are away  i think that we shall soon be back again and that we shall be constantly seeing you jean said you may be sure that the peasants will not keep the field they will gather and fight and win or lose they will then scatter to their homes again until the church bells call them out to repel a fresh attack of the enemy that is our real weakness there will never be any discipline never any common aim  if all the peasants in the west would join in a great effort and march on paris i believe that the peasantry of the departments through which they pass would join us it would only be the national guards of the towns and the new levies that we should have to meet and i believe that we might take paris crush the scum of the faubourgs and hang every member of the convention but they will never do it it will be a war of defence only and a war so carried out must in the long run be an unsuccessful one  however the result will be that we shall never be very far away from home and shall often return for a few days you must always keep a change of clothes and your trinkets and so on packed up so that at an hours notice you and marthe can start with the child either on receiving a note from me telling you where to join us or if you get news that a force from nantes is marching rapidly in this direction two horses will always remain in the stables in readiness to put into the light cart henri will be your driver francois you must send off to find us and tell us the road that you have taken however of course we shall make all these arrangements later on when affairs become more serious i dont think there is any chance whatever of the enemy making their way into the country for weeks perhaps for months to come  the next morning jean martin and leigh started early each carried a rifle slung behind him a brace of pistols in his holsters and a sword in his belt patsey had recovered from her depression of the previous evening and her natural good spirits enabled her to maintain a cheerful face at parting especially as her husbands assurances that there would be no serious fighting for some time had somewhat calmed her fears for their safety  the horses are useful to us for carrying us about leigh jean martin said as they rode along but unless there are enough mounted men to act as cavalry we shall have to do any fighting that has to be done on foot the peasants would not follow a mounted officer as they would one who placed himself in front of them and fought as they fought  i hope that later on we may manage to get them to adopt some sort of discipline but i have great doubts about it the peasantry of la vendee are an independent race they are respectful to their seigneurs and are always ready to listen to their advice but it is respect and not obedience i fancy from what i have read of your scottish highlanders that the feeling here closely resembles that among the clans they regard their seigneurs as their natural heads and would probably die for them in the field but in other matters each goes his own way and the chiefs know better than to strain their power beyond a certain point  as you see they have already their own leadersstofflet the gamekeeper foret the woodcutter and cathelineau a small peddling wool merchant doubtless many men of rank and family will join them and will naturally from their superior knowledge take their place as officers but i doubt whether they will displace the men who have from the beginning taken the matter in hand i am glad that it should be so the peasants understand men of their own class and will i believe follow them better than they would men above them in rank they will at least have no suspicion of them and the strength of the insurrection lies in the fact that it is a peasant rising and not an insurrection stirred up by men of family  at ten oclock they arrived at cathelineaus camp just as they reached the spot they encountered monsieur sapinaud de la verrie he was riding at the head of about a hundred peasants all of whom were armed with muskets they had early that morning attacked the little town of herbiers it was defended by two companies of soldiers with four or five cannon and the republicans of the town had ranged themselves with the blues nevertheless the peasants led by their commander and his nephew had fearlessly attacked them and with a loss of only two or three wounded defeated the enemy and captured the place obtaining a sufficient supply of muskets to arm themselves  as jean martin was known to monsieur sapinaud they saluted each other cordially  so you are coming willingly monsieur martin there you have the advantage of me for these good fellows made me and my nephew come with them as their leaders and would take no refusal however they but drew us into the matter a few days earlier than we had intended for we had already made up our minds to join the movement  i come willingly enough monsieur sapinaud if i had remained in nantes i should have been guillotined by this time and i made up my mind when i left there that i would on the first opportunity do a little fighting before i was put an end to  this is my brotherinlaw he has been out here now nearly two years and has seen enough of the doings of the murderers at nantes to hate them as much as i do  the streets of the little village which cathelineau had made his headquarters were thronged with men through these the four mounted gentlemen made their way slowly until when they came to the church they saw three men standing apart from the others  that is cathelineau the one standing in the middle leigh said  we have come to place ourselves under your orders monsieur sapinaud said as they rode up to him and he named himself and his companions  i am glad indeed to see you sirs cathelineau said you are the first gentlemen who have joined us here though i hear that farther south some have already declared themselves we want you badly  one of you i have seen already and he smiled at leigh i told you that you would hear of me young sir and you see i have kept my word  these with me are stofflet who as you may have heard recaptured the cannon the blues took at clisson and foret who had the honour of striking the first blow at saint florent  your names are all widely known in this part monsieur sapinaud said courteously well sirs we have come to fight under your orders i have brought a hundred men with me and we have already done something on our own account for we last night captured herbiers which was defended by two companies with four cannon we have gained a sufficient number of muskets to arm all our party  if i do not offer to give up the leadership to you monsieur de la verrie cathelineau said gravely it is from no desire on my part to be a commander but i am widely known to the peasantry of many parishes round pin and perhaps because i understand them better than most they have confidence in me and would i think follow me rather than a gentleman like yourself of whom they know but little  they are quite right monsieur sapinaud said the peasantry commenced this war it is right that they should choose their own leaders you and your two companions have already their confidence and it is far better that you should be their leaders i believe all other gentlemen who join you will be as ready as we are to follow you and i am sure that the only rivalry will be as to who shall most bravely expose himself when he faces the enemy  i thank you sir cathelineau said i believe earnestly that in many respects it is best that the peasants should have their own leaders we can associate ourselves with their feelings better than the gentry could do we shall have more patience with their failings  you would want to make an army of them we know that this cannot be done they will fight and die as bravely as men could do but i know that they will never submit to discipline after a battle they will want to hurry off to their homes they will obey the order to fight but that is the only order one can rely upon their obeying  we are on the point of starting for chollet it is a town where the people are devoted to the cause of the convention at the last drawing for the militia they killed without any pretext a number of young men who had come unarmed into the town many inhabitants of adjoining parishes have been seized and thrown in prison charged only with being hostile to the convention and expressing horror at the murder of the king  the capture will produce an impression throughout the country they have three or four hundred dragoons there and yesterday we hear they called in the national guard from the villages round though scarce believing that we should venture to attack them your reinforcement of a hundred men all armed with muskets will be a very welcome one for they will hardly suspect that many of us have firearms however we had before your arrival three hundred who have so armed themselves through captures at saint florent and chemille  he now ordered the bell to be rung and as soon as its notes pealed out started followed at once by the crowd in the village without any sort of order or regularity jean and leigh continued to ride with monsieur de la verrie and his nephew  after some hours marching at two oclock in the afternoon they approached chollet on the way they received considerable reinforcements from the villages they passed through as soon as they approached the town they saw the dragoons pouring out followed by three or four hundred national guards  the vendeans now fell into some sort of order a short council of war was held it was arranged that monsieur de la verrie with his hundred musketeers and foret with as many more should advance against the dragoons while cathelineau and stofflet with a hundred musketeers and the main body of peasants with their pitchforks should attack the national guards  illustration at the first volley the colonel of the dragoons and many of his men fell  the dragoons had expected that the mere sight of them would be sufficient to send the peasants flying and they were amazed that they should continue to advance as soon as they were within easy range the peasants opened fire at the first volley the colonel of the dragoons and many of his men fell reloading the peasants advanced at a run poured in a volley at close quarters and then with loud cheers charged the dragoons  these being but newly raised troops were seized with a panic turned and galloped off at full speed astounded at the defeat of the cavalry in whom they had confidently trusted the national guard at once lost heart and as with loud shouts cathelineau with his peasants flung themselves upon them they too broke and fled in all directions  the peasants pursued them for a league and then returned exultant to chollet here the leading revolutionists were thrown in prison but with the exception of the national guards who attempted resistance after reaching the town no lives were taken a large quantity of arms money and ammunition fell into the hands of the victors  scarcely had the peasants gathered in chollet than the news arrived that the national guard of saumur were marching against them and cathelineau requested monsieur de la verrie and foret with their following to go out to meet them they marched away at once and met the enemy at vihiers  unprepared for an attack the national guard at once broke and fled throwing away their arms and abandoning their cannon among these was one taken from the chateau de richelieu it had been given by louis the thirteenth to the cardinal on the engraving with which it was nearly covered the peasants thought that they could make out an image of the virgin and so called it by her name with these trophies the party returned to chollet  the next day being saturday the little army dispersed the peasants making their way to their homes in order to spend easter there while cathelineau with only a small body remained at chollet from here messengers were sent to messieurs bonchamp delbee and dommaigneall officers who had served in the army but had retired when the revolution broke out cathelineau offered to share the command with them and entreated them to give their military knowledge and experience to the cause  all assented thus the force had the advantage from this time forward of being commanded by men who knew the business of war  leigh had started for home as soon as the national guards of saumur were defeated jean martin at cathelineaus request remaining with him in order to join some other gentlemen who had that day arrived in calling upon the three officers and inviting them to join cathelineau in the command  leighs sister ran out as he rode up to the house the news of the capture of chollet almost without loss had already spread and although surprised she felt no alarm at seeing leigh alone  i hear that you have taken chollet and defeated the dragoons and national guards  yes and this morning we put to flight the guards of saumur without the loss of a single man i dont know what it may come to presently but just now it can hardly be called fighting the sight of peasants rushing on seems to strike these heroes with a panic at once and they are off helter skelter throwing away their guns and ammunition  have you come home only to tell me the news leigh  i have come home because at present our army has evaporated into thin air tomorrow being easter sunday the peasants have all scattered to their homes so that it was of no use my staying at chollet cathelineau is there and the other leaders among them monsieur de la verrie a nephew of his jean and several other gentlemen who have just arrived there they are going as a sort of deputation tomorrow to bonchamp delbee and another officer whose name i forget to ask them to join cathelineau in the command i think that he will still remain as leader and that they will act as his councillors and in command of columns  then your impression of this man is confirmed  more than confirmed jean said this morning that he was a born leader of men while all round him there is excitement and confusion he is as calm and serene as if he were alone he is evidently a man who has read a good deal and thought a good deal and i can quite understand the influence he has gained over the peasantry in his neighbourhood and that it has long been their custom to refer all disputes to him  stofflet is a different sort of man he is tall and powerful in frame stern and almost morose in manner he has been sixteen years a soldier and was i hear distinguished for his bravery  and foret  he is an active young woodman evidently a determined fellow and as he was the first to lead the peasants against the blues he is sure to have a following they are three very different characters but all of them well fitted to act as peasant leaders  and will jean be a leader  not a leader patsey that is to say certainly not a general he does not want it himself but he will no doubt lead the peasants on the estate and perhaps those in the neighbourhood you know that he would not have the church bell rung when he started because he did not wish the tenants to join until he had seen the result of the first fight but when he comes home he will summon those who like to go with him  yes i have had to explain that over and over again yesterday and today almost all the men have been up here to ask why jean did not take them i told them that that was one reason and another was that had they started on foot when you did they would not have arrived in time to take part in the fight at chollet  the conversation begun as leigh dismounted had been continued in the house the groom having taken the horse round to the stable  so the peasants fought well leigh  they would have fought well if the blues had given them a chance but these would not stop till they came up to them if they had done so i am convinced that the peasants would have beaten them there was no mistaking the way they rushed forward and upon my word i am not surprised that the enemy gave way although well armed and not far inferior in numbers they would have had no chance with them  and did you rush forward leigh  we were with the party that attacked the cavalry jean and i fired our rifles twice and after that we only saw the backs of the cavalry if they had been welldrilled troops they ought to have scattered us like sheep for everything must have gone down before them had they charged there was no sort of order among us the men were not formed into companies there was no attempt to direct them each simply joined the leader he fancied and when the word was given charged forward at the top of his speed it is all very well against the national guards and these young troops but as jean said it would be a different affair altogether if we were to meet trained soldiers  but the peasants seem to be quick and i expect they will adopt tactics better suited to the country when they come to fighting in these lanes and woods you see so far a very small proportion have been armed with guns and their only chance was to rush at once to close quarters but we have captured so many muskets at chollet and vihiers that in future a considerable proportion of the peasants will have guns and when they once learn to use the hedges they will be just as good as trained troops  then i suppose jean is more hopeful about the future than he was  i dont say that patsey he thinks that we shall make a hard fight of it but that the end must depend upon whether the people in paris rather than keep fifty thousand men engaged in a desperate conflict here when they are badly wanted on the frontier decide to suspend the conscription in la vendee and to leave us to ourselves there can be no doubt that that would be their best plan but as they care nothing for human life even if it cost them a hundred thousand men to crush us they are likely to raise any number of troops and send them against us rather than allow their authority to be set at defiance  do you know patsey when i used to read about guy fawkes wanting to blow up the houses of parliament i thought that he must be a villain indeed to try to destroy so many lives but i have changed my opinion now for if i had a chance i would certainly blow up the place where the convention meets and destroy every soul within its walls including the spectators who fill the galleries and howl for blood  well you see leigh as guy fawkes and the other conspirators failed in their attempt i am afraid there is very small chance of your being able to carry out the plan more successfully  i am afraid there is not leigh said regretfully i should never be able to dig a way into the vaults and certainly i should not be able to get enough powder to blow a big building up if i could no i was only saying that if guy fawkes hated the parliament as much as i hate the convention there is some excuse to be made for him  now patsey i am as hungry as a hunter  i have a good supper ready for you she said i thought it was quite possible that you and jean would both come home this evening for i felt sure that most of the peasants would be coming back if possible for easter sunday and i had no doubt that if you did come you would both be hungry  have you any news from other districts he asked after he had finished his supper  there is a report that captain charette has gathered nearly twenty thousand peasants in lower poitou and that he has already gained a success over the blues there are reports too of risings in brittany  there is no doubt that things are going on well at present patsey you see we are fighting on our own ground and fifty thousand men can be called to arms in the course of a few hours by the ringing of the church bells we have no baggage no waggons no train of provisions we are ready to fight at once  on the other hand the blues have been taken completely by surprise they have no large force nearer than the frontier or at any rate nearer than paris and it will be weeks before they can gather an army such as even they must see will be required for the conquest of la vendee up to that time it can be only a war of skirmishes unless our leaders can persuade the peasants to march against paris and that i fear they will never be able to do  when the enemy are really ready the fighting will be desperate tis true that the vendeans have a good causethey fight for their religion and their freedom while the enemy will fight only because they are ordered to do so there is another thingevery victory we win will give us more arms ammunition and cannon while a defeat will mean simply that the peasants will scatter to their homes and be ready to answer the next call for their services on the other hand if the blues are defeated they will lose so heavily both in arms and stores and will suffer such loss of life from their ignorance of our roads and lanes that it will be a long time before they will again be able to advance against us  the next morning after the service at the church was over the peasants came down in numbers to the chateau to hear from leigh a full account of the fighting at chollet and vihiers a report of the latter event having arrived that morning there were exclamations of lively pleasure at the recital mingled with regret that they had not borne their share in the fighting  you will have plenty of opportunities leigh said monsieur martin has told me that when he next leaves home all who are willing to do so can go with him but it may be some little time before anything of importance takes place and as at present what fighting there is is a considerable distance away he thinks it best that you should reserve yourselves for some great occasion unless indeed the blues endeavour to penetrate the bocage when i have no doubt you will know how to deal with them when they are entangled in your lanes and woods  we will go every man of us one of the peasants shouted and the cry was reechoed with enthusiasm by the whole of the men  it was nearly an hour before leigh and his sister were able to withdraw from the crowd and make their way homeward  it is difficult to believe that men so ready and eager to fight can be beaten she said did you notice too that their wives all looked on approvingly i believe that even if any of the men wished to stay away they would be hounded to the front by the women i think that with them it would be regarded as a war for their religion while with the men it is the conscription that has chiefly driven them to take up arms    chapter 4 cathelineaus scouts   for some days nothing happened the insurrection spread like wildfire in poitou and anjou and everywhere the peasants were successful the authorities soldiers and gendarmes for the most part flying without waiting for an attack  the news that all la vendee was in insurrection astonished and infuriated the convention which at once took steps to suppress it on the second of april a military commission was appointed with power to execute all peasants taken with arms in their hands and all who should be denounced as suspicious persons general berruyer was sent down to take the command the large army that had been raised principally from the mob of paris for the defence of that city marched down and berruyer at the head of this force entered the bocage on the tenth of april  the time had passed quietly at the chateau the peasants had dispersed at once and except that the principal leaders and a small body of men remained together watching the course of events all was as quiet as if profound peace reigned  jean martin had returned home two days after arriving he had called all the tenants on the estate together and had endeavoured to rouse them to the necessity of acquiring a certain amount of discipline he had brought with him a waggon load of muskets and ammunition which had been discovered at chollet after the main bulk of the peasants had departed and cathelineau had allowed him to carry them off in order that the peasantry in the neighbourhood of the chateau should be provided with a proportion of guns when the day of action arrived the peasants gladly received the firearms but could not be persuaded to endeavour to fight in any sort of order  they did not do it at chollet or elsewhere they exclaimed and yet they beat the blues easily what good did discipline do to the enemy none why then should we bother ourselves about it when the enemy comes we will rush upon them when they are tangled in our thickets  leigh was somewhat more successful the fact that he had fought at chollet and was their seigneurs brotherinlaw had established a position for him in the eyes of peasants of his own age and as he went from house to house talking with them he succeeded in getting some twenty boys to agree to follow him he had been nominated an officer by the three generals who had picked out without reference to rank or age those who they thought would either from position energy or determination fill the posts well thus one company was commanded by a noble the next by a peasant and each would on the day of battle fight equally well  leighs arguments were such as were suited to the lads he addressed  you see if you go with the bands of men you will be lost in the crowd the men will rush forward in front you will all be in the rear you want to serve your country well you can serve it much better by watching the movements of the enemy and carrying word of it to the commander then sometimes we can have a little enterprise of our owncut off a post of the enemy or manage to decoy them into lanes where we know their guns will stick fast  it is not size and strength that are most necessary in war but quickness alertness and watchfulness you know that already the leaders have found that nothing can persuade the men to keep guard or to carry out outpost duty if we do this even if we do nothing else we shall be serving the cause much better than if we were to join in a general rush upon the enemy  but we shall have no muskets with us one of the boys objected  nor would you want them you would have to move about quickly and guns would be terribly inconvenient if you had to push your way through a hedge or a close thicket and besides if you had guns they would not be of much use to you for none of you are accustomed to their use and it needs a great deal of training to learn to shoot straight  i am quite sure that if i were to march with twenty of you to cathelineaus headquarters and were to say to him we have come here sir to act as scouts for you to bring you in news of the movements of the enemy and to do anything in our power to prevent you from being surprised he would be more pleased than if i had brought him a hundred men armed with muskets  when twenty had expressed their willingness to go leigh asked jean who had warmly entered into the plan to speak to the fathers of the lads and get them to consent to their going with him he accordingly called them together for that purpose  but do you mean that they will be away altogether master  yes while this goes on  but we shall lose their labour in the fields  there will not be much labour in the fields till this is over and by having scouts watching the enemy you will get early news of their coming and have time to drive off your beasts before they arrive  but how will they live  when they are in this neighbourhood one or two can come back and fetch bread if they are too far off for that my brother will buy bread for them in cases where they cannot well be spared i will remit a portion of your dues as long as they are away but this will not be for long for i can see that ere many weeks are past the blues will be swarming round in such numbers that there will be little time for work on your land and you will all have to make great sacrifices  you must remember that the less there is in your barns the more difficult it will be for an enemy to invade you for if they can find nothing here they will have to bring everything with them and every waggon will add to their difficulties my brother tells me that one of the things he means to do is to break up the roads when he finds out by which line the blues are advancing and for that purpose i shall serve out from my store either a pick or an axe to each of the band  at last all difficulties were got over and twenty lads were enrolled another three weeks passed the peasants of poitou and anjou thought but little of the storm that was gathering round them  general berruyer had arrived from paris with his army a portion of the army from brest moved down to nantes and were in concert with the army of la rochelle to sweep that part of la vendee bordering on the coast general canclaus was at nantes with two thousand troops general dayat was sent to niort with six thousand men and was to defend the line between sables and saint gilles bressuire was occupied by general quetineau with three thousand men leigonyer with from four to five thousand men occupied vihiers while saint lambert was held by ladouce with two thousand five hundred the right bank of the loire between nantes and angers was held by fifteen hundred men of the national guard  thus that part of upper poitou where the rising had been most successful was surrounded by a cordon of troops which the convention hoped and believed would easily stamp out the insurrection and take a terrible vengeance for what had passed  when the storm would burst none knew but jean one day said to leigh that it was certain that it must come soon and that if he was still resolved to carry out his plan it was time that he set out  i am quite ready to carry out my plans jean as you know but dangers seem to threaten from so many quarters that i dont like going away from home while my company are scattered near chollet for instance the blues may be burning down your chateau  i dont think there is much danger of that leigh it is quite certain that as soon as these divisions begin to move they will have their hands full we may hope that in some cases they will be defeated in others they may drive off the peasants and march to the town that they intend to occupy but they will only hold the ground they stand upon they will not be able to send out detached parties to attack chateaux or destroy villages  for the present i have no fear whatever of their coming here we are well away from any of the roads that they are likely to march by i dont say that any of the roads are good but they will assuredly keep on the principal lines and not venture to entangle themselves in our country lanes there are no villages of any size within miles of us and this is one of the most thickly wooded parts of the bocagewhich as you know means the thickettherefore i shall when the time comes leave your sister without uneasiness we may be quite sure that if contrary to my anticipation any column should try to make its way through this neighbourhood it would be hotly opposed and she will have ample time to take to the woods where she and the child will find shelter in any of the foresters cottages  she is going to have peasant dresses made for her and marthe she will of course drive as we intended and the two men will take the horse and vehicle to some place in the woods at a considerable distance from here and keep it there until we join her and carry out our original plan of making for the coast directly you are gone i shall make it my business to find out the most out of the way spot among the woods and ride over and make an arrangement with some woodman with a wife and family living there to receive her if necessary and i will let you know the spot fixed on and give you directions how to find it  in order to add to leighs influence and authority martin persuaded the village curewho was a man of much intelligence and perceived that real good might be done by this party of ladsto have a farewell service in the church accordingly on the morning on which they were to start all attended the church which was filled by their friends and here he addressed the boys telling them that the service in which they were about to engage was one that would be of great importance to their country and that it would demand all their energy and strength he then asked them to take an oath to carry out all orders they might receive from their leader the seigneurs brother who would himself share in their work and the many hardships they might have to undergo  here he said is a gentleman who is by birth a foreigner but who has come to love the land that his sister adopted as her own and to hate its enemiesthese godless murderers of women and children these executioners of their king these enemies of the churchso much that he is ready to leave his home and all his comforts and to risk his life in its cause remember that you have voluntarily joined him and accepted him as your leader the work once begun there must be no drawing back there is not a man in la vendee who is not prepared to give his life if need be to the cause and you in your way can do as much or more  he then administered an oath to each lad and as had been arranged leigh also took an oath to care for them in every respect and to share their risks and dangers then the cure pronounced his blessing upon them and the service ended  very greatly impressed with what had taken place the little band marched out from the church surrounded by their friends jean martin then presented hatchets or light picks to each and a waist belt in which the tools should be carried as a rule the peasants carried leathern belts over the shoulders in which a sword hatchet or other weapon was slung but jean thought the waist belt would be much more convenient for getting rapidly through hedges or thickets and it had also the advantage that a long knife constituting in itself a formidable weapon could also be carried in it  patsey presented them each with a hat of which a supply had been obtained from saint florent these were of the kind ordinarily worn by the peasants in shape like the modern broadbrimmed wideawake but made of much stiffer material she had bought these to give a certain uniformity to the band of whom some already wore hats of this kind others long knitted stocking caps while others again were bare headed  she added a piece of green ribbon round each hat leigh objected to this on the ground that they might sometimes have to enter towns and that any badge of this sort would be speedily noticed but as she said they would only have to take them off when engaged in such service  a quarter of an hour after leaving the church they marched away amid the acclamations of their friends each boy feeling a sensation of pride in the work that he had undertaken and in the ceremony of which he had been the centre  now lads leigh said as soon as they were fairly away from the village instead of walking along as a loose body you had better form four abreast and endeavour to keep step it is no more difficult to walk that way than in a clump and indeed by keeping step it makes the walking easy and it has the advantage that you can act much more quickly if we heard an enemy approaching and i gave the order ten go to the right and ten go to the left you would not know which were to go  now each four of you will form a section and the order into which you fall now you will always observe then if i say first two sections to the right the other three sections to the left every one of you knows what to do instead of having to wait until i mention all your names  this is nearly all the drill you will have to learn you can choose your places now but afterwards you will have to keep to them so those of you who are brothers and special friends will naturally fall in next to each other  in a minute or two the arrangements were made and the party proceeded four abreast with leigh marching at their head for the first hour or so he had some difficulty in getting them to keep step but they presently fell into it time being kept by breaking into one of the canticles of the church  after a long days march they arrived at the village which cathelineau now occupied as his headquarters as it had been necessary in view of the threatening circle of the various columns of the enemy to remove the headquarters from chollet to a central point from which he could advance at once against whichever of these columns might first move forward into the heart of the country the lads all straightened themselves up as they marched through the streets the unwonted spectacle of twenty peasant lads marching in order exciting considerable surprise cathelineau was standing at the door of the house he occupied conversing with messieurs bonchamp and delbee  ah monsieur stansfield he said is it you as leigh halted his party and raised his hat you are the most militarylooking party i have yet seen they are young but none the worse for that  there is nothing military about them except that they march four abreast he said with a smile but for the work we have come to do drill will not be necessary i have raised this band on jean martins estate sir and with your permission i propose to call them cathelineaus scouts it seemed to my brother and myself that you sorely need scouts to inform you of the movements of the enemy the roads by which they are approaching their force and order i have therefore raised this little body of lads of my own age they will remain with me permanently as long as the occasion needs they will go on any special mission with which you may charge them and will at other times watch all the roads by which an enemy would be likely to advance  if they will do that monsieur stansfield they will be valuable indeed that is just what i cannot get the peasants to do when it comes to fighting they will obey orders but at all other times they regard themselves as their own masters and neither entreaties nor the offer of pay suffices to persuade them to undertake such work as you are proposing to carry out consequently it is only by chance that we obtain any news of the enemys movements i wish we had fifty such parties  they would be valuable indeed monsieur delbee said the obstinacy of the peasantry is maddening  how do you propose to feed your men  when we are within reach of their homes two will go back to fetch bread for the whole when we are too far away i shall buy it in one of the villages  when you are within reach of my headquarters wherever that may be you have only to send in and they shall have the loaves served out to them the same as the band who remain here we are not short of money thanks to the captures we have made  i see that none of your band have firearms  no sir jean martin would have let me have some of the muskets he brought from here but it seemed to me that they would be an encumbrance we may have to trust to our swiftness of foot to escape and at any rate we shall want to carry messages to you as quickly as possible the weight of a gun and ammunition would make a good deal of difference and would moreover be in our way in getting through the woods and hedges  but for all that you ought to have some defence cathelineau said and if you came upon a patrol of cavalry though only three or four in number you would be in a bad case with only those knives to defend yourselves  do you know whether there are any pistols in the storehouse monsieur bonchamp  yes there are some that were picked up from the cavalrymen we killed they have not been given out yet  then i think we had better serve out a pistol with a score of cartridges to each of these lads  if you let them fire three or four rounds at the trunk of a tree or some mark of that sort monsieur stansfield they will get to know something about the use of the weapons  thank you sir that would be excellent and would certainly enable us to face a small party of the enemy if we happen to encounter them  please form the boys up two deep cathelineau said i will say a word or two to them  the manoeuvre was not executed in military style but the boys were presently arranged in order  i congratulate you lads cathelineau went on in having devoted yourselves to your country and that in a direction that will be most useful i trust that you will strictly obey the orders of your commander and will remember that you will be of far more use in carrying them out than in merely helping to swell the number in a pitched battle i have every confidence in monsieur stansfield he has set a noble example to the youths of this country in thus undertaking arduous and fatiguing work which is not without its dangers  i was glad to see that you marched in here in order i hope that you will go a little further and learn to form line quickly and to gather at his call these things may seem to you to make very little difference but in fact will make a great deal you saw that you were at least a couple of minutes forming in line just now supposing the enemys cavalry had been charging down upon you that two minutes lost would have made all the difference between your receiving them in order or being in helpless confusion when they came up  i have no doubt that one of my generals here has among his followers someone who served in the army and who will teach you within the course of an hour if you pay attention to his instructions how to form into line and back again into fours  i will give them an hour myself monsieur bonchamp said i have nothing particular to do and should be glad to instruct young fellows who are so willing and well disposed  are you too tired to drill now you have had a long march  a general negative was the reply  well then march to the open space just outside the town and we will begin at once  feeling very proud of the honour of being drilled by a general the boys fell into their formation and followed monsieur bonchamp and leigh they were at a loss at first to comprehend the instructions given them but by the end of an hour they had fairly mastered the very simple movement  that will do monsieur bonchamp said of course you are not perfect yet but with a quarter of an hours drill by your commander every day at the end of a week you will be able to do it quickly and neatly and you will certainly find it a great advantage if you come upon the enemy  a large empty room was allotted to them and as they sat down on the floor and munched the bread that they had brought with them they felt quite enthusiastic over their work it was a high honour indeed to have been praised by monsieur cathelineau and been taught by one of his generals they even felt the advantage that the drill had given them contrasting the quickness with which they had finally formed into line with their trouble in arranging themselves before monsieur cathelineau the fact too that they were next morning to be furnished with pistols was a great gratification to them and over and over again they said to each other  what will the people at home say when they hear that monsieur cathelineau has praised us that monsieur bonchamp himself has drilled us and that we are to be provided with pistols  in the morning the pistols and ammunition were served out leigh had during the previous evening seen cathelineau and asked for orders  i cannot say exactly the line the blues are likely to take i should say that you had better make chemille your headquarters berruyer who is their new commander has arrived at saint lambert there is a strong force at thouars being a portion of the army from saint lambert the enemy are also in force at vihiers and at parthenay  it is from the forces at thouars and vihiers that danger is most likely to come doubtless other columns will come from the north but we shall hear of their having crossed the loire in time to oppose them and with so small a band as yours you will be amply employed in watching thouars there are many roads all more or less bad by which they may march as soon as you ascertain that they are moving and by which route you will send a messenger to me  any others of your band that you may have with you send off to all the villages round give them warning set the bells ringing promise that aid will soon arrive and urge them to harass the enemy to fell trees across the road and to impede their advance in every possible way  i will give you half a dozen papers for the use of yourself and your messengers saying that you are acting under my orders and are charged with raising the country directly the enemy advance but above all it is important that i should get the earliest possible information as to the route by which they are moving as it will take us thirtysix hours before we can gather in anything like our full strength  it will be useful that you should spread false news as to our whereabouts your boys can say in one village that we are marching towards tours in another that we are massed in the neighbourhood of saint florent in a third that they hear that the order is that all ablebodied men are to go west to oppose the force coming from nantes which has already taken clisson and carried monsieur de lescure and his family prisoners to bressuire  we shall have to tell the villagers sir that we wish this news to be given to the blues if they should come there or if questioned they would tell them something else i am sure that even the women would suffer themselves to be killed rather than give any news that they thought would be useful to the enemy  you are right yes you must tell them that this is what we want the blues to believe and that it is my wish that these are the answers to be given to any of them who may enter the village  the only thing sir is that they may find the villages empty as they come along the women and children will no doubt take to the woods the men will perhaps offer some resistance but when they find how strong the blues are will probably hurry to join you  there will probably be a few old people remaining in each village however we must trust much to chance the great thing is for you to let me know as soon as their main body is in motion whichever way they come we must meet and attack them it is in the woods and lanes that we must defend ourselves  i will endeavour to carry out your orders sir and shall start tomorrow morning as soon as we get our pistols  as soon as the little band was well away from the town the pistols were loaded and each of the lads in turn fired three shots at the trunk of a tree at a distance of ten yards under leighs directions the shooting was quite as good as he had expected and the boys themselves were well satisfied  then the pistols being reloaded and placed in their belts they resumed their march they halted at a tiny hamlet consisting of half a dozen houses four miles from thouars the inhabitants were greatly surprised at their appearance and an old man who was the head of the little community came out and asked leigh who they were  we are cathelineaus scouts he replied we have orders to watch the movements of the enemy we wish to be of no trouble if there is an empty shed we should be glad of it still more so if there is a truss or two of straw  these you can have the old man said if cathelineaus orders had been that we were to turn out of our houses for you we should have done so willingly  a shed will do excellently for us we shall be here but little half our number will always be away if you can supply us with bread i will pay you for it if you cannot do so i shall have to send two of my party away every day to fetch bread from cathelineaus camp  i will see what can be done it will not be for long  no it may possibly be only two or three days and it may be a week  then i think that we can manage if we have not flour enough here to spare i can take my horse and fetch half a sackful from some other village  thank you very much however i think that we shall only occasionally want bread for i shall be sending messengers every day to monsieur cathelineau and these can always bring bread back with them  the old man led them to a building which had served as a stable but which was then untenanted  i will get some straw taken in presently lads  as for you sir i shall be glad if you will be my guest  i thank you leigh said but i prefer to be with my followers they come by my persuasion and i wish to share their lot in all things besides my being with them will keep up their spirits  there was half an hours drill and then leigh led the party to the shed to which four or five bundles of straw had by this time been brought  now he said before we do anything else we must choose two subofficers at times we may divide into two parties and therefore it is necessary that one should be responsible to me for what is done in my absence  i will leave it to you to choose them remember it is not size and strength that are of most importance it is quickness and intelligence you know your comrades better than i do and i shall be quite content to abide by your choice i will go outside for a quarter of an hour while you talk it over i dont want to influence you at all  in ten minutes two of the lads came out  we have chosen andre favras and pierre landrin  i think that you have done very wisely leigh said those are the two whom i myself should have selected  he had indeed noticed them as the two most intelligent of the party they had been his first recruits and it was in no small degree owing to their influence that the others had joined him he returned to the shed  i approve of your choice lads he said no doubt andre and pierre will make very good subofficers when i am not present you must obey their orders as readily as you do mine and i shall be able to trust them to carry out my directions implicitly  now you will divide in two parties the first two sections and two of the third section will form one party and will be under andres command when acting in two parties the other two of the third section and the fourth and fifth will form the second division under pierre you will take it in turns to be on duty we shall not need to watch by night for there is no chance of the enemy venturing to enter our lanes and thickets after dark the party not out on scouting duty will remain here and will furnish messengers to carry news to cathelineau to fetch bread or to perform other duties  the next morning leigh set out with the whole band except two he had gathered from the people of the village the position of the various roads and lanes by which troops going westward from thouars would be likely to travel when within two miles of the town he placed two boys on each of these roads they were not to show themselves but were to lie behind the hedges and if they saw any body of troops coming along were at once to bring news to him his own point being on the principal road  andre and pierre were to leave their arms and belts behind them to make a long detour and to enter the town from the other side they were to saunter about the place listen to what was being said and gather as much news as possible each was provided with two francs and if questioned they were to say that they had come in from some village near to buy an axe  i should have gone in myself andre but although i can get on fairly enough in your patois i cannot speak it well enough to pass as a native however you are not likely to be questioned in a town crowded with troops two lads can move about without attracting the smallest attention from the military it would be only the civilian authorities that you would have to fear but these will be so much occupied in attending to the wants of the soldiers that they will not have any time on their hands for asking questions  be sure before you enter the town that you find out the name of some village three or four miles on the other side so as to have an answer ready if you are asked where you come from  it is probable that you will find troops quartered in all the villages beyond the town which could hardly accommodate so large a number as are there remember you must try to look absolutely unconcerned as you go through them and as you walk about the streets of the town the great object is to find out how many men there are in and around thouars whether they are looking for more troops to join them from saumur and when they are expecting to move forward  as soon as they had left he repeated to the six lads who remained with him the orders that he had given to those posted on the other roads  you are to remain in hiding he said whatever the force may be it is likely enough that patrols of four or five men may come along to see that the roads are clear and that there are no signs of any bodies being gathered to oppose their advance it is quite true that we might shoot down and overpower any such patrols but we must not attempt to do so if one of them escaped he would carry the news to thouars that the roads were beset this would put them on their guarddoubtless they imagine that with such a force as they have gathered they will march through la vendee without oppositionand they would adopt such precautions at to render it far more difficult than it otherwise would be to check their advance when it begins in earnest we are here only to watch we shall have opportunities for fighting later on  this is a good spot for watching for we have a thick wood behind us and plenty of undergrowth along its edge by the road where we can hide so closely that there will not be the slightest chance of our being discovered if we do but keep absolutely quiet  three or four times during the day indeed cavalry parties passed along the road they did not appear to have any fear of an attack but laughed and jested at the work they had come to do scoffed at the idea of the peasants venturing to oppose such forces as had gathered against them and discussed the chances of booty one party of four men and an old sergeant pulled up and dismounted close to the spot where the lads where hidden  it is all very well comrades their leader said but for my part i would rather be on the frontier fighting the austrians that is work for soldiers here we are to fight frenchmen like ourselves poor chaps who have done no harm except that they stick to their clergy and object to be dragged away from their homes i am no politician and i dont care a snap for the doings of the assembly in parisi am a soldier and have learned to obey orders whatever they arebut i dont like this job we have in hand which mind you is bound to be a good deal harder than most of you expect it is true that they say there are twenty thousand troops round the provincebut what sort of troops there are not five thousand soldiers among them the others are either national guards or newlyraised levies or those blackguards from the slums of paris of the national guards i should say half would desert if they only had the chance and the new levies cant be counted on    chapter 5 checking the enemy   you see leigh said when the patrol had ridden on the real soldiers do not like the work they are called upon to do and they have no belief in the national guards or in the new levies it will make all the difference in their own fighting when they know that they cannot rely upon some of the troops working with them i have no doubt that what they say of the national guards is true they have had to come out because they are summoned but they can have no interest in the war against us and doubtless many of them hate the government in paris just as much as we do and would give a great deal to be back again with their homes and families it is just as hard for them to be obliged to fight us as it is for us to be obliged to fight them  it was late in the afternoon before andre and pierre returned by the time they did so the various cavalry patrols had all gone back to thouars from time to time boys had come in from the other roads one or two patrols only had gone out by each of the lanes on which they were posted it was evident that the main road was considered of the most importance and it was probable that the greater portion of the enemys force would move by it  well what is your news leigh asked as his two lieutenants came down from the wood behind i hope all has gone well with you  yes captain andre replied we have had no difficulty the troops in the villages on the other side of the town did not even glance at us as we went through supposing no doubt that we belonged to the place thouars was crowded with soldiers and we heard that two thousand more are to arrive from saumur this evening we heard one of the officers say that orders were expected for a forward movement tomorrow and that all the other columns were to move at the same time and three of them were to meet at chemille  that is enough for the present andre you have both done very well to pick up so much news as that we will be off at once  messengers were at once sent off to order in the other parties and as soon as these joined they returned to the village where they passed the night on arriving there leigh wrote a report of the news that he had gathered and sent off one of the band who had remained all day in the village to cathelineau and the other to monsieur delbee at chollet  the next days watch passed like the first two or three officers however trotted along the main road with a squadron of cavalry and rode to within a few miles of chemille and then returned to thouars  the next morning leigh and his band were out before daybreak and making their way to within a short distance of thouars heard drums beating and trumpets sounding there was no doubt that the force there was getting into motion the band at once dispersed carrying the news not only to every village along the road warning the women and children to take to the woods and the men to prepare for the passage of the enemy but to all the villages within two or three miles of the road ordering the church bells to be sounded to call the peasants to arms while two lads started to carry the news to cathelineau and delbee when once the bells of the churches near the road were set ringing they were speedily echoed by those of the villages beyond until the entire district knew that the enemy were advancing  on the way from chemille leigh had kept a sharp lookout for points where an enemy might be checked and had fixed upon one about halfway between the two towns a stream some four feet in depth passed under a bridge where the road dipped into a hollow beyond this the ground rose steeply and was covered with a thick wood of very considerable extent as soon as he reached this point he set his band to work to destroy the bridge as groups of peasants came flocking along and saw what was intended they at once joined in the work  as soon at it was done leigh led them to the spot where the forest began some thirty yards up the hill and set them to fell trees this was work to which all were accustomed and as many of them carried axes the trees nearest to the road were felled to fall across it while on each side facing the stream they were cut so as to fall down the slope and so form an abattis  before the work was finished to a distance of two or three hundred yards on each side of the road several hundred peasants had come up of these about a third were armed with muskets seeing the advantage of the position and that in case it was forced the forest offered them a means of retreat all prepared for a desperate resistance the men with firearms were placed in the front rank those with pitchforks and other rural weapons were to keep at work till the last moment cutting underwood and filling the interstices between the boughs of the fallen trees so as to make it extremely difficult to force they were ordered to withdraw when the fight began to a distance of two or three hundred yards and then to lie down in any inequalities of the ground so as to be safe from cannon shot only when the defenders of the abattis were forced back were they to prepare to charge  a young fellow with a cow horn took his place by leighs side when he blew his horn the front rank were to run back and the reserve to come forward to meet them and then they were to rush down again upon their assailants who had passed the abattis and to hurl them into the stream  the peasants all recognized the advantages of these arrangements those who had come first had found leigh in command and by the readiness with which he was obeyed by his own followers saw at once that he was in authority as others came up he showed them cathelineaus circular these recognized its order and informed the later arrivals that the young officer who was giving orders was specially empowered by cathelineau to take command and leigh was as promptly obeyed as if he had been their favourite leader himself they saw too that he knew exactly what he wanted done and gave every order with firmness and decision and their confidence in him became profound  it was three hours after he arrived at the river when a party of horse came down the opposite slope leigh had ordered that not a shot was to be fired until he gave the signal he waited until the enemy came to the severed bridge when they halted suddenly and as they did so he gave the word and from the long line of greenery fifty muskets flashed out more than half the troop of horse fell and the rest turning tail galloped up the hill again while a shout of derision rose from the peasants  illustration a scattered fire broke out from the defenders  half an hour passed then the head of the column was seen descending the road it opened out as it came forming into a thick line of skirmishers some two hundred yards wide moving along leigh spread the musketeers to a similar length of front at first the enemy were half hidden by the wood at the other side of the slope but as they issued from this some twenty yards from the stream a scattered fire broke out from the defenders  the blues replied with a general discharge at their invisible foes but these were crouching behind the stumps or trunks of the felled trees and the fire was ineffectual leighs own band were lying in a little hollow twenty yards behind the abattis their pistols would have been useless until the enemy won their way up to the trees and until then they were to remain as a first reserve  exposed as they were to the steady fire of the peasants the assailants suffered heavily and at the edge of the stream paused irresolutely it was some fifteen yards wide but they were ignorant of the depth and hesitated to enter it urged however by the shouts of their officers who set the example by at once entering the stream and by seeing that the water did not rise above their shoulders the men followed but as they gained the opposite bank they fell fast at so short a distance every shot of the peasants told and it was some time before a sufficient number had crossed to make an assault against the wall of foliage in their front  fresh troops were constantly arriving from behind and encouraged by this they at last rushed forward as they did so leigh called up his own band and these crawling forward through the tangle as far as they could opened fire on the enemy as they strove to push their way through the obstacle  for a quarter of an hour the fight went on then the assailants having with great loss succeeded in passing over or pulling aside the brushwood began to pour through the moment they did so leighs horn sounded and at once the defenders rushed up the hill pursued by the blues with exulting shouts but few shots were fired for the assailants had emptied their muskets before striving to pass through the obstacle  leigh and his men had run but a hundred yards into the wood when they met the main body of the peasants rushing down at full speed turning at once his party joined them and fell upon the advancing enemy taken wholly by surprise when they believed that victory was won the two or three hundred men who had passed the abattis were swept before the crowd of peasants like chaff the latter pressing close upon their heels followed them through the gaps that had been made  the panic of the fugitives spread at once to those who had crossed the river and were clustered round the openings jostling in their eagerness to get through and join as they believed in the slaughter of those who had caused them such heavy loss and all fled together the peasants were at their heels making deadly use of their pitchforks axes and knives and drove the survivors headlong into the river the horn again sounded and in accordance with the strict orders that they had received they ran back again to their shelter a few dropping from the scattered fire that the troops on the other side of the stream opened against them as soon as the fugitives had cleared away from their front  scarcely had the peasants gained the shelter when six pieces of cannon that had been placed on the opposite slope while the fight was going on opened against them  leigh at once ordered the main body back to their former position scattering his hundred men with guns along the whole line of abattis whence they again opened fire on the troops on the opposite side of the river these replied with volleys of musketry but the defenders stationed as they were five or six yards apart and sheltering behind the trees suffered but little either from the artillery or musketry fire while men dropped fast in the ranks of the blues  the cannon were principally directed against the trees blocking the road gradually these were torn to pieces and after an hours firing were so far destroyed that a passage through them was comparatively easy then the enemy again began to cross the stream  as soon as they commenced to do so leigh called up the men with muskets from each flank and sent word to the main body to descend the hill again as the cannonade would cease as soon as the attack began three times the assault was made and repulsed the peasants fighting with a fury that the blues already disheartened with their heavy losses could not withstand as they fell back for the third time leigh thought that enough had been done and ordered the peasants at once to make through the woods and to proceed bylanes and byways to join cathelineau who he doubted not would by this time have gathered a considerable force at chemille  by the time that the blues were ready to advance again this time in overwhelming force the peasants were well away the wounded as fast as they fell had been carried off to distant villages and when the enemy advanced they found to their surprise that their foes had disappeared and that only some thirty dead bodies remained on the scene of battle  their own loss had exceeded three hundred a large proportion of whom were regular soldiers and the national guards and the new levies were profoundly depressed at the result of the action  if they said to themselves what must have been but a comparatively small number of peasants have caused this loss what will it be when we meet cathelineaus main body  there was no thought of pursuit a regiment was thrown out in skirmishing order and advanced through the wood the rest following in column along the road general berruyer had joined general menou the evening before with the force from saumur and as they moved forward the two generals rode together  this is a much more serious business than i had expected berruyer said i certainly imagined that with such forces as we have gathered round la vendee the campaign would be little more than a military promenade i see however that i was entirely mistaken these men have today shown themselves capable of taking advantage of the wild character of their country and as to their courage there can be no question whatever if this is a fair sample of the resistance that we have to expect throughout the whole country we shall need at least fifty thousand men to subdue them  fully that menou said shortly there is no doubt that we blame the national guards who were so easily routed by the peasants on the tenth of march more severely than they deserve i rode forward to encourage the men at their last attack i never saw soldiers fight with such fury as did these peasants they threw themselves on the troops like tigers in many cases wresting their arms from them and braining them with their own muskets even our best soldiers seemed cowed by the fierceness with which they were attacked and as for the men of the new levies they were worse than useless and their efforts to force their way to the rear blocked the way of the reinforcements who were trying though i must own not very vigorously to get to the front  the peasants were well led too and acting on an excellent plan of defence they must have been sheltered altogether from our fire for among the dead i did not see one who had been killed by a cannonball the country must possess hundreds of points equally well adapted for defence and if these are as well and obstinately held as this has been it will take even more than fifty thousand men to suppress the insurrection  the convention is going to work the wrong way berruyer said the commissioners have orders to hang every peasant found in arms and every suspect that is to say virtually every one in la vendee it would have been infinitely better for them to have issued a general amnesty to acknowledge that they themselves have made a mistake that the cures of poitou and brittany should be excepted from the general law and allowed to continue their work in their respective parishes without interruption and that for a year at least this part of france should be exempt from conscription why if this campaign goes on a far larger force will be employed here than the number of troops which the district was called upon to contribute to say nothing of the enormous expense and loss of men  it is a hideous business altogether to my mind i would give all i possess to be recalled and sent to fight on the frontier  two hours after the fight leigh with his band of whom none had been killed although several had received wounds more or less serious arrived at chemille they had been preceded by many of the peasants who had already carried the news of the fight and that the column from thouars had been delayed for three hours and had suffered very heavy losses  it was all owing monsieur cathelineau the head of one of the peasant bands said to the officer you sent to command us he was splendid it was to him that everything was due he was cutting down the bridge when we came up and it was by his orders that we felled the trees and blocked the road and made a sort of hedge that took them so long to get through we should have been greatly damaged by the fire of their guns and muskets but he kept us all lying down out of reach till we were wanted while the men with the guns defended the line of fallen trees when we were wanted he called us up by blowing a cow horn and then we drove the blues back into the stream and returned to our shelter until we were wanted again  we did not lose more than thirty men altogether while more than ten times that number of the blues have fallen we thought at first that you had chosen rather a strange leader for us but as always you were right for if you had been there yourself things could not have gone better  but i sent no one as your commander cathelineau said in surprise  he had a paper that he read out saying that he was acting on your orders as i cannot read i cannot say that it was written down as he read it but if you did not send him god must have done so  it is strange bonchamp cathelineau said to that officer for i certainly did not send anyone i never thought of defending the passage of that stream however whoever it is who has commanded has done us great service for that three hours which have been gained will make all the difference they cannot arrive now until after dark and will not attack before morning and by that time our force will have doubled  here comes our officer monsieur the peasant exclaimed as leigh with his party came down the street loudly cheered by the peasants who had fought under him  why it is jean martins young brotherinlaw monsieur bonchamp exclaimed and raising his voice he called to jean who was talking to a group of other officers near  jean ran up  monsieur martin it is your young englishman who has held berruyer in check for three hours see how the peasants are cheering him  cathelineau advanced to meet leigh who halted his band and saluted the general the latter stepped forward and returned the salute by lifting his hat  monsieur stansfield he said i salute you as the saviour of our position here had berruyer arrived this afternoon we must have retired for we are not yet in sufficient force to withstand his attack tomorrow we shall i hope be strong enough to beat him i have been wondering who this officer could be who with but three or four hundred men held the principal force of our foes led by their commanderinchief in check for three hours and as i hear killed three hundred of his best troops with a loss of but thirty of ours i ought to have thought of you when they said that you read them an order saying that you were acting in my name  it was great presumption on my part general leigh said and i know that i had no right to use it for such a purpose but i felt how important it was that you should have time to prepare for defence and i thought it my duty as there was no one else to take the matter in hand to do so myself  you have done magnificently sir and the thanks of all la vendee are due to you  i see that several of your lads are wounded for five of them wore bandages and a sixth was carried on a rough litter by four of his companions lads he said i salute you you have done well indeed and there is not a boy of your age in la vendee but will envy you when he hears how you under your brave young commander have today played the chief part in checking the advance of an army of five thousand men i shall publish an order today saying that my scouts have rendered an inestimable service to their country  well leigh jean martin said after the little band had fallen out and one of the surgeons had taken charge of the wounded you have indeed distinguished yourself i certainly did not think when i persuaded your sister to let you go that you were going to match yourself against the french general and to command a force which should inflict a heavy check upon him cathelineau has asked me to bring you round to his quarters presently so that you can give him the full details of the affair saying that a plan that had succeeded so well might be tried again with equal effect i cannot stay with you now for i am going with bonchamp to see to the work of loopholing and fortifying the church  i am going to look after my boys jean they have had nothing to eat this morning except a mouthful or two of bread each and they have been up since two hours before daylight do you feel sure that the blues will not attack tonight  yes i think so after the lesson you have given berruyer of the fighting qualities of the peasants it is pretty certain that he will not venture to attack us after a hard days march and a fight that must have sorely discouraged his men  that evening news came in from several quarters leigonyer had marched from vihiers by three roads directing his course towards coron two of the columns had been attacked by the peasants and being largely composed of new levies had at once lost heart and retreated the central column in which were the regular troops being obliged in consequence also to fall back another column had crossed the loire and taken saint florent without any very heavy fighting and quetineau had advanced from bressuire to aubiers without meeting with resistance  the news was on the whole satisfactory it had been feared that the force at vihiers would march north and join that of berruyer and that they would make a joint attack upon the town the disaster that had befallen them rendered this no longer possible there was disappointment that saint florent had been recaptured but none that quetineau had advanced without opposition to aubiers for the whole of the peasantry from that locality were with cathelineau  in point of fact berruyer had not ordered the force at vihiers to march to join him on the contrary he had intended after capturing chemille which he expected to do without serious trouble to march south and effect a junction with leigonyer at coron he halted four miles from chemille harangued the new levies reproaching those who had shown cowardice during the days fighting and exhorting them to behave with courage on the following day no inconsiderable portion of them belonged to the force that had marched down from paris and these heroes of the slums who had been foremost in the massacres in the prisons and in their demand for the blood of all hostile to them behaved throughout with abject cowardice whenever they met a foe with arms in their hands  after having had an interview with cathelineau and relating to him full particulars of the fight leigh having nothing to do strolled about the town presently he came upon a group of three or four peasants who had been drinking more than was good for them one of them whose bearing and appearance showed that he had served in the army was talking noisily to the others  you will see that i jacques bruno artilleryman will be a great man yet he said i shall soon be rich i have had enough poverty since i left the army but i shall have plenty of gold yet you will see what you will see  how can you be rich one of the others said with an air of drunken wisdom you are lazy jacques bruno we all know you you are too fond of the wine cup it is seldom that you do a days work  never mind how i shall get rich i tell you that it will be so and the word of jacques bruno is not to be doubted and he turned away saying i shall go for a few hours sleep now to be in readiness for tomorrow  who is that man leigh asked sharply going up to the others  the scarf that he wore showed him to be an officer and the peasants removed their hats  it is jacques bruno monsieur he is in charge of our guns he is an old artilleryman cathelineau has appointed him to the post as it needs an artilleryman to load and point the guns  leigh moved away this fellow was half drunk but not too drunk to know what he was saying what did he mean by declaring that he would soon be rich the peasants had said that he was lazy and fond of the wine cup he could hardly be likely to acquire wealth by honest labour  perhaps he might be intending an act of treachery putting aside other considerations he as an old soldier would scarcely care to mow down his former comrades and his sympathies must be rather with the army than with the peasants he had no personal interest in this revolt against conscription nor was it likely that the cause of the cures concerned him greatly he might however meditate some act of treachery by which he would benefit his former comrades and gain a rich reward  at any rate it would be worth while watching he returned to the room where his band were quartered  andre he said i want you and two others to keep watch with me until midnight then pierre and two of his party will relieve you at that hour you will send one of your party to guide pierre to the place where i shall be you will bring your pistols and knives with you and if i come down and tell you to move forward you will do so as noiselessly as possible  shall we come at once captain andre asked  no you had better lie down with the two who are to come with you and sleep till nine oclock i will come at that hour we will say one oclock instead of twelve for the watch to be changed that will make a more even division for the night  going out again leigh inquired where the cannon had been placed they were on an eminence outside the town and commanded the road by which berruyers column would advance strolling up there he saw bruno lying asleep between two of the guns of which there were five  it seems all right he said to himself and as he cannot walk off with them i dont see what his plan can bethat is if he has a plan however there is no harm in keeping watch the guns are against the skyline and lying down fifty yards away we shall be able to see if he does anything with them of course he might spike them but i dont suppose that he would risk that for the spikes might be noticed the first thing in the morning i dont think that it would do for him to try that it seemed a stupid thing even to doubt him but half drunk as he was he certainly was in earnest in what he said and does believe that he is going to be a rich man and i dont see how that can possibly come about except by some act of treachery at any rate we will keep an eye upon the fellow tonight and if we are not posted in any particular spot tomorrow i will be up here with my band when the firing begins and keep my eye on him  he spent three or four hours with jean martin and then went back to his quarters andre and two of the lads were in readiness they moved out quietly for the street was thick with sleeping peasants there were no sentries to be seen  if the enemy did but know he muttered to himself they might take the place without firing a shot  presently however he came upon an officer  where are you going he asked sharply  i am leigh stansfield and am going with three of my party to keep watch near the guns  that is good the officer said i am on duty here and jean martin has just ridden out he is going a couple of miles along the road and will give the alarm if he hears any movement of the enemy when he gets within half a mile he is to fire off his pistols and i shall have time to get the men up long before their infantry can arrive we have tried in vain to get some of the peasants to do outpost duty they all say that they will be ready to fight when the enemy comes but they want a good sleep first and even cathelineau could not move them it is heartbreaking to have to do with such men  i do not think that it is laziness it is that they have a fixed objection to doing what they consider any kind of soldier work their idea of war is to wait till the enemy comes and then to make a rush upon them and when they have done that they think their duty is ended some day when the blues have a sharp commander and have gained a little discipline we shall suffer some terrible disaster from the obstinacy of the peasantry  with a word of adieu leigh turned off the road and made his way halfway up the eminence here the guns could be plainly made out leaving andre and his two followers he went quietly up the slope to assure himself that the artilleryman was still there had he missed him he was determined to go at once to cathelineau and state his suspicions and his belief that bruno had gone off to inform berruyer that if he advanced he would find the place wholly unguarded and would have it at his mercy he found however that the artilleryman was still asleep and returned to andre  now he said there is no occasion for us all to watch i with one of the others will keep a lookout for the next two hours and at the end of that time will rouse you and the others  leighs watch had passed off quietly there was no movement among the guns and from the position in which bruno was lying his figure would have been seen at once had he risen to his feet  if the man up there stands up you are to awaken me at once andre he said  overcome by the excitement and the heat of the day leigh dropped off to sleep almost immediately an hour later he was roused by being shaken by andre  the man has got up sir  the artilleryman after stretching himself two or three times took up something from the ground beside him and then went some distance down the side of the hill but still in sight of the watchers  he has got something on his shoulder sir i think it is a shovel and he has either a cloak or a sack on his arm  he is evidently up to something leigh replied but what it can be i cannot imagine  presently the man stopped and began to work  he is digging andre said in surprise  it looks like it certainly but what he can be digging for i have no idea  presently the man was seen to raise a heavy weight on to his shoulders  it was a sack he had with him andre said and he has filled it with earth and stones  leigh did not reply the mystery seemed to thicken and he was unable to form any supposition whatever that would account for the mans proceedings the latter carried his burden up to the cannon then he laid it down and took up some long tool and thrust it into the mouth of one of the cannon  a light suddenly burst upon leigh  the scoundrel is going to draw the charges he said and fill up the cannon with the earth that he has brought up  andre would have leapt to his feet as he uttered an exclamation of rage  keep quiet leigh said authoritatively we have no evidence against him yet we must watch him a bit longer before we interrupt him  after two or three movements the man was seen to draw something from the gun this he laid on the ground and then inserted the tool again  that is the powder leigh whispered as something else was withdrawn from the gun there you see he is taking handfuls of earth from the sack and shoving it into the mouth  this was continued for some time and then a rammer was inserted and pushed home several times then he moved to the next cannon  now follow very quietly andre busy as he is we may get quite close up to him before he notices us mind you are not to use your knife we can master him easily enough and must then take him down to cathelineau for his fate to be decided on  illustration leigh gave the word and leaping up they threw themselves on the traitor  noiselessly they crept up the hill when within five or six paces of the gun at which bruno was at work leigh gave the word and leaping up they threw themselves on the traitor who was taken so completely by surprise that they were able to throw him at once to the ground snatching up a rope that had been used for drawing the guns leigh bound his arms securely to his side and then putting a pistol to his head ordered him to rise to his feet  shoot me if you like the man growled i will not move  i will not shoot you leigh replied you must be tried and condemned  now andre we must carry him  the four boys had no difficulty in carrying the man down as they passed the officer on sentry he said  whom have you there monsieur stansfield  it is bruno the artilleryman we have caught him drawing the charges from the guns and filling them with earth we must take him to the general  the villain the officer exclaimed who would have thought of a vendean turning traitor  cathelineau was still up talking with some of his officers as to the preparations for the battle there was no sentry at his door leigh entered and tapping at the door of the room in which he saw a light went in cathelineau looked up in surprise as the door opened  i thought you were asleep hours ago monsieur he said  it is well that i have not been sir  and he related the conversation that he had overheard and his own suspicions that the man bruno meditated treachery the steps they had taken to watch him and the discovery they had made exclamations of indignation and fury broke from the officers  gentlemen cathelineau said we will at once proceed to try this traitor he shall be judged by men of his own class  monsieur pourcet do you go out and awaken the first twelve peasants you come to  in a minute or two the officer returned with the peasants who looked surprised at having been thus roused from their sleep  my friends do you take your places along that side of the room you are a jury and are to decide upon the guilt or innocence of a man who is accused of being a traitor  the word roused them at once and all repeated indignantly the word traitor  monsieur stansfield he said to leigh will you order your men to bring in the prisoner  the man was brought in and placed at the head of the table opposite to cathelineau  now monsieur stansfield will you tell the jury the story that you have just told me  leigh repeated his tale interrupted occasionally by exclamations of fury from the peasants andre and the other lads stepped forward one after the other and confirmed leighs statement  before you return a verdict my friends cathelineau said quietly it is but right that we should go up to the battery and examine the cannon ourselves not of course that we doubt the statement of monsieur stansfield and the other witnesses but because it is well that each of you should be able to see for himself and report to others that you have been eyewitnesses of the traitors plot  accordingly the whole party ascended to the battery there lay the spade and the sack of earth the tool with which the work had been done was still in the mouth of the second cannon and on pulling it out the powder cartridge came with it then leigh led them to the next gun and a man who had a bayonet thrust it in and soon brought some earth and stones to the mouth of the gun  we have now had the evidence of monsieur stansfield and those with him tested by ourselves examining the guns what do you say my friendshas this man been proved a traitor or not  he has the peasants exclaimed in chorus  and what is your sentence  death was the unanimous reply  i approve of that sentence march him down to the side of the river and shoot him  three minutes later four musket shots rang out  thus die all traitors cathelineau said  bruno however was the sole vendean who during the course of the war turned traitor to his comrades and his country    chapter 6 the assault of chemille   few words were spoken as the group of officers returned to the town when they reached cathelineaus quarters leigh would have gone on but the general said come in if you please monsieur stansfield and he followed the party in  this has been a trial gentlemen a heavy trial the general said when i entered upon this work i knew that that there were many things that i should have to endure i knew the trouble of forming soldiers from men who like ours prize their freedom and independence above all other things that we might have to suffer defeat that we must meet with hardships and probably death and that in the long run all our efforts might be futile  but i had not reckoned on having to deal with treachery i had never dreamed that one of my first acts would have been to try and to sentence a vendean to death for an act of the grossest treachery however let us put that aside it was perhaps in the nature of things in every community there must be a few scoundrels and if this turns out to be a solitary instance we may congratulate ourselves especially as we have escaped without injury  that we have done so gentlemen is due solely to monsieur stansfield who thus twice in the course of a single day has performed an inestimable service to the cause there are few indeed who on hearing the braggadocio of a drunken man would have given the matter a moments thought still less have undertaken a night of watchfulness after a day of the heaviest work merely to test the truth of a slightlyfounded suspicion that might have occurred to them it is not too much to say that had not this act of treachery been discovered our defeat tomorrow would have been wellnigh certain you know how much our people think of their guns and if when the fight began the cannon had been silent instead of pouring their contents into the ranks of the enemy they would have lost heart at once and would have been beaten almost before the fight began  we have no honours to bestow on you monsieur stansfield but in the name of la vendee i thank you with all my heart i shall add to my order respecting your fight of yesterday a statement of what has taken place tonight and i shall beg that all officers read it aloud to the parties that follow them  i agree most cordially with the generals words monsieur bonchamp said your defence yesterday would have been a credit to any military man and this discovery has saved us from ruin tomorrow or rather today i will venture to say that not one man in five hundred would have taken the trouble to go out of his way to ascertain whether the words of a drunken man rested on any foundation  there was then a short conversation as to the approaching fight the number of men who had arrived was much smaller than had been anticipated owing to the fact that the simultaneous invasion at so many points had the effect of retaining the peasants of the various localities for the defence of their own homes leigh learned that a mounted messenger had been despatched shortly before he brought the prisoner down to beg monsieur delbee to bring the force he commanded at chollet with all speed to aid in the defence of chemille for if that town fell he would be exposed to the attack of the united forces of generals berruyer and leigonyer  now gentlemen i think we had better get a few hours sleep cathelineau said they will not be here very early probably not until noon for they may wait for a time before starting in hopes of being joined either by leigonyer or one of the other columns and it is not likely that any news of the sharp reverse that leigonyer has met with has reached them  it was now two oclock in the morning and leigh slept heavily till roused at eight  you should have called me before andre he said reproachfully when he learnt how late it was  i thought it was better that you should have a good sleep captain of course if there had been any message to say that you were wanted i should have woke you but as no one came and there is still no news of the enemy i thought that it was better to let you sleep till now  pierre had started with his party at five to scout on the road by which the enemy was advancing leigh first hurried down to the river and had a bath and then felt ready for any work that he might have to do he then went to the house where jean was lodged the latter who had not returned from his outpost work till day broke was just getting up  well leigh he said i called in at cathelineaus quarters to report i found him already up he told me the work that you had been doing and praised you up to the skies it seems to me that you are getting all the credit of the campaign really i feel quite proud of you and we shall be having you starting as a rival leader to cathelineau  leigh laughed  one does not often have two such opportunities in the course of a day and i dont suppose i am likely to have such luck again if the war goes on for a year where are you going to be today  i am going to act as aidedecamp to bonchamp  and what shall we do do you think  well i should say you had best keep out of it altogether leigh you and your band did much more than your share of fighting yesterday and your pistols will be of no use in a fight such as this will be seriously unless cathelineau assigns you some post i should keep out of it your little corps is specially formed to act as scouts and as we are so extremely badly off in that respect it will be far better for you to keep to your proper duties than to risk your lives  how do you think the fight is likely to go jean  it depends in the first place upon how the blues fight if they do well they ought to beat us in the next place it depends on whether delbee comes up in time if he does i think that we shall hold the place but it will be stiff fighting  it was not until noon that berruyers force was seen approaching as soon as it was in sight the vendeans poured out and took up their station by the hill on which the guns were placed in spite of what jean had said leigh would have placed his band with the rest had not cathelineau sent for him half an hour before and given him orders which were almost identical with the advice of jean  i wish you and your band to keep out of this battle monsieur stansfield your force is so small that it can make no possible difference in the fortunes of the day and whether we win or lose your lads may be wanted as messengers after it is over they have done extremely well at present and need no further credit than they have gained i beg therefore that you will take post with them somewhat in rear of the village away on the right i shall then know where to find you if i have any messages to send and moreover i want you at once to send off one of your most active lads with this note to delbee urging him to come on at full speed for the fight is likely to go hard with us unless he comes in time to our assistance and telling him i wish him to know that even if i have to fall back the church will be held till the last and that as soon as he arrives i shall if possible again take the offensive and beg that he will attack the enemy in flank or in rear as he sees an opportunity upon the belfry of the church half a mile on our right you will be able to see how the battle goes and can send off news to delbee from time to time  very well sir i will despatch your letter at once and then march out to the church which i noticed yesterday  here is a telescope cathelineau said we are well provided with them as we took all that we could find at chollet and vihiers i think that with its aid you will be able to have a good view of what is going on  in twenty minutes leigh had taken up his post in the belfry of the village church that cathelineau had indicated andre and pierre whose party had returned an hour before were with him the rest of the band were in the story below them from which a view was also obtainable the three most severely wounded had started for their homes early that morning the others were fit for duty  the fight began by a discharge of the guns of the assailants leigh could see that the defenders guns had been somewhat withdrawn from their position on the top of the rising ground where they would have been too much exposed to the enemys fire and their muzzles now only showed over the brow during the course of the morning an earthwork had been thrown up to afford protection to the men serving them they did not return the fire until the enemy were within a distance of a quarter of a mile then they commenced with deadly effect  the blues halted and leigh could make out that a considerable number of men in the rear at once turned and ran in order to encourage them they had been informed just before they marched of the plot that had been arranged to silence the guns and this unexpected discharge caused the greatest consternation among the young levies a body of cavalry were at once sent off in pursuit and drove the fugitives back to their ranks the troopers using the flats of their swords unstintingly  then the advance was resumed covered by the fire of the guns and by volleys of musketry these were answered but feebly by the firearms in the peasants hands and the blues pressed on until just before they reached the foot of the slope the peasants charged them with fury  the regular troops and a regiment of gendarmes had been placed in front these stood firm poured heavy volleys into the peasants as they approached and then received them with levelled bayonets  in vain the vendeans strove to break through the hedge of steel cathelineau and his officers on one side and the french generals on the other encouraged their men and for a quarter of an hour a desperate conflict reigned then the peasants fell back and the blues resumed their advance  three times cathelineau induced his followers to renew the attack but each time it was unsuccessful the blues mounted the hill the cannon were captured and the vendeans fell back into the town here the ends of the streets had been barricaded and in spite of the artillery and the captured guns now turned against their former owners the assailants tried in vain to force their way into the town  from every window that commanded the approaches the men with muskets kept up an incessant fire the mass of the peasants lay in shelter behind the barricades or in the houses until the enemys infantry approached to within striking distance and then leaping up from these barricades and fighting with an absolute disregard of their lives they again and again repulsed the attacks of the enemy  berruyer seeing that in spite of his heavy losses he made no way called his troops from the assault and forming them into two columns moved to the right and left and attacked the town on both sides here no barricades had been erected and in spite of the efforts of the peasants an entrance was forced into the town every street lane and house was defended with desperate energy but discipline gradually triumphed and the blues won their way into the square in the centre of the town where the principal church stood as they entered the open space they were assailed with a rain of bullets from the roof tower and windows  as soon as the flanking movement began monsieur bonchamp seeing that the town was now certain to be taken had hurried with the greater portion of the men armed with muskets to the church which had already been prepared by him on the previous day for the defence a great number of paving stones had been got up from the roadway and piled inside the church and as soon as he arrived there with his men the doors were closed and blocked behind with a deep wall of stones  berruyer saw that the position was a formidable one and ignorant of the number of the defenders sent back for his guns and contented himself for the time by clearing the rest of the town of its defenders these however as they issued out were rallied by cathelineau and his officers they assured the peasants that the day was not yet lost that the church would hold out for hours and that delbee would soon arrive with his force from chollet to their assistance  leigh anxiously watching the progress of the fight had sent messenger after messenger along the road by which delbee would come his heart sank as he heard the guns open in the centre of the town and knew that they were directed against the church still there was no abatement of the fire of the defenders an incessant fire of musketry was maintained not only from the church itself but from every window in the houses around it  at last he heard that delbees force was but a quarter of a mile away and running down from his lookout he started to meet it it was coming at a run the men panting and breathless but holding on desperately half maddened with the sound of battle  all is not lost yet then delbee said as he came up  no sir the church holds out and i could see that the peasants who have been driven out of the town have rallied but a few hundred yards away and are evidently only waiting for your arrival to renew the attack i think sir that if you will run up to the belfry of the church with this glass you will be able to understand the exact situation  the officer ran up the tower and returned in two or three minutes then he led his men down towards the southeastern corner of the town  leigh on hearing that delbee was close at hand sent off two messengers to cathelineau to inform him of the fact and he now sent off another stating the direction in which the reinforcement was marching  i am going to attack at that corner instead of in the rear monsieur delbee said to him for now that the duty assigned to him had been performed leigh thought that he would be justified in joining in the attack with what remained of his band if i were to get directly in their rear they would on finding their retreat cut off fight so fiercely that i might be overpowered even the most cowardly troops will fight under those circumstances therefore while threatening their line of retreat i still leave it open to them it is a maxim in war you know always to leave a bridge open for a flying foe  in a few minutes they reached the town none had observed their approach the troops being assembled round the church these were at once thrown into confusion when they found themselves attacked with fury by a large force of whose existence they had no previous thought  the vendeans fought with desperate valour the new levies for the most part lost heart at once and in spite of the efforts of berruyer and his officers began to make for the line of retreat the movement was accelerated by an outburst of shouts from the other side of the town where cathelineaus force poured in burning to avenge their former losses and as they fell upon the enemy bonchamp led out the defenders of the church by a side door and joined in the fray  berruyer saw that all was lost by great efforts he kept together the gendarmes and regular troops to cover the retreat and fell back fighting fiercely bonchamp and his musketeers pressed hotly upon them the peasants made charge after charge and as soon as the force issued from the town many of the peasantry set off at full speed in pursuit of the fugitives great numbers of whom were overtaken and killed berruyer continued his retreat all night and entered saint lambert before morning having lost the whole of his cannon and three thousand men in this disastrous fight  the joy of the vendeans was unbounded the stones were speedily removed from the shattered doors of the church mass was celebrated and the peasants returned thanks for their great victory  the gains were indeed considerable three thousand muskets had fallen into their hands they had recaptured the guns that they had lost and taken twelve others their own losses had been heavyeighteen hundred men had been killed and a great number wounded but of this at the time they thought but little those who had died had died for their country and their god as all of them were ready to do and how could men do more  on the republican side general duhaus had been very dangerously wounded and most of berruyers principal officers killed  a council of war was held the next morning at chemille for the moment the victory had secured their safety but while the peasants believed and hoped that the war was over their leaders saw that the position was scarcely improved they had indeed captured guns and muskets but these were useless without ammunition and their stock of powder and ball was quite exhausted already the peasantry were leaving in large numbers for their homes berruyer might return reinforced at any time and effect a junction with leigonyer while the column that had captured saint florent would doubtless advance it was therefore decided that chemille must be abandoned and that the officers should retire to tiffauges until at any rate the peasants were ready to leave their homes again  by evening that day the greater portion of the army had melted away and on the following morning the leaders also left the town they had so bravely defended on the following day indeed berruyer having learned the position of leigonyer returned to chemille and two days later was in communication with leigonyers force the latter had occupied chollet which had been left devoid of defenders since the day they marched away  on the other hand quetineau had on the thirteenth been attacked at aubiers and had been forced to evacuate the place leaving three guns behind him retiring to bressuire the capture of aubiers was the work of henri de la rochejaquelein he had ridden to join cathelineau and met him and the other leaders retiring from chemille they were gloomy and depressed they had won a battle but they were without an army without ammunition almost all the towns were in the possession of the blues it seemed to them that the struggle could not be much longer maintained  the young count was too energetic and too enthusiastic to be seriously moved and rode back to the residence of an aunt at saint aubin there he learned that aubiers had been taken by the enemy the peasantry around were in a state of extreme excitement they had hoisted the white flag on their churches and were ready to fight but they had no leader  hearing that rochejaquelein was at his aunts house they came to him and begged him to take the command promising him that in twentyfour hours ten thousand men should be ready to follow him he agreed to the request the church bells were set ringing and before morning almost that number were assembled of these only two hundred had guns  with this force he attacked aubiers the resistance of the enemy was feeble and they were chased almost to bressuire  rochejaquelein was very anxious to capture this town as his friends the lescures had been brought from clisson and imprisoned there but he saw that it was of primary importance to carry assistance to cathelineau and he accordingly marched to tiffauges  the church bells again rang out their summons and cathelineau in twentyfour hours found himself at the head of an army of twenty thousand men  i told you at clisson that i should soon meet you again monsieur martin la rochejaquelein said when as he rode into tiffauges at the head of his newly raised force he met jean in the street and here i am you see i am only sorry that i am too late to take part in the brave fight at chemille  right glad are we to see you count jean replied this is my wifes brother of whom i was speaking to you at clisson cathelineau will tell you that he has been distinguishing himself rarely  henri held out his hand to leigh and said warmly i am glad to know you it would be a shame indeed were any vendeans to remain at home when a young englishman is fighting for their country i hope that we shall be great friends  i shall be glad indeed to be so leigh replied with equal warmth for he was greatly struck with the appearance of the young soldier  henri de la rochejaquelein was but twentyone years old tall and remarkably handsome he had fair hair and a noble bearing his father had been a colonel in the army and he himself was a cavalry officer in the kings guard he was the beau ideal of a dashing hussar and his appearance was far more english than french he was immensely popular his manner frank and pleasant and he was greatly beloved by the peasantry on his family estates  at this moment cathelineau with his two generals came up and leigh retired from the circle the arrival of the young count with his strong reinforcement at once altered the position the leaders who had since they fell back from chemille been depressed and almost hopeless beamed with satisfaction as they talked with henri whose enthusiasm was infectious  la rochejaquelein accompanied them to his quarters hitherto he had only heard rumours of the fighting at chemille and cathelineau now gave him a full account of the affair jean martin had at his invitation accompanied him and when cathelineau had finished henri turned to him and said  indeed you did not exaggerate monsieur martin when you said that your brotherinlaw had already distinguished himself in fact there can be no doubt that the splendid defence he made at that little river where he held berruyers whole force in check for upwards of three hoursand so forced him to halt for the night on the way instead of pushing forward and attacking chemille at oncesaved the town for it gave time to monsieur delbee to come up scarcely less important was his detection of the treachery of the man in charge of the artillery i cannot but regret that so gallant a young fellow is not my countryman for i should have felt proud of one so daring and so thoughtful  when you do not want him for scouting work monsieur cathelineau i shall get you to lend him to me i should be really glad to have him by my side his face pleased me much there was something so frank and honest about it and after what he has done i am sure that i shall always respect his opinion  there was another consultation as to what should be their first operation and it was resolved that leigonyer should be attacked at once before he could make a complete junction with berruyer the next morning at daybreak the whole force moved off they were only just in time for berruyer had already ordered general gauvillier who commanded the force that had captured saint florent to advance to beaupreau berruyer was to march to vezins and he himself to jallais and to join leigonyer at may  on the previous evening henri had after the termination of the council requested jean martin to take him to the house where leigh and his little party were quartered  i have been hearing of your doings he said and feel quite jealous that you who are i hear four years younger than myself should have done so much while i with all my family influence and connection should as yet have done nothing but chase the enemy out of aubiers how is it that you who have had no training as a soldier should have conceived the idea of arresting the march of berruyers army with a force of only two or three hundred peasants  it was a mere matter of common sense leigh said with a smile i knew that it was of the utmost importance that chemille should not be attacked until cathelineau received reinforcements at first i had no thought of doing more than breaking down the bridge and of perhaps checking the advanced cavalry but when i found that the peasants who came along were quite willing to aid it seemed to me that by cutting down the trees so as to block the road and make a shelter for us we might be able to cause the enemy considerable delay i hardly hoped to succeed in holding out so long or in inflicting such loss upon him as we were able to do it did not require any military knowledge whatever and i should not have attempted it had i not seen that thanks to the forest we should be able to retreat when we could no longer hold the barricade of felled trees  well you could not have done better if you had been a general i have cathelineaus permission to ask you to ride with me when you are not engaged in scouting  i should be delighted to do so but at present i have no horse however i can send one of my lads back to the chateau to fetch the one that i generally ride  i have brought a spare animal with me the young count said i brought it in case the other should be shot and i shall be glad if you will ride it tomorrow and until yours arrives but i would not send for one until after tomorrow for likely enough we may make some captures before nightfall  we are to march at three in the morning and to attack leigonyer the great thing that we need is powder cathelineau says that there is scarcely a charge left among his men mine are not much better off we should have had none with which to attack aubiers but i sent off during the night to a quarry a few miles from my aunts and succeeded in getting forty pounds of blasting powder it would not have been of much use for the muskets but the fact of its being powder was sufficient to encourage the peasants and the blues made such a feeble resistance that its quality made no difference to us it enabled those who had muskets to make a noise with them and was just as effectual in raising their spirits in attacking the blues as if it had been the finest quality we got a few hundred cartridges when we took the place but that will not go very far and i hope that tomorrow we shall be able to obtain a supply from the enemy  before the hour for starting the force had swelled considerably the news that monsieur de la rochejaquelein had retaken aubiers and had come with twelve thousand men to assist cathelineau spread like wildfire the peasants from all the country round flocked in and when they started in the morning the united force had swollen to over twenty thousand men  as soon as the young count left him leigh sent all his band under his lieutenants with orders to proceed towards vezins to ascertain the progress leigonyer had made and the position of his forces and to send back news to him just as the army was starting one of the boys returned and said that a party of twelve cavalry and a detachment of infantry had just entered the chateau of crilloire leigh at once informed cathelineau who sent off a hundred and fifty men to capture the place they were ordered to travel at the top of their speed and jean martin was in command of them  the expedition was crowned with success the infantry who had been stationed outside the chateau fled at once their commandant villemet leigonyers best officer charged the vendeans with his little body of cavalry he was received with a volley two of his men were killed and he himself and nine of his men were wounded he managed however to burst through the vendeans and to overtake his flying infantry these he rallied and led back to the chateau which he found deserted for martin as soon as he captured the place and cleared it of the enemy had gone off with his men to join the main body  berruyer had also started early and sent five hundred men to may where he expected leigonyer to arrive in a few hours but before he reached the town the vendeans attacked the advanced guard of the latter general which consisted of two companies of grenadiers these old soldiers fought well and threw themselves into the chateau of boisgroleau  leaving fifteen hundred men to surround and attack the chateau the main army pressed forward leigonyer hearing of the disaster sent forward two thousand men to succour the besieged force but the vendeans fell upon them and after a short resistance they broke and fled into vezins  the arrival of the fugitives caused a panic among the whole of leigonyers force assembled there and they fled precipitately two hundred and fifty men of the regiment of finisterre alone remaining steady and these maintaining good order covered the retreat of the guns repulsing the attacks of the peasantry who pursued them fortunately for the vendeans a waggon laden with barrels of powder was left behind in the confusion caused by their approach and proved of inestimable value to them  had the vendeans pursued the fugitives with vigour the force would have been almost annihilated but cathelineau learning from leighs scouts that berruyer was already approaching vezins feared to be taken in the rear by him and therefore fell back to may and beaupreau  the garrison that defended the chateau of boisgroleau repulsed the repeated attacks made upon them but surrendered on the approach of the main army their ammunition and the food they had brought with them in their haversacks being entirely exhausted  berruyer on his arrival at jallais heard of the defeat of leigonyer and marched back in all haste to chemille where he had left his magazines on hearing however that leigonyer on his arrival at vihiers had been deserted during the night by the whole of his troops and finding himself in the morning with but a hundred and fifty men of the finisterre regiment had evacuated the town and retreated to doug berruyer wrote to him to endeavour to gather his forces together again and to return to chemille  but the news of another disaster convinced him that he could not maintain himself there the vendeans had marched without delay against beaupreau and attacked gauvillier that general had already heard of the defeat of leigonyer and the retreat of berruyer his force was greatly dispirited at the news and offered but a feeble resistance to the fierce assault the blues were driven out of the town with the loss of their five cannon and were hotly pursued to saint florent losing a large proportion of their numbers on the way  the news of this fresh disaster convinced berruyer that he must fall back without delay and he accordingly retreated with his whole force to saint lambert whence he wrote to the convention to declare the impossibility of doing anything without large reinforcements of regular troops as no dependence whatever could be placed upon the national guards and volunteers and if the insurgents marched against him he would be obliged to march to pontsdece in order to cover angers where the alarm of the inhabitants was intense  thus the invasion that was to crush the vendeans failed altogether except that some advantages had been gained by the blues along the line of coast the troops being assisted by the fleet at all other points misfortune had attended them quetineau had been driven from aubiers and a great proportion of his force having deserted he held bressuire with so feeble a grasp that he could not maintain himself if attacked leigonyers army had practically ceased to exist as had that which had advanced from saint florent berruyer had lost three thousand men and was back again at the point from which he had started chollet and vihiers had been recovered without a blow  as the result of his failures berruyer was recalled to paris tried for his conduct and narrowly escaped the guillotine  as soon as berruyer retired cathelineau advanced against bressuire news of his coming at once scared the blues from the town and they retreated to thouars they did not even wait to take their prisoners with them and as soon as they had gone the marquis de la lescure with his family rode off to their chateau at clisson they had scarcely arrived there when la rochejaquelein arrived and acquainted them with the general facts of the insurrection  cathelineaus army he said consists of twenty thousand men and on any emergency it would swell to nearly twice that number twelve thousand bretons had crossed the loire and were on their way to join him in lower poitou charette had an army of twenty thousand and besides these there were many scattered bands  lescure at once agreed to accompany la rochejaquelein to bressuire and the marquis of donnissan madame lescures father arranged to follow them as soon as he had seen his wife and daughter safely placed in the chateau of de la boulais    chapter 7 a short rest   leigh stansfield had ridden with rochejaquelein during the march of the army to vezins and from there to bressuire he was charmed with his companion who had been the first to dash with a few other mounted gentlemen into the streets of vezins and who had thrown himself with reckless bravery upon the retreating infantry and as the peasants came up had led them to the attack several times until cathelineaus orders that the pursuit should be pushed no farther reached him  that sort of order is very hard to obey he said to leigh however i need not regret that these brave fellows should escape us we have won the battle if one can call it a battle and i honour the men who when all the others have fled like sheep still cling together and defend their guns at least a hundred of them have fallen since they left the town and we have lost double that number and should lose at least as many more before we finally overcame their opposition if all the armies of the republic were composed of such stuff as this regiment i fear that our chance of defending la vendee successfully would be small indeed  on rejoining cathelineau and hearing his reason for calling off the pursuit henri at once admitted its wisdom  after the defeat of leigonyer you will see that berruyer will not long be able to maintain himself at chemille he said and when he hears the news i fancy that he will retire at once for he will know well enough that it will be useless for him to pursue us still if he were to come down on our rear as we advanced it would have a bad effect upon the peasants and it is much better to avoid fighting unless under circumstances that are almost sure to give us victory we can almost always choose our own ground which is an enormous advantage in a country like this it is very fortunate that it is so for we certainly could not raise a body of cavalry that could stand against those of the line but in these lanes and thickets they have no superiority in that respect for no general would be fool enough to send cavalry into places where they would be at the mercy of an unseen foe at the same time i must own that i regretted today that we had no mounted force with but a squadron or two of my old regiment not a man of leigonyers force would have escaped for the country here is open enough to use them and i should certainly have had no compunction in cutting down the rascals who are always shouting for blood and yet are such arrant cowards that they fly without firing a shot  the day after the capture of bressuire the vendeans marched against thouars to which town quetineau had retreated with his force thouars was the only town in la vendee which was still walled the fortifications were in a dilapidated condition but nevertheless offered a considerable advantage to a force determined upon a desperate resistance with the fugitives from bressuire and the garrison already in thouars quetineau was at the head of three thousand five hundred troops of these however comparatively few could be depended upon the successive defeats that had been inflicted on the troops of the republic by the vendeans had entirely destroyed their morale they no longer felt any confidence in their power to resist the onslaught of the peasants  quetineau himself had no hope of making a successful resistance he had repeatedly written urgent letters to the authorities at paris saying that nothing could be done without large reinforcements of disciplined troops and that the national guard and volunteers were worse than useless as they frequently ran at the first shot and excited the hostility of the people generally by their habits of plundering nevertheless the old soldier determined to resist to the last however hopeless the conflict and when the vendeans approached at six oclock in the morning they found that the bridge of viennes was barricaded and guarded  as soon as they attacked the general reinforced the defenders of the bridge by his most trustworthy troops a battalion three hundred and twentyfive strong of marseillais and a battalion of the national guard of nievre so stoutly was the post held that the vendean general saw that the bridge could not be taken without terrible loss he therefore contented himself with keeping up a heavy fire all day while preparing an attack from other quarters  the first step was to destroy the bridge behind the castle and to make a breach in the wall near the paris gate thereby cutting off the garrisons means of retreat at five oclock a large body of peasantry was massed for an attack on the bridge at viennes and its defenders seeing the storm that was preparing retired into the town the vendeans crossed the bridge but as they approached the walls they were attacked by a battalion of the national guard of deux sevres and a body of gendarmes and taken by surprise were driven back some distance their leaders however speedily rallied them and in the meantime other bodies forced their way into the town at several points  to avoid a massacre of his troops quetineau hoisted the white flag on this as on all other occasions in the northern portion of la vendee the prisoners were well treated they were offered their freedom on condition of promising not to serve against la vendee again and to ensure that this oath should be kept for some time at least their heads were shaved before their release a step that was afterwards taken throughout the war  quetineau was treated with all honour and was given his freedom without conditions although he knew well that neither his long services nor the efforts that he had made would save him from the fury of the convention he returned to paris where after the mockery of a trial he was sent to the guillotinea fate which awaited all those who failed in the face of impossibilities to carry out the plans of the mob leaders instead of blame the general deserved a high amount of praise for the manner in which he had defended the town against a force six times as strong as his own  three thousand muskets ten pieces of cannon and a considerable amount of ammunition fell into the hands of the victors this success left it open to the vendeans either to march against leigonyerthe remnant of whose army was in a state of insubordination at doug and could have offered no opposition but must have retreated to saumuror to clear the country south and west  the former would unquestionably have been the wiser course for the capture of saumur would have been a heavy blow indeed to the republicans but the peasants whose villages and property were threatened by the presence of the blues at fontenay parthenay and chataigneraie were so strongly in favour of the other alternative that it was adopted and the force broke into two divisions one moving towards chataigneraie and the other against fontenay  parthenay was evacuated at once by the republicans as soon as news reached the authorities of the approach of the vendeans the latter however made no stay but continued their march towards chataigneraie the town was held by general chalbos with three thousand men after two hours fighting chalbos seeing that his retreat was menaced fell back  he took up a position at fontenay where he was joined by general sandoz from niort the country around the town was unfavourable for the vendeans being a large plain and the result was disastrous to them the republicans were strong in cavalry and a portion of these fell on the flank of the vendeans while the remainder charged them in rear they fell into disorder at once and the cavalry captured a portion of their artillery  the republican infantry seeing the success of their cavalry advanced stoutly and in good order in vain the leaders of the vendeans strove to reanimate their men and induce them to charge the enemy the panic that had begun spread rapidly and in a few minutes they became a mob of fugitives scattering in all directions and leaving behind them sixteen cannon and all the munitions of war they had captured  la rochejaquelein who after he had visited lescure at clisson had rejoined the army with a party of gentlemen covered the retreat with desperate valour charging the enemys cavalry again and again and before falling back allowing time for the fugitives to gain the shelter of the woods the loss of men was therefore small but the fact that the peasants who had come to be regarded as almost irresistible by the troops should have been so easily defeated raised the blues from the depth of depression into which they had fallen while the blow inflicted upon the vendeans was correspondingly great it was some little time before the peasants could be aroused again  small bodies indeed kept the field and under their leaders showed so bold a face whenever reconnoitring parties of the blues went out from fontenay that the troops were not long before they again began to lose heart while the generals who had thought that the victory at fontenay would bring the war to a conclusion again began to pour in letters to the authorities at paris calling for reinforcements  on the side of the vendeans the priests everywhere exerted themselves to impress upon their flocks the necessity of again joining the army cathelineau himself made a tour through the bocage and the peasants persuaded that the defeat was a punishment for having committed some excesses at the capture of chataigneraie responded to the call in nine days after the reverse they were again in force near fontenay and in much greater numbers than before for very many of them had returned to their homes as soon as thouars had been captured and their strength in the first battle was but little greater than that of the republicans  burning with ardour to avenge their defeat and rendered furious by the pillage of all the houses of the patriots at chataigneraieto which town chalbos with seven thousand troops had marchedit was against him that the vendeans first moved chalbos who had occupied his time in issuing vainglorious proclamations and in writing assurances to the convention that the vendeans were so panic stricken that the war was virtually over only saved his army by a long and painful night march back to fontenay here the troops lay down to sleep feeling certain that there could be no attack that day by the enemy  at one oclock however the vendeans issued from the woods on to the plain and the troops were hastily called to arms  the royal catholic army as it now called itself advanced in three columns it was without cannon but its enthusiasm more than counterbalanced this deficiency the vendeans received unshaken the discharge of the artillery of the blues pursuing their usual tactics of throwing themselves to the ground when they saw the flash of the cannon and then leaping up again and rushing forward with loud shouts the cavalry were ordered to charge but only twenty men obeyed the rest turned and fled the infantry offered but a feeble resistance and in ten minutes after the first gun was fired the republican army was a mob of fugitives fontenay was taken and what pleased the peasants even more their beloved cannon marie jeanne was recaptured having been recovered by young foret who with a handful of peasants charged the cavalry that were covering the retreat and snatched it from their hands after this victory the peasants as usual returned for the most part to their homes  as there was no probability of further fighting at the moment jean martin and leigh started for the chateau they had first asked cathelineau if they could be spared  for the moment yes i hope that we shall be joined by the count de lescure in a day or two he will of course be one of our generals he has great influence with the peasantry and if he can but persuade them to remain under arms for a time we will attack the enemy messieurs delbee and bonchamp and i may say several of the gentlemen with me are of opinion that if we are to be successful in the end it can only be by taking the offensive and marching against paris they urge that we should get monsieur charette to go with us with his army cross the loire rouse all brittany and then march a hundred thousand strong against paris  they say that although we have been most successful this time and repulsed the invaders everywhere except on the coast they will come again and again with larger forces till they overpower us possibly if monsieur de lescure and henri de la rochejaquelein aid us with their influence and authority we might persuade the peasants that it is better to make one great effort and then to have done with it than to be constantly called from their homes whenever the blues are in sufficient strength to invade us we shall tell them too that after the two repulses they have suffered the blues will grow more and more savage and that already orders have been sent for all villages to be destroyed and all hedges and woods to be cut downa business that by the way would employ the whole french army for some years  however as soon as our plans are decided upon i will send a messenger to you at present there is nothing requiring either you or your scouts monsieur stansfield and after the good service that they have rendered it is but fair that they should have a short rest  patsey was delighted when her husband and leigh arrived she was under no uneasiness as to their safety as after the repulse of berruyers army at chemille and the rout of leigonyer leigh had sent one of the boys home with the assurance that they were unhurt  i dont quite know how much to believe she said as they sat down to a meal of the reports that the boys have brought home the first came and told me that on your arrival at cathelineaus he himself praised them all and that monsieur bonchamp drilled them for an hour then came home two wounded lads with a story about the great fight in which they insisted that leigh commanded and that they kept the army of the blues at bay for three hours and killed hundreds of them the next messenger told us a tale about leighs having discovered some treachery upon the part of the man who was in charge of the artillery and that he was in consequence shot he insisted that cathelineau had declared that leigh had saved chemille because the enemy were so long delayed that monsieur delbee with his band had time to come up from chollet and rout the blues  of course i did not believe anything like all they said but i suppose there must be something in it for i questioned the boys myself and though i had no doubt they would make as much as they could of their own doings among their neighbours and friends they would hardly venture to lie though they might exaggerate greatly to me  strange as it may appear patsey jean said they told you the simple truth and as soon as we have finished supper i will tell you the whole story of what has taken place since we left and you will see that this brother of yours has cut a very conspicuous figure in our affairs  you are not joking jean  not in the smallest degree i can assure you that if leigh chose to set up as leader on his own account a large proportion of the peasants would follow him  ridiculous jean leigh exclaimed hotly  it may seem ridiculous but it is a real fact  the peasants you must know patsey choose their own leaders there is no dividing or sorting them no getting them to keep in regular companies they simply follow the leader in whom they have the most confidence or who appears to them the most fortunate if he does anything that they dont like or they do not approve of his plan they tell him so leighs defence of the stream against berruyers army created a feeling of enthusiasm among them and i verily believe that his discovery of the plot to render the cannon useless was regarded by them as almost supernatural  superstitious and ignorant as they are they are as you know always ready to consider anything they cant understand and which acts greatly in their favour as a special interposition of providence i am bound to say that leigh acted upon such very slender grounds that even cathelineau who is enormously in advance of the peasantry in general was staggered by it and told me he could not have believed it possible that anyone should on such a slight clue have followed the matter up unless by a special inspiration  the thing was as simple as a b c leigh broke in  you will have to remain a silent listener leigh his sister said when jean is telling me the story i cannot have him interrupted  very well leigh said then i will put on my hat take a fresh horse from the stable and ride off to see how the two wounded boys are going on  i can tell you that they are almost well but still if you dont want to hear jeans story of all your adventures by all means go round i am sure that the tenants will be gratified at hearing that you rode over to see them the very first evening you came home  the vendean leaders had for some time felt the necessity of having a generally recognized authority and after the battle of fontenay they decided to appoint a council who were to reside permanently at some central place and administer the affairs of the whole district provide supplies for the armies and make all other civil arrangements so that the generals would be able to attend only to the actual fighting a body of eighteen men was chosen to administer affairs under the title of the superior council and a priest who had joined them at thouars and who called himself though without a shadow of right the bishop of agra was appointed president he was an eloquent man of commanding presence and the leaders had not thought it worth while to inquire too minutely into his claim to the title of bishop for the peasants had been full of enthusiasm at having a prelate among them and his influence and exhortations had been largely instrumental in gathering the army which had won the battle of fontenay  but although he was appointed president the leading spirit of the council was the abbe bernier a man of great energy and intellect with a commanding person ready pen and a splendid voice but who was altogether without principle and threw himself into the cause for purely selfish and ambitious motives  it was on the sixteenth of may that fontenay was won and on the third of june the church bells again called the peasantry to arms the disaster at fontenay had done more than all the representations of their generals to rouse the convention seven battalions of regular troops arrived and biron who had been appointed commanderinchief reached niort and assumed the command  he wrote at once to the minister of war to say that he found the confusion impossible to describe there was an absence of any organization whatever the town was crowded with fugitives who having distinguished themselves by the violence of their opinions and the severity of their measures before the insurrection broke out were forced to take refuge in the cities the general reported that he had caused the assembly to be sounded again and again without more than a tenth part of the troops paying the slightest heed to the summons  the army was without cavalry without waggons for carrying supplies without an ambulance trainin fact it was nothing but a halfarmed mob biron himself was at heart a royalist and when he in turn had to meet his fate by the guillotine openly declared himself to be one and the repugnance which he felt on assuming the command against the vendeanswhich he had only accepted after a long delay and after petitioning in vain to be allowed to remain at his former postwas heightened when he discovered the state of affairs and the utter confusion that prevailed everywhere  when sending the order for the bells to ring on the first of june the superior council of the vendeans issued a proclamation which was to be read in all the churches to the effect that provisional councils should be formed in each parish to provide for the subsistence of the women and children of men with the army receipts were to be given for all supplies of grain used for this purpose which were to be paid for by the superior council those men who did not remain permanently with the army as long as necessary would be called upon to pay the taxes to which they were subject prior to the rising  the sales of the land belonging to the churcheswhich had been sequestrated on the refusal of the clergy to comply with the orders of the conventionwere declared null and void as these had been bought by the upholders of the revolution for no devout vendean would have taken part in the robbery of the church the blow was a heavy one to those who had so long been dominant in la vendee these lands were for the time to be administered for the good of the cause by the parish council  it was hoped that this proclamation would act beneficially in keeping the peasants in the field as they would know that their families were cared for and that if they only went out at times they would subject themselves to taxation and be regarded by the families of those who remained with the army as being wanting in zeal  upon rejoining the army leigh and his party of scouts learned to their satisfaction that it was intended to march against saumur they were now double their former strength as the story of what they had done had roused the spirit of emulation among lads in the surrounding parishes and leigh could have had a hundred had he chosen he was this time mounted in order that he might at times ride with rochejaquelein while at others he went out scouting with his party  i am heartily glad to see you back again my friend the young count said shaking him warmly by the hand to be with you does me good for the generals and even lescure are so serious and solemn that i feel afraid to make a joke you see in the cavalry we have little responsibility except in an actual battle in an open country we should scout ahead and have affairs with the enemys outposts but in this land of woods where one can seldom see more than twenty yards ahead there is little use for us besides with the exception of a score or two of gentlemen i have no troops to command and having health and good spirits and enjoying life i cannot go about as if the cares of life were on my shoulders your brotherinlaw martin is a capital fellow but with a wife and child he cannot feel so lighthearted as i do though next to yourself he is the most ready to join me in a laugh sailors seem always to be lighthearted and he certainly is no exception  he is a splendid fellow count  yes he is a fine fellow but you see he is seven or eight years older than i am while i feel with you that you are about my own age by the way it is high time that we dropped calling each other by our surnames especially as mine is such a long one so in future let us be henri and leigh to each other most of the peasants call me henri  they generally speak of you as our henri leigh said and would follow you through fire and water i think the vendeans are as a whole serious people and they admire you all the more because you are so unlike themselves if you do not mind my saying so you remind me much more of the young english officers i used to meet at poole than of frenchmen  yes i have often been told that i am more english than french in appearance and perhaps in manner for in france most men have forgotten for the past four years what it is to smile and i question whether a laugh would not be considered in itself sufficient to ensure a mans condemnation as an enemy of the republic  well so we are going to saumur that is an enterprise worth undertaking it may be considered as the headquarters of the blues in these parts there is a considerable body of troops there if we capture it we shall give a rare fright to poitiers tours and the other towns and cause a scare even in paris  leigh was requested to go forward at daybreak with his band to discover the situation of the enemy who might come out from their situation to give battle before doue leigonyer who commanded here had with him four good regiments and occupied several strong positions on the right bank of the river layon and also a post called rochette on the left bank  the fact that the vendeans were advancing against them was already known to leigonyer for confident as they now felt the vendeans made no secret of their destination and the news was speedily carried by the adherents of the convention who everywhere acted as spies three such men were captured by leighs party making their way to leigonyer and being unable to give any account of themselves were immediately shot  leigh had no difficulty in ascertaining the position of the enemy and as the army was but two hours march in the rear he himself rode back to carry the news  at ten oclock the vendeans arrived and at once attacked the blues their main column throwing itself upon the centre of the position which it speedily forced leigonyers troops at rochette and verches were thereby threatened in flank and leigonyer who was himself present ordered the whole force to fall back to a position which he had before chosen as being favourable for giving battle behind doue  but the vendeans pressed forward with such eagerness that the retreat speedily degenerated into a rout and the troops for the most part throwing away their arms fled precipitately carrying the reserve with them to bourlan a strong position in front of saumur where general menou was stationed and where he succeeded in rallying them  leigonyer having from his previous experience great doubts as to whether he should be successful in his stand against the vendeans had taken the precaution to send back the waggons with the munitions and stores together with the artillery as his men had fled too rapidly to be overtaken the numerical loss was not great he himself in his report of the fight ascribed it to a cause that has been frequently used by the french to excuse their defeats namely that it was due to treachery for many of the men broke and fled directly the action began and these he avowed could have been none other than vendeans who had disguised themselves and enlisted for the purpose of causing discontent among the men and confusion in their ranks the first time they met the enemy  since the commencement of the campaign he had several times begged to be relieved of his command and to return to the post that he occupied previously he now repeated the demand saying that he had lost the confidence of his men and that a new commander would be far more likely to succeed with them this time the request was granted and general menou was appointed to succeed him  fortunately for leigonyer the commissioners of the convention reported most favourably of the activity and energy that he had personally shown and although he was accused of treachery in the assembly this report saved him from the guillotine  as soon as the fight was over cathelineau sent for leigh  it is of the greatest importance that we should know what is passing at saumur we have learned from one of the officers who is a prisoner in our hands that biron is at tours and is endeavouring to persuade the paris battalions that have arrived there to march at once to saumur they have absolutely refused to do so until the arrival of the cannon that were promised to them before they left paris they may by this time be marching towards saumur with or without their cannon general salomon is at thouars with a considerable force and it is possible that he also may march to aid in the defence of saumur and as he has in addition to the new levies a fine battalion of gendarmes his arrival at saumur would greatly increase the strength of the defence  i should say that half your scouts had better go to thouars and should there be any considerable movement of troops there they should bring me word at the greatest possible speed we shall tomorrow march forward and take post facing the enemys positions and on the ninth shall attack i tell you this in order that your scouts may know where to find me  to you with the other half of your party i give the charge of watching saumur if one or two of them could cross the loire and watch the road between tours and saumur and bring me speedy word if they see a large body of troops coming along we should know what force we have to encounter and act accordingly  you shall have news general leigh said and saluting at once joined his band  jean who had been talking with him when the message from cathelineau arrived and had waited to hear what his orders were said as he came up  you and your regiment are off on an adventure again leigh  yes we are going to watch thouars and saumur and to find out if possible if the battalions from paris are on their way from tours  the first will be easy enough but unless you swim the loire i dont see how the second is to be managed  i should think that a boat might be obtained at one of the villages on the river bank anyhow i shall get across somehow  andre was ordered to take his party to thouars  remember leigh said there is to be no fighting not a shot must be fired i want you and another to enter the town if possible from the other side to see whether there is any unusual excitement and especially whether there is any stir among the troops that would seem to show that they are on the point of marching away you are to remain there until you see some such movement the lad that you are taking in with you must go out every hour to the spot where you have left the rest and one of these must at once start with your report to the general who will tomorrow be on his way to saumur and will halt not far from its works of defence having delivered his message he is to return to you for you must continue to send off messengers until you hear that there is fighting at saumur if the commander of the blues at thouars has not moved by that time you need remain no longer but return with your party and join the army  after andre had left leigh marched with pierre and the others to a spot up the river ten miles above saumur  can any of you swim he asked  three only of the party were able to reply in the affirmative  do you think that you could swim across the loire  all of them expressed great doubt of being able to do so  well at any rate i must take you with me he said to be able to swim a little is a good deal better than not to be able to swim at all for by making a faggot you will gain such support as will enable you to get across  now pierre you must for the present remain here tomorrow morning you can go into the village whose church tower you can see over there and find out whether the people there are for us or for the blues if they are for us you can show them cathelineaus order of which you have a copy and they will certainly provide you with a boat in that case cross the river with your party and take post on the opposite bank keeping the boat with you and a man who can row then as soon as one of my messengers arrives there you will send on my report to the general who tomorrow evening will be not far from saumur do the same with each messenger that arrives  if on reaching the bank opposite the village they do not find you there they will follow the opposite bank down until they are opposite to you then they will call and you unless anything has happened to drive you away will reply the messenger will then swim across with my report as in the other case you will send it forward at once and he will return to the spot i shall appoint  i see there is another village a mile below us i shall go there with my three followers tonight we will manage to steal a boat and row across i shall go to that village instead of the other because the loss of a boat may cause anger and even if well disposed to the cause they might not receive you well however i shall tie the boat up on the opposite bank when i leave it so that it will not drift away down the river and when they see it in the morning they will only have to send another boat across to fetch it over  i understand captain and will do my best to carry out your instructions even if i find that at the village above they are divided in opinion i shall surely be able to discover from their talk some who are on our side and who will arrange to bring a boat down to this spot in which case your messenger when he does not find us opposite the village will follow the bank down till he does so  at any rate pierre here are a couple of crowns so that you can arrange with a man for the hire of the boat and his services for twentyfour hours if necessary    chapter 8 the capture of saumur   the arrangements being now completed leigh and his band lay down in a thicket near the bank of the river and slept for some hours at one oclock in the morning leigh rose and with his three followers started for the village it was but twenty minutes walk not a soul was stirring not a light visible in any window  they found that three or four boats were lying by the bank leigh chose the smallest of these and loosening the head rope from the post to which it was fastened took his place in her with the others accustomed as he was to rowing from his childhood he soon reached the opposite bank here he fastened the boat up and struck across country until he reached the road then he sent one of his followers westward  you will follow the road he said until within a mile of tours then you will conceal yourself and watch who passes along if you see a large body of troops coming you will at once strike across country and make your way down to the village above that at which we crossed you heard the instructions that i gave to pierre if you find him and the others there with the boat you will report what you have seen he will send another messenger on with the news to cathelineau and you will remain with him until i arrive  if he is not there you will follow the bank of the river down to the other village you will give a shout as you pass the spot where we halted if no answer comes you will probably find pierre and the boat somewhere below you will not miss him for i have ordered him to post two of your comrades on the bank so that you cannot pass them unseen as in the first case you will remain with him until i arrive and your message will be carried to the general by another of his party  in case you do not find him at all you will know that i have returned before you and have taken him and the others on with me in that case you must make a faggot sufficiently large to support you in the water and swim across the river is low and it will not be many yards out of your depth  i could swim that without the faggot sir  yes but it is better to have it i dont suppose that you have ever swum in your clothes and you would find it heavy work therefore you had better rely upon the faggot to keep you up and with its aid you will have no difficulty in crossing  the morning now was breaking for in june the nights are short and after waiting for an hour leigh and his two companionsall of whom had divested themselves of their weapons and belts which they had left in pierres chargestarted for saumur in the presence of so large a number of troops with scarcely any training and discipline and with the excitement that would have been caused by the defeat of leigonyer and the prospect of an attack by the vendeans leigh felt confident that three country lads ran no risk of being questioned however he took the precaution of learning the name of the village he passed through six miles from the town so that if any one should happen to ask where they came from and what they were doing he could give the name of a village and say that they had merely come in from curiosity hearing that there was likely to be a battle assuredly many country people would be coming for the same purpose  they entered the town at six oclock it was already astir the citizens with anxious faces were talking together in little groups soldiers were loitering about in the streets totally regardless of the bugles and drums that were sounding in the marketplace and at various points outside the town the civil functionaries in their scarves of office hurried fussily about but for once they were unheeded but a week before a denunciation by any of these men would have been sufficient to ensure the arrest and imprisonment and probably the death of anyone against whom they had a grudge now they were in greater danger than those who had dreaded and hated them  at present there was no talk of politics among the groups of townspeople men who were the chief upholders of the regime of confiscation and murder and others who in their heart loathed and hated it were discussing the probabilities of an attack by the vendeans and what would happen were that attack to be successful would the town be given over to sack would there be a massacre and slaughter such as chalbos and other commanders of the blues had inflicted in the vendean villages through which they had passed the vendeans in arms were called by the blues the brigands would they behave like brigands or would they conduct themselves as royal and catholic soldiers as they called themselves  as the hours passed the streets became more crowded numbers of the country people came in to learn the news spies from doue had already brought in word that orders had been issued by cathelineau that the army should march at eight oclock for saumur and all doubt that it was their intention either to attack the town or to accept battle in the plain before it was at an end the assembly was sounded in all quarters of the town and presently parties of the mounted gendarmes rode through the streets and drove the soldiers to their rendezvous  presently leigh saw general menou and some other officers of rank enter a large house  who lives there he asked a woman who was standing near him  general duhoux he is in command you know but he has not recovered from a wound he got at chemille and is unable to ride  leigh had no doubt that a council of war was about to be held and bidding his companions wait for him at the end of the street he sauntered across the road and sat down on the pavement by the side of the entrance leaning against the wall he took from his pocket a hunk of the peasants black bread and cutting it up with his knife proceeded to munch it unconcernedly an officer and two or three troopers were standing by their horses heads in the road opposite the door evidently awaiting orders  in half an hour general menou himself came out and said to the officer  sir you will ride at once to thouars by way of loudun and deliver this despatch to general salomon it is most urgent when you hand it to him you can say that i begged you to impress upon him the necessity for losing not a moment of time it is all important that he should arrive here tonight for tomorrow morning we may be attacked take your troopers with you  the officer and his men mounted at once and rode off at full speed leigh remained quiet until menou and the other officers rode out from the courtyard and proceeded down the street followed by their escort then he got up stretched himself and walked slowly to the spot where his two comrades were awaiting him  i have learned what i wanted to know he said do you both make your way back to the spot where pierre will be awaiting us and tell him that i am going to swim the river a mile above the town he is to wait where he is until lucien comes back from tourswhich will not be till twelve oclock tonight for his orders are to remain within sight of the town till six in the afternoon if by that hour the troops there have not set out they will not arrive until after we have captured saumur  saunter along quietly there is no hurry  after they had set out he too strolled out of the town kept along the road for another half mile and then struck off across the fields towards the river arrived there he took off his heavy country shoes tied them round his waist and waded out into the river he had but some thirty yards to swim as soon as he reached the opposite bank he poured the water out of his shoes put them on again and set out at a run he had to make a detour so as to get beyond the eminences on which the republican troops were posted and after running for a couple of miles came down on the road  a short distance farther he arrived at a village a peasant with a horse and cart was standing in front of a cabaret  do you want to earn two crowns he asked the man  the latter nodded  two crowns are not easily earned he said i was just starting for montreuil but if it pays me better to go in another direction i must put that journey off until tomorrow  i want you to carry me to doue he said at the best speed of which your horse is capable  the countryman looked at him doubtfully his clothes were not yet dry leigh saw that the man was not sure of his power to fulfil his promise he therefore produced two crowns and held them up  by saint matthew he said it is the first silver i have seen for months i will take you  leigh jumped up beside the peasant the latter at once whipped up his horse and started at a brisk trot  you know that the catholic army is there he asked  yes i know i belong to it myself i have been with it from the first  i would have taken you for nothing if you had said so before the man said we are all heart and soul with them here and if as they say they will come along here to attack saumur every man in the village will go with them how is it that you are here  i am an officer leigh said and have been in disguise into saumur to see what is going on there and am now taking the news back to cathelineau  conversation was difficult for the jolting of the cart was terrible and leigh found it next to impossible to talk he was well content when the belfries of doue came into sight on arriving at the town they drew up at the house where cathelineau and the generals had their quarters as he got down he offered the peasant the two crowns  no sir the man said i will not take a sou for my service we in this part have had no chance of doing anything and i should be ashamed indeed to take money from those who have been fighting for the good cause  as you say they will advance tomorrow i will wait here it may be that my cart will be useful and whether or no i shall stay if it is only to get a sight of cathelineau whose name we all reverence  i will tell him of your goodwill you had best remain here for a few minutes  he was about to enter when two armed peasants who were guarding the door stopped him  no one can enter the general is in council  do you not know me i am captain stansfield  the men drew back at once it was not strange that they did not recognize him he generally wore a sort of uniform with a red sash round his waist which was the distinguishing badge of the officers but had always adopted a peasant dress on setting out on an expedition there was no one to announce him and he entered a room where the leaders were sitting round a table  they looked up in surprise he was grimed with the dust which had risen in clouds as he drove along and his clothes bore signs of their immersion  back again monsieur cathelineau exclaimed and with news no doubt  very important news sir i have been in saumur and have learned that an officer has started for thouars by way of loudun with orders to general salomon to march instantly into saumur and that he is to arrive there tonight i left the town five minutes after the messenger threequarters of an hour later i struck the road two miles this side of saumur and have been brought here in a cart by a peasant it is now four oclock and i do not think that the officer would arrive at thouars before half past three  that is important news indeed cathelineau said  well gentlemen what do you think had best be done  it seems to me that nothing could be better monsieur de lescure said the enemys column cannot start until five oclock at the earliest it will be dark before they can arrive at saumur i know the road well it runs in several places through woods and where this is not the case there are high hedges  nothing could be more suitable for an ambuscade i propose that half of our force should march at once and take post on the other side of montreuil it will be nearly sunset before salomon can arrive at that town and if we engage him at dusk he will lose half the benefit of the discipline of the regiment of gendarmes who will no doubt accompany him  i quite approve of that plan monsieur cathelineau said  are you all of the same opinion gentlemen  there was a general expression of assent  will you general bonchamp with monsieur de lescure take command of that force i myself will proceed with the rest of our army until past the point where the road from montreuil falls into that from this town in that way if general bonchamp fails to arrest salomons march we can fall upon him and on the other hand if the firing should be heard at saumur and menou leads out a force to assist salomon we can oppose him  general dommaigne your cavalry would be useless in the attack on salomon while it might be of great value if menou comes out  you have rendered us another good service monsieur stansfield if salomon had thrown another four thousand men into saumur including his regiment of gendarmes it would have been a serious business to take the place whereas with the troops menou has half of whom are leigonyers fugitives i do not anticipate any great difficulty  i shall be glad general if you would speak a word to the good fellow who brought me here i had bargained with him for two crowns but when he found that i was one of your officers he refused to receive anything and moreover he said that he would remain here with his cart until tomorrow as perhaps he might be useful in carrying stores he expressed the greatest desire to see you  certainly i will speak to him cathelineau said as he sent out to give orders for the church bells to ring and the horns to blow  the man was standing by his cart a short distance off in the hope of catching sight of cathelineau the general at once walked up to him  this is general cathelineau leigh said  the countryman took off his hat and dropped on his knees  get up my good fellow cathelineau said i am but a vendean peasant like yourself i thank you for the good service that you have rendered by bringing monsieur stansfield so quickly to us the time it has saved may make all the difference to us and in the future you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have played an important part in the capture of saumur  in five minutes the quiet street was crowded with men the peasants had encamped in the fields round the town and at the summons caught up their arms and ran in hastily feeling sure that the occasion was important as they had been told that they were not to march until next morning  the divisions commanded by monsieur de lescure and general bonchamp speedily gathered round the distinguishing flags of those officers other leaders joined them with their followers until some ten thousand men were gathered outside the town  leigh had changed his clothes and mounted his horse monsieur de lescure having invited him to ride with him as they were about to start one of andres messengers arrived with the news that an officer and three troopers had arrived at the town and that ten minutes later the trumpets were sounding the assembly  it is well that we got your news first monsieur de lescure said to leigh for otherwise we could hardly have got our forces together and been ready for a start until it was too late to intercept salomon  the route of the column was by a byroad between doue and montreuil it was seven oclock before they approached the town then striking off the road they marched through the fields until a mile and a half to the east of it when they halted in a thick wood they were now divided into three columns of equal strength that under monsieur de lescure occupied the wood on one side of the road that under monsieur bonchamp the other side the third column were posted in rear of the wood and were to thickly line the hedges that bordered it  it was just dusk when the force from thouars came along it consisted of three thousand six hundred men with four pieces of cannon it was allowed to pass nearly through the wood when a heavy fire was opened upon it on both flanks  the regiment of gendarmes which led the column showed great coolness and animated by their example the whole force remained steady darkness came on but it was not until eleven oclock that there was any change in the situation owing to the darkness in the forest neither side was able to distinguish its foes the men fired only at the flashes of the muskets  lescure then sent round four or five hundred men who suddenly fell upon the baggage train of the enemy the guard were completely taken by surprise many of the carters cut the ropes and traces and galloped off delighted to escape from a service into which they had for the most part been dragged against their will  the alarm thus begun spread rapidly the young troops who encouraged by the example of the gendarmes had so far stood their ground at once lost heart the darkness of the night their ignorance as to the strength of the force that had attacked the rear and the fear that all retreat would be cut off would have shaken older soldiers than these and in spite of the efforts of their officers the wildest confusion soon reigned  the vendeans pressed their attack more hotly and general salomon seeing that unless a retreat was made while there was yet time a terrible disaster might take place ordered the gendarmes to fall back in good order the movement was effected without great loss in the darkness it was impossible for lescure and the other leaders to get their men together and to press hard upon their retreating foes and they were well satisfied at having carried out the object of their expedition and prevented the force from thouars from entering saumur  word was sent to cathelineau that salomon had fallen back and the peasants then lay down till morning  andre with his little band had joined the force when fighting began they had as soon as salomon started from thouars followed his movements at a distance from time to time sending off a messenger to doue giving an account of the progress of the enemy as soon as the firing broke out in the wood andre with the twelve who still remained with him joined the combatants and finding that leigh was with monsieur de lescure was not long in discovering him  you have done very well andre he said i dont think anything will come of this fighting it is getting dark already and i have no fear now that the blues will break through neither party will be able to see the other in this wood and certainly you could do no good with your pistols practically few are engaged on either side the blues have made one effort and finding that we have a very strong force in their front have given up the attempt to push forward i dont believe that the new levies have courage enough to keep steady through a whole nights uncertainty  you had best draw off some distance and rest till you hear by the firing that some change has taken place if you hear that the blues are retreating follow them at a distance it is important for the generals to know what course they are taking they may halt in montreuil they may return to thouars they may retire to niort or parthenay  if they remain in montreuil let us know at once because in that case we shall have to stay here in case they should attempt to push on again if they go farther we need have no more concern about them still it would be of great importance to our generals to know whether they return to thouars or retire farther south  very well captain i will see that you are kept informed  you had better instruct your first messengers to come straight here cathelineau and the rest of the forces started directly we did and will halt at the junction of the roads and are likely to remain there all day tomorrow therefore if your messengers find the wood deserted they have simply to follow the road and they will either overtake us or find us with cathelineau  how long must we follow the blues  there is no occasion to go any great distance i do not suppose that we shall pursue them they could certainly defend themselves at montreuil and we should not risk suffering heavy loss and having the men dispirited by failure when all are needed for the work at saumur if you follow them far enough to determine whether they are retiring on thouars or are marching towards niort that is all that is necessary and you will be able to rejoin us in plenty of time to see the fight at saumur  as leigh thought would be probable monsieur de lescure restrained the peasants from following in pursuit when the blues retreated the latter had left two of their guns behind them and a number of carts laden with ammunition and provisions for the march fell into the peasants handsthe latter providing them with breakfast before they started early next morning rejoining cathelineaus force two hours later these had been apprised some hours before by one of the mounted gentlemen who had accompanied the column of the success that had attended the operation and they were received with great joy by their comrades on their arrival  cathelineau with general bonchamp and a small escort of cavalry had ridden towards saumur to examine the positions occupied by the enemy and to discuss the plan of attack they now felt confident of success unless indeed biron should come up in the course of the day with the paris brigade at tours together with its guns the description that leigh had given of the confusion and want of discipline in the garrison showed that it could not be relied upon for hard fighting and as it was certain that the failure of salomon to get through to its assistance would be known in saumur early in the day it could not but add to the dismay produced by the advance against the town  this was indeed the case as artillery had not been employed on either side the sound of the conflict did not reach the town however as the officer who had taken the order to thouars returned at seven oclock saying that salomon was preparing to march and would assuredly arrive some time in the evening the anxiety increased hour by hour and by midnight the conviction that he must have been attacked by the enemy and had failed to get through became a certainty and spread dismay through the town  at five in the morning a mounted messenger brought a despatch from salomon saying that he had fought for four hours near montreuil against a large force of the enemy and that another column of these having fallen on his rear he found it necessary to retire as a panic was spreading among the national guard and a serious disaster would have happened had he continued his attempts to push on in the evening generals coustard and berthier who had been sent by biron to act under menous orders arrived in the town and santerre the brewer of paris who had been the leader of the mob there and was now a general arrived next morning  cathelineaus army was astir early the leaders had been gladdened by the arrival at five oclock of a messenger from pierre saying that one of his messengers had come in from tours and that up to seven oclock in the evening no troops had left that city it was therefore certain that the garrison of saumur could receive no assistance from that quarter  breakfast was eaten and the army then formed up in its divisions mass was celebrated and it then set out for saumur  in that town all was confusion and dismay the newly arrived generals were strangers alike to the town its defences and the troops they were to command in front of the works defending saumur ran the river dives which fell into the loire a mile or so below the town it was crossed by a bridge but so great was the confusion that in spite of the representations of the civil authorities no steps were taken either to cut or guard it  it was not until three oclock in the afternoon that the vendeans approached the town and general menou sent two battalions of the line one of volunteers and eighty horse under the orders of general berthier to take possession of a chateau in front of the position two hundred and fifty men were posted in a convent near it santerre commanded the force which was to defend the intrenchments at nantilly and coustard the troops who occupied the heights of bourlan  at four oclock the skirmishers on both sides were hotly engaged the vendeans advanced in three columnsthe central one against the post occupied by berthier the left against nantilly and the right threatened to turn the position at beaulieu  berthier allowed the force advancing against him to approach within a short distance of the chateau and then poured a storm of grape into it from a battery that he had established lescure who was in command was badly wounded the head of the column fell into confusion and berthier at once attacked them with his two regiments of the line and for a time pressed the column back his little body of cavalry whom he had ordered to charge fell back as soon as the vendeans opened fire upon them and the latter then attacked the line battalions with such fury that berthier was obliged to call up his regiment of volunteers cathelineau sent reinforcements to his troops and these pressed on so hotly that berthier who had had a horse shot under him was obliged to fall back and the exulting vendeans rushed forward and carried the faubourg of fenet  dommaigne with his cavalry charged the cuirassiers and the german legion there was a sharp fight dommaigne was killed and the colonel of the german legion desperately wounded but a body of the vendean infantry coming up took the cuirassiers in flank with their fire and they fell back into saumur  general menou had been in the thick of the fight and had three horses killed under him he sent another battalion to reinforce berthier but as soon as they came within shot of the vendeans they broke and fled  the two line battalions reinforced by four companies of gendarmes kept up a heavy fire the artillery until now had zealously supported them but their ammunition was failing menou and berthier placed themselves at the head of the cavalry and called upon them to charge but instead of doing so they raised their favourite cry of treason and galloped back to the town  the line regiments and gendarmes pressed more and more hotly and finding themselves without support withdrew in good order into saumur the vendeans had now possession of all the works in the centre of the defenders line coustard seeing that the centre was lost and that the vendeans were moving towards a bridge across the dives by which alone they could enter the town ordered two battalions with two pieces of cannon to hold it he was not only disobeyed but with shouts of treason they rushed upon him and with difficulty he escaped with his life  the vendeans seized the bridge and established a battery for its defence coustard saw that it must be recaptured as the town was now open to the enemy and ordered a detachment of cuirassiers commanded by colonel weissen to carry the bridge the two battalions of infantry now promised to follow  although he saw that to charge the battery with a handful of cavalry was to ride to almost certain death weissen gallantly led his men forward the infantry followed for a short distance but being taken in flank by a volley from a party of vendeans they broke and fled the cavalry were almost annihilated and weissen was desperately wounded two or three of his men alone riding back  the main force of coustards division in the redoubts at bourlan had not been attacked and retired to angers during the night the rout of the rest of the defenders was now complete and the town open  la rochejaquelein by whose side leigh and a small party of gentlemen rode had made a succession of desperate charges into the midst of the fugitives and he now said to leigh and three other gentlemen  come along we will see what they are doing in the town  then dashing forward at full speed they passed through the gate entered the main street and found that it contained a battalion of infantry retreating so cowed were these that they opened their ranks and allowed the five horsemen to dash through them then they made a tour of the place and returned to inform the vendeans who were just entering that all resistance had ceased as on two previous occasions the flying republicans owed their safety to the piety of the peasants who instead of pursuing at once rushed into the churches where the cures who had accompanied them returned thanks for the victory that had been gained and thus lost the half hour of daylight that would have been invaluable  cathelineau after a consultation with lescure and bonchamp decided that it would be useless to attempt a pursuit in the dark berthiers battalion was too unbroken the generals finding that there was no pursuit might have rallied a considerable number of the others when the peasants coming up in the dark could in turn have been repulsed with heavy loss saumur had been taken with all its stores of cannon ammunition and provisions and it was considered that under the circumstances it was best to be contented with the signal success they had gained  berthier and menou indeed although both severely wounded had covered the retreat with the line regiments and gendarmes and carried off with them seven cannon which they came across as they passed through the town and would have given the peasants a warm reception had they followed them the rest of the army were hopelessly scattered and continued their flight all night some towards tours others to angers their reports causing the wildest dismay in both towns  had charette who had always acted independently in lower vendee been persuaded at this moment to join hands with cathelineau there can be little question that they might have marched to paris without encountering any serious resistance and that their arrival there would have changed the whole course of events unfortunately however he was himself sorely pressed by several columns of the enemy and was with difficulty holding his own the great opportunity was therefore lost never to return  the castle of saumur was still in the hands of the blues five hundred of the national guards of the town and about the same number of men of different regiments threw themselves into it before the vendeans entered carrying with them what provisions they could lay hands upon the wives of the national guards soon surrounded the chateau crying to their friends to surrender and asserting that if they did not do so the vendeans would give the town over to pillage and fire for a time the commandant resisted their entreaties but feeling that his position was desperate and that there was no hope of relief he surrendered  in the morning the garrison marched out the officers were allowed to retain their sidearms and the men to return to their homes eighty cannon fell into the hands of the victors many thousands of muskets a large quantity of ammunition and very many prisoners  here as at other places the peasants behaved with great moderation the agents of the convention who had tyrannized the town so long were thrown into prison as were their chief supporters but private property was untouched on the following day there was a council at which lescure seriously wounded as he was was present it was agreed that it was indispensable that one man should be appointed commanderinchief many difficulties had arisen from independent action by generals and leaders of bands more or less numerous and it was necessary that all should act under the orders of a recognized head  when this was agreed to the question had to be decided as to who should be appointed to this responsible post the claims of lescure la rochejaquelein delbee bonchamp cathelineau and stofflet were almost even each had a large band of followers all had been unwearied in their devotion to the cause  it is probable that lescure would have been chosen he was the largest landed proprietor and was of the highest rankwith the exception of rochejaquelein who had although the idol of the army scarcely experience and ballast enough to take so responsible a position lescure himself however proposed that cathelineau should be chosen his influence was great his talents unquestionable and the simple honesty of his character his modesty and untiring zeal in the cause alike recommended him  lescure felt that if he himself bonchamp or delbee were chosen jealousies might arise and the cause suffer  his choice was felt by all to be a good one and cathelineau was unanimously appointed to the post of commanderinchief no finer tribute was ever paid to the virtues and talent of a simple peasant than such a choice made by men so greatly his superior in rank and station    chapter 9 bad news   neither leigh nor jean martin was at saumur when this decision was arrived at the very night that the town was taken one of the formers band who was wounded and greatly against his inclination had been left behind arrived there on horseback he was the bearer of terrible news  illustration he was the bearer of terrible news  early on the previous day a troop of the enemys cavalry had arrived they had apparently ridden all night and without exciting any alarm on the way they had made straight for the chateau without going into the village beyond the fact that they belonged to the force operating from nantes none knew the route they had followed they had doubtless expected to arrest jean at the chateau but on finding him absent had seized his wife had placed her in their midst set fire to the chateau and ridden off before any force could be gathered to oppose them jean and leigh were horror stricken at the news  what is to be done the former exclaimed what can be done  i should say leigh said that the first thing to do will be to tell the generals that we must for the present leave them then we must go to nantes in disguise find out where she is imprisoned and see what can be done to rescue her  certainly that is the best thing leigh let us start at once  it will be daylight in two hours jean and that will make no difference i will go and talk with my boys they are asleep together on the steps of the church of saint marie they may be useful to us and i am sure would follow us anywhere  jean made no reply he had buried his face in his hands and deep sobs broke from him tears were streaming down leighs cheek as he spoke but he put his hand upon jeans shoulder and said in a voice which he tried to keep steady  it is terrible jean but we must not give up hope we have beaten the blues in the field and it is hard if we cannot manage to beat them somehow in this business  the other made no reply and leigh feeling that it would be best to leave him to himself for the present went downstairs  the lad who had brought the message was seated against the wall holding the horses bridle in his hand being a stranger in the place he did not know where to go  come with me philippe the others are all in the great square a hundred yards away they got their bread yesterday morning and will have plenty of it left for you and the horse it can take a drink at the fountain in the centre  ah he exclaimed stopping suddenly you said nothing about the child and we did not think to ask did my sister take it away with her or was it left  i did not hear captain my mother ran into the house crying and said  the blues have come and have set fire to the chateau and carried madame away prisoner take the horse and ride to the army and tell monsieur martin what has happened  i ran into the stable and saddled it took two loaves of bread one for him and one for myself and started i should have been here in the middle of the day but i lost my way in the lanes last night and had to stop till daylight and even then rode for a long time in the wrong direction  leaving the lad and horse in the middle of the square leigh went to the steps of the church a great number of peasants were sleeping there he was not long in finding his own band he roused andre and pierre with some difficulty for having both been up all the previous night they slept heavily  come with me leigh said as soon as they were sufficiently roused to understand who was speaking to them i want to have a talk with you  i have some bad news he went on as they passed beyond the sleepers the blues have been at the chateau they have burned it down and have carried off madame martin  exclamations of rage broke from both the lads patsey had during the months she had spent on the estate made herself extremely popular among the peasantry whose cottages she constantly visited and who always found her ready to listen to their tales of trouble and to supply dainty food for the sick the thought too that the chateau had been burned down was also a blow for all the tenantry considered that they had a personal interest in the affairs of their seigneur  how was it that there was no defence andre asked i know that most of the men were away but surely enough might have been gathered to keep the blues back until madame escaped to the woods  it seems they rode by night and arrived there soon after day broke they had evidently come on purpose to seize your lord for as soon as they found that he was not there they went away at once only stopping to set fire to the chateau they were evidently in a hurry to be off  here is philippe rehan who has brought the news he only knows what i have told you as he mounted and rode off at once  i suppose they have taken our young lord too  philippe does not know about that he says they came from the direction of nantes and no doubt my sister has been taken there  what is to be done captain andre asked as he and pierre looked at each other helplessly in face of this trouble  monsieur martin and i are going to leave at once we dont know what we are going to do yet but we shall certainly try by all means to get her out of prison how it is to be managed we have not even thought but if it can be done we shall do it now i am sure that we can rely upon your assistance  we will do anything andre exclaimed while pierre said we will be cut to pieces for you captain  leigh gave a hand to each  i am sure of it he said and the band  every one of those we had at first we could answer for andre replied and i believe that the others can be trusted too they all esteem it a high honour to have been received into the band of cathelineaus scouts they knew that there would be danger when they joined and that they must be prepared to die for the cause all would certainly be faithful there would be no fear about that  i have not the least idea at present what i shall want you to do but at any rate we shall go to nantes and it is there that you must meet us we shall ride off in an hours time let the others sleep till there is a general movement then you can tell them what has happened and that my orders are that you shall march home at once you can be there by tomorrow night can you not  it will be two long marches but we will be there captain  we shall not be much before you by that time we shall have determined how we shall set about the matter and shall be able to give you instructions which will probably be that you are to meet us at some point we will arrange just outside the town of course you will not go in a body but singly or in pairs crossing the river at various points and travelling by different roads enter the town as if you belonged to villages round  i will ask monsieur de la rochejaquelein to let you have another pistol each before you leave of course you will hide your arms under your clothes i dont know that it will be necessary to use force of course at first we shall try bribery  at any rate you will both be most useful in obtaining information there are very many people who know monsieur martin by sight and a few who know me possibly some of your band may have friends in nantes and these if they are of our party would be able to ask questions and to find out the place in which my sister is imprisoned much better than strangers could do  we have heard nothing of what is passing in nantes for many weeks and as they have sent troops to arrest monsieur martin it is possible that his father may also be arrested if he is at liberty he would be sure to know where my sister is imprisoned  the day was breaking now and leigh went next to the large house which had been set apart for the use of the generals he knew rochejaqueleins room having been chatting with him till late the evening before the young count sat up in bed as he opened the door  you have given me a start leigh he said with a smile i was dreaming that the blues had retaken the town and when the door opened thought that it was a party come to make me prisoner  is there any bad news you look grave  bad news as far as jean martin and i are concerned a messenger arrived two hours ago with the news that a party of blues from nantes arrived at his chateau without being observed as they had travelled all night and reached it at daybreak they had no doubt been specially sent to arrest jean but finding that he was away they burnt the chateau and carried off my sister a prisoner  we are going to start at once i trust that you will explain to the other generals the cause of our absence  i am sorry indeed to hear your news rochejaquelein said warmly a curse upon the blues why cant they content themselves with making war on men without persecuting and massacring women  certainly i will explain to cathelineau and the others the cause of your absence but what are you thinking of doing  that we have not even considered we mean to get her out of their hands if possible but until we see whether she has been really taken to nantesof which i have little doubtwhich prison she is placed in and how it is guarded we can form no plan if possible we shall bribe the jailers if not we will try to rescue her by force  i am taking my band with me i can depend upon them and there is no one in nantes on whom we can rely they will of course enter the town singly and will i am sure give us their loyal service should we require it  if they serve you as well as they serve the cause you could scarce have better assistants i would that i could go with you it would be an adventure after my own heart but private friendship must give way to our countrys needs i hope leigh that it will not be long before we meet again and that i may hear that you have been successful  half an hour later leigh and jean martin started the latters first question when leigh returned had been regarding the child it was now nearly fifteen months old but in the terrible shock caused by the news of his wife having been carried off jean had not thought of it till leigh had left the room  the child is as nothing to me he said when leigh had told him that the messenger had heard nothing of it it would have been some day but so far tis as nothing compared to patsey it slept with the nurse and may possibly have escaped unless indeed patsey wished to take it with her  i do not think that she would do that leigh said no doubt it would have been a comfort to have it with her but she would have known that its chances of life would be slight indeed and for your sake she would have concealed it if possible before she was seized  they reached the ruins of the chateau at noon next day having stopped for the night at chemille in order to rest their horses and keep them in condition for another long ride if necessary the outhouse had been left standing francois came out on hearing the sound of the horses hoofs  thank god you are back master he said it has been a terrible time  is the child safe or was it taken with its mother jean asked  he is safe sir marthe saved it when madame heard the blues ride up and looked out and saw their uniforms she ran into marthes room and said  hide the child marthe run with it downstairs without waking it and put it in a cupboard in the kitchen they will never think of searching for it there then return to your bed again tell your master when he comes back again i have left little louis for him  i was getting up when i heard the horsemen and guessed that it was the blues and without waiting a moment dropped from my window and ran past the stable and hid myself in the shrubbery behind it i had scarcely done so when i heard them come round the house  then there was a great knocking at the door and a minute later a pistol shot was fired i heard afterwards that madame told henri to open the door as he did so the officer of the blues shot him through the head  for ten minutes i heard nothing more then someone came to the stable took out the two horses and then set fire to it looking out through the bushes i saw the smoke coming out from two or three windows of the chateau then i made off as quickly as i could got into the church and set the bells ringing thinking that it might frighten off the blues though i knew that the men were all away and there was no chance of help  soon they came riding along at full speed and i saw madame in the middle of them as soon as they had gone the women all ran out from their houses we tried our best to put out the flames but the fire had too much hold  as we were doing this i saw marthe with the child in her arms it had been saved wellnigh by a miracle she said and she told me how her mistress had run in to her she caught up the child and then thinking that if they saw its clothes they would search for it she opened the drawers seized them all and ran down and put them and the child into the kitchen cupboard as her mistress had told her then ran back to her bedroom and began to dress  she heard her mistress call to henri to go down and open the door she heard the pistol shot and the blues pour into the house she hurried on her clothes and went out they were searching all over the chateau the officer came up to her with a pistol in his hand  where is your master he said  i do not know she replied he rode away from here ten days ago and has not been back since  that is the tale your mistress tells he said  it is true sir you go into the village and ask any of the women there they will tell you the same thing i will swear on the cross that it is so  he seemed very angry but turned away from her presently the mistress came down under a guard of two soldiers and as she passed she said  goodbye marthe tell your master that i am thankful indeed that he was not here  then the officers told the men to set fire to the house in a dozen places they had all got bundles having taken everything they thought of value as soon as they had set fire to the curtains everywhere and saw that the flames had got a good hold they mounted and rode off  they had not searched the kitchen much as they had only opened the closets large enough for a man to hide in and not expecting to find anything worth taking had not troubled themselves to look into the small ones so marthe had only to take the child out fortunately it had not awoke when we found that it was hopeless to try and put the fire out marthe took the child over to the farm of madame rehan who as soon as she got the news of the mistress being carried off had sent her son away on horseback to tell you  thank god the child has been spared jean martin said reverently we will go to the cures  the boys will all be back tonight give the horses a good feed we shall set out perhaps tonight perhaps tomorrow morning  ah monsieur martin the cure said as they entered his house this is a sad homecoming for you if we had known that the blues were coming but a quarter of an hour before they arrived we could have got madame away to a place of safety i knew nought about it until the church bells began to ring just as i was about to go out five minutes later to learn the cause i saw them ride past with madame martin in their midst we did not know that there were any of them within twenty miles of us and thought that there was no chance whatever of their coming to a little village like ours  they came no doubt for me jean said gloomily if they had found leigh and myself at home they would not have taken the place so easily he and i and the two men could have made a stout defence i hear that there were not more than twenty of them and i warrant that there would not have been many of them left when the fight was over  i am sure the cure said that if you had been there and the place had been defended all the women within sound of the church bell would have come in with arms and would have fought like men in the defence of yourself and madame but as it was the whole thing was such a surprise with everyone in bed and asleep that the enemy were off before anyone could think of what had best be done as it was the women from all the farms round were here armed with hatchets or pitchforks half an hour after the bell began to ring of course in the village here we knew that it was too late to do anything but to flock to the church and pray for the safety of our good lady  thank you my friend leigh and i are going to nantes to see if anything can be done to get her out of prison leighs band are coming also of course they will travel singly if of no other use they will be better able to ask questions than we  i am going over now to rehans farm to see my boy and to thank marthe for saving him  it was well managed indeed the priest said i went over yesterday to see the child and the nurse told me how its escape had been contrived it was a happy thought on the part of its mother and the woman carried it out well  but before you go you must take a meal i am sure that you must want it  i will not say no to that jean replied for we have not broken our fast this morning  in half an hour the cures table was most abundantly furnished for as soon as the news spread through the village that the seigneur had arrived and was at the house of the priest the women brought in little presentsa dozen eggs a fowl or some trout that had been caught by the boys in the stream that morning  one or two of the women volunteered to assist the cures servant three fowls were hastily plucked cut asunder and grilled over the fire as soon as they were nearly ready they were placed in front of the fire to be finished while the trout took their place the repast began with these the fowls followed and it was concluded with an omelette  i have not eaten such a meal father martin said since i rode away i think after this i shall be able to take a more hopeful view of matters in that respect the meal will be thrown away upon leigh for he always takes the brightest view of everything and has never ceased to assure me that we are sure to manage to get my wife out of the hands of these villains somehow and as he has so far always succeeded in what he has attempted i feel a good deal of faith in him i should be as hopeful as he if i knew that the henriette was in the river at nantes and that i had to my hand a dozen stout fellows i could thoroughly rely on  after paying a visit to the farm praising marthe and arranging that she should continue to live there they returned to the village  we will go over to the chateau leigh before we do anything else i want to see how hot the ruins are  i should think that they must be pretty cool by this time jean you see it is nearly four days since it was burnt  i have no doubt that the walls will be cool enough but there was a lot of woodwork about it when the roof fell in it would smother the fire for a time but it might go on smouldering even now  but what does it matter jean  it matters a good deal i have with me only a hundred francs in paper which is not worth above a third of its face value i have here four thousand in gold which i brought with me from nantes as soon as the troubles began i buried it one day under the hearthstone of the kitchen thinking it possible that the blues might come here the money is of the utmost importance now for we may want it to bribe some of the jailers and therefore i must get it even if it delays us for a day  they found indeed that as they had feared there was still fire among the mass of debris  we must quench it before we can do anything jean i have no doubt that the women will help  francois was at once sent round and in a short time all the women in the place were assembled with pails martin and francois worked the windlass of the well the women carried pails of water and leigh threw the contents on to the smouldering mass above where he knew the kitchen fireplace must have stood clouds of steam rose and from time to time some of the women with rakes pulled off the upper layer of ashes they worked till nightfall by which time steam had ceased to rise  that will do for tonight jean said we will finish the job tomorrow morning your band will be here by that time and will help us to get some of these heavy beams and timbers out of the way we can then rake the smaller stuff out and get at the fireplace  at eight oclock the band arrived leigh went down and spoke to them and thanked them for the two long marches they had made he had during the afternoon obtained a supply of bread and wine and after they fell out a meal was eaten before they started for their homes promising to be back at six in the morning to aid in the work of clearing away the debris  jean and leigh spent a couple of hours in talk with the cure and related to him the events that had passed since they had left then thoroughly tired out they retired to the room that had been prepared for them the work that afternoon had been heavy they had had a long ride previously and neither had slept much the night before  the next morning the work was recommenced during the night the fire had crept in again from the surrounding mass but there were plenty of hands now and in an hour it was again extinguished the hearthstone was soon cleared and raised and martin brought out a crock in which he had placed the gold  now leigh he said you had better have a talk with your boys and arrange where they are to meet you i should not press any of them who are unwilling to go this is a private business and i do not think that it would be right to urge them  certainly not leigh agreed i am quite sure that all our boys will go with us both for patseys sake and because they are furious at the chateau being burnt down as to the others i shall put it to them that they are perfectly free to do as they wish they can go with us or they can rejoin the army just as they like  if they go i think that it would be as well that they did not enter the town but should take up their quarters in a copse or in a deserted house a mile or two away so that we could call them if we wanted them even in a town like nantes forty strange boys wandering about might be noticed  martin after seeing that the workers all had refreshment went to the cures as he never interfered in any way with the boys thinking that it might lessen leighs authority were he to do so  now i want to talk to you all leigh said after they had drunk their wine and eaten their bread in the first place do i understand that all who were first with me are ready to run a considerable risk to attempt with us to carry off madame martin from the hands of the blues and to save her from the fate that falls upon every one that they once lay a hand upon  they are all willing captain andre said we spoke to them again just before we came in last night and they all said that they were willing and anxious  good remember lads that it is not too late to draw back now  we should not dare show our face in the village again pierre said if we were to hang back when there was a chance of our being of service to so good a lady  i thank you with all my heart leigh said i tell you fairly that i expected such an answer those who have shown such courage as you have done and have been so loyal to the promises made me when i first enrolled you would i felt certain not hang back now now do you draw aside for a minute or two while i speak to the others  there was a movement and the two groups stood apart  your case is different from that of the others he said in the first place you have not been with me so long and secondlyand this is more importantthat madame martin is not the wife of your seigneur and that you owe no duty to her the enterprise on which we are going to start does not concern the cause for which we are fighting it is a private business and there is no occasion whatever for you to take part in it you are free either to choose an officer among yourselves or to rejoin the army find monsieur de la rochejaquelein and tell him that i sent you to him in order that he might find a suitable leader for you among the gentlemen with him i would rather that you talked the matter over among yourselves and came and gave me an answer in half an hour  will you tell us what we shall have to do captain one of them said  that i can hardly do for i do not know myself however i think it probable that the greater portion of the band would remain outside the town there are copses down by the riverside where you could wait in safety until you were wanted possibly you might not be wanted at all possibly you might be summoned to take part in so desperate an enterprise as storming one of the prisons of course it would be done at night when we should have the advantage of a surprise i can tell you no more than that  now my last word is i shall not think any the worse of you if you decide not to go with me  it wanted five minutes of the time when two of the boys returned to where he was talking with pierre and andre  we have decided captain you told us when you marched away from saumur that monsieur de la rochejaquelein had approved of your taking us and therefore we shall feel that we are still doing our duty to the cause you have been kind good and thoughtful while we have been with you all those of our own age in the army envied us who were of cathelineaus scouts and regarded our position as a great honour even if we were willing to go back we could not do so and tell the others that we had left you and our comrades when you were about to undertake some perilous service  but we do not wish it we all desire to remain with you and to follow wherever you may lead us and to die in your service if need be  leigh shook them warmly by the hand  bravely said and i thank you heartily i am proud of my scouts and am glad to see that my confidence in you is well founded call the others up  after thanking these also leigh addressed the whole of them  now i will give you your orders you must make your way by different routes to nantes there are many villages on the bank where you can find a boat that will take you across never travel more than two together you must all take the green ribbons off your hats leave your belts behind and hide your pistols if questions are asked you reply that you are going to get work at nantes where you have friends and that you are afraid to stay in your own villages  i will give each of you assignats for five francs it would not do to give you silver with this you can pay for your ferry across the water and buy food on the way it were best that both on this side of the river and the other you travel either by bylanes or through the fields  when you get near nantes keep close to the river and enter the last large copse before you get there andre or pierre are likely to be there first and will be on the lookout for you they will join me in the town and bring you orders when necessary and will send two or three of you in daily to buy food for the rest  i can give you no orders beyond that now i hope i shall meet you all in three days time at your rendezvous  pierre and andre you will on the evening after you arrive enter nantes following the river bank you will go along to a spot where a church faces the river sit down on its steps and wait for us until the clock strikes ten if we are not there return and come back the next evening if we are still not there you will know that some bad luck has befallen us and the band will then disperse and you will all find your way up home  i should advise you all to travel by night when you have once crossed the loire in that way you will avoid any risk of being questioned  the boys then dispersed and leigh returned to the priests he and martin had already talked over their disguises and had agreed that those of fishermen would be the most appropriate but until they could obtain the necessary clothes they would go in the attire of fairly welltodo people in a country town  we should only have to put on a tricolour scarf jean and should look like municipal authorities  it would go against the grain to put that rag on martin said but your idea is a good one and i would dress up as a general of the blues or as robespierre himself on such an errand as we are bound on  we cannot do better than go to clisson the place is in the hands of our people and the village authorities will not dare to ask us any questions  after dining with the cure they mounted and rode to clisson arriving there at five oclock in the afternoon they went to the leader of the force there as he was a friend of jeans  i will send and get you the things he said when they told him the object of their visit it is just as well if any of the people here are acting as spies for the blueswhich is likely enoughthat they should not be able to give any description of you we are all three about the same size therefore i will go out and buy two suits  as to the scarves i am more doubtful i doubt if any shopkeeper here would admit that he had even a bit of tricolour ribbon in his possession  it will not matter about that martin said and at any rate when we get beyond the ground held by us we shall find no difficulty whatever in getting a couple of cockades of those colours  thank you very much indeed he went on here are five louis i have no doubt that you will be able to lay them out well for us but remember please that although we are all three the same height i am some four or five inches bigger round the shoulders than leigh and want more room for my arms also  i will remember the other laughed just let me pass this string round you and then round monsieur stansfield and tie two knots in it and i will also measure you round the waist and leg  in an hour he returned with one of his men carrying two parcels  i had no difficulty in getting the clothes for your brotherinlaw he said but i had to go to two or three shops before i could get coat and breeches wide enough for you what do you intend to do with your horses  we shall ride into nantes as we are after nightfall and shall put them up at a small inn i know of one near the water it is kept by a man who was at one time in my lugger but he had his leg crushed in a storm and had to have it taken off he was a good sailor so i set him up and can rely upon him he will get fishermens clothes for us and should we have to stay there any time buy a boat and nets we may want such a thing badly  the clothes were tried on and found to fit fairly well in our days the shortwaisted coats with their long tails and the waistcoats extending below the waist would be deemed laughable but as it was then the fashion among the middle classes and especially the republicans jean saw nothing ridiculous in it while leigh smiled at the figures they cut both had bright yellow breeches and stockings and low shoes  they waited till midnight at clisson and then mounted again and by morning they were within a mile or two of a ferry a short distance above nantes they stopped at a small village and there purchased two tricolour cockades from the one shop it boasted these forming conspicuous objects in the window as a proof of the warm adherence of its owner to the convention  at the little cabaret they took breakfast and saw that the horses were fed then they rode on to the ferry the boat was on the opposite side and in half an hour it crossed then they took their places and were ferried over a party of soldiers were posted at the landing place  you are going to nantes i suppose citizens the officer in command asked  we are we come from vallet and are going to consult the commissary of the republic concerning some taxes that as we consider it is impossible for the town to pay which the commissary there has imposed upon us  i should imagine that your errand is scarcely likely to meet with success the officer said with a light smile i hear the same complaints at nantes but have not heard that any remission has been made well citizens at any rate i can wish you luck on your errand  it was still very early when they rode into nantes and but few people were about the streets trade was almost at a standstill the town which had been strongly republican was at once deeply discontented with the crushing taxation imposed upon it and horrified at the constant executions that took place almost every house had soldiers billeted on it as it was considered necessary to keep a large force there in order to overawe the south of brittany and if necessary to send supports to the generals operating in the west of la vendee  there was scarcely any shipping in the river and even the fishermen had almost given up plying their business their best customers had fallen under the guillotine and there was no demand for fish on fast daysfor to practise any of the observances of religion was considered to be in itself a proof of hostility to the convention therefore jean and leigh rode into the courtyard of the little inn without having attracted any attention whatever    chapter 10 preparations for a rescue   i have no accommodation for you here citizens a voice said as jean martin and leigh rode into the little courtyard and a man with a wooden leg came out from the side door of the inn  i think you might be able to manage for us brenon jean said  mon dieu it is  jean held up his hand sharply  yes it is i citizen gallon from vallet it is not often that i stir so far from home but i had business here  well well i will see what i can do for you comrade but as you know i dont profess to take in horses my clients come from the waterside and generally my stable is full of their baskets and ropes however i will see what i can do i will tie them up in that shed for the present and then clear out a stall for them afterwards  the horses were led to a shed encumbered with fishing gear of all sorts  what madness has seized you mon capitaine to put your head into this lions den  i will tell you presently brenon when we get inside i am glad that you are able to take the horses in we dont want to be stared at or talked about we have come along the river bank and so far we have been quite unnoticed  all the better all the better to be noticed here means to have ones head cut off now i will take you to a little room upstairs where there is no chance of anyone seeing you  get us up if you can without our being noticed by your servants brenon we shall be differently dressed when we come down again  the man nodded  the boy is in the front room he said there are three or four fishermen there having their morning glass i have no other servants my wife does what is needful for i was obliged to discharge the girl we had everything has been so slack of late  he led them up to a chamber looking on to the quay jean was puzzled at the mans manner for he spoke in a confused and hesitating way when he closed the door behind him he stood rubbing his hands together nervously  have you heard lately from nantes monsieur jean  no it is five weeks since i had any news except of course what was known about the troops that were here what is it old friend is there bad news  there is terrible news brenon said so bad that i dont know how to tell you  speak out old friend i have had one blow so heavy that i can scarcely be hurt more than i am  well then monsieur your father has been arrested and is in the prison and you know what that means  father arrested jean exclaimed on what grounds he never expressed an opinion as to public affairs that at heart he hated what has been going on i know but he never spoke strongly even to me and when i have heard his opinion asked he has always replied that he was a trader and that a man could not give his attention to business if he worried himself over politics he attended to his trade and left it to those who liked to manage the government of the country  what of my mother and sister  they are safe monsieur he sent them off a fortnight before in disguise to la rochelle at least so i have heard from the fishermen and as the henriette was lying there at the time and sailed two days after there is not much doubt but that they sailed in her for england  your father was denounced before the committee of public safety as one who was hostile to the convention he was accused of having sent large sums of money to england and was believed to have sent his wife and daughter there also with the intention of course of following them and the fact that you were known to be fighting in the ranks of the brigands as they call the vendeans was also mentioned as an additional crime on his part  then we have a double task to carry out leigh jean said grimly  now i will tell you what we came here for brenon six days ago a small party of the blue cavalry came at night to my chateau i was away but they carried off my wife as a prisoner and burnt the house to the ground so we have come here to see if we cannot get her out of prison  you have thought of such a thing as that the man exclaimed in surprise ah monsieur it is well nigh an impossibility that you have undertaken the villains know that there are hundreds of men friends of the prisoners with whom they have crowded the jails who would tear them down stone by stone if they had the power but in addition to the prison wardersnot the men that used to be there but men taken from the lowest class in the townthe prisons are watched by what they call the volunteers fifteen hundred men belonging to the scum of the citythe men from the slaughterhouses the skinners and the tan yards some of these are ever on guard round the prisons night and day  there have been great changes here a year ago almost everyone thought that the assembly was going to do wonderful things no one knew exactly what according to what they said everyone was to be able to eat meat seven days a week to wear good clothes and to do just as much work as pleased him and no more even the fishermen and sailors were fools enough to believe it  but there is a great change now at first they approved of cutting off the heads of those who they were told were the cause of all misery and poverty but when every day fresh prisoners were brought in and it was not the nobles only but quiet citizenstradesmen manufacturers doctors and advocatesand every morning a score were carried out to be guillotined men began to change their opinion especially when they found that the more heads were cut off the less work there was and the poorer they became they began to talk among themselves and when it came to executing women and children as well as men they turned round altogether  more than once the fishermen and sailors have tried to rescue prisoners on their way to execution the commissioners of the republic have been hooted in the streets and if they had had arms in their hands our men would have turned the tables but the town is full of troops now and worse than all they have enrolled this corps of volunteers who are the terror of the place they have spies everywhere and no one dares whisper a word against the commissioners or the executions for if but two or three men are standing by the chances are that one of them is a spy  but surely my brother might have prevented my fathers arrest brenon he was one of the leading men at that jacobin club  he is still one of the leading men of the party brenon said gloomily he is established in your fathers house now and is on the most intimate terms with the commissaries of the convention  is monsieur desailles still here he was a young advocate and a member of the jacobin club  yes he is a member still but he is not in good odour with the extreme party he is at the head of what they call the moderates they say that sometimes these try to defend accused persons and that is considered a terrible offence by the others i should never be surprised to hear that he himself and those with him have been denounced as enemies of the state this is an awful time monsieur and heaven only knows what we shall come to  now is there anything that i can do for you captain you know well that you have but to say the word and that whatever it is i would do it even if i were cut to pieces the minute afterwards  thank you old friend it was because i knew that you were trusty and true that i came here now the first thing that we want is fishermens clothes we only disguised ourselves in those things in order to pass safely through the blues and be able to cross the ferry for the present they have done their work and now we want a disguise that we can go about in unnoticed of course we dont want new things  i can get them easily enough monsieur my customers are all hard up i know pretty well which are true men and which are not  in the next place i should like to buy or hire a boat to be at my disposal as long as i stay here  there are boats and to spare captain fishing goes on because men must live though it can hardly be called living for the prices of everything are fixed by law now and are fixed so low that the men can scarce earn enough to buy bread for themselves and their families still there are boats in plenty men have come down from towns and villages higher up for they say that the troops are under no control and when the boats come in after a nights fishing they come down and help themselves and if a man ventures to grumble he gets a musket ball to pay him for his fish the men here at first were against their fishing between this place and the sea but the authorities stepped in and said that the more food the better for the people and as the price was fixed the men here saw that it made no difference to them still like our own men they are doing badly enough and one could buy a boat for a mere song  it would be better to buy one from those men brenon because the fact of our being strangers would not then be noticed i want one rowing boat as fast a craft as you can pick out  i also want to hire a boat with a cabin that will hold us both of course it will be a sailing boat say of three or four tons burden i intend that we shall live on board it might be noticed if two strange sailors were often coming in and out of your place whereas if we were in a boat moored against the bank no one would notice us if you can get hold of such a boat with a couple of men who seem to you to be honest fellows strangers to the place it will be a great thing and we could occasionally go down the river and do a little fishing  all that can be managed easily enough captain i know of one boat just such a size owned by two men rouget and medart who sailed in the henriette for years and only left her when you did as they had wives and families here and knew that she would not put in again for a long time you could trust them as you do me  that would be the very thing make arrangements with them on any terms they like i will take her by the week she carries a boat i suppose  of course monsieur they could not do without one  if she is fast well and good if not tell them to buy the fastest they can find they can sell their own boat in part payment or they can get her up on the quay and let her lie there until we have gone when they can either sell her or the new one  however the clothes are the first thing we cannot venture out in these in the first place because we might be questioned and secondly because we might be recognized whereas in a fishermans dress with a wide oilskin hat and our faces dirtied somewhat i dont think that anyone could know us  they remained quiet until evening and then sallied out in the disguises brenon had obtained for them their first visit was to the house of jeans friend desailles it was arranged that leigh should not go in as desailles would probably speak more freely to jean if alone jean had written his name on a piece of paper folded it up and carefully sealed it and when he reached the house he handed this to the woman who opened the door  this is for citizen desailles he said i will wait he may want to see me  in a minute the servant returned and requested him to come in he was shown into a room where desailles was sitting with some papers before him he did not speak until the servant closed the door then he leapt up and held out both hands to his visitor  my dear jean he said what imprudence what madness for you to venture here  i dont think there is any fear of my being discovered even you yourself would scarcely know me  i know you now you have taken that hat off but i own that i did not recognize you before and thought for the moment that you were but a messenger  please do not talk loud for aught i know my servant has been bribed to act as a spy upon me and may have her ear at the keyhole to tell you the truth jean things are coming to a crisis at the club the violent party get more violent every day and i am heartily sick of this butchers work i feel that at any moment i may be denounced  then why on earth do you stay here jules why dont you come and throw in your lot with us  i should have laughed at the idea a year ago he said for at that time although i objected strongly to the doings in paris i yet believed that much good would come of the changes now i know that nothing has come of them but murder and misery and the madness increases rather than diminishes hopeless as i own your struggle seems to me i would at least rather be killed in battle than executed here but i would rather still get to england if i could as you know i can play the violin well and might be able to support myself by its aid if nothing else turned up  if you are thinking of going desailles i will give you a letter to my fatherinlaw at poole i hear that my mother and sister have escaped and they have doubtless gone there so you will not find yourself friendless  and now for the purpose that has brought me here i had no idea until i arrived that these wretches had imprisoned my father who is the last man to interfere in politics and has i am sure never uttered a word of enmity against the convention i came to endeavour to rescue my wife who as no doubt you have heard has been seized and carried off in my absence and my house laid in ashes i suppose she has been brought here  yes i am aware of it jules said the party of horse who did it were specially sent from here of course you were the principal object of the expedition but the officer was ordered to bring her tooin the first place as your wife in the second as an englishwoman and therefore of course an enemy of france you were denounced to the club and as you were known to be one of the gentlemen who had joined the insurrection and were fighting with cathelineau and others i knew that it would be useless to raise a voice on your behalf having the satisfaction of feeling sure that you would be away from home when they got there and hoping that your wife would receive notice of their coming before they entered the house  has she been brought here yet  yes she arrived three days ago she is in the old city prison where your father is also confined  so far that is fortunate jean said  now how about my father i should have thought that jacques influence would have been sufficient to protect him  the young advocate smiled bitterly  monsieur jacques martin poses as a brutus jean when your father was denounced in the club he rose and said that he should take no part in the deliberations that he was before all other things a patriot and that he would not permit private affection to interfere with his duty as a citizen in fact my dear jean painful as it must be for you to hear my opinion is that your brother has all along been playing a deep game and that his object has been to grasp the whole of your fathers business and property it was a friend of his who denounced you at the club when i before gave you warning it was members of his clique who stirred the authorities up to send a small body of cavalry to capture you and it was they also who denounced your father your brother is by far the most powerful of the committee of safety as well as in the club he assumes an air of perfect disinterestedness and of a passionate love for the republic his vote is always given for death i think he takes saint just as his model and repeats his assertion that it is only by the destruction of the enemies of france that france can be freed  there is a cold bloodedness about him that sets my nerves tingling i believe myself that the discovery that your father had largely reduced his stocks and had sent the proceeds to england decided him in either agreeing to or bringing about this denunciation and that he deferred it only until he found that your mother and sister had escaped that freed his hands to some extent had they remained here he would have been in a difficult position even in these days when we are sated with horrors he could hardly have permitted his mother and sister to be executed when as everyone knew he had power to save them on the other hand if they had remained they would have been obstacles to the success of his plan as it is now your fathers house and all property belonging to him were declared confiscated but the committee of safety passed a vote that seeing the inestimable service rendered to the state by his eldest son they would be bestowed upon him as a token of gratitude for his well doing  you scarcely surprise me jean said gloomily i never liked my brotherwe had not a feeling in common and for years he has never seemed to belong to the family and certainly since the troubles began he has not set foot in my fathers house still i hardly believed that he would be such a scoundrel i abhorred his opinions but believed that he was at least sincere i did not see what he could gain by a revolution now i understand his character better and can see how cleverly he has played his cards i cannot reckon myself with the scoundrel deeply as he has wronged me and my father but i should welcome the news that retribution had fallen upon him by some other hand  and now jules can you give me any advice whatever as to how to set about my scheme of getting them both out of prison  jules shook his head  i fear my poor friend that that is impossible the prison is as you know strong there are i should say some forty warders all ruffians and scoundrels any attempt to bribe even one of them would almost to a certainty be denounced and it would probably be necessary to have at least half a dozen in the plot as to force it is out of the question the building is very strong there are always some twenty or thirty of the volunteers on guard outside and an alarm would bring up five hundred in a quarter of an hour to say nothing of the troops what force could you bring that could have even a remote chance of success  i have leigh with me you know him well jules i rely much more upon him than i do on myself he is full of plans and contrivances and has rendered extraordinary services during the war he has with him or rather will have in the course of a day or so a band of forty lads of whom he is the captain who have acted as scouts to cathelineau they will be in hiding a mile or two out of the town  jules lifted his eyebrows  i am afraid that such a force as that would be of very little use to you jeanin fact of no use whatever if you had five hundred men and could gather them for a sudden attack on the jail and had a couple of cannon to blow in the gate i should say it might be possible and even then the chance of its being all done and the fugitives got safely away before the arrival of some three thousand troops would be very doubtful  at this moment the servant brought in a note  who brought this monsieur desailles asked  it was a woman monsieur she did not wait for an answer  the advocate opened it it was written in pencil  dear jules martin is on his feet denouncing you hostile vote certain escape at once  after reading it he handed it to jean  that settles it he said i am with you where are you staying  martin told him and said  it will never do for you to stay there but i have arranged for a boat with a cabin we shall go on board at once you can come with us i had better go out first  it is better that we should not go together for if the woman reports that i went off with a fisherman a search might be made in all the boats i will join you on the quay opposite the inn you speak of i shall need a quarter of an hour to burn some papers i have already a valise packed with a couple of thousand francs which is all the money i could obtain without creating suspicion i have seen this coming for some time and had no intention of making a martyr of myself when my doing so would be of no advantage  dont delay too long jules i shall be in a fever until you join me  i know their way jean there will be a half a dozen speeches each vying with the other in abusing me my friends will see the uselessness of trying to defend me when the terrorists are three to one against them if my friend slipped out as is probable directly your brother rose i can calculate on a good hour actually the club have no power whatever to order arrests but they are so closely allied now with the committee of safety that they do not stand upon legalities except in cases likely to attract a great deal of public attention  jules went to the door and let his visitor out jean joined leigh  desailles is going to join us he has just been denounced and will be with us in a quarter of an hour on the wharf it is very lucky that brenon completed the arrangements today for the boat and that rouget and medart will be expecting us this evening i told them that i might not come until tomorrow morning but this settles it there will be a sharp search for desailles as soon as it is found that he is gone and it is just as well that we should be off too i am very glad that i had the boat taken from her usual berth to a spot half a mile higher up because there are sure to be inquiries whether any fishing boats put out during the night  they walked fast back to the inn brenon on being told what had happened agreed that it would certainly be safest for them to go on board  i have two friends living here he said both of whom are carriers and keep eight or ten horses tomorrow morning early i will take one of your horses to one and the second to the other no one will notice them there whereas if a search is madeand i have no doubt a search will be made of the houses near the riverthey will light upon them in my shed and they would not believe my story that i had two citizens from vallet living herein the first place because it is an unlikely place to put them up and in the second because no such citizens would be forthcoming it is lucky that you told the men to get a cask of wine and a store of provisions on board before starting  well you know captain that whenever you choose to land again my house is at your disposal and i will carry out what we arranged that i should get together a score of men i can trust and to each of whom i can promise a hundred francs for a nights work in a good cause  they packed up their former disguises which might come in useful again their pistols they had already about them they then went out on to the wharf again and a few minutes later were joined by jules desailles  i have been nervous ever since i left you jean martin said as his friend shook hands with leigh i was afraid that a quarter of an hours delay might be fatal  i lost no time but i feel sure that it will be an hour before anyone is down after me they are all too fond of listening to their own voices to close any discussion in less than an hour after the proposer has sat down i hope the boat is not far off for this portmanteau of mine is heavy i can assure you  martin took it up and swung it on to his shoulder  no my dear jean i wont have it  nonsense jules the weight is nothing to me though no doubt to a man who never takes any exercise it would feel heavy  to say the truth it is heavier than i expected i went on packing up everything that i did not like to leave behind until the thing was crammed full and after i had locked it and went to lift it i was thunderstruck with the weight  did your servant see you go out  no i rang for her and told her that i was going out and did not suppose that i should be back till late and that she could go to bed when she likedwhich i knew would be a few minutes after she got permission she is a sort of human dormouse and nineteen times out of twenty i have had to wait for my breakfast i was in a fright as i walked down here lest some one who knew me might run against me but happily i saw no one  they would not recognize you if they had seen you jean laughed the idea of monsieur desailles advocate a gentleman somewhat particular as to his attire dragging a portmanteau weighing a hundred pounds through the streets would seem an impossibility  i have left that phase of my existence behind me jules laughed henceforth i am a man of war a rebel a brigand as they call you prepared for any desperate adventure ready to rush up to a cannons mouth  that is right desailles i am glad to see that you take things so cheerfully  my dear jean i feel as if i walk on air since you have taken my portmanteau i have been living in a state of suspense for months hating these wretches and their ways and knowing that i was gradually falling into bad odour with them and that the blow would certainly fall ere long over and over again i have thought of making my escape from it all but you see i am not a man of action as you are i did not see how the matter was to be effectedwhere to go or what to do i was like a boy shivering at the edge of the bank and afraid to plunge in then another comes behind him and pushes him into the water and he strikes out and finds that it is not as cold as he expected and forthwith enjoys it i have cut loose from the past i have become a rover and a waif and i feel as lighthearted as a boy  now let me get hold of one end of that trunk again  i have got it all right and as you see i have not yet changed shoulders and if i want help it is to leigh i should turn and not to you after three months campaigning it may be that you will be able to hold up an end as well as he can but you certainly cannot do so now in another hundred yards we shall be at the boat and they must be on the lookout for us  in a short time they saw a fishing craft with a boat astern of her a man was standing on the deck  it is a dark night my friends he said  it will be lighter in the morning jean replied  the man leapt ashore  ah captain i am glad indeed to see you brenon did not tell us until after he had made a bargain with us who wanted our boat or we should not have talked about payment not likely after having sailed with you since you were a boy of fourteen  no indeed said another man who had just raised his head out of the cabin hatch and we are not going to take it either  we will talk about that afterwards jean said as he stepped on board  i doubted whether it was you captain for brenon had only spoken to us of two and when i saw three of you i thought that you must belong to one of the boats higher up there are two or three of them a bit farther on  i did not know myself until half an hour ago this is my friend monsieur desailles who is in the same danger from these butchers of the convention as i am first pass this box down and then we will follow it  they gathered in the little cabin it was but some seven feet long  it will be close work captain rouget said  it will do very well jean said cheerfully there is room for two of us to sleep on the lockers and one on the floor you have got the small boat behind you i see  she is there the man said and a good boat she is we bought her from two fishermen who had come down from saint florent she is very well for up there but she is scarce fit for fishing far below nantes  i am glad that she did not belong to this place martin said the fishermen might have been surprised to see two strange men in a boat they knew but so many have come down here from the towns above that we shall excite no attention now the first thing to do is to get up sail and drop down two miles past the town then you can go about your fishing as usual only one of us will show upon deck at a time  now as to the matter on which we are here brenon told you that it was a dangerous business for which you would be required  he told us that it was to hide two gentlemen whom the committee of public safety would be glad to get hold of and i knew of course that to do such a thing was dangerous but we did not like it any the worse for that all honest men are horrified at the way these commissioners from paris are carrying things on and would be glad enough to aid in getting anyone out of their hands  but the danger is greater in our case than ordinary jean went on you heard that my father had been imprisoned  we heard it captain and savage it made us as you may guess everyone spoke well of him and being your father of course we felt it all the more  but that is not all lads a party of their cavalry went to my chateau in my absence burnt it down and brought my wife here a prisoner now it is absolutely certain that they will both of them be condemned for they have a personal enemy on the committee of public safety and they will be murdered unless we can get them out and i and my brother leigh whom you all know have come for that purpose  well captain you can count upon both of us heart and soul but i dont see how it is going to be done the prison is a strong place and well guarded i have no doubt that we could count on getting twenty stout men along the wharf but that would not be much use they have more than that on guard and before we could get into the prison they would come swarming down any number of them  we have forty young fellows from my neighbourhood who will by tomorrow be hidden away in the wood a mile and a half higher up the river  that will be a help sir but even with two hundred we should not be able to do much  we shall have plenty of time to talk it over afterwards get the sail up and drop down the river keep close to the opposite bank it is important that we should not be noticed as we pass the town  well sir there is hardly air enough to fill the sails i should say that we had best tow her across to the other side in the small boat and then drift till we are fairly beyond the town we are safe not to be seen then  perhaps that will be the best plan rouget  the men went out and in two or three minutes the sound of the oars could be heard  i cant say that the lookout is very hopeful leigh  i did not think that anyone would think it so jean but it seems to me that it is just because everyone seems so confident that the prison is safe from attack that we shall have a chance the thing that is troubling me most is where we can get a barrel of gunpowder we must have powder to blow open the gate i expect that any of the doors we may find locked inside will give way if a pistol is fired through the keyhole but to blow in the main gate of the prison we must get powder and a good deal of it that however is a matter in which we shall find that money will be of use  there are too many officials in the prison for us to hope to get any one out without eight or ten being in the plot and as these we hear are all fellows who are heart and soul with the convention it is not possible to attempt it in that way but when as you know the blues succeeded in bribing a vendean to tamper with our guns it ought not to be such a difficult thing to bribe one of these fellows who is in charge of ammunition to let us have a barrel or two of powder  that certainly seems to hold out a prospect of success so far leigh i have never been able to understand your confidence in success but certainly the first indication of your plan seems to promise well now let us hear some more of it  well this is my idea jean i will choose a windy night and send andre and pierre with twenty of the boys into the worst part of the town each shall carry a ball of yarn dipped in turpentine mixed with sulphur and other inflammable things they shall also carry another ball having but a thin coating of the yarn and powder inside so as to explode when the clock strikes two we will say each of them will smash the window of some store light both balls and put them in i want the explosion of one ball to scare anyone who may be sleeping there half out of their senses and make them rush out of the house which will leave plenty of time for the other ball to set on fire anything that it may light upon twenty fires starting at once at different spots will create a fearful scare many of the guards outside the prisonall of whom are drawn from the slumswill have come from that quarter and as they have no idea of discipline will when they see the flames mounting up leave their posts and rush off to see to the safety of their homes  choosing a windy night you may be sure that the fires would burn fast and that the rest of the volunteers and the national guard would soon be so busy that they would not trouble themselves about the prison one way or the other thus i calculate that of the fifty men on guard round the prison there would not be twenty left at the outside and they would be so busy staring at and talking of the fire that with a sudden surprise they could all be disposed of without difficulty then the gates of the prison would be blown in and we should rush in shoot down all the warders we meetkeeping one only as a guidemake straight for the rooms where your father and patsey are confined release them and as many others as the time will allow telling them to rush down to the wharf and seize boats or to escape in whichever way they like while you with your father and patsey would make straight down to our boat while i with the boys would follow you and cover your retreat if any of the blues came up to pursue you  leigh you are a genius martin exclaimed bringing his hand down on the lads shoulder with a force that almost knocked him from his seat  what do you think of that desailles for a plan i told you that i relied upon leighs head more than my own and you see i had good reason for doing so i doubt whether it could be done with his forty boys but if we can get the powder it seems to me that with half as many sailors to help us there is no reason why it should not succeed  but you might burn half the town down desailles said gravely  if i was sure that it would burn the whole of it down i should not mind leigh exclaimed but there is not much fear of that if it cleared out the whole of the slums where the supporters of the gang of murderers they call the committee of public safety live i should rejoice most heartily as there are several wide streets between them and the business quarters and as they will have all the soldiers of the town to assist in fighting the flames i do not think that there will be any fear of the fire spreading very far  well at any rate leigh you have hit on a plan that offers a good chance of success we shall find out in a day or two how many of the boatmen we can get to aid us and how far they will be disposed to go we must learn in some way how long it is likely to be before it is absolutely necessary to act if we find that there is time we can send some of the boys off to the army to bring their fathers and brothers back with them the sixty might not be enough but with a hundred of our men i think we should be pretty sure of success    chapter 11 the attack on nantes   when three or four miles down the river the boat was anchored and the two men were called into the cabin and leighs scheme explained to them  it is a big affair sir medart said thoughtfully when jean had concluded now there is no love lost between us and the ruffians who carry out the committees orders they call us river rats we call them sewer rats and there has been many fights between the fishermen and these fellows as far back as i can remember and lately these have been much more frequent if the plan was only to burn down their quarters there are a good many who would lend a hand because it could be done quietly and they would have no particular reason for suspecting that it was the work of the fishermen but as for going into the jail that would be different we should not have time by what you say to hunt up and kill all the warders and it would therefore be known at once that we were concerned five or six of our fellows have already had their heads chopped off on suspicion of having aided royalists to escape they dont mind whom they lay hands on and they dont trouble themselves to search but just seize the first they come to who perhaps in a cabaret has said a word against their doings  as to the trials they are no trials at all one of their fellows comes in and says i heard this man abusing the authorities and i accuse him also of being concerned in the escape of so and so it is no odds what the prisoner says the fellow who acts as judge looks at the jury who are all their creatures they say guilty and he says death and the accused are marched off again to the prison to wait until their turn comes for the guillotine well you see if this prison was broken into as you propose and it was known that the sailors had a hand in it the chances are that they would march a couple of hundred of us into the great square which would be choke full of the national guard and volunteers and just shoot us down  jean was silent the probability that things would go as the man said was so evident that he had no answer  i think the way to get over that difficulty leigh said when he saw that jean was puzzled would be for you all quietly to buy other clothes or better still for them to be bought for you by your wives they should be such clothes as the peasants buy when they come into the town it would then be supposed that the attack was made by a party of breton peasantry as a good many other prisoners would escape in addition to monsieur martin and your captains wife there would be no reason to suppose that the plot was specially arranged to aid their escape or that any of the people of this town were concerned in the matter  that is so master leigh rouget said it might be managed in that way but i think that most of our chaps had better be told off for firing the town i think that a good many might be willing to undertake that job for i have heard it said many and many a time that they would like to burn the sewer rats out there are other men who would i am sure rather join in the attack on the jail if they could do so without putting the lives of all of us in danger  as to getting hold of an artilleryman i dont know that that would be difficult the men employed on that sort of work are all old soldiers and many of these though they dare not say so hate what is going on just as much as we do i have met one of them with emile moufflet who served with you captain for two or three years when we have been chatting together he has said things about the committee that would have cost him his head if he had been overheard i know that his chum is in charge of some stores but whether they are powder or not i cannot say but at any rate emile will be able to find out for me the name of several of them who have charge of powder and he would be likely to know which of them had sentiments like his own and how far they could be trusted  that would not take long but to get hold of forty hands for the other work would take some time one dare go only to men one is very intimate with and get them to approach men whom they know well for even among us there are fellows who take the committees money to spy over the others and to find out whether any trouble is likely to come or royalists to be shipped off one generally knows who they are because they overdo their parts and rail at the convention more roundly and openly than an honest man would dare to do some of them one finds out that way others again one spots by their always having money to spend if they are too shrewd to betray themselves in that way our wives find them out for us by telling us that their women and children have new clothes and we know well enough that there is no buying new clothes out of fish at their present price besides most of these fellows give up fishing altogether and lounge about the wharves talking and smoking and one knows that a man and his family cannot live on air still there may be others who are too sly to let out their secret in either way and therefore one must be very careful whom one speaks to one would not think of telling anyone about what is intended until just as it comes off one could simply say that one has heard that there is something in the air and that report says that every man who will lend a hand will earnhow much captain  two hundred francs  when one sees how a man takes that one can go a step or two further  well i should not think of letting out to a soul what the nature of the work would be simply saying that every precaution will be taken to prevent its being known that any fishermen are engaged in it all that will take time i should say that it might be nigh a couple of weeks before one could get the whole thing arranged  what do you think desailles jean said shall we have a fortnight  desailles shook his head  i could not say you might have more than that if the prisoners were taken in the regular order in which they were condemned the jails are crowded and as fresh captures are effected room must be made for them of course the committee have a list and they make a mark against the names of those who are to be executed each day it might be three weeks before your friends turn comes it might be only a few days  i tell you what rouget you and your comrade had better land tomorrow morning and set to work you might say that three fishermen from saint florent finding their boat too small hired yours for a week to try their luck if they succeed they will give you a fair price for her if not they will simply pay the hire you can say that the price is not much but as it is as much as you can make at fishing you thought that you might as well have an idle week on shore  leigh and i can work her as soon as day breaks you shall shoot your nets so that we can see exactly how you work and be able to catch an average amount of fish each day i am sure that no one will know us in these disguises and at any rate we shant be clumsy either with the sails or oars you can say that as we are strangers you have agreed to sell our fish for us which will be an excuse for your coming down to us with the news of how you are getting on each time that we come in  that will do very well captain but in that case as a good deal of the fishing must be done at night we had better get out the nets at once and show you how they are managed  for the next three days the work was carried on desailles had undertaken to obtain from a friend of his on the committee of public safety news of what was going on and an early copy of the names of the prisoners told off for execution on the following day  on the third day after their arrival martin and leigh rowed up to the wood where they had directed the band to assemble and found that with two or three exceptions all had arrived four or five of them were at once told to return to the estate and to the army with a message from jean begging all his tenants to leave and join the party in hiding many of them would no doubt have returned to their homes within a day or two of the capture of saumur letters had already been written to bonchamp and rochejaquelein to say that they were intending to attack the jail and deliver a number of captives besides jeans father and wife and to beg that they would pick out some fifty or a hundred determined men and send them on on the morning of the sixth day when the two sailors joined them they were in a state of high excitement  there is great news captain rouget said the whole city is in a state of tumult it is reported that cathelineau with his army is marching upon nantes and it is also reportedbut this is not so certainthat charette is marching to join them with all his force  that is grand news if true jean exclaimed that would indeed favour our scheme i doubt whether they will capture nantes for there is a big force here and enough of them are seasoned troops to encourage the volunteers and national guard to make a good fight of it however we can at any rate take advantage of the attack to carry out our own plans when the fighting is at the hottest you may be sure that every armed man will be wanted at the work and that there will not be many guards left behind at the prison our band here can dispose of them and half a dozen men each with fireballs can add to the confusion by setting fire to warehouses and factories the great thing now will be the powder  that we have managed already captain medart replied as i told you i spoke to emile moufflet the first morning i went ashore and he said that it was at the magazines that his chum was employed yesterday evening he came to us and said that if i gave him the two thousand francs that you had given me for the purpose he would hand us over two barrels of powder at eleven oclock last night we got them and carried them as you told us to brenons and helped him to bury them in his shed we also got as you ordered a couple of yards of fuse  bravo medart everything seems going well for us  the news of cathelineaus advance was confirmed on the following day by the return of the lads who had been sent to fetch assistance they brought with them eight or ten men from the estate and reported that la rochejaquelein had remained at saumur with a portion of his army to defend that town against a large force that biron was assembling at tours while cathelineau having with him bonchamp and stofflet was marching with the main force along the north bank of the river they said however that his force was greatly diminished for that large numbers of his men objecting to fight outside their own country had scattered to their villages they however confirmed the news that charette was reported to be marching north to join cathelineau  that is the worst part of the whole business jean said bitterly our generals have no control over their men they will fight when they want to fight and return home when they choose if cathelineau had come along with a big force he would have been joined by numbers of bretons on the way and if he had captured nantes by the greater part of southern brittany now that so many of his men have left him it is quite possible that his attack may fail and in that case the result will be disastrous his army would disperse the blues would turn their whole force against la rochejaquelein and the cause that a fortnight since seemed half won would be lost  it shows at any rate that the idea of marching on paris could not be carried out for if men refuse to march when they would be separated from their own country only by the river to take nantes by which la vendee is constantly threatened certainly a greater portion still would have gone off to their homes rather than join in what would seem to them so terrible an affair as a march on paris the peasants are good enough at fighting but though they may win a victory by their bravery they are certain to lose a campaign by their independent habits  feeling convinced that the approach of the vendean army would enable their enterprise to be carried out by a much smaller body than had at first appeared necessary jean martin told the two sailors that they had better abstain from broaching the matter to any more of their acquaintances they had already obtained the adhesion of those of whose fidelity they felt absolutely assured and should one of the others whom they intended to approach turn traitor it would overthrow all chances of success and might cause such alarm to the authorities that the executions would go on more rapidly than before and the fate of their friends be precipitated  day by day the excitement in the city increased generals beysser and canclaux had under their command some ten thousand men there was no chance of further reinforcements reaching them but they felt confident that they could successfully defend the town with this force  had charette marched to pontsdece and crossing there joined cathelineau the danger would have been much more formidable but instead of so doing he was advancing directly towards nantes on the south side of the river the few places remaining in the hands of the republicans being hastily evacuated on his approach here however he could give but slight aid to cathelineau for the bridge crossing the loire could be defended by a comparatively small force provided with cannon to sweep the approaches  in order to reassure the townspeople and encourage the troops the french generals as the enemy approached moved out with a large proportion of their force and threw up some intrenchments a mile and a half outside the town feeling confident that they could withstand any attack in the open country  as many of the peasants fled into nantes especially those who in the villages had rendered themselves obnoxious by their persecutions of those suspected of royalist leanings or who were personally obnoxious to them leigh was able to gather the whole of his party in the town they were like other peasants to sleep in the open squares or down near the walls they were always to go about in pairs and to meet pierre or andre at places and hours arranged by them they were supplied with money sufficient to buy bread and were warned on no account to make themselves conspicuous in any way with them were the men from martins estates who had answered to his summons  clothes had been bought for the twelve sailors engaged by medart and rouget the fireballs had been prepared in the cabin of the fishing boat each of the fourteen fishermen was to carry two of these their leaders had carefully gone round the quarter and had picked out the stores or warehouses into which the fireballs were to be flung among these were several wood yards no private houses were to be fired that the flames would spread to these was likely enough but at least there would be time for the women and children to escape  having decided upon the places to be fired the sailors were one by one taken round and the two buildings assigned to each pointed out so that there would be no confusion or loss of time when the signal was given only two stores near the water had been marked down for destruction namely those belonging to the martins this was leighs work as a firm the business was extinct it was now the sole property of jacques martin and there was no probability that martin senior or jean would ever recover a share in it as in each of the stores a considerable quantity of spirits in addition to the wine was housed not only would the loss be very heavy but the interest excited in the vicinity would increase the confusion and alarm that would prevail  desailles was in daily communication with his friend he learned that the list of prisoners was being taken now more in the order in which they stood the farce of a trial had been gone through in the case of jeans wife and she had of course been condemned she stood a good deal lower on the list than his father there was not much chance of the day of her execution being settled before the arrival of the vendean forces the number of names however above that of monsieur martin was rapidly decreasing and there was imminent danger that he might be included in the fatal list before their arrival  on the twentysixth of june the vendeans arrived within a few miles of the town and a formal summons was sent in to the generals it was briefly refused general canclaux believed that he had so strengthened his advanced position which was occupied by his best troops that he would be able to repulse cathelineaus force there the vendeans however being informed by the peasantry of the formidable nature of the intrenchments decided that it would be dangerous to attack them and consequently moved round so as to threaten the town from the north charette on his side moved his force up within cannon shot of the bridge  at eight oclock on the evening of the twentyseventh the sound of heavy firing was heard in nantes a column of the vendeans had attacked nort a place lying to the north of the town it was defended by six hundred troops of the line and a body of the national guard they maintained themselves there during the night but at daybreak fell back upon the town leaving their cannon behind them a considerable body of troops moved out to cover their retreat  confident that the attack would begin that evening every preparation for action was made by jean and leigh the powder barrels were dug up and holes bored for the fuses the boys were all informed that the hour for action was at hand and were ordered to lie down at nightfall in the open space facing the front of the prison scattering themselves among others who would be sleeping there or in expectation of the attack on the town beginning would be standing in groups listening for it leigh would be among them  as the hour neared twelve they were to gather in a body the sailors were not to begin their work until the attack on the town commenced in earnest jean with his twelve tenants was to come up at twelve the exact moment for the attack was to be decided upon by the progress made by the fires when these had had their effect leigh was to fall upon the guard round the prison and jean with his band to run forward to the gate plant the powder barrels against it light the fuse and run back  as soon as they had killed or driven away the guard leighs party were to return to the front there andre with half the band were to station themselves and to hold the gate against any armed body that might arrive while leigh with the others entered the prison and aided if necessary to overpower the warders and blow open the doors of the cells the prisoners were all to be told that charettes army was on the other side of the loire and that their best plan was to make their way down to the river seize boats and get across  at five oclock in the afternoon charettes guns opened against the barricades that had been thrown up at the bridge canclaux seeing that the attack upon the north had rendered it useless for him to retain the advanced post ordered the troops there to fall back into the town at ten oclock in the evening and at eleven the whole garrison were concentrated in nantes  finding that with the exception of the cannonade on both sides across the river all remained quiet leigh passed the word round among his followers to remain as they were until further orders jean and his men came up by twos and threes before twelve and these too lay down as if to sleep or seated themselves on the steps of the houses few of the inhabitants had retired to rest they knew that at any moment the storm might break and some awaited the attack with hope that the time of their release from the tyranny under which they had for months groaned had come while others trembled at the thought of the vengeance that if the town were taken would fall upon those who had been concerned in what had passed  martin and desailles presently joined leigh as the time went on they began to fear that for some reason or other the vendeans had determined to delay their attack until the next day at half past two charettes cannonade redoubled in vigour and the rattle of musketry showed that his troops were advancing the batteries of the defenders opened with equal violence and their musketry answered that of the assailants on the opposite bank  i think that that must be the signal for cathelineau to begin martin said  and ten minutes later the attack commenced with fury upon the gates of vannes rennes and that by the river  every window was opened and anxious faces looked out the night was dark and the few oil lamps alone threw a feeble light on the square suddenly a broad glare rose to the west and the murmur there is a house on fire passed from mouth to mouth in another few minutes flames were seen rising at a dozen points and a cry of consternation arose  the brigands have entered the town they are going to burn it to the ground  man after man of the little group of national guards who had been gathered talking in front of the door of the prison was seen to detach himself from it and to move quietly away then those at the windows noticed four or five parties of men move forward from among those who were standing talking when within a short distance of the guard there was a sharp command and these groups all rushed towards the gates together there were shouts and cries and then there was silence taken wholly by surprise the guard had fallen under the knives of the vendeans without having had time to fire a shot  then the majority of their assailants ran off half one way half the other following the wall of the prison two pistol shots were fired a moment later the men who had remained at the gate drew back for some distance there was a short pause and then a tremendous explosion all the people gathered in the place save those who had carried out the affair fled with cries of terror then jean and his party dashed forward towards the shattered gates and entered the prison and shot or cut down the frightened warders as these came running out dazed and bewildered at the sound of the explosion jean seized one of them by the throat  illustration jean seized one of them by the throat  where are the keys kept answer or i will blow out your brains  the frightened ruffian at once led the way to the chief warders room he had already fallen being one of the first to run down there were two bunches of keys  these are of the doors of the corridors the man said taking down one bunch the others are of the cells  now go before us and open them allevery one mind  they were soon joined by leigh with his party who had made short work of the few guards who remained at their post outside the prison  set your men to blow in the doors jean said it would take half an hour to unlock them all at this rate  pistols were at once applied to the keyholes and the locks destroyed there were a few separate cells but the prisoners were for the most part crowded twenty or thirty together in the larger rooms as he entered each room leigh shouted the directions agreed on to the prisoners in a short time he came upon jean who as had been arranged had first gone to the rooms where his father and patsey were confined jean started with these at once with six of his men leaving leigh and desailles to see to the release of the rest of the prisoners  as soon as all rooms had been burst open or unlocked he and his party with that at the gate hurried away the streets were light as a sheet of flame rose from the stores of jacques martin the musketry fire on the wharves showed that there were troops stationed there as they hurried along the shouts of alarm which rose in the town showed that the news of the attack upon the prison had spread rapidly as soon as the released prisoners knew that they were well above the bridge and the silence on the wharves showed that none of the troops were stationed there shouts of delight arose there were a good many boats moored to the bank and the fugitives threw themselves into these  get out your oars and row straight across leigh shouted if you drift down the stream you will come under the fire of the troops there  then having done their work he and his band went up a hundred yards farther where they knew that three large boats were lying in these they took their places and started to row across the river and in five minutes reached the opposite bank they sprang out with a shout of joy at finding themselves again in their own country most of the fugitives also gained the opposite bank but some boats in which there were but few capable of handling the oars drifted down the river and lost most of their number from the fire of the troops on the bank before they could land among the men of charettes army  leigh with his boys soon joined the other party who had landed a hundred yards higher up it was a joyful meeting indeed between him and patsey  jean tells me it is all your doing that we have been got out she said i felt sure you would manage it somehow  they had already arranged their plans jean with his wife and father and his twelve men was to start at once for parthenay where lescure was in command leigh had determined to join cathelineau with as many of his band as chose to accompany him desailles would go with jean  the boys on the choice being given them almost all decided to accompany leigh they were excited at the success that had attended them and the tremendous roll of fire round the town showed how fiercely their countrymen were fighting and they longed to join in the conflict  saying goodbye to those who were going leigh and his party towed one of the boats a mile up the river and then crossing soon joined the party engaged the vendeans had already advanced some distance but every house and garden was fiercely contested hour after hour passed and the troops were beginning to be discouraged it was broad daylight now and the vendeans pressed forward at all points more hotly than ever  the troops were falling into disorder and would soon have become a disorganized mass when a musket ball fired from a window struck cathelineau in the breast as with his officers who had been considerably increased in number owing to the many gentlemen who had joined him at saumur he was leading on his troops  a cry of dismay rose from those who saw him fall and the news spread like wildfire among the peasants who regarded him with an almost superstitious reverence and had a firm belief that he was protected by heaven from the balls of his enemies his loss seemed to them an irretrievable misfortune the fierceness of their attack diminished their ardour was gone and the blues gaining courage as their assailants ceased to press them took the offensive  they met with but little opposition the vendean army lately on the point of being victorious was already breaking up and ere long was scattered over the country its retreat being undisturbed by the enemy who could scarcely believe their own good fortune at having succeeded when all had seemed lost  cathelineau was carried off but died a fortnight later from the effects of the wound his death was a terrible blow to the cause the failure to take nantes had in itself been a great misfortune but the vendeans had suffered no more heavily than the enemy and had cathelineau been but spared matters might still have gone well with them the effect of his death however was for the time to dishearten the peasantry utterly and had at this time terms of peace which would have permitted them to enjoy the exercise of their religion and to be free from conscription been offered to them they would gladly have been accepted  charette after he saw that the attack upon nantes from the north side of the river had failed fell back with his force as before into lower poitou the vendeans now under bonchamp who had also been wounded retired along the north bank of the loire crossing the river at various points as they could find boats  before joining in the fight leigh had told his band that in the event of failure he should recross the river in the boat that had brought them over they had all kept near him during the struggle eight of them had fallen several others were wounded and he himself had received a musket ball in the shoulder as soon as he saw that the battle was lost he withdrew from it and made his way with the boys to the river bank recrossed the stream and struck across the country after proceeding some six miles they entered a wood and lay down and slept for some hours and then marched to parthenay  here the band broke up and proceeded to their homes while leigh made his way to lescures headquarters learned where his friends were lodged and joined them  patsey gave a cry of alarm as he entered fugitives had arrived before him and it was already known that the attack on nantes had failed and that cathelineau was mortally wounded  what is it leigh  i am wounded in the shoulder it is nothing very serious i think though i suppose i shant be able to hold a sword for some time  a surgeon was soon fetched the ball extracted and the wound bandaged and they then sat down to talk over the events that had occurred since they had been separated monsieur martin had become a broken man the fact that his son who assuredly had it in his power to protect him had given him over to the terrible tribunal had been a harder blow to him than the prospect of death and even the devotion that had been shown by jean scarcely sufficed to comfort him  patsey was pale and thin her imprisonment had told upon her and still more the thought of what jean must be suffering on her account and her uncertainty as to the fate of her child but even the twentyfour hours that had elapsed since she had left her prison had done much for her the news that the child was safe and well had taken a load off her mind and she felt proud indeed that her release and that of so many others of her fellow prisoners had been brought about by the devotion of her husband and her brother before the day was out she was laughing and chatting as if nothing had happened  on the following morning they started early and reached home in the afternoon they were received with delight by their people although many of these had lost relations in the recent battles a house in the village was placed at their disposal patsey riding straight on to see her child with which and its faithful nurse she soon returned  and now jean patsey said when with the cure and jules desailles they sat down for a quiet talk that evening what is to be the next thing  you should ask the blues that he replied so far as i can see it will be a repetition of what has taken place they will invade us again and probably we shall beat them back each time they will come with larger forces and at last i suppose we shall have to endeavour to make our way to england i am afraid there can be no question that that will be the end of it fight as we may we cannot withstand the whole strength of france  why can we not fly at once monsieur martin asked  the difficulty in reaching the coast and of getting a passage would be immense besides so long as la vendee resists so long is it my duty to fight and i am sure that patsey would not wish me to do otherwise i have been in it from the first and must stay until the end if i am not killed before that comes if it were possible to send you and patsey and leigh away to england i would gladly do so but i am sure that she would not go and i think i may say the same for leigh  certainly jean as long as you stay i stay my life is far less important than yours for i have no one dependent upon me i quite agree with you that the war can end in only one way but till that comes all those who have been the leaders of these poor peasants ought to hold by them  i agree entirely with you both patsey added and there was no more to be said    chapter 12 a series of victories   more formidable foes than the peasants had yet met were approaching la vendee mayence had surrendered to the allies and the garrison there which was a large one composed of veteran troops was allowed to march away on each man taking an oath that he would not again serve on the frontier  outside france there was no idea of the desperate struggle that was going on in la vendee had it been known in england that it needed but little aid for brittany and la vendee to successfully oppose the efforts of the republic men money arms and ammunition would no doubt have been sent but unfortunately the leaders of the insurrection occupied as they were with the efforts they were making had taken no steps to send a statement of the real facts of the case to the english government the ports were all in the hands of the republicans and although in paris public attention was concentrated on the struggle the british government was very badly informed as to what was passing there had the allies been aware of it the terms granted to the garrison at mayence would have been very different and they would either have been held as prisoners or been compelled to take the oath that they would in future not serve the republic in any way in arms  as it was they were free to act in france and were already on the march towards la vendee as before arrangements were made for the district to be attacked simultaneously on all sides la rochejaquelein was so much weakened by the return of the peasants to their homes that he was obliged to evacuate saumur and this town was taken possession of by the division from tours consisting of twelve thousand five hundred infantry sixteen hundred cavalry and four hundred artillerymen under general menou  the division of niort comprised fifteen thousand six hundred infantry and thirteen hundred and eighty cavalry it was commanded by chalbos having westermann with him at sables were four thousand three hundred infantry two hundred and fifty cavalry and three hundred artillery they were commanded by general boulard  there was but small breathing time for the vendeans westermann had moved towards parthenay with a strong force and but a few hours after the martins had left it lescure was forced to fall back from the town this was occupied by the blues they pillaged and burned a village near although no opposition had been offered and then sent off a force which burned lescures chateau at clisson  the martins were engaged in conversation when a messenger ran in  i have an order from monsieur lescure he said the church bells are to be rung throughout the district  all started to their feet  already jean exclaimed why what has happened  we have fallen back from parthenay the blues under westermann eight thousand strong have already occupied the town the generals orders are that all are to join him at moulin in two days time messengers have been despatched all over the country and monsieur de la rochejaquelein has been sent for to join general lescure at moulin  that gives us twentyfour hours then jean said with a sigh of content i will see that your message is carried on to all the villages near there are plenty of boys of twelve or fourteen about the place  but the bells rang that night to deaf ears many of the peasants were still absent others had returned but a few hours before worn out and dispirited but when on the following day the news came that westermanns troops were burning villages and slaying all who fell into their hands and that monsieur de lescures chateau had been burnt fury and indignation again fired them and that night the greater part of them set out for moulin  i wonder what has become of our horses jean said as he prepared to start we shall never hear any more of those we left at nantes we must go on foot this time and trust to getting hold of a couple of horses the first time we defeat the blues  he had that day been over with patsey her child his father the nurse and francois to the peasants house deep in the forest to which he had before arranged that she should go in case of need all the party were dressed as peasants the man and woman from whom the house was hired removed to another hut a quarter of a mile away francois was to go down every day in the cart to the village to get news and letters and buy provisions the cure had arranged to send off one of the village boys the moment that he heard that any party of the blues were approaching when the whole of the occupants of the village and the farms around it would be obliged to take to the woods for it was evident that neither age nor sex was respected by westermanns troops  it was morning when jean leigh and desailles arrived at moulin they were warmly received by rochejaquelein and bonchamp to whom jean introduced desailles as a new comrade  i know nothing of fighting the latter said but gentlemen i shall do my best  that is all that anyone can do rochejaquelein said heartily we may say that none of us with the exception of monsieur bonchamp and a few others had any experience in fighting when we began but we have done pretty well on the whole  do you think that we have much chance of holding this place jean asked they told us as we came in that at present there are not much more than eight thousand men here and westermann they say has about as many  that is so bonchamp said and i do not expect that we shall beat them but we must fight or they will march through the country wasting and destroying as they go it is only by showing them that we are still formidable and that they must keep together and be prudent and cautious that we can maintain ourselves a succession of blows even of light ones will break a rock  at two oclock the enemys forces approached and the engagement soon became hot every hedge was lined by the peasants every position strongly defended and only evacuated when the horns gave the signal at the end of two hours westermann after losing a considerable number of men approached ground where his cavalry could come into play and the leaders of all the bands had been warned that when they fell back to this point the horn was to be sounded three times and that resistance was to cease at once and the bands disperse to meet at a given point two hours later seven of the ten cannon they had with them were safely carried off and although compelled to retire from their position the peasants were well satisfied with having withstood so long the attack of an equal number of troops supported by an artillery much superior to their own  leigh had taken no part in the actual fighting his right arm was tightly strapped and bandaged across his chest and he therefore acted only as the generals aidedecamp  ill tell you what it is jules jean said to desailles as they retired from the field if you are going to expose yourself in the way you have done today your fighting will be over before long when it comes to leading the peasants to an attack one must necessarily set the men an example but when on the defence you see the peasants all lie down behind the hedges and bushes and show themselves as little as possible  and there were you walking about as if you were in the principal street in nantes i do not say that we must not expose ourselves a good deal more than the peasants in order to encourage them but there is a limit to all things and one must remember that we are very short of officers and that the peasants brave as they are would be useless without someone to direct them  i have no doubt but you are right jean desailles said with a laugh but in fact i dont remember giving a thought to the matter i was almost bewildered by the roar of the battle and the whistling of the bullets i felt like a man who had taken too much wine which in my student days happened to me more than once my blood seemed to rush through my veins and i would have given anything for the order to come for us to throw ourselves upon the enemy  you will get over that jean laughed but the same feeling is strong among the men one can see how eager they are for the order to charge they use their muskets but it is to use their bayonets that they are panting they would make grand soldiers if they were but well drilled and disciplined  unless i am mistaken you will see them at their favourite work before many days are over westermann will get to chatillon tonight when he gets there he will find no provisions for his troops and will begin to wonder whether he is wise in thus penetrating so far into a nest of hornets  bonchamp will give him two or three days to forget the mauling that we have given him by that time our force will have increased and it will be well for westermann if he manages to carry half his force back with him  the news of the burning of la rochejaqueleins chateau on the following day excited the liveliest indignation the young count himself received the news with greater indifference than did those around him  when a man carries his life in his hand every day he said he does not fret over the loss of a house i do not suppose that i should ever have sat down quietly in possession of it and the cousin who is my heir may have to wait a number of years before if ever he comes to take possession of the estate had circumstances been different the loss of the old chateau where my family have lived for so many years would have been very grievous to me but at present it affects me comparatively little  it is lucky that i sent off four men directly the fight was over with a letter to my steward charging him to hand over to them the four horses that still remained in my stables they arrived here an hour ago i guessed that the blues would be paying a visit there in my absence  one of them is for you monsieur martin and one for leigh the others i shall keep as spare chargers i have had two shot under me already and am likely to have more in the meantime if your friend monsieur desailles likes to ride one it is at his service  i thank you very much marquis jules said but i would prefer trusting to my own legs my profession has been a peaceful one and i have never yet mounted a horse and certainly should feel utterly out of my element in the saddle with an animal under me excited almost to madness by the sounds of battle of the two i think that i should prefer being on a ship during a storm  rochejaquelein laughed  it is all a matter of training he said as for me i feel twice the man on horseback that i do on foot i have never tried fighting on foot yet and i should certainly feel altogether out of my element the first time that i attempted it  however i will not press the animal on you i shall send it and the other to some cottage in the heart of the woods whence i can have them fetched when needed  i am sure that we are greatly obliged to you jean said as i told you when relating our adventure in nantes we had to leave our horses behind us there though had we captured the town we should have recovered them as it is the blues carried off the two i had left behind at the chateau and i could only buy one other as we came through that i detailed for the use of my wife i certainly had not expected to obtain another until we captured some from the enemy we are heartily obliged to you not only for your generous gift but for your thoughtful kindness in sending for them for us  say not another word rochejaquelein said you are a sailor and i am a soldier and between us there is no occasion for thanks or compliments you would have done the same for me and i am glad to be able to set you both on horseback again and indeed i am not sure that i was not a little selfish in the matter for yesterday i missed the company of your brotherinlaw greatly and felt that i would give a good deal to hear his cheery laugh and confident tone  as usual the army dispersed after its victory but there were but a few days quiet for on the fourteenth it gathered to oppose the advance of a strong french column from brissac and on the morning of the fifteenth early just as the troops were getting into movement the vendeans burst down upon them  their numbers were not large for the notice had been short and only the peasants of the surrounding district had had time to gather nevertheless they attacked with such energy led by rochejaquelein and delbee that they fought their way into the middle of the camp captured the headquarters with its correspondence and treasury and scattered several battalions in utter confusion  on the return of the advanced guard under santerre the situation changed the fugitives were rallied and after long and fierce fighting the vendeans drew off  we must admit another failure said rochejaquelein who had with his little troop of mounted men been in the thick of the fight charging again and again into the midst of the enemy and covering the retreat when it began by opposing a determined front to the enemys cavalry a failure but a glorious one they were superior to us in numbers and yet if it hadnt been that their advanced guard returned while our men were scattered intent upon the plunder of their headquarters we should have won the day however we shall have reinforcements up in a couple of days  on the seventeenth the french column resumed its march santerres command led the way to vihiers which they reached without opposition the rest of the division arrived in the afternoon they had left at their previous halting place the heavy baggage with a portion of their artillery ammunition scarcely had they arrived at vihiers when a tremendous explosion told them that the guard left behind had been overpowered and their store of ammunition destroyed  a feeling of uneasiness and alarm spread through the army santerres battalion were at once attacked by rochejaquelein who had but a small body of men with him but who thought to take advantage of the alarm which the explosion would naturally cause among the enemy santerres battalion however stood firm and the vendeans were drawn off in the night however the main body of the peasants arrived and at one oclock next day made their attack  menou himself with the rest of his command had now come up some of the battalions as before stood steadily but the rest of the army dispirited by the perseverance with which the vendeans in spite of failure and losses were ever ready to renew their attack speedily lost heart  in two hours the right fell back in disorder the panic spread and in a short time the rout became general in vain the officers endeavoured to check the fugitives so great was their terror that in three hours the panic stricken mob traversed the distance between vihiers and saumur  thus the second great invasion of la vendee had met with no greater success than the first the two strong columns that had advanced in full confidence of success had returned utterly discomfited westermanns division had been all but annihilated the army from saumur had lost great numbers of men and had for the time ceased to be a military body the bocage with its sombre woods its thick hedges and its brave population seemed destined to become the grave of the republican army and the order to advance into it was in itself sufficient to shake the courage of those who boasted so loudly when at a distance  it was the grave too of the reputation of the french generals one after another they had tried failed and been disgraced the first general marce was superseded by berruyer berruyer by biron who was recalled and guillotined westermann was also tried but having powerful friends was acquitted generals of divisions had come and gone in numbers some had been dismissed some at their own urgent request allowed to return to the districts they commanded before the outbreak of the insurrection but one and all had failed one and all too had never ceased from the time they joined the army of invasion to send report after report to the convention complaining of the untrustworthiness of the troops the bad conduct and uselessness of the officers and the want of a sufficient staff to maintain discipline and restore order  indeed the bulk of the revolutionary troops possessed little more discipline than the vendeans themselves and being uninspired as were the latter by a feeling either of religion or of patriotic enthusiasm they were no match for men who were willing to give their lives for the cause  the vendeans were far better armed than when they commenced the struggle then the proportion of men who were possessed of muskets or firearms of any kind was extremely small but now thanks to the immense quantity which had been captured in the hands of prisoners thrown away by fugitives or found in the storehouses of the towns there were sufficient to supply almost every man of the population with firearms and in addition they possessed a good many pieces of artillery  unfortunately they had learned little during the four months fighting their methods were unchanged love of home overpowered all other considerations and after a victory as after a defeat they hurried away leaving with their generals only the officers and a small body of men who were either emigres who had returned from england to take part in the struggle or royalists who had made their way from distant parts of france for the same purpose  after the capture of saumur too a good many swiss and germans belonging to a cavalry regiment formed of foreigners had deserted and joined the vendeans thus a small nucleus of an army held together swelling only when the church bells summoned the peasants to take up arms for a few days  but while the royalists of la vendee remained quiescent after they had expelled the invaders the republicans more alarmed than ever were making the most tremendous efforts to stamp out the insurrection  beysser who had commanded at nantes was appointed to succeed menou orders were given that the forests and hedges of la vendee were all to be levelled the crops destroyed the cattle seized and the goods of the insurgents confiscated an enormous number of carts were collected to carry faggots tar and other combustibles into la vendee for setting fire to the woods it was actually proposed to destroy the whole male population to deport the women and children and to repeople la vendee from other parts of france from which immigrants would be attracted by offers of free land and houses santerre suggested that poisonous gases should be inclosed in suitable vessels and fired into the district to poison the atmosphere  carrier the infamous scoundrel who had been appointed commissioner at nantes proposed an equally villainous scheme namely that great quantities of bread mixed with arsenic should be baked and scattered broadcast so that the starving people might eat it and be destroyed wholesale this would have been carried out had it not been vigorously opposed by general kleber who had now taken the command of one of the armies of the invasion  the rest of july and the first half of august passed comparatively quietly general toncq advanced with a column into la vendee and fought two or three battles in which he generally gained successes over the peasants but with this exception no forward movement was made and the majority of the peasants remained undisturbed in their homes  soon however from all sides the flood of invaders poured in no fewer than two hundred thousand men were now under the orders of the french generals and advanced from different directions in all cases carrying out the orders of the convention to devastate the country burn down the woods destroy the crops and slay the inhabitants five armies moved forward simultaneously that commanded by kleber consisting of the veteran battalions of mayence  but everywhere they were met charette had marched to the aid of the vendeans of the north and the country was divided into four districts commanded by charette bonchamp lescure and la rochejaquelein each of these strove to defend his own district  the war now assumed a terrible aspect maddened by the atrocities perpetrated upon them the peasants no longer gave quarter to those who fell into their hands and in their despair performed prodigies of valour they had not now as at the commencement of the war the superiority in numbers instead of fighting generally four to one against the blues the latter now exceeded them in the same proportion  but the peasants had changed their tactics instead of rushing impetuously upon the enemys lines and hurling themselves upon his artillery they utilized the natural features of their country as the republican columns marched along believing that there was no enemy near they would hear the sound of a horn and from behind every hedge every thicket every tree a stream of musketry would break out very soon the column would fall into confusion the lanes would be blocked with dead horses and immovable waggons in vain would the soldiers try to force their way through the hedges and to return the fire of their invisible foes then as suddenly as the attack commenced the peasants would leap from their shelter and with knife and bayonet carry havoc among their enemies  these tactics prevailed over numbers even when as in the case of klebers division the numbers possessed military discipline training and high reputation for a month fighting was almost continuous and at the end of that time to the stupefaction of the convention their two hundred thousand troops were driven out of la vendee at every point by a fourth of that number of undisciplined peasants never perhaps in the history of military warfare did enthusiasm and valour accomplish such a marvel  the second half of september was spent by the peasants at their homes rejoicing and returning thanks for their success but already a heavy blow was being struck at their cause charette hotheaded impetuous and self confident had always preferred carrying out his own plans without regard to those of the leaders in upper vendee and he now quarrelled with them as to the course that had best be pursued and left with the forces that he had brought with him to renew the war in the south  but although the peasants rejoiced their leaders knew that the struggle could not long continue the number of fighting menthat is to say of the whole male population of la vendee capable of bearing armshad diminished terribly indeed the number that originally responded to the summons of the church bells was decreased by fully a half food was scarce owing to the continued absence of the peasants the harvest had in many places not been garnered and wherever the republican troops had passed the destruction had been complete a large portion of the population were homeless the very movements of the vendeans were hampered by the crowds of women and children who with the few belongings that they had saved packed in their little carts wandered almost aimlessly through the country many of the towns were in ruins and deserted in all save a few secluded spots as yet unvisited by the republicans want and misery were universal  there was no thought of surrender but among chiefs and peasants alike the idea that as a last resource it would be necessary to abandon la vendee altogether and to take refuge in brittany where the vast majority of the population were favourable to them gradually gained ground  generals beysser canclaux and dubayet were recalled by the convention for their failure to obtain success and lechelle was appointed to the command having kleber and westermann as leaders of his principal divisions  jean martin and leigh had joined their friends in their retreat in the forest after the repulse of all the republican columns they had heard while engaged in the thick of the fighting of the death of monsieur martin he had never recovered from the effects of his imprisonment at nantes and instead of gaining strength he had become weaker and weaker the terrible uncertainty of the position the news that constantly arrived of desperate battles and the conviction that in the end the vendeans would be crushed told heavily upon him he took to his bed and sank gradually  i am not sorry my child he said to patsey the day before he died that i am going to leave you i was wrong in not taking jeans advice and sailing for england with my wife and daughter however it is useless to think of that now  i can see terrible times in store for all here it is evident that no mercy is to be shown to the vendeans it has been decreed by the convention that they are to be hunted down like wild beasts  had i lived i should have been a terrible burden to you i should have hampered your movements and destroyed any chance whatever that you might have of escaping from these fiends it would have been impossible for me to have supported the fatigues and hardships of a flight and i should have been the means of bringing destruction on you all it is therefore better in every respect that i should go  i pray that heaven will protect you and jean and your brave brother and enable you to reach england in safety you will bear my last message to my wife and louise you will tell them that my last thought was of them my last feeling one of gratitude to god that they are in safety and that i have been permitted to die in peace and quiet  it is a sad homecoming this time jean patsey said as her husband and leigh rode up to the door  it is indeed patsey and yet even when the news came to me i could scarcely grieve that it was so i had seen how he was fading when i went away and was not surprised when i heard that he had gone for me it is one care one anxiety the less in future  patsey we will be together i cannot leave you here when leigh and i are away the child shall go with us and when all is lost we will escape or die together  i am glad to hear you say so jean it has been terrible waiting here and knowing that you were in the midst of dangers and that even while i thought of you you might be lying dead i shall be glad indeed to share your fate whatever it is  for three weeks the little party lived quietly in the cottage there were many discussions as to the future it was agreed that in case of a final reverse it would be better that they should travel alone  the more of us there are the more certain to attract observation jean said we must go without francois and marthe their chance of safety will be greater if they either return to their villages or take up their abode with the family of some woodmanor rather marthes safety would be greater as to francois he has long been eager to join in the fighting and it is only his fidelity that has constrained him to remain in what he considers is a disgraceful position when every other man who can bear arms is fighting we will therefore take him with us and when the day of battle comes he will join the fighting men and if we are defeated must care for his own safety  when we fight i shall always leave you at a village a mile or two away you will have the horse ready to mount and we shall join you at once if we are defeated  we ought to be disguised jean leigh said  it would be well jean said but i hardly see what disguise would be of use to us certainly not that of peasants for in that dress we should be shot down without question by the first party of blues we came across even if we succeed in reaching the river and crossing it we may be sure that the authorities will be everywhere on the lookout for fugitive peasants it would be better to be shot at once than to await in prison death by the guillotine  i should say that it does not matter a bit how we are dressed till we reach the river we know now pretty nearly every lane in the country leigh said and i should think that we ought to be able to reach the loire  that is where the difficulty will begin in the first place there will be the trouble of crossing and then that of making our way through the country certainly we could not do so as vendean peasants  i should say jean that the best disguises would be those of fairly welltodo townspeople something like those we wore into nantes but rather less formalthe sort of thing that ordinary tradesmen without any strong political feeling either way would wear i dont say that we shall not be suspected however we are dressed because no one in his senses would be travelling about just at present but when once we get beyond tours if we go that way we might pass without much notice  which way do you think that we ought to go jean  jean shrugged his shoulders  i dont see that there is any choice there would be very little chance of escaping from any of the ports of brittany and la rochelle would be still more hopeless as far south as bordeaux we should be in a comparatively peaceful country and i should hope to find friends there the eastern frontier is of course the safest to cross but the distance is very great and in the towns near the border a very sharp lookout is kept to prevent emigres escaping  there is a rumour that lyons has declared against the convention but if we got there it is certain that it would be but la vendee over again lyons cannot resist all france and as soon as they have done with us here they will be able to send any number of troops to stamp out these risings  undoubtedly if we could get there toulon would be the best place i have heard for certain that they have driven out the extreme party and have admitted the english fleet once there we should be able to take berths in a ship bound somewhere abroadit matters little whereand thence get a passage to england most probably we shall be able to arrange to go direct from toulon for there are sure to be vessels coming and going with stores for the british fleet  but that would be a terrible journey jean his wife said  yes i think that would be quite out of the question it seems to me that our best chance would be either to cross the loire and then make for le mans and so up through alencon to honfleurthat way we should be east of the disturbed districtor if we found that a vast number of fugitives had made their way into brittany as is almost certain to be the case we might bear more to the east and go up through vendome and chartres and evreux and then branch off and strike the seine near honfleur in that case we should be outside the district where they would be searching for fugitives from here  once on the seashore or on the seine it would be hard if we could not steal a fishing boat and cross the channel however one must of course be guided by circumstances still i do think that it would be as well to buy the disguises leigh suggests without loss of time i will ride over to chatillon tomorrow and get them    chapter 13 across the loire   marthe was filled with grief when she heard that it had been decided that it was better that she should return to her native village but her mistress pointed out to her that if all went well she could rejoin them if things went badly and they escaped they would send for her wherever they might be but in case disaster compelled them to fly three persons were as many as could hope to travel together without exciting suspicion the nurse however begged that at any rate she might go with them to the headquarters of the army  everyone is going she said and they say that if we are beaten in the next battle they will cross the loire and take refuge in brittany for the blues will not leave a soul alive in la vendee i should have nowhere to go to here and will keep with the others whatever happens if you are with them madame i can rejoin you if not i hope to be with you afterward  it was indeed an exodus rather than the gathering of an army that was taking place the atrocities committed by the invaders the destruction of every village the clouds of smoke which ascended from the burning woods created so terrible a scare among the peasants that the greater portion of the villages and farms were entirely deserted and every road leading to chollet which was the rendezvous where the fighting men were ordered to gather was crowded with fugitives francois walked by the horses head patsey the nurse and the child with a trunk containing articles of absolute necessity occupied the cart jean and leigh rode ahead  the company of cathelineaus scouts no longer existed more than half of them had fallen in the late battles their services were no longer required as scouts and the survivors had joined their fathers and brothers and formed part of the command of bonchamp  on the fourteenth of october the enemys columns were closing in upon chollet those round mortagne were marching forward when the advanced guard under general beaupuy were suddenly attacked by the vendeans while entangled in the lanes the head of the column fought well but those in the rear finding themselves also attacked and fearing that the retreat would be cut off retired hastily to mortagne the column would have been destroyed had not beaupuy promptly sent up large reinforcements after a long and obstinate fight the vendeans were driven from the woods and the republican artillery opening upon them they were compelled to retire to chollet  here no halt was made kleber had also been fiercely attacked but had also though with much difficulty repulsed his assailants the next morning the republicans entered chollet which they found deserted by the enemy  on the seventeenth their whole force being now concentrated there they were about to move forward towards beaupreau when the advanced guard was hotly attacked and in a short time the combat became general for a time the vendeans bore down all opposition but as the whole of the republican force came into action their advance was arrested  the battle began soon after one oclock it raged without intermission till nightfall no decisive advantage had been gained on either side and the result was still doubtful when a panic took place among the multitude of noncombatants in the rear of the vendeans the cry was raised to the loire  the panic spread in vain the leaders and their officers galloped backwards and forwards endeavouring to restore confidence and shouted to the men that victory was still in their grasp in the darkness and din they could only be heard by those immediately round them and even these they failed to reanimate and the men who had for seven hours fought as kleber himself reported like tigers lost heart  lescure had fallen in the fighting on the fourteenth bonchamp and delbee were both desperately wounded at the battle at chollet and were carried off by their men la rochejaquelein with whom jean martin and leigh were riding had made almost superhuman efforts to check the panic and they fell back almost broken hearted with a band of peasants who held together to the last on the previous day leigh had escorted patsey to beaupreau and it was to this town that the fugitives made their way arriving there at midnight  thank god that you are both alive patsey said bursting into tears as her husband entered the room in which she was established  we can hardly believe it ourselves jean said it has been a terrible day indeed our men fought nobly and i firmly believe that we should have won the day had not an unaccountable panic set in what caused it i know not we were doing well everywhere and had begun to drive them back and could we have fought on for another half hour it was likely that as usual a panic would have seized them  however patsey they would have gathered again stronger than ever and it must have come to the same thing in the long run now put on your disguise at once we will lie down for two hours and see you off before daybreak i do not know whether la rochejaquelein who must now be considered in command since delbee and bonchamp are both desperately wounded will gather a force to act as a rearguard if so we must stay with him but i do not think that even his influence would suffice to hold any considerable body of peasants together all have convinced themselves that there is safety in brittany  at any rate the enemy will need a days rest before they pursue they must have suffered quite as heavily as we have  the night however was not to pass quietly at two oclock two officers who had remained as piquets rode into the town with news that westermanns division which had marched through moulet and had taken no part in the action was approaching the horn sounded the alarm and the fugitives started up and renewed their flight marthe could not be left behind now nor did the others desire it and until they had crossed the loire there could be no separation for the whole country would swarm in fortyeight hours with parties of the enemy hunting down and slaying those who had taken refuge in the woods  jean and leigh had lain down in the cart to prevent any of the fugitives seizing it the two women and the child were hurried down and took their places in it francois who had escaped had fortunately found them and took the reins and the journey was continued  there was no pursuit it was only a portion of westermanns force that had arrived and these were so exhausted and worn out by the length of their march and by the fact that they had been unable to obtain food by the way that they threw themselves down when they reached the town incapable of marching a mile farther  at beaupreau there had been no fewer than five thousand republican prisoners kept under guard on the arrival of the routed vendeans the peasants as a last act of retaliation would have slain them but bonchamp who was at the point of death ordered them to be set free  it is the last order that i shall ever give he said to the peasants assembled round his litter surely you will not disobey me my children  the order was obeyed and the prisoners were at once sent off and as the republican column marched out from chollet the next day they encountered on the road their liberated comrades the sentiments with which the commissioners of the convention were animated is evidenced by the fact that one of them declared in a letter to the commanderinchief of the army that the release of these prisoners by the vendeans was a regrettable affair and recommended that no mention whatever should be made of it in the despatches to paris lest this act of mercy by the insurgents should arouse public opinion to insist upon a cessation of the measures that had been taken for the annihilation of the vendeans  the fugitives a vast crowd of over one hundred thousand men women and children reached saint florent without coming in contact with the enemy the republican generals indeed had no idea that the peasants had any intention of quitting their beloved country and imagined that they would disperse to their homes again and that there remained only the task of hunting them down a company had been left on a hill which commanded saint florent but they had no idea of being attacked and had not even taken the precaution of removing the boats across the river  as soon as they arrived the vendeans attacked the post with fury and captured it twenty boats were found and the crossing was effected with no little difficulty there were still two or three thousand principally women and children to be taken over when a party of republican dragoons arrived numbers of the women and children were massacred but the great bulk flying precipitately regained the country beyond the heights of saint florent and took refuge in the woods  the multitude were for the present safe there was no strong force of the enemy between nantes and saumur and they halted for the night dispirited worn out and filled with grief they had left their homes and all they cared for behind they were in a strange country without aim or purpose their only hope being that the bretons would rise and join thema poor hope since the terrible vengeance that had been taken on la vendee could not but strike terror throughout brittany also  jean martin and leigh had seen patsey and the nurse placed in one of the first boats that crossed  do not go far from the spot where you land they said we shall stay here until all is over if the blues come up before all have crossed we shall swim across with our horses be under no uneasiness about us  taking the horse out of the shafts of the cart and putting a saddle that they had brought with them on its back they left the three animals in charge of francois and then aided other officers to keep order among the crowd and to prevent them from pressing into the boats as they returned from the other bank in such numbers as to sink them all day the work went on quietly and regularly until so comparatively few remained that hope became strong that all would cross before any of the enemy arrived  that hope was destroyed when suddenly the enemys cavalry appeared at the edge of the slope and came galloping down the officers in vain tried to get the few men that remained to make a stand they were too dispirited to attempt to do so and the little throng broke up and fled some one way some another  fortunately an empty boat had just returned and into this the other officers leapt while jean with his two companions led the horses into the water they had already linked the reins francois was unable to swim but at jeans order he took hold of the tail of the horse in the middle while jean and leigh swam by the heads of the two outside horses and without difficulty the other side was gained patsey who had had her eye fixed upon them all day was standing at the spot where they landed  they were near the town of ancenis and a portion of the vendeans entered the place which was wholly undefended the inhabitants were in abject terror thinking that the town would be sacked and were surprised to find that the peasants did no one any harm and were ready to pay for anything that they required so long indeed as any money whatever remained the vendeans paid scrupulously when it was all expended the chiefs did the only thing in their power issuing notes promising to pay and although these had no value save in the good faith of the vendeans they were received by the bretons as readily as the assignats of the republicwhich indeed like the notes of the vendeans were never destined to be paid  had the army plunged into brittany after the capture of saumur there can be no doubt that the peasantry would everywhere have risen but coming as fugitives and exiles they were a warning rather than a source of enthusiasm and although small numbers of peasants joined them the accession of force was very trifling  jean martin his wife and leigh held an anxious consultation that evening they had found a poor lodging after attending a meeting of the leaders at which la rochejaquelein had been unanimously elected commanderinchief bonchamp having died while delbee wounded to death had been left at the cottage of a breton peasant who promised to conceal him the young soldier had accepted the fearful responsibility with the greatest reluctance he and those around him saw plainly enough that the only hope of escape from annihilation was the landing of a british force to their assistance unhappily however england had not as yet awoke to the tremendous nature of the struggle that was going on her army was a small one and her fleet as yet had not attained the dimensions that were before many years to render her the unquestioned mistress of the seas  the feeling that the revolution was the fruit of centuries of oppression and that terrible as were the excesses committed in the name of liberty the cause of the revolution was still the cause of the peoples of europe had created a party sufficiently powerful to hamper the ministry moreover the government was badly informed in every respect by its agents in france and had no idea of the extent of the rising in la vendee or how nobly the people there had been defending themselves against the whole force of france it is not too much to say that had england at this time landed twenty thousand troops in brittany or la vendee the whole course of events in europe would have been changed the french revolution would have been crushed before it became formidable to europe and countless millions of money and millions of lives would have been saved  throughout france there was a considerable portion of the population who would have rejoiced in the overthrow of the republic for even in the large towns its crimes had provoked reaction toulon had opened its gates to the english lyons was in arms against the republic normandys discontent was general and its peasantry would have joined those of brittany and la vendee had there been but a fair prospect of success  england however did nothing but stood passive until the peasantry of la vendee were all but exterminated and indeed added to their misfortunes by promising aid that never was sent and thus encouraging them to maintain a resistance that added to the exasperation of their enemies and to their own misfortunes and sufferings  what are we going to do patsey asked as her husband and leigh returned from the meeting  that is more than anyone can say jean replied we shall for the present move north we are like a flight of locusts we must move since we must eat and no district could furnish subsistence for eighty thousand people for more than a day or two  there can be no doubt that the impulse to cross the loire was a mad one on the other side we at least knew the country and it would have been far better to have died fighting there than to throw ourselves across the river it was well nigh a miracle that we got across and it will need nothing short of a miracle to get us back again  of one thing we may be sure the whole host of our enemies will by this time be in movement we should never have got across had they dreamed that such was our intention now that we have done it you may be sure that they will strain every effort to prevent us from returning probably by this time half their forces are marching to cross at nantes the other half are pressing on to saumur in three or four days they will be united again and will be between us and the river  were we a smaller body were we only men i should say that we ought to march another twenty miles north then sweep round either east or west and while the enemy followed the north bank of the river to effect a junction we should march all night without a halt pass them and hurl ourselves either upon saumur or nantes and so return to la vendee but with such a host as this there would be little hope of success i fancy that we shall march to laval and there halt for a day or two by that time the whole force of the enemy will have come up and there will be another battle  and we jean  i see nothing but for us to march with them we know nothing of the movements of the enemy and were we to try to make our way across the country we might run into their arms besides leigh and i have both agreed that at present at least we cannot leave rochejaquelein  we could not indeed patsey leigh broke in if you had seen him this evening when with tears in his eyes he accepted our choice you would feel as we do it was all very well for us before to talk of making off but now that the worst has happened if it were only for his sake i should stay by him though i think that jean with the responsibility of you and your child would be justified in going  no patsey said firmly whatever comes we will stay together as jean said you cannot desert the cause now as long as there are battles to fight we must stay with them and it is not until further fighting has become impossible that we like others must endeavour to shift for ourselves  well spoken patsey her husband said that must be our course so long as the vendeans hang together with rochejaquelein at their head we must remain true to the cause that we have taken up when once again the army becomes a mass of fugitives we can without loss of honour and a clear consciousness that we have done our duty to the end think of our safety i grant that if one could find a safe asylum for you and our louis in the cottage of some breton peasant  no no she interrupted that i would never consent to we will remain together jean come what may if all is lost i will ask you to put a pistol to my head i would a thousand times rather die so than fall into the hands of the blues and either be slaughtered mercilessly or thrown into one of their prisons to linger until the guillotine released me  i agree with you in that patsey well we will regard the matter as settled as long as the army hangs together so long will we remain with it after that we will carry out the plans we talked over and make for the coast by the way which seems most open to us  the next day was spent by rochejaquelein and his officers in going about among the peasants they did not disguise from these the extreme peril of the position but they pointed out that it was only by holding together and by defeating the blues whenever they attacked them that they could hope for safety  it was difficult to cross the loire before they said it will be tenfold more difficult now every boat will have been taken over to the other side and you may be sure that strong bodies of the enemy will have been posted all along the banks to prevent our returning you have fought well before you must fight even better in future for there is no retreat no home to retire to your lives and those of the women and children with you depend upon your being victorious you have beaten the blues almost every time that you have met them you would have beaten them last time had not a sort of madness seized you it was not we who led you across the loire you have chosen to come and we have followed you  at any rate it is better to die fighting for god and country than to be slaughtered unresistingly by these murderers you saw how they fell upon the helpless ones who were unable to cross with us how they murdered women and children although there was no resistance nothing to excite their anger if you die you die as martyrs to your faith and loyalty and no man could wish for a better death  all is not lost yet defeat the blues and brittany may yet rise besides we are promised aid from england at any rate la vendee has been true to herself through over six months of terrible struggle la vendee may perish let the world see that she has been true to herself to the end  the fugitive priests with the army seconded the efforts of the officers and by nightfall a feeling of resolution and hope succeeded the depression caused by the terrible events of the preceding thirtysix hours and it was with an air of calmness and courage that the march was recommenced on the following morning  the instant that it became known that the vendeans had crossed the loire a panic seized the republicans at nantes and messengers were sent to implore the commanderinchief to march with all haste to aid them should as they believed the vendeans be marching to assail the town kleber with his division started at once followed more slowly by the main body of the army  another column advanced to saint florent and obtaining boats crossed the river and entered angers to the immense relief of the republicans there who had been in a state of abject terror at the presence so near them of the vendeans kleber marched with great rapidity passed through nantes without stopping and established himself at the camp of saint georges  the news of what was termed the glorious victory at cholletalthough in point of fact the republicans fell back after the battle to that towncaused the greatest enthusiasm in paris and the convention and the republican authorities issued proclamations which were unanimous in exhorting the army to pursue and exterminate the vendeans  by the twentythird the whole of the french army was in readiness to march in pursuit kleber was still in the camp of saint georges chalbos was at nantes with a corps darmee beaupuy was at angers  the vendeans had marched through cande and chateaugontier and had without difficulty driven out the republican force stationed at laval lechelle the commanderinchief was profoundly ignorant supine and cowardly and owed his position solely to the fact that he belonged to the lower class and was not like biron and the other commandersinchief of good family remaining always at a distance from the scene of operations he confused the generals of divisions by contradictory orders which vied with each other in their folly  on the twentyfourth kleber marched to ancenis and on the following day he beaupuy and westermann arrived at chateaugontier canuels division from saint florent had not yet come up the troops were already tired but westermann who as kleber in his report said was always anxious to gain glory and bring himself into prominence insisted on pushing forward at once and prevailed over the more prudent counsel of the others as he was the senior officer  when they approached laval westermann sent a troop of cavalry forward to reconnoitre he was not long before he came upon some vendean outposts these he charged and drove in towards the town  no sooner did they arrive there than the bells of the churches pealed out it was now midnight but before the army could form into order the vendeans poured out upon them guided by the shouts of the republican officers who were endeavouring to get their troops into order the combat was desperate and sanguinary the peasants fighting with the fury of despair threw themselves recklessly upon the republican troops whose cannon were not yet in a position to come into action and whose infantry in the darkness fired at random fighting in the dark discipline availed but little klebers veterans however preserved their coolness and for a time the issue was doubtful  had westermanns cavalry done their duty victory might still have inclined towards them but instead of charging when ordered they turned tail and riding through a portion of their infantry spread disorder among them westermann seeing that it was hopeless to endeavour to retrieve the confusion ordered a retreat and the army fell back to chateaugontier where they arrived in the course of the day here they found the commanderinchief who disregarding the exhausting march the troops had already accomplished and their loss of spirit after their defeat ordered them to return to vihiers halfway to laval  it was nightfall when they reached this place but westermann pushed the advanced guard some two leagues farther kleber seeing the extreme danger of the position refused to advance beyond vihiers and sent orders to danican who commanded the advanced guard to fall back to a strong position in advance of vihiers  danican had taken command only on the previous day and the soldiers believing that this order was but an act of arbitrary authority on his part refused to move and the bridge over the river ouette in front of vihiers remained unguarded save by a squadron of cavalry kleber had just returned from visiting the post when he received a despatch from lechelle bidding him give the order they had decided upon between them to the other two divisions as no such arrangement had been made kleber was in ignorance of what was meant but he sent a messenger to beaupuy who was at chateaugontier and to bloss who commanded a column of grenadiers to join him as soon as possible  bloss arrived early the next morning at the camp beaupuy moved forward but as his whole force had not yet come up he did not arrive at the camp at the same time  at eleven that night lechelle and the four generals now in the camp held a council westermann was extremely discontented at finding that the heights were not occupied but as kleber remarked the troops were utterly dissatisfied at the way in which they had been handled and at the unnecessary and enormous fatigues that had been imposed upon them and it was impossible to demand further exertions savary one of the generals at the council was well acquainted with laval and gave the advice that a portion of the army should follow the river for some distance and then take possession of the hills commanding the town  when beaupuy arrived his division moved forward at once as an advanced guard but as the army was moving a messenger arrived from lechelle issuing orders in absolute contradiction of the plan that he had agreed to when the council of war broke up the orders were obeyed but the generals again met and sent off a messenger to lechelle to remonstrate against the attack in one mass and a march by a single road on a position that could be attacked by several routes and to recommend that at least a diversion should be made by a false attack westermann himself carried this remonstrance but the commanderinchief paid no attention to him  advancing it was found that the vendeans had taken up a position on the neglected heights the cannon opened on both sides and beaupuy was soon hotly engaged kleber advanced his division to sustain him lechelle coming up arrested the further advance of the division of chalbos savary rode back in haste to implore lechelle to order chalbos to move to the right and attack the left flank of the enemy but by this time the unfortunate wretch had completely lost his head and instead of giving chalbos orders to advance ordered him to retreat and himself fled in all haste  two columns that were posted a few miles in the rear received no orders whatever and remained all day waiting for them kleber seeing the division of chalbos retiring in great disorder felt that success was now impossible and placed two battalions not yet engaged at the bridge to cover the retreat but the panic was spreading his orders were disobeyed and the veterans of mayence as well as the divisions of beaupuy broke their ranks and fled  in vain the officers endeavoured to stay the flight the panic was complete their guns were left behind and the vendeans pressing hotly on their rear overtook and killed great numbers bloss with his grenadiers advancing from chateaugontier tried in vain to arrest the flight of the fugitives and he himself and his command were swept away by the mob and carried beyond the town  a few hundreds of the soldiers alone were rallied and prepared to defend the bridge of chateaugontier but la rochejaquelein had sent a portion of his force to make a circuit and seize the town so that the defenders of the bridge were exposed to a heavy fire from houses in their rear  kleber with a handful of men held the bridge and was joined by bloss who had been already wounded while passing through the town he advanced to cross kleber and savary in vain tried to stop him  no he said i will not survive the shame of such a day and rushing forward with a small party fell under the fire of the advancing vendeans  the pursuit was hotly maintained keeping on heights which commanded the road the vendeans maintained an incessant fire of cannon and musketry it was already night and this alone saved the republican army from total destruction beaupuy received a terrible wound in the battle and a great number of officers were killed in endeavouring to stop the panic  at last the pursuit ceased and for a few hours the weary fugitives slept then they continued their retreat and took up a strong position near the town of angers which was crowded with fugitives  lechelle came out to review the troops who by the orders of their generals had already formed in order of battle but was received with such yells of hatred and contempt that he was forced to retire the representatives of the convention offered kleber the command of the army but he refused saying that chalbos was of superior rank and that it was he who should take the command they agreed to this and sent to lechelle telling him to demand leave of absence on account of his health  a council of war was then held the representatives of the convention were favourable to a fresh advance of the army but kleber protested that at present there was no army he said that the soldiers were utterly discouraged that some battalions had but twenty or thirty men with the colours that all were wet to the skin utterly exhausted many without shoes and all dispirited therefore he insisted that it was absolutely necessary that the army should be completely reorganized before undertaking a fresh forward movement  their loss had indeed been extremely heavy klebers division alone having lost over a thousand men beaupuy had suffered even more heavily while the divisions of chalbos and the grenadiers of bloss had also lost large numbers the total loss including deserters amounted to over four thousand  the whole of the cannon of the two first divisions had fallen into the hands of the enemy the artillerymen having cut the traces a large number of ammunition waggons and a quantity of carts laden with provisions had also been captured    chapter 14 le mans   the victory won by the vendeans was one of the most important of the war never had they fought with greater bravery never did they carry out more accurately and promptly the orders of their generals napoleon afterwards pronounced that the tactics pursued by la rochejaquelein showed that he possessed the highest military genius  it was night alone that saved the routed army of the republic from absolute destruction it is probable that at the time the vendean general had no idea of the completeness of the victory that he had won or of the disorganization of the enemy had he known it he would doubtless have attacked them again on the following day when he would have experienced no resistance could have captured angers without firing a shot and could had he chosen have recrossed the loire the vendeans however well content with their success returned to laval and there enjoyed a weeks quiet and repose  the crushing defeat that the republicans had experienced caused an immense sensation at paris and in the towns through which the vendeans would pass on their way to the capital which was at the time actually open to them  patsey was delighted when jean and leigh returned unwounded  you both seem to bear a charmed life she said leigh has indeed once been hit but it was not serious you have escaped altogether what is going to be done next  we are going to rest here for ten days or so there is plenty of food to be had and the rest will do wonders for the men of course we rode back with la rochejaquelein his opinion was as it always has been that a march on paris will alone bring this terrible business to a close but he knows that even his authority will not suffice to carry out such a plan as long as they are in brittany they are among friends and are still near their homes but to turn their backs on these and march on paris would appear so terrible an undertaking that reckless as they are of their lives in battle nothing would induce them to attempt it  after ten days delay the vendeans commenced their march towards the coast the battle at vihiers was fought on the twentyseventh by the sixth of november they had captured the towns of ernee and de fougeres defeating at the latter place three battalions dol was next captured mayenne opened its gates without resistance  the greatest efforts were made by the republicans to place the seaports in a state of defence cherbourg would have been the best point for the fugitives to attack as here they would have found an abundance of powder of which they were in great need and cannon and here they might have defended themselves until the promised help arrived from england granville however had been fixed upon by the british government and the march thither was shorter therefore it was against granville that the attack was directed  a considerable portion of the force with the artillery were left at avranches although assured that the march to the sea was made in order to obtain succour there from england there was much fear among the peasants that the intention of the chiefs was to embark and to leave the army to its fate consequently they advanced against granville with less energy and enthusiasm than usual  however half a league out of the town they came upon a portion of the garrison and repulsed them so successfully that they entered one of the suburbs with them the garrison had for the most part shut themselves up in a fort which commanded the town having erected a strong palisade across the streets leading to it four hundred men occupied this post  the vendeans had no axes to cut down the palisades nor powder to blow then in they were therefore obliged to content themselves with a musketry fire against it as the garrison were well supplied with ammunition and kept up a constant fire they suffered heavily  when night came the vendeans scattered among the houses to find food fire and shelter and all night the batteries on the heights played upon them  in the morning the republicans redoubled their fire it became evident that the town itself could not be taken and the mass of the vendeans without orders from their chiefs began to retire and in a short time the whole were in rapid retreat to avranches  there the cry was raised back to la vendee  la rochejaquelein after halting his force on the main road a few hours called upon the men to follow him to caen but only one thousand did so on arriving at a village he learned that the bulk of the army instead of being behind him had marched towards pontorson he was therefore forced to retrace his steps and to follow them and on overtaking them found that they had already carried the bridge driven away the enemy and occupied the town  the enemy were closing round them but the capture of pontorson deranged the plans of the republicans the place had been held by four thousand men and ten pieces of cannon and as it could be approached only by a narrow defile it was believed that it would be impossible for the vendeans to force their way into it however after three hours fighting their desperate valour won the day and the republicans were routed with the loss of most of their cannon  the affair indeed appeared to the peasants to be a miracle granted in their favour and with renewed heart they marched the next night to dol kleber was with a large force in this neighbourhood but the impetuosity of westermann again upset his plans as soon as the latter heard that pontorson had been carried by the vendeans and that they had marched to dol he pursued them with three thousand infantry two hundred cavalry and four cannon he arrived within a short distance of dol at six in the evening and without waiting for the infantry to come up charged into the town and for a moment spread confusion among the vendeans  illustration westermanns cavalry charged into the streets of dol  they however soon recovered from their surprise and drove the enemy out with loss westermanns infantry took no part in the action kleber was occupied in closing every route by which the vendeans could leave dol but westermann who had held no communication with him and knew nothing of his plans marched with marignys division with six thousand men to attack the town  this he did at two oclock in the morning the vendeans at once rushed to meet them and first tried to turn the right but they failed here and also in an attack on the left they fought however so fiercely that westermann withdrew his troops to the position that they had occupied before attacking the vendeans however gave them no time to form in order of battle but heralding their charge with a heavy musketry fire rushed down upon them the enemy at once broke and leaving their cannon behind them continued their flight till they reached pontorson  in the meantime marceau was advancing with his division by another road and the vendeans hearing this ceased their pursuit of westermanns routed division and moved against him and at four oclock in the morning attacked him when within a league of dol a combat ensued that lasted for three hours the vendeans then drew off on learning that the division of muller was on the point of joining that of marceau  together these divisions could have forced their way into dol but muller was hopelessly drunk and being the senior officer the greatest confusion arose and had the vendeans known what was taking place they could have gained a decisive victory  marceau seeing that he could do nothing to restore order rode at full speed to klebers headquarters and at daybreak the two generals arrived at the spot and found the two divisions mingled in supreme disorder the brigades and battalions being mixed up together finding that nothing could be done with them there kleber drew them off their confusion being almost converted into a rout by the fire of about a hundred vendeans a council of war was held and eighteen hundred men with two guns were sent to pontorson to join westermanns defeated division  that general was ordered to advance again at once upon dol kleber opposed this and the rest of the council coming at last to his opinion orders were sent to westermann to remain on the defensive and await fresh orders westermann however as usual disregarded these and marching through the night approached the town and arrived early in the morning at a village close to it  the sounding of the church bells told that the vendeans had discovered the enemy and in a few minutes these were seen rushing as usual to the attack in spite of the reinforcements that had reached them westermanns troops fought worse than they had done two nights before the reinforcements were the first to give way the advanced guard speedily turned and fled westermann and marigny with a small party of cavalry fought desperately to cover the retreat marigny however fell and the whole force became a mass of fugitives  kleber on his way the next day to reconnoitre the town met the vendeans advancing scattering rapidly these occupied the ridges and attacked the brigade that formed his advanced guard so fiercely that it broke and fled kleber sent to fetch some battalions of the troops of mayence and as soon as they arrived with some battalions of grenadiers formed them in order of battle other troops came up and they prepared for a serious engagement  at this moment the vendean column that had defeated westermann showed itself on the right flank of the republicans and threatened their rear kleber ordered some of the battalions to take post further back to cover the line of retreat other battalions seeing the movement and believing this to be a signal for retreat followed  the grenadiers alone stood firm and defended themselves for three hours in the meantime the greater portion of the republican army was already in full flight and a retreat was ordered the troops remaining on the field retired at first in good order but as the victorious vendeans pressed on this speedily became a rout  marceau gathering together such soldiers as still retained their presence of mind endeavoured to defend the bridge of antrain but the vendeans pressing forward swept them away and the fugitives fled in a confused mob as far as rennes  the vendeans on entering antrain at once scattered in search of food disregarding the orders and entreaties of la rochejaquelein and stofflet who urged them to press hotly upon the routed enemy and so to complete the victory they had won at antrain they learned that the wounded who had been left in hospital at fougeres had been murdered in their beds by the blues and they accordingly shot all the prisoners they had taken in the battle  the victory seemed to open the way to the loire and the vendeans steadily marched south through mayenne and laval and arrived in front of angers but the city was no longer in the defenceless state in which it was when they first crossed the loire as soon as it was perceived to be the point for which the vendeans were marching four thousand troops were thrown into it and all preparations made for a stout defence  if they defend themselves as they ought to do la rochejaquelein said to two or three of his officers among whom was jean martin there is no hope of taking the town we have neither cannon to blow down the walls nor means of scaling them thirtysix hours is the utmost we can hope for our operations kleber and the rest of them will be up by that time howeverit is our sole hopepossibly a panic may seize them when we attack but even cowards will fight behind walls and after our failure at granville i have little hope of our taking angers especially as they must know how soon their army will be up  the affair was a repetition of that at granville the vendeans at once obtained possession of one of the suburbs twenty pieces of cannon opened fire upon it from the walls while from the houses the vendeans replied with a musketry fire during the night a number of men laboured to undermine the wall by one of the gates and partially succeeded but day broke before the work was completed and the defenders planted several cannon to bear upon them  the vendeans were too much discouraged to make any further effort and when a few hours later news came that the republican army was fast approaching and would reach the ground in an hours time they again got into motion and pursued their hopeless journey in search of some point where they could cross the river if only to die in their beloved land  on the following day kleber was reinforced by a column eight thousand strong from cherbourg and a reconnaissance was made along the road by which the vendeans had retreated they found everywhere the bodies of men women and children who had succumbed to cold fatigue and misery westermanns cavalry set out in pursuit muller following with his division to support him  marceau was now appointed commanderinchief pending the arrival of turreau and rossignol the latter had almost from the commencement of the war intrigued against every general concerned in the operations especially against kleber he was himself utterly without military talent and owed his position simply to his devotion to the convention and his readiness to denounce the men who failed to satisfy its anticipations of an easy victory or who showed the slightest repugnance to execute its barbarous decrees  with the exception of some three thousand men who marched at the head of the vendean column the fugitives were now utterly disheartened many hid their muskets and cutting sticks thought that being no longer armed they would not be molested by the enemy each night numbers stole away in groups of twos and threes in the hope of finding a boat on the bank of the river others scattered among the villages their appearance exciting compassion but fear of the troops was more powerful and the men for the most part were seized and held prisoners  of the hundred thousand men women and children who had crossed the loire more than half were dead of those who remained fully fifteen thousand were women and children  on the march leigh always rode by the side of his sister generally carrying the child before him jean as one of the leading officers now rode with rochejaquelein at the head of the column patsey suffered less on her own account than on that of the poor people who had to journey on foot the cold was intense and except when they entered a town it was impossible to obtain provisions the horses were worn out and half famished a great proportion of the fugitives were without shoes and the clothing of all was in rags  in order to spare her the sight of the misery prevailing among those who marched in the rear of the column leigh always rode with his sister in the rear of the leading division he himself for the most part walked on foot lending his horse to some wounded man or exhausted woman  when the column left angers it had been intended to march to saumur and cross there but the news arrived that a strong republican force had gathered there and it was determined to change the course and to march through la fleche to le mans by this sudden and unexpected movement rochejaquelein hoped to gain time to give his followers two days rest  the immediate result however was to excite a feeling of despair among a great portion of them their backs were now turned to la vendee and it seemed to them that their last hope of reaching their homes had vanished rochejaqueleins idea however was that in their present state of exhaustion it was impossible to hope to cross the loireguarded as it was at every point and with over one hundred thousand men between him and la vendeeand he intended after giving them the much needed rest to march round through chateaudun to come down on the loire above orleans and so to make his way back into poitou  had he had with him only men the project difficult as it seemed might possibly have been accomplished unembarrassed by baggage trains or cannon the peasants could have out marched their pursuers but hampered by the crowd of wounded sick women and children the movement must be regarded as the inspiration of despair  indeed even the fighting men were no longer in a state to bear the fatigue bad and insufficient food had played havoc with them dysentery was raging in their ranks and many could scarce drag themselves along  we cannot conceal from ourselves that it is nearly over jean said when he told his wife and leigh that the route was changed we shall get to le mans but the republicans will be on our heels and one cannot doubt what the issue will be doubtless a small body will hang together and still try to regain la vendee but we shall have done our duty after our next defeat i will leave the army  i shall not go without telling la rochejaquelein of my intentions he has more than once spoken to me of you both and it was but two days ago that he said to me  martin you are not like the rest of us you have an english wife and your brave young brotherinlaw is english also you have to think of them as well as of la vendee you can make your home in england and live there until better times come  it is no longer a question of defending our country it is lost charette is there now and still fighting but as soon as we are disposed of all these troops that have been hunting us down will be free to act against him and he too must be crushed the peasants have nowhere else to go and it is not with a desire to defend their homeswhich no longer existbut to die in their native land that they seek to return you have from the first done your utmost for la vendee but there can be no occasion that you should throw away your life and those of your wife and brother now that the cause is utterly lost and all hope is at an end  think this over i do not say that it is possible for you to escape but the longer you stay with us the more difficult will it become  so you see i am sure that when i tell him that feeling that we can no longer be of use i am determined to make at least an endeavour to reach england with you he will approve  i think he is right jean no one can say that you have not done your duty to your country to the utmost or can blame you for now doing what you can for your family  just as they neared la fleche a squadron of the enemys cavalry fell upon the rear of the column they killed many of the fugitives but were too small in number to threaten the safety of the column which kept on until it reached the bridge across the loir this had been broken down but fire was opened against the cannon planted on the other side the gunboats that were guarding the river were driven away and a party moving up the bank found two little boats and began to cross  a detachment of republicans hurried to attack them but the loir an affluent of the loire was narrow and the musketry fire of the main body drove them away until two or three hundred men had crossed la rochejaquelein went over and took the command and on their advance the republicans took to their heels rochejaquelein then recrossed and drove off the cavalry that were harrassing the rear  working desperately a strong party threw beams across the broken bridge and the vendeans occupied the town at daybreak the weary fugitives slept till midday when the enemys cavalry reappeared but rochejaquelein with some mounted gentlemen attacked and defeated them and pursued them for some distance  in the evening a force under chalbos approached the town but the vendeans sallied out and speedily scattered them they then broke down the bridge that they had repaired and started for le mans which they captured after threequarters of an hours fighting  two days later kleber was in front of the town westermann and mullers divisions first approached the two days rest had reanimated the vendeans and mullers infantry were driven back three miles but large reinforcements came up and the peasants were forced to fall back again then westermanns cavalry charged into the town carrying dismay among its defenders but la rochejaquelein and his officers soon reanimated them and the cavalry were driven out of the town itself they and the infantry that had come up were able however to maintain themselves in the suburbs  by this time la rochejaquelein was aware that the armies of brest cherbourg and the west were all upon him all through the night the battle went on without interruption the republican columns could gain no ground and were frequently obliged to give way but behind the vendean line of defence panic was gaining ground among the fugitives three or four thousand escaped by the road to laval but the retreat of the rest was cut off by the cavalry  in the morning klebers division came up they at once relieved marceaus division which had been fighting all night and renewed the attack the resistance was feeble a few hundred men disputed every foot of the way and died with a consciousness that they had at least covered the retreat of the rest  a hot pursuit was at once organised and while all taken in the town were massacred at once westermanns cavalry pursued the fugitives in all directions covering the plain with corpses and pressing hard on the rear of the force that still held together  jean martin had the day before the republican attack gone with leigh to la rochejaqueleins quarters and told him that he intended if the town was captured by the enemy to endeavour to save the life of his wife by flight  you are quite right rochejaquelein said warmly i entirely approve of your determination as long as ten of my men hold together it is my duty to remain with them for i have accepted the position of their commander and i must share their fate to the end but it is different with you as the cause of la vendee for which you have fought is lost your first duty now is to your wife i trust that you will all three succeed in making your way to england and enjoy there the peace and rest that none can have in unhappy france i thank you for your gallant services  and i thank you in the name of la vendee leigh for the manner in which you have fought for her and also for the companionship that has so often cheered me during our last days  as for myself i have no wish to live i should feel dishonoured were the army i led to be exterminated and i who accepted the responsibility of leading it to survive we have the consolation at least that never in history has a people fought more bravely against overpowering odds than la vendee has done and though at present we are called brigands i am sure that the world will acknowledge that we have fought like heroes for our country and our faith unfortunate as we may be i am proud to be one of those who have led them so often to victory  when will you go my friend  i intend to be with you to the last jean said when the fight begins leigh and my wife will be ready at a point agreed on in the rear of the town when all is lost i shall join them there we shall ride until beyond pursuit and then put on our disguises  then i will not say goodbye to you now rochejaquelein said  goodbye leigh may heaven keep you and take you safely home again  leigh was too much affected to speak and after a silent grasp of the hand of the gallant young soldier he returned with jean to the quarters they occupied  now for our plans jean said they are as vague as ever but we must settle now it is quite evident that the alarm is so widely spread here in the west that it will be wellnigh impossible to pass through even a village without being questioned alencon on the north has a strong garrison at mayenne on the west is a division and the whole country beyond will be alive with troops on the search for fugitives it is only to the east that the road is open to us  i should say that the safest way will be to travel so as to cross the loir between chateaudun and nogent and then come down on the road running south from fontainebleau through montargis travelling south through nevers we should excite no suspicion if questioned we can say that we are going to visit some friends at macon the unfortunate thing is that we have no papers and i think that our story had best be that we belong to le mans and fled in such haste when the town was captured by the vendeans that we escaped just as we stood and omitted to bring our papers with us  fortunately we all speak french without accent and there is nothing about us to give rise to suspicion that we belong to la vendee if we can think of a more likely story as we go along all the better when we get as far as macon if we ever get there we can decide whether to endeavour to cross the frontier into switzerland or to go down to toulon  now remember patsey my last injunctions are that when you perceive from the rush of fugitives that all is over and that any firing that may still be going on is but an attempt to cover the retreat you must not wait for me but as soon as the sound of combat approaches you will ride off with leigh you need not suppose because i do not join you that i am killed the enemy may have pushed so far through the town that i may find it impossible to join you but from whatever cause i tarry you are not to wait for me  if i am shot it will be a consolation to me to know that you will be away under your brothers protection if i escape i shall if i make my way to england have the hope of meeting you there and shall not be haunted with the fear that you have delayed too long and have sacrificed your lives uselessly i want you and him to give me your solemn promise that you will act thus and will as soon as he considers that further delay will be dangerous ride off remember that this is my last wish this is my last order  i will do as you wish jean his wife said firmly god has preserved us three thus far and i trust that he will continue to do so i shall have the less hesitation because i think that alone you will have perhaps a better chance of escaping than with us at any rate we will carry out your instructions but should we miss each other is there no place where we can arrange to meet  i do not see that it is possible to make any arrangements patsey you may be turned out of your course by circumstances which it is impossible to foresee and the same may be the case with myself suppose we named a seaport there would in the first place be difficulty in finding each other you might see some opportunity of getting across the water and if you lost that the chance might not occur again and the delay might cost you your lives i trust that we shall not be separated dear but i see clearly that if such a misfortune should happen it were best that we should each make our own way in the hope of meeting at poole  you may be sure that i shall join you if possible for i see that if separated your difficulties will be far greater than mine you too would have the burden of the child but let us suppose that i was wounded but got away and managed to obtain shelter in some breton cottage you might be waiting for me for weeks at an agreed point now while travelling you might escape many questions but were you to stop even for a few days at any town or village you may be sure that you would be questioned so closely by the authorities that there would be little chance of your getting on i should know that and should be fretting my heart out  yes i see tis best that we should do as you say jean god forbid that we should be separated but if you do not come to the rendezvous i promise you that we will as you wish go on by ourselves  and now dear we will divide our money we have still three hundred louis left i will take one hundred and you shall take the rest you are much more likely to want money if we are separated than i  you had best sew the greater part up in your saddle leigh  i think we had better divide it as much as possible jean we can put seventyfive louis in each of our saddles and the weight would not be so great that anyone who happens to handle one of them would notice it i can put another fiveandforty in the belt round my waist and keep the odd five in my pocket for expenses of course if we decide to abandon our horses i will make some other arrangement  the best plan leigh will be for us to change the louis for assignats at the first opportunity gold is so scarce that each time you offered to pay with it it would excite suspicion i have no doubt that i can buy assignats here we have taken a quantity from the enemy and la rochejaquelein will i am sure be glad to obtain some gold for them it will be a double advantage we shall have less weight to carry and shall be able to pay our way without the gold exciting suspicion the assignats now are only a quarter of their face value so that for two hundred louis i should get eight hundred louis in assignats of which i would take two hundred and you could take the rest  that would certainly be an excellent plan jean for two hundred louis in gold would be a serious weight to carry and if found on us would in itself be sufficient to condemn us as intending emigres  jean at once took two hundred louis which had hitherto been carried in their wallets and went out he returned in an hour  that is satisfactorily settled he said blacquard who is in charge of the treasury was delighted to obtain some gold and has given us five times the amount in assignats of this i will take two hundred and fifty louis worth you will have seven hundred and fifty louis in assignats and we will divide the hundred louis in gold of the latter you had best sew up twenty in each of your saddles and you can carry ten about you people are so anxious for gold that in case of need you can get services rendered for it that you would fail to obtain for any amount of paper  the greater portion of the assignats and the gold as agreed was sewn up in the saddles some provisions packed in the valises and jean and leigh went out together and fixed upon a spot where they were to wait the preparations were all finished when firing broke out jean kissed his wife  may gods blessing keep you he said i trust that we shall meet again when the fighting is over  then he kissed his child wrung leigh by the hand and rode off to join the general the women children and the men who had thrown away their arms the sick and wounded were already leaving the town  marthe you must go now patsey said to the faithful nurse  they had bought a horse for her from a peasant who had captured it a riderless animal that belonged to one of westermann troopers  here are fifty louis in assignats i wish that you could have gone with us but that is not possible francois is waiting outside and will take care of you as we have agreed the best possible plan will be to separate yourselves from the others as soon as possible the blues are sure to be keeping close to them ride straight for the river by bylanes and if you cannot obtain a boat swim your horse across and then make for home if we get safely to england we will write to you as soon as these troubles are over and you can join us there  god bless you madame it breaks my heart to part with you and the child but i see that it is for the best  leigh fetched the horse round and assisted her to mount behind francois the two women both weeping were still exchanging adieus when leigh said to francois  ride on the sooner this is over the better for both  the man nodded  god bless you young master i will look after marthe as soon as we get away from the rest i shall get off and run by her side the horse would never carry two of us far  so saying he touched the horse with his heel and they rode off    chapter 15 in disguise   leigh returned into the house with his sister  cheer up patsey he said it is very hard parting but i have every hope that they will succeed in getting safely home francois is a sharp fellow they have a good stock of food and they wont have to go into any village and being only two they will have a far better chance of crossing the river than if they kept with the others  how they are fighting patsey said a few minutes later  indeed the roar of musketry was unceasing and was mingled with the louder cracks of the field guns  our men are holding their own leigh replied the firing is no nearer than it was half an hour ago  now you had better lie down patsey i will keep a sharp lookout and the moment i see any signs of our men retiring we will mount i know there is no chance of your sleeping but it will rest you to lie down and we shall have a long ride before us tomorrow  patsey nodded but after he had gone out she did not lie down but threw herself on her knees by the couch and prayed for the safety of her husband hour after hour passed from time to time leigh returned and towards morning told patsey that it was time that they should mount  our men have not begun to give way yet he said but they say that klebers division has just arrived there is a lull in the fighting at present but no doubt they will relieve the division that has been fighting all night and our men cannot hope to hold out for long i have just brought the horses round to the door now i will strap the valises on while you wrap louis up warmly  in five minutes they started for the point agreed on before they reached it the firing broke out again with increased violence in an hour numbers of men began to make their way past them one of them halted he was one of jeans tenants  ah madame he said as he recognized herfor it was now broad daylighti fear that all is lost you had best ride at once the blues will not come just yet for la rochejaquelein with four or five hundred of his best followers will hold the place till the last so as to give us time to get away  did you see my husband leroux  he was with the general madame they and the horsemen charged again and again whenever the blues pushed forward  thank god he is safe so far patsey said goodbye leroux we may not meet again  we shall meet in heaven madame the man said reverently they may take away our country they may kill our cures they may destroy our churches but they cannot take away our god may he protect you madame and pressing the hand she held out to him he hurried on  faster and faster the fugitives passed them but for an hour the combat continued unabated then the exulting shouts of the blues showed that they were making way the gallant band of vendeans were not indeed retiring but they were being annihilated patsey had said but little during the anxious time of waiting from time to time she murmured  will he never come oh god send him to us  presently a mounted officer rode past  ride on ride on he shouted the blues will be here in a minute  we must go patsey leigh said as without drawing rein the officer rode on  no no wait a few minutes leigh he will surely come soon  presently however a number of peasants their faces blackened with powder ran past  the blues are on our heels they shouted they will be here in a minute they are but a hundred yards away  come patsey leigh said remember your promise we must go it is madness waiting any longer  and as he spoke one of the peasants running past fell dead shot by a musket ball from the rear leigh seized patseys bridle and setting his own horse in motion they rode on they were but just in time for before they had ridden two hundred yards leigh looking round saw the republicans issuing from the town  pull yourself together patsey leigh exclaimed we may have their cavalry after us in a minute or two remember jean trusts you to carry out his instructions  patsey drew herself up struck the horse with her whip and galloped on at full speed they soon left the road followed by the rest of the fugitives and turned down one leading east the din of battle had ceased now but a scattered fire of musketry showed that the enemy were engaged in their usual work of shooting all who fell into their hands  after riding for an hour at full speed they drew rein at a wood and entering it dismounted and put on their disguises they had no fear now of pursuit the enemys cavalry must have made a very long march to reach the town and their horses must be worn out by their previous exertions while their own had had fortyeight hours rest during which time they had been well fed and cared for moreover any pursuit that was made would be in the direction taken by the bulk of the fugitives  mounting again they rode on it was but a narrow country road that they were traversing and during the day they only passed through two or three small hamlets  are the brigands coming this way they were asked  no leigh replied they are fighting at le mans if they are beaten they wont come this way but will make south we thought it best to leave the town when fighting is going on in the streets it is time for quiet people to be off  they rode forty miles before night and then entered a wood having agreed that until they got farther away from the scene of action and struck the road running south it would be better not to enter any place where they would be questioned choosing an open space among the trees leigh took off the bridles to let the horses pluck what grass they could after giving to each a hunch of bread from their store then he returned with the blankets that had been rolled up and fastened behind the saddles  now patsey you must eat something and drink some wine you must keep up your strength for the sake of louis and jean  patsey had spoken very few words during the day she shook her head  i will try for louiss sake she said as to jean and she stopped  as to jean he said we have every reason to hope for the best many things may have happened to prevent his joining us the blues may have pushed in between his party and us and he may have found that he could not rejoin us his horse may have been shot and he obliged to fly on foot he has gone through all these battles from the first and has never been wounded why should we suppose that he has not done the same now i feel sure that if he had lost his horse he would not have tried to join us for he would have thought that he would have hampered our escape  jean is full of resources and has everything in his favour he is not like the others who have but one aim to get back to la vendee and die there and whose way is barred by the loire he has all france open to him and if he gains a port has but to get some sailor clothes to pass unnoticed he is well provided with money and has everything in his favour when he once gets away from le mans the road would be open for we may be sure that the enemy will all gather in the rear of the remains of our army  i see all that patsey said and if i were but sure that he got safely away i should feel comparatively easy however leigh i will try and look at the best side of things if jean is killed he has died gloriously doing his duty till the last if he is not he will some day be restored to me  that is right dear he said you have always been so hopeful and cheery through all this business that i am sure you will keep up your courage now we have every reason to hope and for my part i confidently expect to see jean safe and sound when we arrive home now let us set to we both want something badly  patsey did her best and being indeed faint from hunger having eaten nothing since the evening before she felt all the better and stronger when she had finished her meal and was able to chatter cheerfully to little louis who had ridden before leigh all day and who was now just beginning to talk then they spread a blanket on the ground and lying down together for warmth covered themselves with the rest of their wraps and leigh was glad to find by her steady breathing that the fatigue of the last twentyfour hours had sufficed to send his sister to sleep in spite of her grief at her separation from her husband  the next day they crossed the road leading to tours between chateaudun and chartres once over this there was no longer any occasion for haste there was no fear of their connection with the struggle in the west being suspected and they had now only to face the troubles consequent on travelling unprovided with proper papers  late that evening they entered the town of artenay on the main road from paris to orleans coming down upon it from the north side here they entered a quiet inn the landlord was a jovial pleasantfaced man of some sixty years of age and his wife a kind motherlylooking woman as usual the travellers signed the names they had agreed upon in the book kept for the purpose patsey retaining her own name and he signing as lucien porson  the landlady seeing that patsey was completely worn out at once took her off to her room  ah i thought that monsieur was too young to be madames husband the landlord said  leigh laughed  i am her brother he said her husband is a sailor and she is to join him at toulon  i see the resemblance the landlord said it is a long journey indeed for her and with a child under two years old and in such weather  but you forget that such a place as toulon no longer exists it has been decreed that the town that received the english and resisted the republic is to be altogether destroyed except of course the arsenal and is henceforth to be known as the town without a name  the tone rather than the words convinced leigh that his host was not an admirer of the present state of things leigh shrugged his shoulders slightly and said with a smile  perhaps france will change her own name surely a republic cannot put up with the name that has been associated for centuries with kings  the landlord brought his hand down with a heavy smack on leighs shoulder  ah he said i see that you are too young as i am too old to care for the present changes with anyone in the town i should not venture to say anything but i am sure by your face that you can be trusted  and i can say the same to you landlord  are your papers by the by in good order  frankly we have no papers  the landlord gave a low whistle expressive of surprise and consternation  and how do you expect to travel monsieur how you have got so far as this i cannot make out for at any tavern where you put up you might of course have been asked for them  we have not put up at any towns as yet but have slept at little places where no questions were asked  but you cant get on like that monsieur even in the small villages they are on the watch for suspected persons you must have papers of some sort  that is all very well leigh said the question is where to get them  what story do you mean to tell  if we had been stopped anywhere on our way here we should have said that we belonged to le mans that like most of the other inhabitants we fled before the vendeans entered and in such haste that i forgot all about papers and indeed could not have got them had i thought of it as all the authorities had fled before we did  that story added to your appearance and that of madame as respectable citizens might succeed sometimes with those who are not anxious to show their zeal but as most of these functionaries are so you would probably if it was a village be sent on under a guard to the next town and if it were a town would be thrown into prison and you know to get in a prison in our days is  equivalent to a sentence of death leigh put in as he hesitated  you must get papers somehowsomething that would pass at any rate in the villages where as often as not there is not a man who can read i will see what i can do a cousin of mine is clerk to the mayor he is a good fellow though he has to pretend to be a violent supporter of the convention  i dont know how you are situated monsieur but times are hard and all salaries terribly in arrears and when they are paid it is in assignats and i need hardly say that when you pay in assignats you dont buy cheap  we have money leigh said and i would pay any reasonable sum in gold for proper papers  sapristi you might almost tempt the maire himself by offering him gold only he would suspect that you must have more hidden away and that by arresting you he could make himself master of the whole instead of only a part but since you offer gold i have no doubt that my cousin would not mind running some little risk how much shall i say monsieur  i would if necessary give forty louis  that is more than his yearly salary the innkeeper said half of that would be ample i will go to him at once it is important that you should get papers of some kind for at any moment anyone might come in and demand to see them  here are ten louis i have more sewn up in my saddle and can give him the other ten later on when i get an opportunity to go to the stable unnoticed  that will do very well monsieur i will be off at once  it was an hour before he returned and leigh and patsey had just finished supper as there were two or three other persons in the room he said nothing but signified by a little nod that he had succeeded a quarter of an hour later the other customers having finished their meal went out  here are your papers he said as he handed a document to leigh  it was a printed form blanks being left for the names description and the object of journey  arthenay mairie  to all concerned  it is hereby testified that citizen lucien porson and his sister citoyenne martin both of good repute and well disposed to the republic natives of this town of arthenay are travelling accompanied by a child of the latter to marseilles whither they go on family affairs and to join citoyenne martins husband a master mariner of that town  the destination had been altered when they heard of the state of things at toulon the document was purposed to be signed by the maire under his official seal  there is only one difficulty the landlord said as leigh and patsey warmly thanked him and that is that although it will pass you when you have once left this town it would be dangerous to use it here and you may at any moment be asked for it but my cousin who is a charming fellow pointed out the difficulty to me and said  the best thing will be for me to take a couple of men and pay the official visit to him myself  i expect that he will be here in a few minutes  then as the stableman has gone out at lastat least i see no lights therei will go and get the rest of the money  yes i met him a hundred yards off on my way back there is no one about i will take a lantern and go out with you  in ten minutes they returned leigh having the ten louis required in his pocket a quarter of an hour later the door opened and a man wearing the scarf which showed him to be an officer of the municipality entered followed by two men with the cockade of the republic in their hats  this is citizen porson and citoyenne martin his sister the landlord who accompanied the party said  the functionary walked up to the table and said gruffly your papers citizen  leigh handed him the document he glanced through it  that is right he said citizen porson and citoyenne martin of the arrondissement of paris travelling to marseilles duly signed by the maire of the arrondissement and duly sealed that is all in order we are obliged to be particular citizen there are many ill disposed to the republic travelling through the country  will you sit down citizen and take a glass of wine with me landlord draw two stoups of wine for these two good citizens  the two men followed the landlord out to the public room  i should think jeannette leigh said to his sister you had better to retire to bed you have had a long days ride and must i am sure be tired out  as soon as she had left the room leigh dropped the ten louis into the adjoints hand  i thank you with all my heart he said you have done a good action and i can assure you that it can do no harm to the republic against whom i have no intention of conspiring there is no fear i suppose that the maires signature may be questioned  there is no fear whatever of that because the signature is precisely similar to that which occurs on all official documents the maire is without doubt an excellent republican and a devoted servant of the convention but he is altogether ignorant of letters and the consequence is that i sign all official documents for him so you see there was no trouble whatever in filling in signing and sealing this letter the only matter that concerned me was that if by any chance you should be arrested as a suspect possibly a demand might be made as to how you obtained this pass however even that did not trouble me greatly for as i myself open and read the maires letters i should have no difficulty in keeping him altogether in the dark as to the purport of any letter that might come and should myself pen an answer with explanations which would no doubt be found satisfactory  and now can you tell me sir which in your opinion would be the best port for me to make to to leave the country it matters little whether we go by land or sea  it would be more easy for you to make your way to a port than across the frontier the adjoint said but when you reach a port your difficulties would but begin in the first place our trade with foreign countries is almost at a standstill and every vessel that goes out is rigidly searched for concealed emigres  on the other hand once across the frontier your troubles would be at an end but every road is closely watched every village is on the lookout for the orders are precise that all persons leaving france shall be arrested and detained until in a position to prove their identity and to place the truth of the reason given for journeying beyond all doubt i do not say that it might not be possible to bribe peasants to take you by unfrequented paths over the jura but the journey would be arduous in the extreme and probably impossible to be performed on horseback  but for my part if i were in your position and desired to leave the country i should go north instead of south i should go in the first place to paris stay there in quiet lodgings for a little time until you became known and you might then get your papers visaed to enable you to continue your journey to calais or dunkirk money will go just as far among the incorruptibles of paris as it will here you might obtain a passage down the seine to rouen or havre  that would certainly suit us best i regret now that i had the paper made out for marseilles  that can easily be remedied monsieur if you will walk back with me to the mairie i will write a fresh paper out and destroy the one i have given you but what shall i say is your object in journeying to paris you are too young to be going to purchase goods and indeed would hardly be taking a woman and child with you for such a purpose  now monsieur frankly tell me who you are i have some relations in paris quiet bourgeois who keep a small shop near the markets if i were to give you a letter to them saying that you have business in paris and have asked me to recommend someone who would provide you with quiet lodgings no doubt they would willingly take you in but i would not involve them in danger you might be recognised as being members of some family who are proscribed and in that case not only would my friends get into trouble but as they would of course say that you were recommended to them by me i might find myself in a very unpleasant position  there is no fear of anything of that sort i and my sister are both english she married the son of a merchant at nantes and i came over with her to learn the business there have as you know been troubles in that part of france we endeavoured to escape but she was separated from her husbandwho has i greatly fear been killedand we of course are both anxious to rejoin our family in england  how long have you been in france monsieur you speak the language well  we have been over here nearly three years  well i do not think that there is any risk unless of course you are caught in the act of trying to make your escape but i think that it would be as well that my friends should be prepared for your coming i know a man who is leaving for paris tomorrow i will give him my letter and ask him to deliver it personally as soon as he gets there then you can follow twentyfour hours later now that it is known that i have examined your papers and found them correct there will be no further inquiry about you and at any rate you could stay here for a day or two without any questions being asked  that would be an admirable plan monsieur and i cannot tell you how much i am obliged to you  say no more about that monsieur you have paid me well for it and moreover i am not a bad fellow though at present i am obliged to appear to be a strong supporter of the people in paris now if you will put on your hat and come along with me i will leave you a short distance from the hotel de ville to which i have access at all hours i shall of course simply put in the passport that you are travelling to paris on private matters and that you will stay with your friend citizen tourrier in the rue des halles  a quarter of an hour later leigh returned to the auberge furnished with the required paper the adjoint had said on handing it to him  i shall not come round tomorrow we met as strangers yesterday and it is as well i should not appear to be intimate with you but should you find yourself in any difficulty send for me at once and i will soon set matters right  is it all satisfactorily arranged monsieur the hotel keeper asked when leigh returned  perfectly your friend has done even more than he promised  and he told him of the change that had been made in the plans  that is certainly better i have been wondering myself how you would ever be able to get away from marseilles now it seems comparatively easy i have no doubt that my cousins friends in paris will be able to get you another pass or to put you in the way of travelling to one of the ports though no doubt it will be almost as difficult to get away from there as from marseilles  i think that could be managed landlord i am a pretty good sailor and there ought to be no great difficulty in getting hold of a boat and making out to sea and when once away i could steer for england or get on board some vessel bound there  he tapped at his sisters door she was still up  you are very late leigh  yes but you will be able to sleep as long as you like tomorrow as we are not going to start till next day and are then going north instead of south our paper has been changed for paris instead of marseilles and we are going to the house of a cousin of the man who gave me the pass so we shall be safe so far and ought to have no difficulty whatever in journeying from there either to havre or one of the northern ports i will tell you all about it tomorrow  they passed the next day quietly and both felt better for the short rest in addition to the pass the adjoint had given leigh a note to his cousin it was unsealed and read  my dear cousin  the bearer of this is monsieur porson and his sister madame martin of whom i wrote to you you will find them amiable people who will give you but little trouble i have assured them that they will find themselves very comfortable with you and that you will do all in your power for them for the sake of your affectionate cousin  simon valles  adjoint to the maire of arthenay  they journeyed by easy stages stopping at etampes arpajon and longjumeau and rode on the fourth day into paris they had no difficulty in finding the shop of monsieur tourrier it was a grocers and as soon as they alighted from their horses its owner came out and greeted them heartily  madame and monsieur are both most welcome he said i have received a letter from my cousin simon i am glad indeed to receive his friends fortunately our rooms upstairs are unlet strangers are rare in paris at present  he called a boy from the shop and told him to show leigh the way to some stables near he then entered the house accompanied by patsey with her child here she was received by madame tourrier a plumpfaced businesslike woman and was not long in finding out that she was the real head of the establishment  i have got the rooms ready for you she said we were surprised indeed to get a letter from simon valles for he is a poor correspondent though he generally comes to stay with us for three days once a year he is a good fellow but it is a pity that he did not go into trade he would have done better for himself than by becoming adjoint to the maire of arthenay it has a high sound but in these days when men are paid their salaries in assignats it is but a poor living however i suppose that it is an easy life for i dont think hard work would suit simon the last time he was up we tried to persuade him that he would do better here but he laughed and said that peoples heads were safer in arthenay than they were in paris but that is folly the convention does not trouble itself with small shopkeepers it knows well enough that we have work enough to do to earn our living without troubling ourselves about politics yet if the truth were known a good many of us are better to do than some of those they call aristocrats this is a busy quarter you see and we are close to the markets and the country people who come in know that we sell good groceries and on cheaper terms than they can get them in their villages we should do better still if my husband would but bestir himself but men are poor creatures and i dont know what would become of them if they had not us women to look after their affairs  they now reached the rooms which were small but comfortable and the price which madame tourrier named seemed to patsey to be very moderate  you see your room is furnished as a sitting room also madame and you and your brother can talk over your affairs here as to your meals i could provide your cafe au lait in the morning but i cant undertake to cook for you but there are many good places where you can obtain your meals at a cheap rate in the neighbourhood how long do you expect to remain in paris  that i cannot say at present my husband is a sailor but i have not heard from him for a long time at arthenay there is but small opportunity of learning what happens outside and it may be that i shall have to travel to havre to obtain news of him although i am troubled greatly by the fear that his ship has been lost or captured by the english we have never been in paris before and my brother naturally wishes to stay a short time to see the sights  madame tourrier shook her head  there are but few sights to see she said the churches are all closed or at least are turned into meeting places and clubs it is not as it was before the troubles began there are few amusements and no reviews or pageants i do not say that it is not better so i have no opinion on such subjects i have never once been to the hall of representatives i have no time for such follies and except on sunday afternoons i never stir out of doors still no doubt it will all be new to him and as you have horses you can ride over to versailles and other places round there is not much of that now people think of nothing but the convention talk of nothing but of the speeches there and of robespierre and saint just and danton it seems to me that they are always quarrelling and that nothing much comes of it  now if you will excuse me madame i will go down to the shop again my husband cannot be trusted there a minute and if my back is turned he will be selling the best sugar for the price of the worst then we shall lose money or the worst sugar for the price of the best and then we shall lose customers  so saying she hurried away in a few minutes leigh came up  i was told where to find you he said madame is in the thick of business and there were half a dozen customers waiting to be served monsieur was standing a few yards away from the front of the shop it was he who gave me instructions for finding your room  it is best he said that madame should be asked no questions while she is busy i always go out myself when customers come in she is one of the best of wives and manages affairs excellently but her temper is short she likes to do things her own way and as it pleases her i never interfere with her  i think he is wise not to do so patsey laughed i can see already that she is mistress of the establishment but from what i have seen at nantes i think that it is generally the women who look after the shops and mind the businesses however though she speaks sharply i should say that she is a kindhearted woman however we may be very thankful that we have obtained a shelter where we can live safely and quietly until we have fixed on our plans for the future  but although monsieur tourrier was in all matters connected with the business but as a child in the hands of his wife he was far better acquainted with what was passing around them and when leigh mentioned to him that he intended to ride out to versailles he at once warned him against doing so  my dear monsieur he said i know nothing of the state of things at arthenay and for aught i know people may go out riding for pleasure there but it would be little short of madness to attempt such a thing here at present things have got to such a state that for any man to seem richer than another is in itself a crime here all must be on an equality were you to ride out every man you pass would look askance at you at the first village through which you rode you would be arrested and to be arrested at present is to be condemned there are no questions asked the prisoners are brought in in bunches and are condemned wholesale i say nothing against the condemnation of the aristocrats but when perhaps two or three aristocrats are brought up with half a dozen journalists and a dozen others who may have been arrested merely out of spite and are all condemned in five minutes it is clear that the only way to live is to avoid being arrested and the only way to avoid being arrested is to avoid attracting attention  if you were really going on a matter of business it would be different but to ride to versailles merely to see the place would be regarded as ample proof that you were an aristocrat and no one would regard your papers as anything but a proof that these had been obtained by fraud and that you were either an aristocrat or a spy of pitts or a girondist and certainly an enemy of the convention therefore monsieur if you wish to go anywhere walk or go out in a market cart for to ride might be fatal  i will take your advice leigh said i did not think that things were so bad as that  they could not be worse monsieur it would be impossible but we who are quiet men think that it cannot go on much longer even the sansculottes are getting tired of bloodshed there is no longer a great crowd to see the executions and the tumbrils pass along without insults and imprecations being hurled against the prisoners  the men of the convention having killed all the girondists are now quarrelling among themselves robespierre is still all powerful but the party opposed to him are gaining in strength and there is a feeling that ere long there will be a terrible struggle between them and if robespierre is beaten there are many of us who think that the reign of terror will come to an end we who are too insignificant to be watched talk these things over together when we gather at our cafe and there is no one but ourselves present and even then we talk only in whispers but we all live in hopes of a change and any change must surely be for the better    chapter 16 a friend at last   day after day leigh went out into the town more than once he saw the fatal tumbrils going along in the distance but he always turned and walked in the opposite direction once or twice having changed his clothes for those of a workman he fought his way into the public galleries of the convention and listened to the speeches in which it seemed to him that the principal object of each speaker was to exceed those who had gone before him in violence and that the most violent was the most loudly applauded both by the galleries and the assembly  patsey was most anxious to be off but he urged that it would not do to show haste she did not leave the house at all while he was out almost all day at the end of the fortnight he told monsieur tourrier that he had now finished his business and asked him if he could obtain from the maire of the arrondissement a pass down to havre  it is a pity that you did not get your pass direct from arthenay he said you say that your sister wants to make inquiries about a husband there and that you are taking her down and you also say that you are a sailor  yes  then i should think that the best thing for you would be to dress yourself as a sailor again it will seem more natural than for you to be in that civilian dress i can go with you and say that you were strongly recommended to me by the maires adjoint at arthenay and that your papers are all en regle if he asks why you did not have your papers made out in the first place to havre say that you had hoped to have been joined by your brotherinlaw here but as he has not arrived your sister is anxious about him and wishes therefore to go on to havre which indeed he has requested her to do as it was uncertain whether he would be able to leave his ship  i know of course that it is all right or my cousin would not have recommended you so strongly to me but in these days everyone is suspicious and one cannot be too cautious i will get one of the market authorities to go up with me i am well known to them all and tis likely that none of the people at the mairie will know me seeing that i am a quiet man and keep myself to myself  leigh had no trouble in buying a sailors dress at a shop down by the wharves and having put this on went up with monsieur tourrier and one of the market officers to the mairie as the former had anticipated there was no difficulty leighs pass was examined the market official testified to the grocer as being a wellknown citizen doing business with the market people and taking no part in public affairs while monsieur tourrier showed the letter that he had received from his cousin the adjoint at arthenay  what is the name of the ship which your sisters husband commands the maire asked  the henriette a lugger formerly she traded with england but since the war broke out she trades between the ports on our western coast  and you have been a sailor on board her  yes citizen  the maire nodded and made out the pass for jeannette martin travelling to join her husband the captain of the lugger henriette for her brother lucien porson and for louis martin aged two years son of the abovenamed citoyenne martin  as they agreed that it would now be best to travel by water leigh next went to the stables and as the horses were both good ones obtained a fair price for them the next morning they went on board a sailing craft going down the river and after a cordial adieu from their host and hostess and a promise to take up their abode there on their return through paris they went on board leigh had sold the saddles with the horses having on the journey to paris removed the bundles of assignats concealed in them  the accommodation on board was very fair patsey occupied a roomy cabin aft the rest slept in a large cabin forward for before the troubles began the majority of people travelling from paris down to rouen or havre went by water and although the boats were mainly constructed for the carriage of merchandise the conveyance of passengers formed an important part of the profits at present however there was but little travelling and patsey had the womens cabin to herself while one other male messenger with the master and two hands had the forward compartments to themselves  the master explained that at ordinary times his two men occupied a tiny place boarded off from the hold or in summer slept on deck but that as there were so few passengers they lived with the rest for as he growled under his breath the present  the voyage was slow but not unpleasant there was scarce wind enough to fill the two sails carried by the boat but the captain and his two hands frequently got out sweeps to keep the boat in the middle of the current they stopped for a day at rouen while the cargo destined for that town was landed patsey and leigh were glad to spend the day in the town visiting the cathedral taking their meals at a restaurant for the cuisine on board the boat was not of the highest character  we used to keep a regular cook the captain lamented in those days we often carried several passengers but at present when we seldom have more than one or two we cannot afford it the revolution is no doubt a grand thing and has greatly benefited the nation but it has weighed hardly on us there are but half the boats on the river there used to be and they are hardly paying expenses now that no one travels those that go to sea are worse off still for what with the falling off in trade and with the english cruisers all along the coast there is little employment for seamen save in the privateers however they dont starve for the greater portion of the men on the coast have to go in the ships of the republic  on the sixth day after leaving paris they arrived at havre here they had no difficulty in obtaining lodgings in a small auberge near the port their pass was on their arrival sent to the authorities of the town and duly stamped leighs first inquiries were for the henriette he found that she was well known in the port and had sailed for la rochelle six weeks before  she does not very often come up here one of the sailors said sometimes she is months between her visits as likely as not she may have been captured on her way down her port is bordeaux and if you wanted to find her you had much better have gone straight there than come to this place  i do want to find her leigh said is there any chance of finding a ship going down south  well you might find one the man said but you would have to take your chance of getting there many of the ships are laid up for the risk of capture is great it is small craft that for the most part make the venture they creep along inshore and either run into a port or anchor under the guns of a battery if they see a british cruiser outside drawing so little water they can keep in nearer than a cruiser would dare to and as they all can take the mud they do not mind if they stick on the sands for a tide  leigh returned with the news to his sister  what do you think patsey he said i do not say that we cannot cross from here in a boat though i have learned that the entrance to the channel is guarded by gunboats if we passed safely through these we should have serious risk and many hardships to undergo i hear that there are numerous french privateers and we might be picked up by one of them instead of by an english cruiser i am afraid that our passes in that case would not avail us in the slightest  now if we go down to bordeaux we have only to wait till the henriette comes in possibly she may be there when we arrive in that case i am sure that lefaux will be willing to take us out and either put us on board a british cruiser or land us in england  certainly we will go to bordeaux patsey said we may find jean there if he escaped that night he would make for the loire and as he is a good swimmer he would get over without difficulty and he would then try to make his way towards bordeaux  that may be so patsey but i would not be too sanguine about our finding him there it was so much nearer for him to have made for one of the northern ports that he might very well have done so and as soon as he managed to obtain a sea outfit he would no longer be suspected of having anything to do with the vendeans  they had learnt before this that after the fight at le mans the vendeans had made for the river had desperately fought their way through the forces that barred their march had come down on the banks but had failed to find any means to cross it then they had turned into brittany again for a short distance had fought two or three more desperate battles and had again reached the loire there was but one leaky boat to be found in this la rochejaquelein with a few of his officers had crossed the river to bring back some boats that were moored on the opposite bank  directly they got across they were attacked but la rochejaquelein with two or three others effected their escape  after this the vendeans no longer kept together the women and children wounded and invalids hid themselves in the woods where they were hunted down like wild beasts and either slaughtered at once or sent to nantes where thousands were either executed or drowned by the infamous carrier one of the most sanguinary villains produced by the revolution many of the men managed to cross the river either by swimming on rough rafts or in boats in la vendee the war was still going on for charette had marched up again from lower poitou and was keeping a large force of the republican troops engaged  i will try not to hope too much patsey said but at any rate i am for going down to bordeaux for apart from the chance of finding jean there it seems much safer than putting out to sea in a little boat  i certainly think so leigh replied now i will go out and make inquiries as to what craft there may be bound south  he returned in a couple of hours  i have arranged for our passage patsey she is a fastlooking little craft with very decent accommodation she is in the wine trade and brought a cargo safely up last week and will start again the day after tomorrow she carries a crew of eight hands and i have made inquiries about the captain and hear a very good report of him and he seemed to me a firstrate fellow when i mentioned the name of the henriette he said that he knew her well and was acquainted both with the present captain and with your jean he had heard from lefaux that her former owner had been denounced and had been obliged to fly from nantes to a chateau that he had in la vendee the henriette has never been into nantes since but went down to bordeaux and was there registered in another owners name and lefaux had worked for him ever since  i fancy he said she sometimes makes a run with brandy to england she was in that business before and had lefaux said been chased many a time by english cutters but had always managed to give them the slip  i was half inclined to tell him that i was jeans brotherinlaw but i thought it better not to until we had been to sea for a day or two and had learned a little more about him  the next day leigh went to the mairie and explained that not having found the ship commanded by citoyenne martins husband and thinking it likely that they would hear of him at bordeaux they had taken passage by the trois freres which sailed the next day the addition was made to his papers without a question and the next morning they went on board they were heartily received by the captain  you ought to bring us luck madame he said i mean citoyenne but the old word slips out of ones mouth sometimes it is not often that i have a lady passenger there are few who travel now and before the war broke out people preferred taking passage in larger ships than mine still i will do my best to make you comfortable and i can assure you that leon my cook is by no means a bad hand at turning out dainty dishes he was cook in an hotel at one time but he let his tongue wag too freely and having to leave suddenly was glad enough to ship with me fortunately he likes the life and i do not think anything would tempt him to go back to an hotel kitchen again  i am not particular i can assure you patsey said in these times we all have to rough it still i own that i like a good dinner better than a bad one  we shall put in to a good many little ports the skipper said sailing as close as we do inshore i always make a port if i can as evening comes on and we are therefore never without fresh meat fish and vegetables  how long shall we be going down  that i cannot tell you it all depends upon the wind we may too be kept in port for two or three days if there is an enemys cruiser anywhere about we may get there in ten days we may take three weeks  before the boat set sail a commissary with two men came on board and examined the passes of the passengers and searched below the hatches to make sure that no one was hidden there as soon as they had completed their inspection the sails were hoisted and the trois freres started on her way down the channel the wind was light and blowing from the southwest and they were just able to lay their course and anchored for the night off the mouth of the vire river  i suppose tomorrow you will get round the cape de la hague captain leigh said  no we shall not attempt that the coast is a very difficult one with furious currents we shall bring up off cherbourg and start at daylight and shall i hope be well down towards the bay of avranches by nightfall there is no fear of a british cruiser till we get out towards ushant they do not care about coming inside the islands what with the fogs the rocks and the currents it is safer outside than in besides there is little to be picked up except coasters like ourselves and fishing boats there is hardly any foreign trade between havre and brest it is from there down to the mouth of the gironde that their cruisers are so thick from ushant to boulogne there are plenty of them but these are chiefly occupied in guarding their ships going up and down the channel from our privateers which run out from every port dieppe and havre granville avranches and saint malo  the skipper had by no means over praised his cook who turned them out a better dinner than any that they had eaten since the troubles began with the exception only of those they had had at arthenay  he takes a pride in it the captain said and you will never get good work done in any line unless by a man who does so a sailor who is careless about the appearance of his ship is sure to be careless about the keeping of the watch and is not to be trusted in matters of navigation when you see a craft with every rope in its place everything spotlessly clean the brass work polished up and the paint carefully attended to you may be sure that the skipper is as particular in more important matters it is just so with our man it is a little bit of a galley but his saucepans shine like gold everything is clean and in its place he grumbles if we run short of anything and is a good deal more particular about my dinner being just what it should be than i am myself  sometimes when we have rough weather i say to him make me a soup today leon i shall be well content with that and it is not weather for turning out a regular dinner  he always replies gravely monsieur anyone can cook when the sea is calm it is on an occasion like this that one who knows his business is required monsieur will dine as usual  and up comes dinner with three or four courses cooked to perfection for myself i would rather snatch a few mouthfuls and go up on deck again but this would hurt leons feelings if he saw it and he might even consider that he must seek another employer for that his talents were wasted upon me so i go through it all with exemplary patience i would not lose him for anything not only because i own i like good food but the trois freres has such a reputation for good living that if i am in port passengers will wait for days to sail with me instead of going by other craft  and then too i have no trouble with my crew and it is rarely indeed that i change one of my hands for although their meals are of course much simpler than mine they are all perfect in their way  it takes a great deal of trouble off my hands too instead of my having a dozen little accounts to go into at every port we enter i allow him a certain sum and he manages on thatso much a day for my own table so much for each passenger and so much for the crew how he does it i dont know i find that it is cheaper than it used to be before his time and yet i have all sorts of dainties i never dreamt of then  i say to him sometimes leon you must be ruining yourself but he smiles and says i am well content captain if you are satisfied i am so  he buys the fish off the boats as they come in and i can understand that he gets them far more cheaply than if he waited till they were hawked in the streets he is great at omelets and when he has a chance he is ashore before the countrywomen come into the market and will buy the whole stock of eggs a pound or two of butter and three or four couples of fowls from one woman who is glad to sell cheaply and so be free to return home at once at bordeaux he lays in a stock of snipe and other birds from the sand hills and marshes oysters and other such matters he is a great favourite with the crew and in cold weather or stormy nights there is always hot soup ready for them  he has only one fault as a rule the cooks are expected to help get up the anchor and sails but he will not put a hand to sailors work he says that a cook must not have a rough hand but that it should be as soft as a womans personally i believe that is all nonsense however as we have a fairly strong crew i do not press him on the subject though sometimes when i tail on to a rope myself and see him leaning quietly against his galley smoking his pipe i am inclined to use strong language  i dont think that is much to put up with captain patsey said with a smile if he always cooks for you such breakfasts and dinners as we have had today and i do think that there is perhaps something in what he says about rough hands  well i feel that myself he said still it is a little aggravating when everyone else is working hard to see a man calmly smoking and never raising a finger to help  the next day they kept very close inshore more than once a white sail was seen in the distance which the captain pronounced from its cut to belong to a british cruiser  the weather is fine you see and the wind is steady so they are coming rather farther into the bay than usual we shall see more of them as soon as we are round that cape ahead for they keep a very sharp lookout off cherbourg  it was not however until they had rounded ushant that any british vessel came near enough to cause them uneasiness there were two large frigates cruising backwards and forwards off brest and a brigofwar came within shot as they were doubling penmarch point  there is plenty of water for her here the skipper said however she will hardly catch us before we are under shelter of the batteries of quimper  i should have thought that she would hardly think you worth the trouble of chasing  it may be that they think we are carrying fresh meat from saint malo to nantes there is a good deal of trade that way this time of year when meat will keep good for a week or it may be that they want to get news of what ships there are in brest however it is certain that he is in earnest he is politely requesting us to lower our sails  he laughed as a puff of white smoke broke out from the brig and a second or two later a ball dashed up the water fifty yards ahead of them the emotions with which patsey and leigh watched the brig differed much from those of the captain they would gladly have seen the lugger overhauled and captured but they soon saw that there was little chance of this the lugger was a fast boat the wind just suited her and the brig fell farther and farther astern until as the former entered the bay of quimper and laid her course north the brig hauled her wind and turned to rejoin the vessels off brest  keeping close to the land they passed lorient and quiberon and vannes without stopping and did not drop anchor again until they entered the bay on the eastern side of the island of noirmoutier the next day they passed out through the narrow channel of froment and had gone between the island and the mainland for a distance of two miles when they saw a large brig making in towards the shore  another of those cruisers the captain exclaimed this is more serious for there is no bay we can run into and the fellow is bringing the wind down with him our only chance is to anchor under the guns of saint jean des montes we shall be lucky if we get there in time  the brig came up fast and was within a mile when the lugger caught the wind then running along rapidly she held her own until off saint jean when she ran in as close as her draught would permit and anchored two french privateers were already lying in there one having dropped anchor only a few minutes before the trois freres arrived  i expect it was that fellow that the brig was in chase of and i am not by any means sure that we have done with her yet they are as likely as not to try to cut out one if not both of these privateers of course it would look like madness with the guns of that battery on the height protecting them but they have done such things so often that one can never say that one is altogether safe from them  the brig stood in until two or three guns in the battery opened fire when she turned and made out to sea again  that means nothing the captain said of course she would not attack in daylight i dare say she will sail pretty nearly out of sight so as to make the privateers believe that she had no intention of meddling with them if i was sure that was her game i would get up sail again as soon as it is dark and make for oleron but it is likely enough that she may think that that is just what the privateers will do and will sail in that direction herself so as to cut them off before they get there and force them to fight without the protection of a shore battery  there is the bell for breakfast leon would not be two minutes late if there was an action going on close to us  half an hour later they went on deck again  at any rate the sea has saved us the trouble of discussing the matter the captain said we are aground the tide turned just before we got here it is now half past twelve and we shall not be afloat again for nearly twelve hours  well there is one thing if they are thinking of trying to cut out the privateers they are not likely to do it before two or three oclock in the morning as soon as we float i shall haul out a cables length or two so as to ensure our being able to get off and if they do attack i shall get up my sails at once and run south they will be too much occupied to give us a thought whereas if i stay here and they capture the privateers they might take it into their heads to come on board and set fire to the lugger which as i am part owner would be a very serious matter to me  it was apparent that the privateers had no thought of the brig returning at any rate at present as boats went backwards and forwards between them and the shore  what do you think leigh his sister asked quietly as they were sitting alone together  i do not know in the least he said our best chance is that the two frenchmen seem to be so confident that they are safe under the guns of the fort that they will take no very great precautions one of them mounts eight guns the other ten and they ought to be a match for the brig even without the forts for we could see by her ports that she only carries sixteen guns however i think myself that she will very likely have a try at them it will be a very dark night for the sky is overcast and there is no moon  it was between ten and eleven when just as they were about to turn in the captain ran in  quick madame you must hurry on your clothes i heard a sound just now that could only be made by a boat as we are still aground i shall bring a boat alongside and land there is nothing like being on the safe side  the two privateers were lying a quarter of a mile farther out and there were still lights burning on board them  the fools the captain growled as leigh and his sister came on deck leigh carrying little louis who had been put to bed fully dressed indeed no time had been lost for his mother and leigh had agreed that it would be better to lie down in their clothes in case of an alarm being given  the fools the captain repeated if they had extinguished every light as they ought to have done the boats would have had difficulty in finding them now they could not miss them if they tried  now madame will you please take your place in the boat with me i am sure that there are boats coming along of course the oars are muffled and there is enough sea on to prevent us hearing the splash i think the noise i heard was caused by one of the stretchers giving way  reluctantly patsey and leigh took their places in the boat just as they reached the shore a shout was heard on board one of the privateers and a moment later came the sound of a british cheer it was followed by a hubbub of shouts then muskets flashed out from the decks and almost immediately came the sounds of conflict a blue light was struck on the deck of one of the privateers and by its light those on shore could obtain a view of the conflict the boats had boarded from the shore side two of them lay alongside each of the privateers and the crews could be seen climbing up by the chains and leaping down upon the decks  they deserve to be taken the captain said they have not even triced up their boarding nets  a confused medley of sounds came to the shore with the shouts of the french sailors were mingled the clash of cutlasses and the crack of pistols the british sailors fought for the most part silently on the heights above blue lights were burning in the battery and men could be seen standing on its crest watching the combat below but powerless to assist their friends  it was but five minutes after the outbreak of the combat when a loud british cheer followed by a dead silence showed that one at least of the privateers had been captured the fighting still continued on the deck of the other craft but from the vessel that had been captured a number of sailors leapt down into one of their boats and rowed to the assistance of their comrades the reinforcements apparently decided the issue of the fight for in a couple of minutes the british cheer was again heard and the blue light was promptly extinguished as were all the other lights on both vessels scarcely was this done when the guns from the battery boomed out  it is of no use their firing the captain said i dont think they can depress the guns enough to bear upon them  there they are making sail he went on as the creaking of blocks was heard of course they have cut the cables they would not waste time in getting up anchors with the forts playing upon them however it is mere waste of powder and shot on such a night as this i dont suppose the gunners can make them out now for a certainty they wont be able to do so as soon as they have moved off another quarter of a mile of course a stray shot may hit them but practically it is all over  i think that we can go on board again i did not think of it before but they would hardly set fire to us for the light would enable the gunners to see them till they were a long way out  there is no doubt those englishmen can fight our men are all right when they are under sail and it is a question of exchanging broadsides but the success of so many of their cutting out expeditions shows that somehow or other we lose heart when we are boarded we must have had nearly twice as many men as there were in those four boats and yet it seemed to be a certainty as soon as the english got among them  our craft had much better have sailed out together when the brig came in this morning and fought her fairly they ought to have been more than a match for her no doubt they would have done so if they had thought that they would be attacked tonight but they relied upon the battery and allowed themselves to be taken completely by surprise  i could see even from this distance that most of them were fighting in their shirts and i expect that they were sound asleep when the attack began and men roused in that sudden way can never be relied upon to do their duty as they would do if prepared to meet it  the party were soon on board the lugger again just as daylight was breaking there was a trampling of feet on the deck and leigh going up found that sail was being hoisted keeping close to the shore they ran down without putting in anywhere to la rochelle here they waited for a day and then keeping inside the isle of oleron entered the gironde and the next day anchored in the garonne off the quays of bordeaux  after thanking the captain very heartily for his kindness during the passage they landed showed their papers to an official on the quay and then being unhampered by luggage walked quietly away as there was nothing particularly noticeable in their appearance they attracted no attention whatever it was five oclock when they landed and already becoming dusk they waited until it was quite dark and then having inquired for the house of monsieur flambard the merchant to whom jean had assigned the henriette they knocked at his door  it was a handsome house not far from the quays the lower portion was evidently occupied by the offices as a servant opened the door leigh seeing that his sister hesitated to speak inquired if monsieur flambard was at home  he is the man said shortly but he does not see people on business after the office is closed  leigh saw that his dress as a sailor did not impress the man  i think he will see us he said if you take the name up to him will you tell him that citoyenne martin wishes to speak to him  a minute later the merchant himself a handsome man of about the same age as jean martin came down  ah madame i am glad indeed to see you he said for he had more than once been up to nantes during the time she was living there and had been frequently at the house i have been in great anxiety about you  has jean been here she asked in a tone of intense anxiety  no madame i have heard nothing of him for many months not indeed since his lugger first came down here with his letter and the deed of her sale to myself did you expect to find him here  i hoped so although there was no arrangement between us to meet here still i thought that he would have made his way down here if possible as he would then be able to escape in the lugger  he may have found it more difficult than he thought monsieur flambard said soothingly but do not let us be standing here pray come up my wife will be glad to welcome you for she has often heard me speak of martins english wife  leigh had been standing behind patsey while they spoke but as the merchant closed the door his eye fell upon him  ah monsieur now i recognize you you are monsieur leigh stansfield the brother of madame i welcome you also cordially  so saying he led the way upstairs    chapter 17 a grave risk   nothing could be kinder than the reception of the fugitives by madame flambard she had heard so much of patsey she said from her husband to whom she had been married six months before that she had quite shared his anxiety about the fate of jean martin who had more than once been mentioned as being one of the leaders of the vendeans she soon went off with patsey to put the child to bed and while they were away monsieur flambard took leigh into his smoking room  before he said i ask you anything about your adventures i must explain to you the state of things here until november last bordeaux and indeed the whole of the gironde was moderate all our deputieswho have now as perhaps you know either fallen on the scaffold or been hunted down like wild beastsbelonged to that party they were earnest reformers and were prominent among the leaders of the revolution they went with the stream up to a certain point they voted for most of the sanguinary decrees although in time they strove to mitigate the horrors inflicted by the extreme party but after a long conflict the latter supported by the mob of paris obtained the ascendency and the girondists underwent the same fate that had befallen so many others for myself i cannot pity them they were all men of standing and of intelligence but without perceiving the terrible results that must follow they unchained the mob and became its victims  up to that time there had been but few executions here and the power remained in the hands of the moderate party two months since however there was a local insurrection the party of the terror suddenly rose seized the members of the council and threw them into prison other prominent citizens were seized and the guillotine began its bloody work in earnest since that time every citizen of position or standing lives in momentary danger of arrest not a day passes but a dozen or so are seized and dragged off i grant that at present there is nothing like the wholesale butchery that goes on at nantes under that fiend carrier it is only those who have wealth and property that are seized not only in this town but in the whole department the agents of those who assumed power are busy it is the gironde and therefore hateful to the party of robespierre and the proprietors of the land who have hitherto been left unmolested are being brought in daily  the trial is of course a mere farce the prisoners are murdered not because they are moderates but because they are rich and their wealth is divided among the members of the council and the mob who support them so far i have been unmolested i have never taken any part in politics business being sufficient to occupy all my time another thing is that i employ a considerable number of men in addition to the crews of some ten vessels which belong to me i believe that i am popular generally on the wharves and it is the knowledge that my arrest might promote a tumult and might reverse the present order of things that has led to my being left alone so far  fortunately my servant who let you in has been in the family for the past fiveandthirty years and is devoted to me had it been otherwise the position would have been a dangerous one a report to the council that a young man in the attire of a sailor accompanied by a lady and child had arrived and been at once received would suffice to set them in motion i should be accused of having a suspect probably one of the emigres hidden here and it would be difficult for me to explain your reception you must in the first place attire yourself in clothes such as are worn by the mate of a privateer i suppose you have papers or you would not have been permitted to land  leigh took out the passes and handed them to him monsieur flambard glanced through them  you must have managed well to have got hold of these passes and they certainly put the matter on safer ground however i should find some difficulty in explaining how i came to show hospitality to two persons who by a strangely roundabout course had made their way from arthenay it is a little unfortunate that your sister kept her own name had it been otherwise i might have said that her husband was captain of one of my ships but he is unfortunately not unknown here after martins flight from nantes a claim was made by the committee of public safety at nantes for the henriette fortunately your brotherinlaw had dated his bill of sale to me a fortnight before he left the trial took place here and as in those days law and justice still prevailed in the civic courts the decision was given in my favour  it was urged on the other side that the transaction was invalid as martin must have parted with his vessel knowing well that he was a traitor to the republic and that his property would be confiscated however we got the best of them there was no proof whatever that martin was conscious that he was suspected of being disaffected and we claimed that he had only sold it as having married he had decided to give up the sea and to settle upon his estates in la vendee of course at that time la vendee had not risen and it was not a crime worthy of death to own an estate there still the case attracted attention and the fact that my guest was a madame martin might recall the circumstances and at once awake a suspicion that she was the wife of one of those who had led the insurgents of la vendee in which case her life and yours would be certainly forfeited and my receiving you would be regarded as amply sufficient evidence of my connection with the insurgents  now for our sakes as well as yours i think that it would be strongly advisable that you should take up your abode elsewhere believe me that it is no want of hospitality but a measure of precaution both for your sake and ours tomorrow morning i should have to send in a statement that two guests have arrived here and it is therefore most desirable that you should move without delay fortunately the wives of two or three of my captains live here one of these especially an excellent woman has a house much larger than she needs and takes in lodgers generally captains whose families do not reside here when their ships are in port therefore the fact that a sailor with a sister and her child have taken rooms there will excite no suspicion whatever she will as a matter of course send in your name to the police of the town together with your passes they will be marked and returned without probably being glanced at  i think that that will be an excellent arrangement sir leigh said and i quite see that our stay here might be awkward for you as well as us  i will at once go with you that is as soon as you have told your sister the reason why it will be better for you to establish yourselves elsewhere than here i may tell you that i myself have been quietly making preparations for flight but it is not all my captains whom i can trust the henriette which i expect here shortly has been delayed but on her arrival i propose that we shall all cross the channel together i hear the ladies voices in the next room it were best that we got this painful business over at once  madame flambard was greatly distressed when leigh gave his sister an account of the conversation they had had and the resolution at which they had arrived but patsey at once saw that it was most desirable that the change should be made and assured her hostess that she fully recognized that their safety would be imperilled by staying at their house  it would be a cruel kindness on your part to insist upon our stopping here madame flambard we know that it is from no lack of hospitality that we are leaving but that you are making a real sacrifice in order to procure our safety  shall i put on my things at once monsieur  by no means i will go with your brother first to see if madame chopin has other lodgers if so i will go to the wife of one of my clerks who also lets a portion of a house or if you would not mind poor accommodation to another of the captains wives as in your brothers character of a sailor it would be more natural for you to go to such a lodging which may very well have been recommended to you by the skipper of the lugger in which you came here when we have arranged things we will return it is but a quarter of an hours walk for the house stands near the river above the bridge  he at once set out with leigh on arriving at the house they found that there were at present no lodgers there  this young sailor has brought a letter of recommendation to me madame chopin he has a married sister and her child with him and i am sure that you will make them very comfortable and can supply them with what they may require they have just arrived by sea from havre the length of their stay is uncertain this young man is looking for a berth as mate and shall have the first vacancy on one of my vessels his sister may stop with you for some time as she is hoping that her husband will return here though he is so long overdue that i fear his ship has been either lost or captured by the english  i will do my best to make them both comfortable monsieur flambard and thank you for recommending them to me  leigh saw the rooms which consisted of two bedrooms and a third room which was similarly furnished but madame chopin said that she would take down the bed and put some other furniture into it so that they could use it as a sitting room  we should prefer that madame for my sister at times is greatly depressed and we should prefer being alone  i can quite understand that the woman said well you will not be troubled with society here as i have only these three rooms to let so that unless my husband comes home before you go we shall be quite alone  i shall return with my sister in an hours time leigh said that will not be too late for you  no monsieur it is little past eight oclock yet and it will take me fully two hours to get everything straight and tidy  very well then we will say ten oclock monsieur flambard said i will keep monsieur porson as he has news to give me concerning the friend who recommended him to me  on their return to the merchants they sat chatting for an hour over the adventures through which leigh and his sister had passed and the manner in which they were separated from jean martin  i think you have every reason to hope madame monsieur flambard said cheerfully jean is not the sort of fellow to let himself be caught in a hole and i expect that when he found that he could not rejoin you he at once struck north either for dunkirk or calais and has probably managed to be taken over in a fishing boat or a smuggler and if he failed in doing so he would probably make off in a boat single handed i think that you have every reason to hope that you will find him at poole when you arrive there but even should he not be there there will be no reason for despair he may have had difficulty in getting away he may have been impressed for the naval service at any rate i have great faith that he will turn up sooner or later certainly when he has once managed to get a seafaring outfit he will be safe from any fear of detection as one of the terrible vendean insurgents  at a quarter to ten little louis was taken out of bed wrapped up in a cloak and carried by leigh monsieur flambard insisted on again accompanying them the streets were now almost deserted and they soon arrived at madame chopins  i quite forgot to ask if you would want anything before going to bed but i can make you a cup of good coffee if you would like it  thank you but we have eaten but an hour ago  saying goodnight to monsieur flambard they went up to their rooms their hostess leading with a candle she had made the most of her time since leigh left the house white curtains had been put up at the windows and everything looked beautifully clean and patsey uttered an exclamation of pleasure when she entered the room  this does indeed look fresh and homelike she said thank you for taking so much trouble madame  the next morning leigh procured a jacket and waistcoat with brass buttons and a cap with a gold band he then sauntered along the wharves and went aboard the trois freres and told the skipper that no news had been received of his sisters husband it had been agreed that it was best that they should not go to monsieur flambards house but that the merchant should call at the lodging after dark when leigh returned to the midday meal he found that the papers had come back from the mairie duly stamped and countersigned and that as no one had been to the house to make inquiries it was evident that no suspicion had been excited  during the next four or five days leigh went but little into the town contenting himself with keeping near the wharves watching the vessels loading or discharging cargo and spending much of his time on board the trois freres on the afternoon of the fifth day he saw a lugger approaching and as it came near he made out to his great delight that it was the henriette as soon as she dropped anchor in the stream her boat rowed to the wharves lefaux was sitting in the stern and as soon as he landed went off in the direction of monsieur flambards office  leigh did not go near him he thought that it would be better that the honest sailor should learn that he and his sister were there from the merchant before he spoke to him as any imprudent remark on the sailors part might be caught up by one of the spies of the committee and lead to trouble as he expected monsieur flambard came round with lefaux that evening  i am heartily glad to see you again madame he said as patsey shook him by the hand and you too monsieur stansfield i began to think that i never should do so and i only wish that monsieur jean was here too still i feel confident that he has got safely away trust a sailor for getting out of a scrape you must have gone through a lot madame but you dont look any the worse for it  except anxiety for my husband i have gone through nothing to speak of i had a horse to ride and generally a shelter to sleep under and for myself i had little to complain of but it was terrible to see the sufferings of the peasant women and children and of the many men broken down by sickness and there was too the anxiety as to the safety of my husband and brother in each battle that took place but of hardship to myself there was very little  well madame i hope that i shall soon have the pleasure of sailing into poole again with you and monsieur leigh on board and also with my good master monsieur flambard and his wife  when will you be off again patsey asked eagerly  that is what i have come to talk with you about madame martin monsieur flambard said i have pretty good information as to what passes at the meetings of the wretches who call themselves the committee of public safety and i hear that there will very shortly be a seizure of a number of prominent citizens and my name has been mentioned they are only hanging back until they can decide upon what shall be the pretext since none of those named have taken any part in politics here all those who have done so have been already seized however the blow may come at any moment  the henriette has already begun to discharge her cargo fortunately there is not much of it the moment that she has finished she will drop down below the rest of the shipping and be ready to start at any moment if we find that the matter is not absolutely pressing we will go quietly on board as soon as she is ready and sail at once as there will then be no fear of her being stopped  if however i find that the order for our arrest is on the point of being issued i will send her down and let her lie beyond fort medoc and blaye if it were discovered that i was missing a few hours after she had started it would be suspected at once that i had gone in the henriette mounted messengers would carry the news down to both forts and the boat would be forced to heave to as she passed between them  therefore i shall have a light carriage with two fast horses kept in readiness a quarter of a mile outside the town and a relay of horses fifteen miles on which is about halfway and join the ship below the forts if as may possibly happen i am suddenly arrested in the streets i shall have my servant near me he will have his orders which will be to hurry back home to tell his mistress to put on the disguise of a peasant woman that has already been prepared for her and to go with her at once to the carriage and another man whom i can also thoroughly trust is to come here and say to you it is a bad day  then you and your sister and the child will at once start to join my wife she has most reluctantly consented to carry out this plan for as i tell her it will add to my sufferings a hundredfold were she also to be arrested  by dint of great exertions the henriette was unloaded by the following evening and half an hour after her last bale was ashore she dropped down the river with the tide she was to anchor off a small village two miles beyond fort medoc and if inquiry was made as to why she stopped there lefaux was to say that he was to take in some wine that monsieur flambard had bought from a large grower in that district and that the lugger was then going to charente to fill up with brandy for havre  leigh had the day before gone with the merchant into the extensive cellars which adjoined the house  there is not a man here monsieur flambard said who would not do all in his power for me some of them have been with the firm nearly all their lives i treat them well and i am happy to say that not one of them has taken any part in our last troubles indeed i am told that is one of the matters that if i am arrested will be brought against me it will be said that it was a proof of my enmity to the convention that none of my people took the side of the patriots  however it tells both ways i have over forty men here they have of course friends among the porters and others working on the wharves and a disturbance might take place were i arrested however the scoundrels have now got such absolute power that no doubt they feel that they could disregard any local rising and indeed with the plunder of my store before them they could reckon on the devotion of the greater part of the mob of the town  on the morning after the henriette had sailed the merchant took leigh down to a little wayside inn half a mile below the town where he had placed his carriage and horses and gave instructions to his coachman that he was to place himself under leighs orders  at whatever hour of the day or night he comes you will start at once with him and the lady and child who accompany him you will know in that case that i am not coming but have been arrested  but master  it must be as i say pierre once i am arrestedand it is almost certain my wife would be arrested with menothing can be done to help and it would be a great satisfaction to me to know that my friends have escaped there will be in that case no need of extreme haste for no one knows that they are in any way connected with me and there will be no inquiries for them  leigh told patsey that afternoon that in the event of the flambards being arrested he might possibly instead of coming himself send a messenger to her and that she must then start at once and await his coming in front of the church at the end of the street in which the merchants house stood  you had better have a letter written to our landlady inclosing the sum due to her and a weeks rent in advance and say that we are hastily called away to blaye but may return in a few days and begging her to keep the rooms vacant for a week for which you leave the money you had better write the letter at once so that if you get my message you can leave instantly there is nothing like being prepared for everything of course the arrest of the flambards would not really affect us in any way or add to our danger but if the coachman were to hear of it before we got there he might disregard his masters orders and return at once with the carriage  leigh had in his mind the very short notice that desailles had had of his danger and how narrowly he escaped being arrested although he had a friend who kept him acquainted with what was going on he thought that it was still more likely that the arrest of the flambards would take place suddenly it would probably be decided upon by two or three of the men who were the leaders of the party of terror and no word would get about as to their intentions until the arrest had been absolutely made in which case the captives would be lodged in prison before the matter would be known and all fear of an emeute be thereby prevented he had therefore decided upon what was the best course to pursue and posted himself in the street where he could observe anyone who entered or left flambards house  it was already getting dusk when he saw two commissaries of the committee with six armed men stop before the door and knock it was opened two of the men remained outside and the rest entered he ran to the stores the head cellarman had gone round the place with him and his master and leigh at once went to him  lefranc he said your master and mistress have just been arrested two commissaries and six armed men have gone into the house there is time to save them yet they have a carriage in waiting a short distance away and if we can overpower these men and tie them up so that they cannot give the alarm until morning monsieur flambard and his wife will get safely away they have a vessel waiting for them in readiness down the river  i am your man sir and every one here  half a dozen will be enough pick out that number of strong fellows whom you can rely upon let them all take off their aprons and tear up this black silk handkerchief and as we leave the cellar let each man put a piece over his face to act as a mask there is a private door leading to the house is there not  yes monsieur  well draw the men off quietly so that the others shall not notice them and tell them to go to that door and to put on their masks there let each man take some weapon but not a mallet or anything used in the trade let them bring some stout rope with them  the man nodded and hurried away and leigh went to the end of the stores abutting on the house and stopped at the door he found there in a minute the men began to arrive they had as he directed thrown aside their leather aprons and put on blouses so that they differed in no way in appearance from ordinary working men one or two were armed with hammers others with long knives each carried a piece of black handkerchief in his hand long enough to go from the forehead down to the mouth leigh tied these on with strings cutting holes with his knife through which they could see  when the six men and the foreman had assembled they entered the house the old servant was standing in the hall wringing his hands in distress  where are they leigh asked  in the masters study sir they are searching the drawers  come on quietly leigh said to the men we must take them by surprise  the door of the study was standing open and lights burned within leigh had already instructed his followers to go at once for the armed men and to knock them down before they had time to use their muskets going noiselessly up they entered the door with a sudden rush  the two commissaries were engaged in emptying the contents of the table drawers into a basket the armed ruffians had leant their muskets against the wall and had seated themselves in comfortable chairs flambard stood with his arm round his wife looking disdainfully at the proceedings of the commissaries  in a moment the scene changed before the men could even rise from their seats they were knocked down bits of sacking thrust into their mouths and their arms tied leigh had levelled one of the commissaries by a blow in the face and the foreman had struck down the other with a hammer these were also securely tied  the flambards stood a picture of astonishment the whole thing had passed so instantaneously that they could scarcely realize what had happened when they did so madame flambard who had hitherto preserved her calmness burst into tears while her husband embraced leigh with passionate gratitude  now monsieur the latter said you had better collect at once any money and jewels you wish to take with you while we are making sure of these ruffians  now my men he went on take these fellows into different rooms but first let me see that the ropes are securely tied although as sailors you are not likely to make any mistake that way still it is as well to be on the safe side  he himself then examined the fastenings and added a few more cords  now when you have got them into separate rooms tie their feet to a heavy piece of furniture make a slipknot at the end of another rope put the noose round the neck and fasten the other end to another piece of furniture that there may be no chance of their getting loose till their friends come to their assistance  he saw all this securely done then he said  there is one more thing to see to in time those fellows at the door will be getting impatient and will begin to suspect that all is not right we must get them inside and then tie them up with the others stand back behind the door as they enter and as i close it throw yourselves upon them one of you grip each of them by the throat and another seize his musket and wrench it from him the rest will be easy  the men placed themselves as directed and leigh then opened the door and said  you are to come in they will take some little time over the papers and there is plenty of good wine for you to amuse yourselves with  with an exclamation of satisfaction the two men entered  it is very dark in here one said as leigh closed the door why didnt you get a light  the words were scarcely spoken when there was a rush a sudden exclamation the sound of a short struggle and then silence  keep hold of them tightly while i fetch a candle leigh said and running upstairs soon came down with the light  the two guards were standing helpless in the hands of their captors and gripped so tightly that they were unable to utter the least sound  now put the gags into their mouths and truss them up as you did the others  leaving the men to carry out his orders he ran upstairs again  everything is arranged now he said the whole of the fellows are bound and the road is free for you i should go out by the back way for there is sure to be a little crowd in front of the house attracted by the sight of the guard standing outside i do not think that there is any extraordinary hurry but in an hour or so if either of the men who have ordered your arrest is waiting at the prison he may get impatient and send down to see what detains the party here  i am going in the first place to have the servants bound so that they may not be suspected of having aided in this business as soon as that is done i shall hasten to my lodging and bring my sister and the child to the inn where you have your carriage of course you will have the horses put in as soon as you get there i shall not be very long behind you as i shall take the first fiacre and drive down to that end of the town and then discharge him as i am not in any way associated with you even if inquiries are made our movements will throw no light upon yours  the conversation took place in the bedroom where madame flambard was with her husband packing up a few necessaries  as we go downstairs he went on i shall make some remark about our going straight on board that will put them on the wrong scent and they will waste a lot of time searching all the craft in the river i do it principally because i want them to believe that you have been rescued by a party of sailors you heard me say that as sailors they would be accustomed to tie the knots tightly and of course my uniform will help to lead them astray the men with me were really some of your cellarmen under lefranc  we shall be ready in three minutes fortunately we have not much beyond my wifes jewels that we want to save like your wifes brother i have already made provision in england for this  i will be off as soon as i see the servants tied up  he ran downstairs again the two men and the maids willingly suffered themselves to be tied up when leigh explained to them the reasons for which it was done  mind he said if questioned you say you believe that the men who rushed in and fastened you up were sailors  before the work was done monsieur flambard came down and standing at the door which communicated with the cellars shook hands with his rescuers as they went out and thanked them most heartily in the name of himself as well as his wife for the service that they had rendered the men before they passed through the door took off their masks it had already been arranged that they should at once scatter and return quietly to the places where they had been at work and in so large a place it was not likely that their absence had been noticed as it would be supposed that they had gone to another part of the cellar and it was not above twenty minutes since they had left it  as soon as they had gone out the door was locked on the inside leigh and the flambards went out at the back entrance into another street and there separated leigh hurrying back to his lodgings madame chopin opened the door  madame he said i have good news for my sister i hope that we shall be able to obtain news of her husband at blaye for he may if my information is correct have sailed up the dordogne and we may catch him as he comes down again if my information is not correct we shall return here i will therefore if you will allow me pay you our reckoning at once and also the rent of the rooms for another week so that if we return we may find them unoccupied  but you are not going to start this evening surely monsieur  yes i have arranged for a passage on a boat that is on the point of starting and have not a moment to lose  he ran upstairs to patsey  they have gone on to the carriage he said put on louiss things and your own i will tell you all about it as we go  he then went down again and settled up with his landlady who was profuse in her exclamations of regret at their departure in a couple of minutes patsey came down she had the letter that she had written in her hand leigh took it from her  i have already settled up with our kind hostess he said say goodbye dear at once or the boat may be starting without us  a minute later they were out of the house leigh carried louis and led the way to a spot near where two or three fiacres were always standing he took the first and told the driver to put them down in a street at the lower end of the town the name of which he had noticed when he went with monsieur flambard to the inn where the carriage was standing  when he got to the end of the street he told the driver to stop saying that he was not sure of the number paying the man his fare they walked slowly down the street until the fiacre had driven off and then returning took the road leading into the country  ten minutes walking brought them close to the little inn they met the carriage coming along slowly three hundred yards before they arrived there it stopped at once  you are here sooner than i expected madame monsieur flambard said as he alighted and helped patsey  as she took her place by the side of madame flambard the latter threw her arms round her neck  thank god this awful time is over she said it is to your brother we owe it that we are not both now in that terrible prison  leigh is good at breaking prison patsey said he rescued me from the gaol at nantes  by this time her husband and leigh had taken their places louis still soundly asleep was transferred to his mothers lap and the carriage turning went back at the full speed of the horses    chapter 18 home   why did you come down the road leigh asked monsieur flambard as the carriage flew past the little inn we had not arranged for that and in the dark we might have passed it without knowing that it was yours  we were on the lookout for you and had no fear of missing you i decided to drive back to the town as we went out i believe the innkeeper to be an honest fellow and he has been one of our customers for a number of years but i thought it just as well to throw dust in his eyes therefore as i got into the carriage i said in his hearing  dont go through the main streets of the town but drive round and strike the road beyond it keep on to langon we shall stop there tonight  we drove off fast and only broke into a walk just before you met us the innkeeper would have gone into the house again before we met and as i noticed that the shutters were up he certainly would not have supposed that the vehicle which passed was our carriage coming back again  well thank god we are all safe and together in three hours we shall be at the village lefaux was to keep a boat ashore and to be himself at the inn there is only one in the village  the road was a good one and the horses fast and in less than an hour and a half they reached the spot where the relay of horses had been stationed five minutes sufficed to make the change and in a little under three hours after starting they arrived at the village two miles below fort medoc they stopped at the first house  now gregoire monsieur flambard said as they alighted here are five louis for yourself you had better drive back to the place where we changed horses and put up there for the night tomorrow you can go quietly back to bordeaux dont get there until late in the afternoon return the carriage and the other two horses to the stables where you hired them and take my two horses back to our stables  you are sure to be questioned and can tell them the truth say that you acted by my orders and had no idea of the reason for which i had hired the carriage and the extra horses that you knew that i often made flying visits to the vineyards and you thought i wanted to see some proprietor of medoc on business and to return as quickly as possible and were much surprised when you saw that madame went with me do not say anything about our picking up my friends on the road  i understand monsieur and i will stick to that story god bless you sir and you madame and i trust that before long you will be back again with us  i hope so gregoire but i fear it will not be for some time to come  they now walked forward leigh hurrying on in front until he came to the little village inn it was already closed but on his knocking violently at the door a window above was opened  what are you making such a noise for at this time of night  i have come to call captain lefaux he said a messenger has just brought an order from bordeaux that he is to get up anchor at daylight  i will call him the landlord said and in three minutes lefaux came out  we are all here lefaux leigh said and we want to go on board and get up anchor at once and to be as far down the river as we can before daylight  the saints be praised that you have all escaped monsieur stansfield we will lose no time i have two men sleeping in a cottage close to where the boat is made fast they sleep on the ground floor and i can tap at the window and get them out i told them to turn in as they stood as they might be wanted at any moment  the others had now come up and together they went down to the boat the tide had turned about an hour before and the boat was afloat  now i will fetch the men out the skipper said and in five minutes he came down with them  they untied the head rope of the boat from the stump to which it was fastened and hauled it in  that is the lugger i suppose leigh said pointing to a dark object a hundred yards from the shore  that is her sir and it wont take us long to get under weigh everything is ready for hoisting sail  they rowed off to the henriette and leigh could hardly restrain a shout of joy at finding himself once again on board her the crew had been unchanged since they left nantes and tumbling up on deck as they heard the boat coming off greeted leigh most heartily and respectfully saluted patsey and their owner they would have broken into cheers had not their skipper sharply silenced them  it will be time enough to cheer when we reach the open sea lads he said and we will do so more heartily still when we land madame martin monsieur leigh and the owner and his wife either on english ground or the deck of an english ship  you mistake captain monsieur flambard said as you know the lugger was only passed over to me by monsieur martin to escape confiscation there is no longer any need that i should appear as owner and in fact madame martin as representative of her husband is the owner of the henriette and i and my wife are passengers on board her  i hope that you will find it all right below madame captain lefaux said captain martins cabinwe have always called it sois ready for you and madame flambard monsieur will take the spare cabin and monsieur leigh mine  i will sleep on one of the sofas in the saloon captain i should not feel comfortable if i turned you out and besides i like being able to pop quietly on deck whenever i feel inclined so that is settled  now we will have a tumbler of hot brandy and water the captain said you have had a cold drive  what will you take ladies  both declared that they wanted nothing but to get to bed and they at once retired to the after cabin with little louis who had slept without waking ever since he had been lifted from his bed at bordeaux the captain had given orders as soon as he came on board to have the sails hoisted and as monsieur flambard and leigh sipped their grog they had the satisfaction of hearing the water rippling past and of feeling by the heel of the boat that there was sufficient wind to send them along at a good rate  what is she making captain leigh asked as he went up to take a last look round  about five knots but the wind is getting up there was scarcely a breath when i turned in at ten oclock  how far do you call it to the mouth of the river  it is about forty miles to the tower of cordouan once past that we reckon we are at sea  eight hours going at five knots it is nearly twelve now it will be daylight when we get there  i hope that we shall be there before that sir you have not allowed for the tide nor for the wind increasing i reckon we shall be there by six and day does not begin to break till an hour later  i want to get past without being seen there are always a couple of gunboats lying there i fancy that they know us pretty well by this time but sometimes as we go out they make us lie to and come on board to see that we are not taking off suspected persons and that any passengers we have tally with those on the manifest if they should take it into their heads to do that in the morning it would be awkward and i am anxious to get past without being seen once out of gunshot i do not mind i fancy that we can show our heels to either of the gunboats  leigh and monsieur flambard turned in the latter slept soundly but leigh went frequently on deck  she is doing well the captain said gleefully she is going fully seven knots an hour you see master leigh i still keep to captain martins terms and count by knots instead of by leagues the tide is giving us another two knots i reckon that at the rate we are going we shall keep it pretty nearly down to the mouth of the river seven and two are nine and as i have just been looking up the chart and as i find that it is but thirtyseven from the village where we started we shall do it in five hours at the outside  the river is wide at the mouth and by heading south directly we get there and running so for a couple of miles before we put straight out to sea there will be no chance whatever of our being seen once away we shall of course lay a course inside the islands till we are off finisterre then we can either strike out into the channel or coast along as far as cape la hague and thence sail straight for poole but there is no occasion to discuss that at present  satisfied with the assurance of the captain leigh turned in again at two oclock and this time slept soundly when he awoke the motion of the vessel told him he was at sea and he saw that it was broad daylight leaping off the sofa he saw by his watch that it was eight oclock and he was speedily on deck the mate was in charge  the captain turned in half an hour ago sir do you wish him to be called  certainly not where are we now  we are just passing between the island of oleron and the mainland  oh yes i see when i came down of course we saw it from the other way and i did not recognize it at first so we managed to get past cordouan without being seen  yes we rounded the south point of the river before six oclock laid her head southwest for an hour and just as it became light changed our course north and passed three miles to seaward of the tower they doubtless supposed that we were coming up from bayonne at any rate they paid no attention to us  the wind is blowing pretty strongly  yes sir we should have had a rough tumble of sea if it had been from the west and should have had to lie up under shelter of the island but as it is blowing right off shore it is just about the right strength for us and we shall make a quick run of it if it holds  i hear there is no news of captain martin monsieur  no i am sorry to say there is not but i have every hope that we shall find he has got to poole before us  we are all hoping that nothing has happened to him of course we heard that he was fighting in la vendee and as every one of us comes from one port or another there we only wished that we had been with him  you were well out of it edouard it was a terrible business no one could have fought better than your people did but they had all france against them and few indeed of those who were engaged from the first can ever have returned to their homes and even when they get there there can be no safety for them for carrier and his commissioners seem to be determined to annihilate the vendeans altogether  the mate indulged in many strong expressions as to the future fate of carrier and his underlings  we heard of that attack on the jail master leigh i guessed that you were in that for among the prisoners who were delivered the names of monsieur martin and madame jean martin were mentioned  yes captain martin and i were in the thick of it there was very little fighting to do for we chose a time when the troops were all busy with cathelineaus and stofflets attack and we had really only to open the door of the prison to get them out  the captain has been telling us that monsieur flambard was also in danger of arrest it is atrocious everyone knows that he is a good master and i never heard a word said against him  that has very little to do with it leigh said his crime was that he was rich and the scoundrels wanted his money they did arrest him but he was rescued before they got him out of his house and fortunately everything had been prepared for his flight at the present moment they are searching high and low for him and i expect that no craft there will be permitted to leave till she has been thoroughly ransacked to make sure that he and madame are not hiding there  ah they are bad times monsieur it may be that things were not quite as they might have been though for my part i never saw anything to grumble at nor did any other vendean as far as i ever heard but if things had been ten times as bad as they were they would have been better than what is going on now  why monsieur all europe must think that we frenchmen are devils they say that more than a hundred thousand people have been put to death not counting the loss in la vendee  which must be quite as much more edouard and it is no consolation to know that the loss of the blues must have been fully equal to ours  how is it to end monsieur  i think that the first part will end soon as far as i could find out as we travelled through the country and in paris even the mob are getting sick of this terrible bloodshed that feeling will get stronger until finally i believe that robespierre and his gang will be overturned what will come after that i dont know one may hope that some strong man will rise drive out the convention and establish a fixed government after that i should say that no one can guess what will follow  there is one consolation monsieur no change can be for the worse  that is absolutely certain  he went to the galley  well cook when are you going to let us have some breakfast i am famishing for i have eaten nothing since twelve oclock yesterday  it will be ready in twenty minutes monsieur i was just going to ask you if you would call the ladies or whether you will take the cafe au lait and eggs to their door  i will go and ask them  he went and knocked at the cabin door  patsey cafe au lait will be ready in twenty minutes will you and madame flambard take it in your cabin or come into the saloon  i am just dressed and shall be up on deck with louis in two or three minutes madame flambard will not get up it is her first voyage and she will not take anything to eat  he was just going to knock at the merchants door when there was a shout from within  i have heard what you are saying and shall be dressed in ten minutes  patsey was soon on deck  this is splendid leigh and now that we have got away so wonderfully i feel more hopeful than i have done before that jean also will have made his escape  well louis what do you think of this you had better keep hold of your uncles hand as well as mine or you may get a nasty tumble  nasty bad ship mama  it is because the wind is blowing hard and the sea is rough we had smooth water on our last voyage you know  louis not like him he said positively very bad ship  you will be all right if you keep hold of your uncles hand he will walk up and down with you  this is good indeed monsieur flambard said if we go on as well as we have begun we shall have nothing to grumble at  the voyage to ushant was accomplished without any adventure the lugger was so evidently french that two or three privateers who passed close by paid no attention to them and although they saw the sails of more than one british cruiser they either escaped observation or were considered too insignificant to be chased  on the voyage they had agreed that when they came to ushant they would be guided by the wind if it continued to blow as it had done from the east it would be a great loss of time to beat in to saint malo and they would be within sight of england long before they could make in there  as the wind was unchanged they therefore laid their course from ushant for the isle of wight before they had been many hours out they saw an english brig of war making toward them they did not attempt to escape but slightly changed their course so as to head for her  as the brig approached they lowered their mainsail the brig was thrown up into the wind a couple of lengths away  send your boat on board the captain of the brig shouted  they had indeed already got the boat over the side  you may as well come with me leigh said as he stepped into her monsieur flambard will take care of louis while you are away  seeing that there was a woman in the boat the brig lowered its accommodation ladder and the captain was standing at the gangway  we are english sir leigh said the lugger is owned by my sisters husband if he is alive if not i suppose it belongs to her we are escaping from france with two french friends my brotherinlaw was a vendean and has fought through the war we were with him until at the attack on le mans we were separated we hope to meet him at poole the vessel traded between that port and nantes until the war broke out some members of the family are already established there and our father is a magistrate living within a couple of miles of the town  i am sorry madam that i cannot offer you a passage but i must not leave my cruising ground  thank you sir we are doing very well in the lugger we intend to register her as a british vessel and the crew who are all vendeans will probably remain in our service until things settle down in france  and were you through the war too madam the captain asked patsey  not through the whole of it she replied our chateau was burned down by the republicans and i was carried to the prison at nantes and should have been guillotined had not my husband and brother rescued me when the vendeans were attacking the town i remained at the farmhouse until the vendeans could no longer maintain themselves in la vendee and crossed the loire then i accompanied my husband  well madam i congratulate you heartily on your escape we heard terrible tales in england of what is going on in france  however terrible they are they can hardly give you an idea of the truth at nantes for instance the guillotine is too slow and hundreds of men women and children are put into boats which are sunk in the middle of the river it is too horrible to think of  is there anything that i can do for you madam anything in the way of provisions with which we can supply you  no thank you we have everything that we can want  then i will detain you no further he said and can only wish you a pleasant voyage i see by the course you are steering that you are making for the isle of wight you ought to be there tomorrow afternoon  the boat returned to the lugger the sails were filled again and at four next afternoon the henriette passed handfast point and headed for the entrance to poole harbour as the distance from home lessened patseys excitement increased hourly she could not sit down for a minute quietly but walked restlessly up and down the deck she had scarcely spoken when leigh said after a long look through the telescope  i can make out the house on the hill quite plainly patsey  at any other time patsey who dearly loved their old home would have shown the liveliest interest but just then her thoughts were all of jean and she could spare none for anything else  they must have made us out by this time she said as they passed durleston  i should think so but i dont suppose they watch as we used to do in the old days the revenue men up there and he nodded up the cliff must of course see that we are french and if there are any of them who were here three or four years ago no doubt they know us again and must be wondering what brings us here  they had scarcely passed durleston when patsey sprang on to the rail holding fast by the shrouds and gazed intently at the narrow entrance of the channel between the island and the mainland  there is a boat coming out she exclaimed  the coast guard are sure to have launched their boat as soon as they made us out they would naturally come out to inquire what a french lugger is doing here  he went forward with his telescope and took a long look at the boat  yes it is the coast guard rowing six oars  in a minute or two he went back to his sister  do get down patsey he urged of course they may have news of jean but you must not be disappointed too much if they have not you know that we have agreed all along that very likely we shall be the first back and no news cannot be considered as bad news it will only mean that we must wait  she shook her head but did not reply  there are three men in the stern she said at last  leigh sprang up onto the rail behind her  yes there are three sitters  suddenly one of the men stood up the boat was still too far away for the figure to be distinguished leigh would have called to the captain to use his glass but he feared to hold out even a hope to patsey that jean might be in the boat  a minute later the standing figure began to wave his arms wildly  it is jean it is jean patsey cried he has made me out  it was well that leigh had taken his place beside her for suddenly her figure swayed his arm closed round her and calling to the captain to help him he lowered her and laid her on the deck  my sister has fainted bring a bucket of water  madame flambard took patsey from him  she thinks she sees her husband in that boat leigh said pray try and get her round before it comes up i think it must be he but if it should not be we will take her below directly we are sure it will be a terrible blow to her to be disappointed now but possibly they may have news of him and that would be almost as good as his being here  she could not have recognized him at this distance monsieur flambard said  no she did not but he would have recognized her at least he must have seen that there was a woman standing upon the rail watching them and it was hardly likely that coming in his own boat it should be anyone but her i dont see why anyone else should have waved his arms suddenly in the way that he did  he took the bucket of water from lefauxs hands  we think it is captain martin he said run up the shrouds and take a look through the glass  then taking a double handful of water he dashed it into his sisters face  but monsieur madame flambard began to remonstrate  oh it does not matter about her being wet a bit leigh said the great thing is to bring her round  there she is opening her eyes i never saw her faint before she is not that sort  at this moment there was a joyous shout from the skipper  it is captain martin himself hurrah boys it is the captain  the crew broke into joyous shouts  it is jean patsey leigh said sharply thank god it is he  steady steady he added as his sister suddenly sat up and held out her arms to be lifted to her feet are you all right dear he will not be alongside for some little time dont try to get up for a minute or two  as madame flambard supported her he ran down into the cabin poured out a little brandy and water and ran upstairs again with the glass  there dear drink this you must be strong enough to greet him as he comes alongside  she drank it up and then he helped her to her feet she stood leaning on the rail but unable to see the boat through her tears leigh ran up a few of the ratlines and waved his cap and two or three minutes later the whole crew clustered along the side raised a loud cheer as the boat came near  patsey held out her arms to jean who had after his first eager signal dropped back into his seat and sat there with his face covered in his hands until within two or three hundred yards of the lugger then he had stood up again he waved his cap in reply to the cheers of the crew but his eyes were fixed upon patsey  illustration for two or three minutes husband and wife stood together  as the boat came alongside he sprang on to the channel swung himself over the rail patsey falling into his arms as his feet touched the deck the others all drew back and for two or three minutes husband and wife stood together then jean placing patsey in a chair turned and embraced leigh warmly  i felt sure that you would bring her back safely he said i never allowed myself to doubt it for a minute and as soon as i made the lugger out from the height there i was sure that she was on board and ran down to the coast guard station and captain whittier and the crew were in her in a couple of minutes  where is louis  here he is monsieur flambard said coming forward with the child in his arms  louis knew his father at once and greeted him with a little shout of pleasure  and you too flambard jean said after he had kissed and embraced his boy i am glad indeed that you too have escaped from that inferno they call france  yes and my wife too martin and like your wife we owe our safety to leigh  although they had not met before jean and madame flambard shook hands as warmly as if they had been old friends filled as they were by a common happiness  captain whittier now came on board he had hitherto remained in the boat in order that the family meetings should be got over before he showed himself  i am glad to see you master leigh he said shaking hands as he spoke though i certainly should not have known you again you ought no longer to be called master leigh for you are a grown man we have talked of you often and often and it was not until captain martin arrived a week ago that we had any idea of what had become of you  everyone will be glad to know that you are safely back and you too mrs martin everyone has missed miss patsey as they still call you when they speak of you  jean had been shaking hands with lefaux and the crew and now returned  i dont know how we stand with this craft captain she has come into port of her own free will and not as a prize i claim that she is the property of a french royalist now an emigre and as england so far from being at war with french royalists is their ally i intend to transfer her to my wife and to have her registered as an english ship  well i suppose that you will have to settle that with the authorities captain martin but i should think that you are right for other french craft have come across with emigres and have always been allowed to return is there any cargo on board  none leigh said she left bordeaux the moment she discharged the cargo she brought there  as they dropped anchor off the island another boat came alongside with mr stansfield and his two sons and there was again a scene of tender greeting between them her and leigh  where is polly patsey asked  she was married two years ago her father said to harry king the son of the banker you know of course she lives in poole now  and so this is your little boy  yes but he cannot understand you at present we have always talked french with him since the troubles began as had he spoken a word or two of english it might have been fatal to him and to us but he will soon pick it up now he is among you all  it was a happy party indeed that evening at netherstock where mr stansfield had insisted that monsieur and madame flambard should stay till they could find a lodging to suit them in poole madame martin and her daughter louise arrived a few minutes after the others had reached the house as jean had sent off a boy to tell them as soon as he made out the lugger and a little later patseys sister polly came over from poole  at first innumerable questions were asked on each side and then leigh related all that had happened since they left le mans monsieur flambard interrupted when it came to the point where leigh had rescued him and his wife and gave full particulars of it to jean who translated it to the others then it came to jeans turn  i was with rochejaquelein he said we had made our last charge down on the head of the enemys column it was hot work desailles was shot through the head close by my side and as we rode off i felt my horse stumble and knew that it was hit almost at the same moment my sword fell from my hand my right arm being broken by a musket ball  la rochejaquelein had given orders that this charge was to be the last he knew that by this time the main part of the army would have left the town my horse lagged behind the others and i was just turning it to ride to our meeting place when it fell under me  i decided at once not to attempt to come to the rendezvous in the first place i felt sure that you had already followed out my instructions and in the next place had i joined you i should have ruined your chance of escape being dismounted i should have hampered your flight and even had we escaped pursuit your having a man with a broken arm with you would everywhere have roused suspicion i therefore determined to go as far as i could and then hide in a wood and shift for myself  i got a peasant who was running past me to stop for a moment and bind my arm tightly with my sash it was broken high up i walked for two or three hours in the direction opposite to that in which the army had retreated the peasant who had bound my arm up accompanied me i found that he came from a farm near us he had recognized me at once but i had not noticed who it was i told him to try and save himself but he would not hear of it  monsieur will require my aid he said and it is my duty to render it besides i am as likely to escape one way as the other monsieur knows more about the roads than i do and will be able to direct me  of course i assented for i was glad indeed to have him with me as soon as we hid up in a wood he cut two strips of bark off the trunk of a young tree cut off the sleeve of my coat and shirt put the arm straight and with a strip torn off my sash first bandaged it and then applied the two pieces of bark as splints and finally bound another bandage round them  he had carried with him the blanket and valises he had taken off the saddle the latter contained a bottle of wine and some food and on this we lived for three days then i determined upon starting he went out in the evening and managed to buy at a cottage two loaves of bread and a couple of bottles of wine we divided these then i put on my disguise and we started in different directions he making south for the river which i trust the good fellow managed to reach and cross safely while i struck north  my wine and bread lasted me for four days by which time i had arrived at louviers on the seine i was now a hundred miles from le mans and altogether beyond the line of action i felt comparatively safe my arm was so painful however that i felt that at whatever risk i must see a surgeon  i went first to an inn where my appearance as a stranger and without means of conveyance excited the surprise of the landlord  you are hurt monsieur he said  yes my horse fell under me and threw me heavily and broke my arm before i could recover myself it had run away fortunately a peasant who was going by bandaged my arm up and i was able to walk on here who is the best surgeon in the place  he mentioned the name of the doctor and said that he had the reputation of being very skilful and kind he offered to send for him but being close by i said that i would rather go to him  the mans face gave me confidence as soon as i entered i knew that it would be of no use to tell him the story of a fall and i said at once  monsieur i believe doctors are like confessors and that they keep the secrets of their patients  he smiled  monsieur has a secret then  i have i said i have had my arm broken by a musket ballit does not matter how or when does it  in no way he said my business is simply to do what i can for you  it is seven days old i said and is horribly painful and inflamed  he examined the wound  the bone is badly broken he said it is well for you that it has been bound up with some skill and that these rough splints have kept it in its place of course what you require is rest and quiet without cutting down to the bone i cannot tell how badly it is splintered and in the state of inflammation that it is now in i could not venture upon that i can only rebandage it again and give you a lotion to pour over it from time to time  tell me frankly what you are you can trust me  i am a sailor i said captain of my own craft i am also a vendean and as the cause is now lost i am making my way down to the sea i hope in some way or other to make my escape to england where i have friends my wife being an englishwoman what i require more than anything is a suit of sailors clothes  i will do what i can to help you my friend i am not one of those who think that france can be regenerated by the slaughter of the whole of the best of her people and by all power being given to the worst  let me see i cannot go and buy sailors clothes myself but my old servant can be trusted absolutely there is a shop down by the river where such things are sold i will get her to go down there and say that she has a nephew just arrived from sea and that she wants to give him a new rig out but as he has hurt himself and cannot come she must choose it what is your height  about five foot ten i said  and how broad round the shoulders  fortythree inches i have plenty of money to pay for all that is necessary and more and i took out my roll of assignats  since you are well provided he said i will take some the people are very poor and we all suffer together they pay me when they can and so that i can make ends meet i am well content  in an hour the woman returned with a suit of rough sailors clothes and you may imagine how glad i was to put them on the doctor helping me on with the jacket  now he said when i had dressed and eaten some food the old servant had set before me it happens that at daybreak tomorrow one of my patients the master of a river boat is starting on the turn of tide for honfleur i will first go round to the auberge and tell the landlord that your arm is badly broken and that i shall keep you here for the night as you will require attention then i will go to the captain and arrange for your passage when i tell him that you are a patient of mine and that i should be obliged if he would find you some quiet lodging at honfleur where you can remain till your arm is better and you are fit to be about again i have no doubt he will manage it he is a good fellow and i shall let him understand that you dont want inquiries made about you  now you had better lie down on a bed upstairs and try to sleep i will call you in time to go down to the boat  there is no fear of my getting you into trouble i asked i would rather go on to honfleur by road at once than do so  there is no fear of that the maire is a friend and patient of mine and if as may be the case the landlord mentions the arrival of a stranger and his coming to me i shall simply tell the maire that your arm being badly broken i kept you for the night and then sent you on by boat and that as for papers not being a gendarme i never thought of asking you for them  the next morning he dressed my arm again and then himself took me down to the boat and handed me over to its skipper he absolutely refused any payment for his services but i insisted on his receiving a couple of hundred francs in assignats for the use of his poorer patients  the skipper carried out his instructions to the letter we got to honfleur after dark on the day after starting and he went with me to the cottage of a widow of his acquaintance  he said to her mother i want you to take care of this young sailor he has broken his arm and wants nursing he does not want his being here to be known because he is afraid he might be packed off in one of the ships of war as soon as he recovers i suppose you can manage that  oh yes she said i have very few visitors and no one would guess that i have anyone upstairs  he has plenty of money to pay your charges now i will leave him with you and will look in tomorrow to see how he is getting on  i stayed there a fortnight by which time the inflammation had pretty well subsided no one could be kinder than the old woman was she used to bathe my arm by the hour and she fed me up with broth  at the end of that time i felt ready for work though my arm was of course useless so having paid my account i went down boldly to the river and crossed to harfleur and then went on to havre i stayed there for a couple of days at a sailors cabaret where they supposed that i belonged to a vessel in port and no questions were asked  finding that it would be difficult to pass the gunboat lying there i walked up to fecamp picked out a likely looking boat afloat by the quay and at night got on board rowed quietly out and then managed to get the sail hoisted the wind was offshore and by the morning i was out of sight of the french coast i laid my course for portsmouth and landed there that evening being fortunately able to speak english i had only to leave the boat tied up to the quay and go up to a small inn close by i slept there crossed to gosport and walked to southampton the next morning and got into poole on the following day and soon found where my mother and sister were staying  so you see i had altogether very little adventure on my way from le mans since then i have spent most of my time up here sweeping the water with your fathers glass i had been watching the henriette for hours before she came near enough for me to be sure that it was she though of course i could see that she was a frenchrigged boat  as soon as i made her out i sent off word to my mother and ran down to the coast guard station i felt sure that you were on board for otherwise the lugger would not have come over here still of course i could not be absolutely certain until i saw that the figure i could make out standing on the rail was that of a woman  it was some little time before their plans were finally decided upon it was evident that at present no trade could be done in french wines however as jean his mother and his friend flambard had sufficient capital to enable them to live without trade for some time they agreed that they should establish themselves at once in london as wine merchants flambard had correspondents in spain and portugal from whom he could obtain wine of these countries and they agreed that poole did not offer opportunities for carrying on any considerable trade both insisted that leigh should become a member of the firm and a month after their arrival at poole the party moved up to london  madame martin her daughter jean and his wife took a house between them at hackney and monsieur flambard and his wife established themselves in another a few hundred yards away  from time to time came scraps of news from across the channel la rochejaquelein and stofflet after being separated from their followers when crossing the loire had gathered a small band together and gained some successes over parties of the enemy two grenadiers after one of these skirmishes were on the point of being shot by the peasants when henri came up to save their lives one of the prisoners however recognizing the gallant leader of the vendeans raised his musket and shot him dead  it was not for two years after this that the struggle was finally brought to a conclusion for the heroic people of la vendee continued to resist all the efforts of their enemies until stofflet and charette were captured and executed the one in february 1796 the other in the following month the moderation and judgment of general hoche finally brought about the end of a war which stands unexampled in history for the noble resistance offered by a small body of peasants to the power of a great country  as soon as monsieur flambard heard from his correspondents abroad that a consignment of wine was on its way they took an office for it had already been agreed that having no connection for sales to private customers they would work only as wholesale merchants dealing with the trade and with large hotels and other establishments contenting themselves with the smallest possible rate of profit until they made a connection and at the end of two or three years they were doing a considerable business  the henriette sailed for france shortly after their arrival in poole as the crew preferred returning home lefaux was to trade as before and being so well known at all the western ports was certain of obtaining freights he was to pay wages and all other expenses and to transmit the balance as opportunity occurred  three years later when the internal affairs of the country had calmed down jean managed to get a letter sent to the priest of their village asking him to inquire about marthe and after a considerable time an answer was received saying that she and francois had reached home in safety had been married shortly after their return and were doing well having with their joint savings purchased at a very low price one of jeans confiscated farms  ten years later the firm of flambard martin  stansfield were doing a large business and when the war came to a termination and trade with bordeaux charente and nantes was renewed monsieur flambard returned to bordeaux and having a large connection there the firm soon became known as the largest importers of foreign wines in london  madame martin had long before that died patsey was the mother of three boys and two girls and leigh had a separate establishment of his own and had been for fifteen years a married man mr stansfield was still alive and things went on at netherstock in very much the same fashion as before patsey left home  jacques martin had been one of the many who were guillotined when the terror came to an end after the death of robespierre  the end
