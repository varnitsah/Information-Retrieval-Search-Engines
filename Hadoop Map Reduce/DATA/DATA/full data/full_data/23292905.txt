23292905	prayers written at vailima     introduction    in every samoan household the day is closed with prayer and the  singing of hymns  the omission of this sacred duty would indicate  not only a lack of religious training in the house chief but a  shameless disregard of all that is reputable in samoan social life   no doubt to many the evening service is no more than a duty  fulfilled  the child who says his prayer at his mothers knee can  have no real conception of the meaning of the words he lisps so  readily yet he goes to his little bed with a sense of heavenly  protection that he would miss were the prayer forgotten  the  average samoan is but a larger child in most things and would lay  an uneasy head on his wooden pillow if he had not joined even  perfunctorily in the evening service  with my husband prayer  the direct appeal was a necessity  when he was happy he felt  impelled to offer thanks for that undeserved joy when in sorrow  or pain to call for strength to bear what must be borne  vailima lay up some three miles of continual rise from apia and  more than half that distance from the nearest village  it was a  long way for a tired man to walk down every evening with the sole  purpose of joining in family worship and the road through the bush  was dark and to the samoan imagination beset with supernatural  terrors  wherefore as soon as our household had fallen into a  regular routine and the bonds of samoan family life began to draw  us more closely together tusitala felt the necessity of including  our retainers in our evening devotions  i suppose ours was the  only white mans family in all samoa except those of the  missionaries where the day naturally ended with this homely  patriarchal custom  not only were the religious scruples of the  natives satisfied but what we did not foresee our own  respectability  and incidentally that of our retainers  became  assured and the influence of tusitala increased tenfold  after all work and meals were finished the pu or war conch was  sounded from the back veranda and the front so that it might be  heard by all  i dont think it ever occurred to us that there was  any incongruity in the use of the war conch for the peaceful  invitation to prayer  in response to its summons the white members  of the family took their usual places in one end of the large hall  while the samoans  men women and children  trooped in through  all the open doors some carrying lanterns if the evening were  dark all moving quietly and dropping with samoan decorum in a wide  semicircle on the floor beneath a great lamp that hung from the  ceiling  the service began by my son reading a chapter from the  samoan bible tusitala following with a prayer in english  sometimes impromptu but more often from the notes in this little  book interpolating or changing with the circumstance of the day   then came the singing of one or more hymns in the native tongue  and the recitation in concert of the lords prayer also in samoan   many of these hymns were set to ancient tunes very wild and  warlike and strangely at variance with the missionary words  sometimes a passing band of hostile warriors with blackened faces  would peer in at us through the open windows and often we were  forced to pause until the strangely savage monotonous noise of the  native drums had ceased but no samoan nor i trust white person  changed his reverent attitude  once i remember a look of  surprised dismay crossing the countenance of tusitala when my son  contrary to his usual custom of reading the next chapter following  that of yesterday turned back the leaves of his bible to find a  chapter fiercely denunciatory and only too applicable to the  foreign dictators of distracted samoa  on another occasion the  chief himself brought the service to a sudden check  he had just  learned of the treacherous conduct of one in whom he had every  reason to trust  that evening the prayer seemed unusually short  and formal  as the singing stopped he arose abruptly and left the  room  i hastened after him fearing some sudden illness  what is  it i asked  it is this was the reply i am not yet fit to  say forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass  against us  it is with natural reluctance that i touch upon the last prayer of  my husbands life  many have supposed that he showed in the  wording of this prayer that he had some premonition of his  approaching death  i am sure he had no such premonition  it was i  who told the assembled family that i felt an impending disaster  approaching nearer and nearer  any scot will understand that my  statement was received seriously  it could not be we thought  that danger threatened any one within the house but mr graham  balfour my husbands cousin very near and dear to us was away on  a perilous cruise  our fears followed the various vessels more or  less unseaworthy in which he was making his way from island to  island to the atoll where the exiled king mataafa was at that  time imprisoned  in my husbands last prayer the night before his  death he asked that we should be given strength to bear the loss  of this dear friend should such a sorrow befall us    contents   for success for grace at morning evening another for evening in time of rain another in time of rain before a temporary separation for friends for the family sunday for selfblame for selfforgetfulness for renewal of joy    for success    lord behold our family here assembled  we thank thee for this  place in which we dwell for the love that unites us for the peace  accorded us this day for the hope with which we expect the morrow  for the health the work the food and the bright skies that make  our lives delightful for our friends in all parts of the earth  and our friendly helpers in this foreign isle  let peace abound in  our small company  purge out of every heart the lurking grudge   give us grace and strength to forbear and to persevere  offenders  give us the grace to accept and to forgive offenders  forgetful  ourselves help us to bear cheerfully the forgetfulness of others   give us courage and gaiety and the quiet mind  spare to us our  friends soften to us our enemies  bless us if it may be in all  our innocent endeavours  if it may not give us the strength to  encounter that which is to come that we be brave in peril  constant in tribulation temperate in wrath and in all changes of  fortune and down to the gates of death loyal and loving one to  another  as the clay to the potter as the windmill to the wind  as children of their sire we beseech of thee this help and mercy  for christs sake    for grace    grant that we here before thee may be set free from the fear of  vicissitude and the fear of death may finish what remains before  us of our course without dishonour to ourselves or hurt to others  and when the day comes may die in peace  deliver us from fear  and favour  from mean hopes and cheap pleasures  have mercy on  each in his deficiency let him be not cast down support the  stumbling on the way and give at last rest to the weary    at morning    the day returns and brings us the petty round of irritating  concerns and duties  help us to play the man help us to perform  them with laughter and kind faces let cheerfulness abound with  industry  give us to go blithely on our business all this day  bring us to our resting beds weary and content and undishonoured  and grant us in the end the gift of sleep    evening    we come before thee o lord in the end of thy day with  thanksgiving  our beloved in the far parts of the earth those who are now  beginning the labours of the day what time we end them and those  with whom the sun now stands at the point of noon bless help  console and prosper them  our guard is relieved the service of the day is over and the hour  come to rest  we resign into thy hands our sleeping bodies our  cold hearths and open doors  give us to awake with smiles give  us to labour smiling  as the sun returns in the east so let our  patience be renewed with dawn as the sun lightens the world so  let our lovingkindness make bright this house of our habitation    another for evening    lord receive our supplications for this house family and  country  protect the innocent restrain the greedy and the  treacherous lead us out of our tribulation into a quiet land  look down upon ourselves and upon our absent dear ones  help us  and them prolong our days in peace and honour  give us health  food bright weather and light hearts  in what we meditate of  evil frustrate our will in what of good further our endeavours   cause injuries to be forgot and benefits to be remembered  let us lie down without fear and awake and arise with exultation   for his sake in whose words we now conclude    in time of rain    we thank thee lord for the glory of the late days and the  excellent face of thy sun  we thank thee for good news received   we thank thee for the pleasures we have enjoyed and for those we  have been able to confer  and now when the clouds gather and the  rain impends over the forest and our house permit us not to be  cast down let us not lose the savour of past mercies and past  pleasures but like the voice of a bird singing in the rain let  grateful memory survive in the hour of darkness  if there be in  front of us any painful duty strengthen us with the grace of  courage if any act of mercy teach us tenderness and patience    another in time of rain    lord thou sendest down rain upon the uncounted millions of the  forest and givest the trees to drink exceedingly  we are here  upon this isle a few handfuls of men and how many myriads upon  myriads of stalwart trees  teach us the lesson of the trees  the  sea around us which this rain recruits teems with the race of  fish teach us lord the meaning of the fishes  let us see  ourselves for what we are one out of the countless number of the  clans of thy handiwork  when we would despair let us remember  that these also please and serve thee    before a temporary separation    today we go forth separate some of us to pleasure some of us to  worship some upon duty  go with us our guide and angel hold  thou before us in our divided paths the mark of our low calling  still to be true to what small best we can attain to  help us in  that our maker the dispenser of events  thou of the vast  designs in which we blindly labour suffer us to be so far  constant to ourselves and our beloved    for friends    for our absent loved ones we implore thy lovingkindness  keep  them in life keep them in growing honour and for us grant that  we remain worthy of their love  for christs sake let not our  beloved blush for us nor we for them  grant us but that and  grant us courage to endure lesser ills unshaken and to accept  death loss and disappointment as it were straws upon the tide of  life    for the family    aid us if it be thy will in our concerns  have mercy on this  land and innocent people  help them who this day contend in  disappointment with their frailties  bless our family bless our  forest house bless our island helpers  thou who hast made for us  this place of ease and hope accept and inflame our gratitude help  us to repay in service one to another the debt of thine unmerited  benefits and mercies so that when the period of our stewardship  draws to a conclusion when the windows begin to be darkened when  the bond of the family is to be loosed there shall be no  bitterness of remorse in our farewells  help us to look back on the long way that thou hast brought us on  the long days in which we have been served not according to our  deserts but our desires on the pit and the miry clay the  blackness of despair the horror of misconduct from which our feet  have been plucked out  for our sins forgiven or prevented for our  shame unpublished we bless and thank thee o god  help us yet  again and ever  so order events so strengthen our frailty as  that day by day we shall come before thee with this song of  gratitude and in the end we be dismissed with honour  in their  weakness and their fear the vessels of thy handiwork so pray to  thee so praise thee  amen    sunday    we beseech thee lord to behold us with favour folk of many  families and nations gathered together in the peace of this roof  weak men and women subsisting under the covert of thy patience  be  patient still suffer us yet awhile longer  with our broken  purposes of good with our idle endeavours against evil suffer us  awhile longer to endure and if it may be help us to do better   bless to us our extraordinary mercies if the day come when these  must be taken brace us to play the man under affliction  be with  our friends be with ourselves  go with each of us to rest if any  awake temper to them the dark hours of watching and when the day  returns return to us our sun and comforter and call us up with  morning faces and with morning hearts  eager to labour  eager to  be happy if happiness shall be our portion  and if the day be  marked for sorrow strong to endure it  we thank thee and praise thee and in the words of him to whom this  day is sacred close our oblation    for selfblame    lord enlighten us to see the beam that is in our own eye and  blind us to the mote that is in our brothers  let us feel our  offences with our hands make them great and bright before us like  the sun make us eat them and drink them for our diet  blind us to  the offences of our beloved cleanse them from our memories take  them out of our mouths for ever  let all here before thee carry  and measure with the false balances of love and be in their own  eyes and in all conjunctures the most guilty  help us at the same  time with the grace of courage that we be none of us cast down  when we sit lamenting amid the ruins of our happiness or our  integrity  touch us with fire from the altar that we may be up  and doing to rebuild our city  in the name and by the method of  him in whose words of prayer we now conclude    for selfforgetfulness    lord the creatures of thy hand thy disinherited children come  before thee with their incoherent wishes and regrets  children we  are children we shall be till our mother the earth hath fed upon  our bones  accept us correct us guide us thy guilty innocents   dry our vain tears wipe out our vain resentments help our yet  vainer efforts  if there be any here sulking as children will  deal with and enlighten him  make it day about that person so  that he shall see himself and be ashamed  make it heaven about  him lord by the only way to heaven forgetfulness of self and  make it day about his neighbours so that they shall help not  hinder him    for renewal of joy    we are evil o god and help us to see it and amend  we are good  and help us to be better  look down upon thy servants with a  patient eye even as thou sendest sun and rain look down call  upon the dry bones quicken enliven recreate in us the soul of  service the spirit of peace renew in us the sense of joy     end of the project gutenberg etext prayers written at vailima            a

ministers in that parish  of the first  i have a special reason to speak well even had there been any to  think ill  the second i have often met in private and long in the  due phrase sat under in his church and neither here nor there  have i heard an unkind or ugly word upon his lips  the preacher of  the text had thus no original in that particular parish but when i  was a boy he might have been observed in many others he was then  like the schoolmaster abroad and by recent advices it would  seem he has not yet entirely disappeared
