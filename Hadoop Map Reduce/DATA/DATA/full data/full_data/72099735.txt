72099735	the twins of table mountain and other stories   by bret harte     contents   i   the twins of table mountain  ii  an heiress of red dog  iii the great deadwood mystery  iv  a legend of sammtstadt  v   views from a german spion      the twins of table mountain     chapter i   a cloud on the mountain   they lived on the verge of a vast stony level upheaved so far above the surrounding country that its vague outlines viewed from the nearest valley seemed a mere cloudstreak resting upon the lesser hills the rush and roar of the turbulent river that washed its eastern base were lost at that height the winds that strove with the giant pines that half way climbed its flanks spent their fury below the summit for at variance with most meteorological speculation an eternal calm seemed to invest this serene altitude the few alpine flowers seldom thrilled their petals to a passing breeze rain and snow fell alike perpendicularly heavily and monotonously over the granite bowlders scattered along its brown expanse although by actual measurement an inconsiderable elevation of the sierran range and a mere shoulder of the nearest whitefaced peak that glimmered in the west it seemed to lie so near the quiet passionless stars that at night it caught something of their calm remoteness  the articulate utterance of such a locality should have been a whisper a laugh or exclamation was discordant and the ordinary tones of the human voice on the night of the 15th of may 1868 had a grotesque incongruity  in the thick darkness that clothed the mountain that night the human figure would have been lost or confounded with the outlines of outlying bowlders which at such times took upon themselves the vague semblance of men and animals hence the voices in the following colloquy seemed the more grotesque and incongruous from being the apparent expression of an upright monolith ten feet high on the right and another mass of granite that reclining peeped over the verge  hello  hello yourself  youre late  i lost the trail and climbed up the slide  here followed a stumble the clatter of stones down the mountainside and an oath so very human and undignified that it at once relieved the bowlders of any complicity of expression the voices too were close together now and unexpectedly in quite another locality  anything up  looey napoleons declared war agin germany  shooo  notwithstanding this exclamation the interest of the latter speaker was evidently only polite and perfunctory what indeed were the political convulsions of the old world to the dwellers on this serene isolated eminence of the new  i reckon its so continued the first voice french pete and that thar feller that keeps the dutch grocery hev hed a row over it emptied their sixshooters into each other the dutchmans got two balls in his leg and the frenchmans got an onnessary buttonhole in his shirtbuzzum and hez caved in  this concise local corroboration of the conflict of remote nations however confirmatory did not appear to excite any further interest even the last speaker now that he was in this calm dispassionate atmosphere seemed to lose his own concern in his tidings and to have abandoned every thing of a sensational and lowerworldly character in the pines below there were a few moments of absolute silence and then another stumble but now the voices of both speakers were quite patient and philosophical  hold on and ill strike a light said the second speaker i brought a lantern along but i didnt light up i kem out afore sundown and you know how it allers is up yer i didnt want it and didnt keer to light up i forgot youre always a little dazed and strangelike when you first come up  there was a crackle a flash and presently a steady glow which the surrounding darkness seemed to resent the faces of the two men thus revealed were singularly alike the same thin narrow outline of jaw and temple the same dark grave eyes the same brown growth of curly beard and mustache which concealed the mouth and hid what might have been any individual idiosyncrasy of thought or expressionshowed them to be brothers or better known as the twins of table mountain a certain animation in the face of the second speakerthe firstcomera certain light in his eye might have at first distinguished him but even this faded out in the steady glow of the lantern and had no value as a permanent distinction for by the time they had reached the western verge of the mountain the two faces had settled into a homogeneous calmness and melancholy  the vague horizon of darkness that a few feet from the lantern still encompassed them gave no indication of their progress until their feet actually trod the rude planks and thatch that formed the roof of their habitation for their cabin half burrowed in the mountain and half clung like a swallows nest to the side of the deep declivity that terminated the northern limit of the summit had it not been for the windlass of a shaft a coil of rope and a few heaps of stone and gravel which were the only indications of human labor in that stony field there was nothing to interrupt its monotonous dead level and when they descended a dozen wellworn steps to the door of their cabin they left the summit as before lonely silent motionless its long level uninterrupted basking in the cold light of the stars  the simile of a nest as applied to the cabin of the brothers was no mere figure of speech as the light of the lantern first flashed upon it the narrow ledge before the door was strewn with feathers a suggestion that it might be the home and haunt of predatory birds was promptly checked by the spectacle of the nailedup carcasses of a dozen hawks against the walls and the outspread wings of an extended eagle emblazoning the gable above the door like an armorial bearing within the cabin the walls and chimneypiece were dazzlingly bedecked with the partycolored wings of jays yellowbirds woodpeckers kingfishers and the polytinted woodduck yet in that dry highlyrarefied atmosphere there was not the slightest suggestion of odor or decay  the first speaker hung the lantern upon a hook that dangled from the rafters and going to the broad chimney kicked the halfdead embers into a sudden resentful blaze he then opened a rude cupboard and without looking around called ruth  the second speaker turned his head from the open doorway where he was leaning as if listening to something in the darkness and answered abstractedly  rand  i dont believe you have touched grub today  ruth grunted out some indifferent reply  thar hezent been a slice cut off that bacon since i left continued rand bringing a side of bacon and some biscuits from the cupboard and applying himself to the discussion of them at the table youre gettin off yer feet ruth whats up  ruth replied by taking an uninvited seat beside him and resting his chin on the palms of his hands he did not eat but simply transferred his inattention from the door to the table  youre workin too many hours in the shaft continued rand youre always up to some such dn fool business when im not yer  i dipped a little west today ruth went on without heeding the brotherly remonstrance and struck quartz and pyrites  thets youallers dippin west or east for quartz and the color instead of keeping on plumb down to the cement         the local name for goldbearing alluvial driftthe bed      of a prehistoric river   weve been three years digging for cement said ruth more in abstraction than in reproachthree years  and we may be three years moremay be only three days why you couldnt be more impatient ififif you lived in a valley  delivering this tremendous comparison as an unanswerable climax rand applied himself once more to his repast ruth after a moments pause without speaking or looking up disengaged his hand from under his chin and slid it along palm uppermost on the table beside his brother thereupon rand slowly reached forward his left hand the right being engaged in conveying victual to his mouth and laid it on his brothers palm the act was evidently an habitual half mechanical one for in a few moments the hands were as gently disengaged without comment or expression at last rand leaned back in his chair laid down his knife and fork and complacently loosening the belt that held his revolver threw it and the weapon on his bed taking out his pipe and chipping some tobacco on the table he said carelessly i came a piece through the woods with mornie just now  the face that ruth turned upon his brother was very distinct in its expression at that moment and quite belied the popular theory that the twins could not be told apart thet gal continued rand without looking up is either flighty oror suthin he added in vague disgust pushing the table from him as if it were the lady in question dont tell me  ruths eyes quickly sought his brothers and were as quickly averted as he asked hurriedly how  what gets me continued rand in a petulant non sequitur is that you my own twinbrother never lets on about her comin yer permiskus like when i aint yer and you and her gallivantin and promanadin and swoppin sentiments and mottoes  ruth tried to contradict his blushing face with a laugh of worldly indifference  she came up yer on a sort of pasear  oh yesa short cut to the creek interpolated rand satirically  last tuesday or wednesday continued ruth with affected forgetfulness  oh in course tuesday or wednesday or thursday youve so many folks climbing up this yer mountain to call on ye continued the ironical rand that you disremember only you remembered enough not to tell me she did she took me for you or pretended to  the color dropped from ruths cheek  took you for me he asked with an awkward laugh  yes sneered rand chirped and chattered away about our picnic our nosegays and lord knows what said shed keep them bluejays wings and wear em in her hat spouted poetry toothe same sort o rot you get off now and then  ruth laughed again but rather ostentatiously and nervously  ruth look yer  ruth faced his brother  whats your little game do you mean to say you dont know what thet gal is do you mean to say you dont know thet shes the laughingstock of the ferry thet her fathers a dd old fool and her mothers a drunkard and worse thet shes got any right to be hanging round yer you cant mean to marry her even if you kalkilate to turn me out to do it for she wouldnt live alone with ye up here taint her kind and if i thought you was thinking of  what said ruth turning upon his brother quickly  oh thets right holler swear and yell and break things do tear round continued rand kicking his boots off in a corner just because i ask you a civil question thats brotherly he added jerking his chair away against the side of the cabin aint it  shes not to blame because her mother drinks and her fathers a shyster said ruth earnestly and strongly the men who make her the laughingstock of the ferry tried to make her something worse and failed and take this sneaks revenge on her laughingstock yes they knew she could turn the tables on them  of course go on shes better than me i know im a fratricide thats what i am said rand throwing himself on the upper of the two berths that formed the bedstead of the cabin  ive seen her three times continued ruth  and youve known me twenty years interrupted his brother  ruth turned on his heel and walked towards the door  thats right go on why dont you get the chalk  ruth made no reply rand descended from the bed and taking a piece of chalk from the shelf drew a line on the floor dividing the cabin in two equal parts  you can have the east half he said as he climbed slowly back into bed  this mysterious rite was the usual termination of a quarrel between the twins each man kept his half of the cabin until the feud was forgotten it was the mark of silence and separation over which no words of recrimination argument or even explanation were delivered until it was effaced by one or the other this was considered equivalent to apology or reconciliation which each were equally bound in honor to accept  it may be remarked that the floor was much whiter at this line of demarcation and under the fresh chalkline appeared the faint evidences of one recently effaced  without apparently heeding this potential ceremony ruth remained leaning against the doorway looking upon the night the bulk of whose profundity and blackness seemed to be gathered below him the vault above was serene and tranquil with a few large farspaced stars the abyss beneath untroubled by sight or sound stepping out upon the ledge he leaned far over the shelf that sustained their cabin and listened a faint rhythmical roll rising and falling in long undulations against the invisible horizon to his accustomed ears told him the wind was blowing among the pines in the valley yet mingling with this familiar sound his ear now morbidly acute seemed to detect a stranger inarticulate murmur as of confused and excited voices swelling up from the mysterious depths to the stars above and again swallowed up in the gulfs of silence below he was roused from a consideration of this phenomenon by a faint glow towards the east which at last brightened until the dark outline of the distant walls of the valley stood out against the sky were his other senses participating in the delusion of his ears for with the brightening light came the faint odor of burning timber  his face grew anxious as he gazed at last he rose and reentered the cabin his eyes fell upon the faint chalkmark and taking his soft felt hat from his head with a few practical sweeps of the brim he brushed away the ominous record of their late estrangement going to the bed whereon rand lay stretched openeyed he would have laid his hand upon his arm lightly but the brothers fingers sought and clasped his own get up he said quietly theres a strange fire in the canyon head that i cant make out  rand slowly clambered from his shelf and hand in hand the brothers stood upon the ledge its a right smart chance beyond the ferry and a piece beyond the mill too said rand shading his eyes with his hand from force of habit its in the woods where he would have added where he met mornie but it was a point of honor with the twins after reconciliation not to allude to any topic of their recent disagreement  ruth dropped his brothers hand it doesnt smell like the woods he said slowly  smell repeated rand incredulously why its twenty miles in a beeline yonder smell indeed  ruth was silent but presently fell to listening again with his former abstraction you dont hear anything do you he asked after a pause  its blowin in the pines on the river said rand shortly  you dont hear anything else  no  nothing likelikelike  rand who had been listening with an intensity that distorted the left side of his face interrupted him impatiently  like what  like a woman sobbin  ruth said rand suddenly looking up in his brothers face whats gone of you  ruth laughed the fires out he said abruptly reentering the cabin im goin to turn in  rand following his brother half reproachfully saw him divest himself of his clothing and roll himself in the blankets of his bed  goodnight randy  rand hesitated he would have liked to ask his brother another question but there was clearly nothing to be done but follow his example  goodnight ruthy he said and put out the light as he did so the glow in the eastern horizon faded too and darkness seemed to well up from the depths below and flowing in the open door wrapped them in deeper slumber   chapter ii   the clouds gather   twelve months had elapsed since the quarrel and reconciliation during which interval no reference was made by either of the brothers to the cause which had provoked it rand was at work in the shaft ruth having that morning undertaken the replenishment of the larder with game from the wooded skirt of the mountain rand had taken advantage of his brothers absence to prospect in the drifta proceeding utterly at variance with his previous condemnation of all such speculative essay but rand despite his assumption of a superior practical nature was not above certain local superstitions having that morning put on his gray flannel shirt wrong side outan abstraction recognized among the miners as the sure forerunner of divination and treasurediscoveryhe could not forego that opportunity of trying his luck without hazarding a dangerous example he was also conscious of feeling chipperanother local expression for buoyancy of spirit not common to men who work fifty feet below the surface without the stimulus of air and sunshine and not to be overlooked as an important factor in fortunate adventure nevertheless noon came without the discovery of any treasure he had attacked the walls on either side of the lateral drift skilfully so as to expose their quality without destroying their cohesive integrity but had found nothing once or twice returning to the shaft for rest and air its grim silence had seemed to him pervaded with some vague echo of cheerful holiday voices above this set him to thinking of his brothers equally extravagant fancy of the wailing voices in the air on the night of the fire and of his attributing it to a lovers abstraction  i laid it to his being struck after that gal and yet rand continued to himself heres me who havent been foolin round no gal and dog my skin if i didnt think i heard one singin up thar he put his foot on the lower round of the ladder paused and slowly ascended a dozen steps here he paused again all at once the whole shaft was filled with the musical vibrations of a womans song seizing the rope that hung idly from the windlass he half climbed half swung himself to the surface  the voice was there but the sudden transition to the dazzling level before him at first blinded his eyes so that he took in only by degrees the unwonted spectacle of the singera pretty girl standing on tiptoe on a bowlder not a dozen yards from him utterly absorbed in tying a gaylystriped neckerchief evidently taken from her own plump throat to the halliards of a freshlycut hickorypole newly reared as a flagstaff beside her the hickorypole the halliards the fluttering scarf the young lady herself were all glaring innovations on the familiar landscape but rand with his hand still on the rope silently and demurely enjoyed it  for the better understanding of the general reader who does not live on an isolated mountain it may be observed that the young ladys position on the rock exhibited some study of pose and a certain exaggeration of attitude that betrayed the habit of an audience also that her voice had an artificial accent that was not wholly unconscious even in this lofty solitude yet the very next moment when she turned and caught rands eye fixed upon her she started naturally colored slightly uttered that feminine adjuration good lord gracious goodness me which is seldom used in reference to its effect upon the hearer and skipped instantly from the bowlder to the ground here however she alighted in a pose brought the right heel of her neatlyfitting left boot closely into the hollowed side of her right instep at the same moment deftly caught her flying skirt whipped it around her ankles and slightly raising it behind permitted the chaste display of an inch or two of frilled white petticoat the most irreverent critic of the sex will i think admit that it has some movements that are automatic  hope i didnt disturb ye said rand pointing to the flagstaff  the young lady slightly turned her head no she said but i didnt know anybody was here of course our partyshe emphasized the word and accompanied it with a look toward the further extremity of the plateau to show she was not aloneour party climbed this ridge and put up this pole as a sign to show they did it the ridiculous selfcomplacency of this record in the face of a man who was evidently a dweller on the mountain apparently struck her for the first time we didnt know she stammered looking at the shaft from which rand had emerged thatthat she stopped and glancing again towards the distant range where her friends had disappeared began to edge away  they cant be far off interposed rand quietly as if it were the most natural thing in the world for the lady to be there table mountain aint as big as all that dont you be scared so you thought nobody lived up here  she turned upon him a pair of honest hazel eyes which not only contradicted the somewhat meretricious smartness of her dress but was utterly inconsistent with the palpable artificial color of her hairan obvious imitation of a certain popular fashion then known in artistic circles as the british blondeand began to ostentatiously resume a pair of lemoncolored kid gloves having as it were thus indicated her standing and respectability and put an immeasurable distance between herself and her bold interlocutor she said impressively we evidently made a mistake i will rejoin our party who will of course apologize  whats your hurry said the imperturbable rand disengaging himself from the rope and walking towards her as long as youre up here you might stop a spell  i have no wish to intrude that is our party certainly has not continued the young lady pulling the tight gloves and smoothing the plump almost bursting fingers with an affectation of fashionable ease  oh i havent any thing to do just now said rand and its about grub time i reckon yes i live here ruth and meright here  the young woman glanced at the shaft  no not down there said rand following her eye with a laugh come here and ill show you  a strong desire to keep up an appearance of genteel reserve and an equally strong inclination to enjoy the adventurous company of this goodlooking hearty young fellow made her hesitate perhaps she regretted having undertaken a role of such dignity at the beginning she could have been so perfectly natural with this perfectly natural man whereas any relaxation now might increase his familiarity and yet she was not without a vague suspicion that her dignity and her gloves were alike thrown away on hima fact made the more evident when rand stepped to her side and without any apparent consciousness of disrespect or gallantry laid his large hand half persuasively half fraternally upon her shoulder and said oh come along do  the simple act either exceeded the limits of her forbearance or decided the course of her subsequent behavior she instantly stepped back a single pace and drew her left foot slowly and deliberately after her then she fixed her eyes and uplifted eyebrows upon the daring hand and taking it by the ends of her thumb and forefinger lifted it and dropped it in midair she then folded her arms it was the indignant gesture with which alice the pride of dumballin village received the loathsome advances of the bloated aristocrat sir parkyns parkyn and had at marysville a few nights before brought down the house  this effect was i think however lost upon rand the slight color that rose to his cheek as he looked down upon his claysoiled hands was due to the belief that he had really contaminated her outward superfine person but his color quickly passed his frank boyish smile returned as he said itll rub off lord dont mind that thar nowcome on  the young woman bit her lip then nature triumphed and she laughed although a little scornfully and then providence assisted her with the sudden presentation of two figures a man and woman slowly climbing up over the mountain verge not far from them with a cry of theres sol now she forgot her dignity and her confusion and ran towards them  rand stood looking after her neat figure less concerned in the advent of the strangers than in her sudden caprice he was not so young and inexperienced but that he noted certain ambiguities in her dress and manner he was by no means impressed by her dignity but he could not help watching her as she appeared to be volubly recounting her late interview to her companions and still unconscious of any impropriety or obtrusiveness he lounged down lazily towards her her humor had evidently changed for she turned an honest pleased face upon him as she girlishly attempted to drag the strangers forward  the man was plump and short unlike the natives of the locality he was closely cropped and shaven as if to keep down the strong blueblackness of his beard and hair which nevertheless asserted itself over his round cheeks and upper lip like a tattooing of indian ink the woman at his side was reserved and indistinctive with that appearance of being an unenthusiastic family servant peculiar to some mens wives when rand was within a few feet of him he started struck a theatrical attitude and shading his eyes with his hand cried what do me eyes deceive me burst into a hearty laugh darted forward seized rands hand and shook it briskly  pinkney pinkney my boy how are you and this is your little prop your quartersection your countryseat that weve been trespassing on eh a nice little spot cool sequestered remotea trifle unimproved carriageroad as yet unfinished ha ha but to think of our making a discovery of this inaccessible mountain climbing it sir for two mortal hours christening it sols peak getting up a flagpole unfurling our standard to the breeze sir and then by gad winding up by finding pinkney the festive pinkney living on it at home  completely surprised but still perfectly goodhumored rand shook the strangers right hand warmly and received on his broad shoulders a welcoming thwack from the left without question she dont mind her friends making free with me evidently said rand to himself as he tried to suggest that fact to the young lady in a meaning glance  the stranger noted his glance and suddenly passed his hand thoughtfully over his shaven cheeks no he saidyes surely i forgetyes i see of course you dont rosy turning to his wife of course pinkney doesnt know phemie eh  no nor me either sol said that lady warningly  certainly continued sol its his misfortune you werent with me at gold hillallow me he said turning to rand to present mrs sol saunders wife of the undersigned and miss euphemia neville otherwise known as the marysville pet the best variety actress known on the provincial boards played ophelia at marysville friday domestic drama at gold hill saturday sunday night four songs in character different dress each time and a clogdance the best clogdance on the pacific slope he added in a stage aside the minstrels are crazy to get her in frisco but money cant buy herprefers the legitimate drama to this sort of thing here he took a few steps of a jig to which the marysville pet beat time with her feet and concluded with a laugh and a winkthe combined expression of an artists admiration for her ability and a man of the worlds scepticism of feminine ambition  miss euphemia responded to the formal introduction by extending her hand frankly with a reassuring smile to rand and an utter obliviousness of her former hauteur rand shook it warmly and then dropped carelessly on a rock beside them  and you never told me you lived up here in the attic you rascal continued sol with a laugh  no replied rand simply how could i i never saw you before that i remember  miss euphemia stared at sol mrs sol looked up in her lords face and folded her arms in a resigned expression sol rose to his feet again and shaded his eyes with his hand but this time quite seriously and gazed at rands smiling face  good lord do you mean to say your name isnt pinkney he asked with a half embarrassed laugh  it is pinkney said rand but i never met you before  didnt you come to see a young lady that joined my troupe at gold hill last month and say youd meet me at keelers ferry in a day or two  nooo said rand with a goodhumored laugh i havent left this mountain for two months  he might have added more but his attention was directed to miss euphemia who during this short dialogue having stuffed alternately her handkerchief the corner of her mantle and her gloves into her mouth restrained herself no longer but gave way to an uncontrollable fit of laughter o sol she gasped explanatorily as she threw herself alternately against him mrs sol and a bowlder youll kill me yet o lord first we take possession of this mans property then we claim him the contemplation of this humorous climax affected her so that she was fain at last to walk away and confide the rest of her speech to space  sol joined in the laugh until his wife plucked his sleeve and whispered something in his ear in an instant his face became at once mysterious and demure i owe you an apology he said turning to rand but in a voice ostentatiously pitched high enough for miss euphemia to overhear i see i have made a mistake a resemblanceonly a mere resemblance as i look at you nowled me astray of course you dont know any young lady in the profession  of course he doesnt sol said miss euphemia i could have told you that he didnt even know me  the voice and mockheroic attitude of the speaker was enough to relieve the general embarrassment with a laugh rand now pleasantly conscious of only miss euphemias presence again offered the hospitality of his cabin with the polite recognition of her friends in the sentence and you might as well come along too  but wont we incommode the lady of the house said mrs sol politely  what lady of the house said rand almost angrily  why ruth you know  it was rands turn to become hilarious ruth he said is short for rutherford my brother his laugh however was echoed only by euphemia  then you have a brother said mrs sol benignly  yes said rand he will be here soon a sudden thought dropped the color from his cheek look here he said turning impulsively upon sol i have a brother a twinbrother it couldnt be him  sol was conscious of a significant feminine pressure on his right arm he was equal to the emergency i think not he said dubiously unless your brothers hair is much darker than yours yes now i look at you yours is brown he has a mole on his right cheek hasnt he  the red came quickly back to rands boyish face he laughed no sir my brothers hair is if any thing a shade lighter than mine and nary mole come along  and leading the way rand disclosed the narrow steps winding down to the shelf on which the cabin hung be careful said rand taking the now unresisting hand of the marysville pet as they descended a step that way and down you go two thousand feet on the top of a pinetree  but the girls slight cry of alarm was presently changed to one of unaffected pleasure as they stood on the rocky platform it isnt a house its a nest and the loveliest said euphemia breathlessly  its a scene a perfect scene sir said sol enraptured i shall take the liberty of bringing my scenepainter to sketch it some day it would do for the mountaineers bride superbly or continued the little man warming through the blueblack border of his face with professional enthusiasm its enough to make a play itself the cot on the crags last scenemoonlightthe struggle on the ledge the lady of the crags throws herself from the beetling heightsa shriek from the depthsa womans wail  dry up sharply interrupted rand to whom this speech recalled his brothers halfforgotten strangeness look at the prospect  in the full noon of a cloudless day beneath them a tumultuous sea of pines surged heaved rode in giant crests stretched and lost itself in the ghostly snowpeaked horizon the thronging woods choked every defile swept every crest filled every valley with its darkgreen tilting spears and left only table mountain sunlit and bare here and there were profound olive depths over which the gray hawk hung lazily and into which blue jays dipped a faint dull yellowish streak marked an occasional watercourse a deeper reddish ribbon the mountain road and its overhanging murky cloud of dust  is it quite safe here asked mrs sol eying the little cabin i mean from storms  it never blows up here replied rand and nothing happens  it must be lovely said euphemia clasping her hands  it is that said rand proudly its four years since ruth and i took up this yer claim and raised this shanty in that four years we havent left it alone a night or cared to its only big enough for two and them two must be brothers it wouldnt do for mere pardners to live here alonethey couldnt do it it wouldnt be exactly the thing for man and wife to shut themselves up here alone but ruth and me know each others ways and here well stay until weve made a pile we sometimesone of ustakes a pasear to the ferry to buy provisions but were glad to crawl up to the back of old table at night  youre quite out of the world here then suggested mrs sol  thats it just it were out of the worldout of rows out of liquor out of cards out of bad company out of temptation cussedness and foolishness hez got to follow us up here to find us and theres too many ready to climb down to them things to tempt em to come up to us  there was a little boyish conceit in his tone as he stood there not altogether unbecoming his fresh color and simplicity yet when his eyes met those of miss euphemia he colored he hardly knew why and the young lady herself blushed rosily  when the neat cabin with its decorated walls and squirrel and wildcat skins was duly admired the luncheonbasket of the saunders party was reenforced by provisions from rands larder and spread upon the ledge the dimensions of the cabin not admitting four under the potent influence of a bottle sol became hilarious and professional the pet was induced to favor the company with a recitation and under the plea of teaching rand to perform the clogdance with both gentlemen then there was an interval in which rand and euphemia wandered a little way down the mountainside to gather laurel leaving mr sol to his siesta on a rock and mrs sol to take some knitting from the basket and sit beside him  when rand and his companion had disappeared mrs sol nudged her sleeping partner do you think that was the brother  sol yawned sure of it theyre as like as two peas in looks  why didnt you tell him so then  will you tell me my dear why you stopped me when i began  because something was said about ruth being here and i supposed ruth was a woman and perhaps pinkneys wife and knew youd be putting your foot in it by talking of that other woman i supposed it was for fear of that he denied knowing you  well when hethis randtold me he had a twinbrother he looked so frightened that i knew he knew nothing of his brothers doings with that woman and i threw him off the scent hes a good fellow but awfully green and i didnt want to worry him with tales i like him and i think phemie does too  nonsense hes a conceited prig did you hear his sermon on the world and its temptations i wonder if he thought temptation had come up to him in the person of us professionals out on a picnic i think it was positively rude  my dear woman youre always seeing slights and insults i tell you hes taken a shine to phemie and hes as good as four seats and a bouquet to that child next wednesday evening to say nothing of the eclat of getting this st simeonwhat do you call himstalactites  stylites suggested mrs sol  stylites off from his pillar here ill have a paragraph in the paper that the hermit crabs of table mountain  dont be a fool sol  the hermit twins of table mountain bespoke the chaste performance  one of them being the protector of the wellknown mornie nixon responded mrs sol viciously accenting the name with her knittingneedles  rosy youre unjust youre prejudiced by the reports of the town mr pinkneys interest in her may be a purely artistic one although mistaken shell never make a good varietyactress shes too heavy and the boys dont give her a fair show no woman can make a debut in my version of somnambula and have the front row in the pit say to her in the sleepwalking scene youre out rather late mornie kinder forgot to put on your things didnt you mother sick i suppose and youre goin for more gin hurry along or youll ketch it when ye get home why you couldnt do it yourself rosy  to which mrs sols illogical climax was that bad as rutherford might be this sundayschool superintendent rand was worse  rand and his companion returned late but in high spirits there was an unnecessary effusiveness in the way in which euphemia kissed mrs solthe one woman present who understood and was to be propitiatedwhich did not tend to increase mrs sols good humor she had her basket packed all ready for departure and even the earnest solicitation of rand that they would defer their going until sunset produced no effect  mr randmr pinkney i meansays the sunsets here are so lovely pleaded euphemia  there is a rehearsal at seven oclock and we have no time to lose said mrs sol significantly  i forgot to say said the marysville pet timidly glancing at mrs sol that mr rand says he will bring his brother on wednesday night and wants four seats in front so as not to be crowded  sol shook the young mans hand warmly youll not regret it sir its a surprising a remarkable performance  id like to go a piece down the mountain with you said rand with evident sincerity looking at miss euphemia but ruth isnt here yet and we make a rule never to leave the place alone ill show you the slide its the quickest way to go down if you meet any one who looks like me and talks like me call him ruth and tell him im waitin for him yer  miss phemia the last to go standing on the verge of the declivity here remarked with a dangerous smile that if she met any one who bore that resemblance she might be tempted to keep him with hera playfulness that brought the ready color to rands cheek when she added to this the greater audacity of kissing her hand to him the young hermit actually turned away in sheer embarrassment when he looked around again she was gone and for the first time in his experience the mountain seemed barren and lonely  the too sympathetic reader who would rashly deduce from this any newly awakened sentiment in the virgin heart of rand would quite misapprehend that peculiar young man that singular mixture of boyish inexperience and mature doubt and disbelief which was partly the result of his temperament and partly of his cloistered life on the mountain made him regard his late companions now that they were gone and his intimacy with them with remorseful distrust the mountain was barren and lonely because it was no longer his it had become a part of the great world which four years ago he and his brother had put aside and in which as two selfdevoted men they walked alone more than that he believed he had acquired some understanding of the temptations that assailed his brother and the poor little vanities of the marysville pet were transformed into the blandishments of a circe rand who would have succumbed to a wicked superior woman believed he was a saint in withstanding the foolish weakness of a simple one   he did not resume his work that day he paced the mountain anxiously awaiting his brothers return and eager to relate his experiences he would go with him to the dramatic entertainment from his example and wisdom ruth should learn how easily temptation might be overcome but first of all there should be the fullest exchange of confidences and explanations the old rule should be rescinded for once the old discussion in regard to mornie reopened and rand having convinced his brother of error would generously extend his forgiveness  the sun sank redly lingering long upon the ledge before their cabin it at last slipped away almost imperceptibly leaving rand still wrapped in revery darkness the smoke of distant fires in the woods and the faint evening incense of the pines crept slowly up but ruth came not the moon rose a silver gleam on the farther ridge and rand becoming uneasy at his brothers prolonged absence resolved to break another custom and leave the summit to seek him on the trail he buckled on his revolvers seized his gun when a cry from the depths arrested him he leaned over the ledge and listened again the cry arose and this time more distinctly he held his breath the blood settled around his heart in superstitious terror it was the wailing voice of a woman  ruth ruth for gods sake come and help me  the blood flew back hotly to rands cheek it was mornies voice by leaning over the ledge he could distinguish something moving along the almost precipitous face of the cliff where an abandoned trail long since broken off and disrupted by the fall of a portion of the ledge stopped abruptly a hundred feet below him rand knew the trail a dangerous one always in its present condition a single misstep would be fatal would she make that misstep he shook off a horrible temptation that seemed to be sealing his lips and paralyzing his limbs and almost screamed to her drop on your face hang on to the chaparral and dont move  in another instant with a coil of rope around his arm he was dashing down the almost perpendicular slide when he had nearly reached the level of the abandoned trail he fastened one end of the rope to a jutting splinter of granite and began to lay out and work his way laterally along the face of the mountain presently he struck the regular trail at the point from which the woman must have diverged  it is rand she said without lifting her head  it is replied rand coldly pass the rope under your arms and ill get you back to the trail  where is ruth she demanded again without moving she was trembling but with excitement rather than fear  i dont know returned rand impatiently come the ledge is already crumbling beneath our feet  let it crumble said the woman passionately  rand surveyed her with profound disgust then passed the rope around her waist and half lifted half swung her from her feet in a few moments she began to mechanically help herself and permitted him to guide her to a place of safety that reached she sank down again  the rising moon shone full upon her face and figure through his growing indignation rand was still impressed and even startled with the change the few last months had wrought upon her in place of the silly fanciful halfhysterical hoyden whom he had known a matured woman strong in passionate selfwill fascinating in a kind of wild savage beauty looked up at him as if to read his very soul  what are you staring at she said finally why dont you help me on  where do you want to go said rand quietly  where up thereshe pointed savagely to the top of the mountainto him where else should i go she said with a bitter laugh  ive told you he wasnt there said rand roughly he hasnt returned  ill wait for himdo you hearwait for him stay there till he comes if you wont help me ill go alone  she made a step forward but faltered staggered and was obliged to lean against the mountain for support stains of travel were on her dress lines of fatigue and pain and traces of burning passionate tears were on her face her black hair flowed from beneath her gaudy bonnet and shamed out of his brutality rand placed his strong arm round her waist and half carrying half supporting her began the ascent her head dropped wearily on his shoulder her arm encircled his neck her hair as if caressingly lay across his breast and hands her grateful eyes were close to his her breath was upon his cheek and yet his only consciousness was of the possibly ludicrous figure he might present to his brother should he meet him with mornie nixon in his arms not a word was spoken by either till they reached the summit relieved at finding his brother still absent he turned not unkindly toward the helpless figure on his arm i dont see what makes ruth so late he said hes always here by sundown perhaps  perhaps he knows im here said mornie with a bitter laugh  i didnt say that said rand and i dont think it what i meant was he might have met a party that was picnicking here todaysol saunders and wife and miss euphemia  mornie flung his arm away from her with a passionate gesture they herepicnicking herethose people here  yes said rand unconsciously a little ashamed they came here accidentally  mornies quick passion had subsided she had sunk again wearily and helplessly on a rock beside him i suppose she said with a weak laughi suppose they talked of me i suppose they told you how with their lies and fair promises they tricked me out and set me before an audience of brutes and laughing hyenas to make merry over did they tell you of the insults that i receivedhow the sins of my parents were flung at me instead of bouquets did they tell you they could have spared me this but they wanted the few extra dollars taken in at the door no  they said nothing of the kind replied rand surlily  then you must have stopped them you were horrified enough to know that i had dared to take the only honest way left me to make a living i know you randolph pinkney youd rather see joaquin muriatta the mexican bandit standing before you tonight with a revolver than the helpless shamed miserable mornie nixon and you cant help yourself unless you throw me over the cliff perhaps youd better she said with a bitter laugh that faded from her lips as she leaned pale and breathless against the bowlder  ruth will tell you began rand  dn ruth  rand turned away  stop she said suddenly staggering to her feet im sickfor all i know dying god grant that it may be so but if you are a man you will help me to your cabinto some place where i can lie down now and be at rest im very very tired  she paused she would have fallen again but rand seeing more in her face than her voice interpreted to his sullen ears took her sullenly in his arms and carried her to the cabin her eyes glanced around the bright partycolored walls and a faint smile came to her lips as she put aside her bonnet adorned with a companion pinion of the bright wings that covered it  which is ruths bed she asked  rand pointed to it  lay me there  rand would have hesitated but with another look at her face complied  she lay quite still a moment presently she said give me some brandy or whiskey  rand was silent and confused  i forgot she added half bitterly i know you have not that commonest and cheapest of vices  she lay quite still again suddenly she raised herself partly on her elbow and in a strong firm voice said rand  yes mornie  if you are wise and practical as you assume to be you will do what i ask you without a question if you do it at once you may save yourself and ruth some trouble some mortification and perhaps some remorse and sorrow do you hear me  yes  go to the nearest doctor and bring him here with you  but you  her voice was strong confident steady and patient you can safely leave me until then  in another moment rand was plunging down the slide but it was past midnight when he struggled over the last bowlder up the ascent dragging the halfexhausted medical wisdom of browns ferry on his arm  ive been gone long doctor said rand feverishly and she looked so deathlike when i left if we should be too late  the doctor stopped suddenly lifted his head and pricked his ears like a hound on a peculiar scent we are too late he said with a slight professional laugh  indignant and horrified rand turned upon him  listen said the doctor lifting his hand  rand listened so intently that he heard the familiar moan of the river below but the great stony field lay silent before him and then borne across its bare barren bosom like its own articulation came faintly the feeble wail of a newborn babe   iii   storm   the doctor hurried ahead in the darkness rand who had stopped paralyzed at the ominous sound started forward again mechanically but as the cry arose again more distinctly and the full significance of the doctors words came to him he faltered stopped and with cheeks burning with shame and helpless indignation sank upon a stone beside the shaft and burying his face in his hands fairly gave way to a burst of boyish tears yet even then the recollection that he had not cried since years ago his mothers dying hands had joined his and ruths childish fingers together stung him fiercely and dried his tears in angry heat upon his cheeks  how long he sat there he remembered not what he thought he recalled not but the wildest and most extravagant plans and resolves availed him nothing in the face of this forever desecrated home and this shameful culmination of his ambitious life on the mountain once he thought of flight but the reflection that he would still abandon his brother to shame perhaps a selfcontented shame checked him hopelessly could he avert the future he must but how yet he could only sit and stare into the darkness in dumb abstraction  sitting there his eyes fell upon a peculiar object in a crevice of the ledge beside the shaft it was the tin pail containing his dinner which according to their custom it was the duty of the brother who staid above ground to prepare and place for the brother who worked below ruth must consequently have put it there before he left that morning and rand had overlooked it while sharing the repast of the strangers at noon at the sight of this dumb witness of their mutual cares and labors rand sighed half in brotherly sorrow half in a selfish sense of injury done him  he took up the pail mechanically removed its cover andstarted for on top of the carefully bestowed provisions lay a little note addressed to him in ruths peculiar scrawl  he opened it with feverish hands held it in the light of the peaceful moon and read as follows   dear dear brotherwhen you read this i shall be far away i go because i shall not stay to disgrace you and because the girl that i brought trouble upon has gone away too to hide her disgrace and mine and where she goes rand i ought to follow her and please god i will i am not as wise or as good as you are but it seems the best i can do and god bless you dear old randy boy times and times again ive wanted to tell you all and reckoned to do so but whether you was sitting before me in the cabin or working beside me in the drift i couldnt get to look upon your honest face dear brother and say what things id been keeping from you so long ill stay away until ive done what i ought to do and if you can say come ruth i will come but until you can say it the mountain is yours randy boy the mine is yours the cabin is yours all is yours rub out the old chalkmarks rand as i rub them out here in mya few words here were blurred and indistinct as if the moon had suddenly become dimeyed too god bless you brother  psyou know i mean mornie all the time its she im going to seek but dont you think so bad of her as you do i am so much worse than she i wanted to tell you that all along but i didnt dare shes run away from the ferry half crazy said she was going to sacramento and i am going there to find her alive or dead forgive me brother dont throw this down right away hold it in your hand a moment randy boy and try hard to think its my hand in yours and so goodby and god bless you old randy  from your loving brother  ruth   a deep sense of relief overpowered every other feeling in rands breast it was clear that ruth had not yet discovered the truth of mornies flight he was on his way to sacramento and before he could return mornie could be removed once despatched in some other direction with ruth once more returned and under his brothers guidance the separation could be made easy and final there was evidently no marriage as yet and now the fear of an immediate meeting over there should be none for rand had already feared this had recalled the few infelicitous relations legal and illegal which were common to the adjoining campthe flagrantly miserable life of the husband of a san francisco anonyma who lived in style at the ferry the shameful carousals and more shameful quarrels of the frenchman and mexican woman who kept house at the crossing the awful spectacle of the three halfbred indian children who played before the cabin of a fellow miner and townsman thank heaven the eagles nest on table mountain should never be pointed at from the valley as another  a heavy hand upon his arm brought him trembling to his feet he turned and met the halfanxious halfcontemptuous glance of the doctor  im sorry to disturb you he said dryly but its about time you or somebody else put in an appearance at that cabin luckily for her shes one woman in a thousand has had her wits about her better than some folks i know and has left me little to do but make her comfortable but shes gone through too muchfought her little fight too gallantlyis altogether too much of a trump to be played off upon now so rise up out of that young man pick up your scattered faculties and fetch a womansome sensible creature of her own sexto look after her for without wishing to be personal im dd if i trust her to the likes of you  there was no mistaking dr duchesne s voice and manner and rand was affected by it as most people were throughout the valley of the stanislaus but he turned upon him his frank and boyish face and said simply but i dont know any woman or where to get one  the doctor looked at him again well ill find you some one he said softening  thank you said rand  the doctor was disappearing with an effort rand recalled him one moment doctor he hesitated and his cheeks were glowing youll please say nothing about this down therehe pointed to the valleyfor a time and youll say to the woman you send  dr duchesne whose resolute lips were sealed upon the secrets of half tuolumne county interrupted him scornfully i cannot answer for the womanyou must talk to her yourself as for me generally i keep my professional visits to myself but he laid his hand on rands armif i find out youre putting on any airs to that poor creature if on my next visit her lips or her pulse tell me you havent been acting on the square to her ill drop a hint to drunken old nixon where his daughter is hidden i reckon she could stand his brutality better than yours goodnight  in another moment he was gone rand who had held back his quick tongue feeling himself in the power of this man once more alone sank on a rock and buried his face in his hands recalling himself in a moment he rose wiped his hot eyelids and staggered toward the cabin it was quite still now he paused on the topmost step and listened there was no sound from the ledge or the eagles nest that clung to it half timidly he descended the winding steps and paused before the door of the cabin mornie he said in a dry metallic voice whose only indication of the presence of sickness was in the lowness of its pitchmornie there was no reply mornie he repeated impatiently its merand if you want anything youre to call me i am just outside still no answer came from the silent cabin he pushed open the door gently hesitated and stepped over the threshold  a change in the interior of the cabin within the last few hours showed a new presence the guns shovels picks and blankets had disappeared the two chairs were drawn against the wall the table placed by the bedside the swinginglantern was shaded towards the bedthe object of rands attention on that bed his brothers bed lay a helpless woman pale from the long black hair that matted her damp forehead and clung to her hollow cheeks her face was turned to the wall so that the softened light fell upon her profile which to rand at that moment seemed even noble and strong but the next moment his eye fell upon the shoulder and arm that lay nearest to him and the little bundle swathed in flannel that it clasped to her breast his brow grew dark as he gazed the sleeping woman moved perhaps it was an instinctive consciousness of his presence perhaps it was only the current of cold air from the opened door but she shuddered slightly and still unconscious drew the child as if away from him and nearer to her breast the shamed blood rushed to rands face and saying half aloud im not going to take your precious babe away from you he turned in halfboyish pettishness away nevertheless he came back again shortly to the bedside and gazed upon them both she certainly did look altogether more ladylike and less aggressive lying there so still sickness that cheap refining process of some natures was not unbecoming to her but this bundle a boyish curiosity stronger than even his strong objection to the whole episode was steadily impelling him to lift the blanket from it i suppose shed waken if i did said rand but id like to know what right the doctor had to wrap it up in my best flannel shirt this fresh grievance the fruit of his curiosity sent him away again to meditate on the ledge after a few moments he returned again opened the cupboard at the foot of the bed softly took thence a piece of chalk and scrawled in large letters upon the door of the cupboard if you want anything sing out im just outsiderand this done he took a blanket and bearskin from the corner and walked to the door but here he paused looked back at the inscription evidently not satisfied with it returned took up the chalk added a line but rubbed it out again repeated this operation a few times until he produced the polite postscripthope youll be better soon then he retreated to the ledge spread the bearskin beside the door and rolling himself in a blanket lit his pipe for his nightlong vigil but rand although a martyr a philosopher and a moralist was young in less than ten minutes the pipe dropped from his lips and he was asleep   he awoke with a strange sense of heat and suffocation and with difficulty shook off his covering rubbing his eyes he discovered that an extra blanket had in some mysterious way been added in the night and beneath his head was a pillow he had no recollection of placing there when he went to sleep by degrees the events of the past night forced themselves upon his benumbed faculties and he sat up the sun was riding high the door of the cabin was open stretching himself he staggered to his feet and looked in through the yawning crack at the hinges he rubbed his eyes again was he still asleep and followed by a dream of yesterday for there even in the very attitude he remembered to have seen her sitting at her luncheon on the previous day with her knitting on her lap sat mrs sol saunders what did it mean or had she really been sitting there ever since and all the events that followed only a dream  a hand was laid upon his arm and turning he saw the murky black eyes and indianinked beard of sol beside him that gentleman put his finger on his lips with a theatrical gesture and then slowly retreating in the wellknown manner of the buried majesty of denmark waved him like another hamlet to a remoter part of the ledge this reached he grasped rand warmly by the hand shook it heartily and said its all right my boy all right  but began rand the hot blood flowed to his cheeks he stammered and stopped short  its all right i say dont you mind well pull you through  but mrs sol what does she  rosey has taken the matter in hand sir and when that woman takes a matter in hand whether its a baby or a rehearsal sir she makes it buzz  but how did she know stammered rand  how well sir the scene opened something like this said sol professionally curtain rises on me and mrs sol domestic

appealingly looking toward the cabin  hush it is said the actor goodnaturedly but its all right mr rand well pull you through  later in the morning rand learned that mornies illfated connection with the star variety troupe had been a source of anxiety to mrs sol and she had reproached herself for the girls infelicitous debut  but lord bless you mr rand said sol it was all in the way of business she came to uswas fresh and new her chance looking at it professionally was as good as any amateurs but what with her relations here and her bein known she didnt take we lost money on her its natural she should feel a little ugly we all do when we get sorter kicked back onto ourselves and find we cant stand alone why you wouldnt believe it he continued with a moist twinkle of his black eyes but the night i lost my little rosey of diphtheria in gold hill the child was down on the bills for a comic song and i had to drag mrs sol on cut up as she was and filled up with that much of old bourbon to keep her nerves stiff so she could do an old gag with me to gain time and make up the variety why sir when i came to the front i was ugly and when one of the boys in the front row sang out dont expose that poor child to the night air solmeaning mrs soli acted ugly no sir its human nature and it was quite natural that mornie when she caught sight o mrs sols face last night should rise up and cuss us both lord if shed only acted like that but the old lady got her quiet at last and as i said before its all right and well pull her through but dont you thank us its a little matter betwixt us and mornie weve got everything fixed so that mrs sol can stay right along well pull mornie through and get her away from this and her baby too as soon as we can you wont get mad if i tell you something said sol with a halfapologetic laugh mrs sol was rather down on you the other day hated you on sight and preferred your brother to you but when she found hed run off and left you youdont mind my sayina mere boy to take what oughter be his place why she just wheeled round agin him i suppose he got flustered and couldnt face the music never left a word of explanation well it wasnt exactly square though i tell the old woman its human nature he might have dropped a hint where he was goin well there i wont say a word more agin him i know how you feel hush it is  it was the firm conviction of the simpleminded sol that no one knew the various natural indications of human passion better than himself perhaps it was one of the fallacies of his profession that the expression of all human passion was limited to certain conventional signs and sounds consequently when rand colored violently became confused stammered and at last turned hastily away the goodhearted fellow instantly recognized the unfailing evidence of modesty and innocence embarrassed by recognition as for rand i fear his shame was only momentary confirmed in the belief of his ulterior wisdom and virtue his first embarrassment over he was not displeased with this halfway tribute and really believed that the time would come when mr sol should eventually praise his sagacity and reservation and acknowledge that he was something more than a mere boy he nevertheless shrank from meeting mornie that morning and was glad that the presence of mrs sol relieved him from that duty  the day passed uneventfully rand busied himself in his usual avocations and constructed a temporary shelter for himself and sol beside the shaft besides rudely shaping a few necessary articles of furniture for mrs sol  it will be a little spell yet afore mornies able to be moved suggested sol and you might as well be comfortable  rand sighed at this prospect yet presently forgot himself in the good humor of his companion whose admiration for himself he began to patronizingly admit there was no sense of degradation in accepting the friendship of this man who had traveled so far seen so much and yet as a practical man of the world rand felt was so inferior to himself the absence of miss euphemia who had early left the mountain was a source of odd halfdefinite relief indeed when he closed his eyes to rest that night it was with a sense that the reality of his situation was not as bad as he had feared once only the figure of his brotherhaggard weary and footsore on his hopeless quest wandering in lonely trails and lonelier settlementscame across his fancy but with it came the greater fear of his return and the pathetic figure was banished and besides hes in sacramento by this time and like as not forgotten us all he muttered and twining this poppy and mandragora around his pillow he fell asleep  his spirits had quite returned the next morning and once or twice he found himself singing while at work in the shaft the fear that ruth might return to the mountain before he could get rid of mornie and the slight anxiety that had grown upon him to know something of his brothers movements and to be able to govern them as he wished caused him to hit upon the plan of constructing an ingenious advertisement to be published in the san francisco journals wherein the missing ruth should be advised that news of his quest should be communicated to him by a friend through the same medium after an interval of two weeks full of this amiable intention he returned to the surface to dinner here to his momentary confusion he met miss euphemia who in absence of sol was assisting mrs sol in the details of the household  if the honest frankness with which that young lady greeted him was not enough to relieve his embarrassment he would have forgotten it in the utterly new and changed aspect she presented her extravagant walkingcostume of the previous day was replaced by some bright calico a little white apron and a broadbrimmed strawhat which seemed to rand in some odd fashion to restore her original girlish simplicity the change was certainly not unbecoming to her if her waist was not as tightly pinched a la mode there still was an honest youthful plumpness about it her step was freer for the absence of her highheel boots and even the hand she extended to rand if not quite so small as in her tight gloves and a little brown from exposure was magnetic in its strong kindly grasp there was perhaps a slight suggestion of the practical mr sol in her wholesome presence and rand could not help wondering if mrs sol had ever been a gold hill pet before her marriage with mr sol the young girl noticed his curious glance  you never saw me in my rehearsal dress before she said with a laugh but im not company today and didnt put on my best harness to knock round in i suppose i look dreadful  i dont think you look bad said rand simply  thank you said euphemia with a laugh and a courtesy but this isnt getting the dinner  as part of that operation evidently was the takingoff of her hat the puttingup of some thick blond locks that had escaped and the rollingup of her sleeves over a pair of strong rounded arms rand lingered near her all trace of the pets previous professional coquetry was goneperhaps it was only replaced by a more natural one but as she looked up and caught sight of rands interested face she laughed again and colored a little slight as was the blush it was sufficient to kindle a sympathetic fire in rands own cheeks which was so utterly unexpected to him that he turned on his heel in confusion i reckon she thinks im soft and silly like ruth he soliloquized and determining not to look at her again betook himself to a distant and contemplative pipe in vain did miss euphemia address herself to the ostentatious getting of the dinner in full view of him in vain did she bring the coffeepot away from the fire and nearer rand with the apparent intention of examining its contents in a better light in vain while wiping a plate did she absorbed in the distant prospect walk to the verge of the mountain and become statuesque and forgetful the sulky young gentleman took no outward notice of her  mrs sols attendance upon mornie prevented her leaving the cabin and rand and miss euphemia dined in the open air alone the ridiculousness of keeping up a formal attitude to his solitary companion caused rand to relax but to his astonishment the pet seemed to have become correspondingly distant and formal after a few moments of discomfort rand who had eaten little arose and believed he would go back to work  ah yes said the pet with an indifferent air i suppose you must well goodby mr pinkney  rand turned you are not going he asked in some uneasiness  ive got some work to do too returned miss euphemia a little curtly  but said the practical rand i thought you allowed that you were fixed to stay until tomorrow  but here miss euphemia with rising color and slight acerbity of voice was not aware that she was fixed to stay anywhere least of all when she was in the way more than that she must sayalthough perhaps it made no difference and she ought not to say itthat she was not in the habit of intruding upon gentlemen who plainly gave her to understand that her company was not desirable she did not know why she said thisof course it could make no difference to anybody who didnt of course carebut she only wanted to say that she only came here because her dear friend her adopted motherand a better woman never breathedhad come and had asked her to stay of course mrs sol was an intruder herselfmr sol was an intruderthey were all intruders she only wondered that mr pinkney had borne with them so long she knew it was an awful thing to be here taking care of a poorpoor helpless woman but perhaps mr rands brother might forgive them if he couldnt but no matter she would gomr sol would goall would go and then perhaps mr rand  she stopped breathless she stopped with the corner of her apron against her tearful hazel eyes she stopped withwhat was more remarkable than allrands arm actually around her waist and his astonished alarmed face within a few inches of her own  why miss euphemia phemie my dear girl i never meant anything like that said rand earnestly i really didnt now come now  you never once spoke to me when i sat down said miss euphemia feebly endeavoring to withdraw from rands grasp  i really didnt oh come now look here i didnt dont theres a dearthere  this last conclusive exposition was a kiss miss euphemia was not quick enough to release herself from his arms he anticipated that act a full halfsecond and had dropped his own pale and breathless  the girl recovered herself first there i declare im forgetting mrs sols coffee she exclaimed hastily and snatching up the coffeepot disappeared when she returned rand was gone miss euphemia busied herself demurely in clearing up the dishes with the tail of her eye sweeping the horizon of the summit level around her but no rand appeared presently she began to laugh quietly to herself this occurred several times during her occupation which was somewhat prolonged the result of this meditative hilarity was summed up in a somewhat grave and thoughtful deduction as she walked slowly back to the cabin i do believe im the first woman that that boy ever kissed  miss euphemia staid that day and the next and rand forgot his embarrassment by what means i know not miss euphemia managed to restore rands confidence in himself and in her and in a little ramble on the mountainside got him to relate albeit somewhat reluctantly the particulars of his rescue of mornie from her dangerous position on the broken trail  and if you hadnt got there as soon as you did shed have fallen asked the pet  i reckon returned rand gloomily she was sorter dazed and crazed like  and you saved her life  i suppose so if you put it that way said rand sulkily  but how did you get her up the mountain again  oh i got her up returned rand moodily  but how really mr rand you dont know how interesting this is its as good as a play said the pet with a little excited laugh  oh i carried her up  in your arms  yees  miss euphemia paused and bit off the stalk of a flower made a wry face and threw it away from her in disgust  then she dug a few tiny holes in the earth with her parasol and buried bits of the flowerstalk in them as if they had been tender memories i suppose you knew mornie very well she asked  i used to run across her in the woods responded rand shortly a year ago i didnt know her so well then as he stopped  as what as now asked the pet abruptly rand who was coloring over his narrow escape from a topic which a delicate kindness of sol had excluded from their intercourse on the mountain stammered as you do i meant  the pet tossed her head a little oh i dont know her at allexcept through sol  rand stared hard at this the pet who was looking at him intently said show me the place where you saw mornie clinging that night  its dangerous suggested rand  you mean id be afraid try me i dont believe she was so dreadfully frightened  why asked rand in astonishment  ohbecause  rand sat down in vague wonderment  show it to me continued the pet orill find it alone  thus challenged he rose and after a few moments climbing stood with her upon the trail you see that thornbush where the rock has fallen away it was just there it is not safe to go farther no really miss euphemia please dont its almost certain death  but the giddy girl had darted past him and face to the wall of the cliff was creeping along the dangerous path rand followed mechanically once or twice the trail crumbled beneath her feet but she clung to a projecting root of chaparral and laughed she had almost reached her elected goal when slipping the treacherous chaparral she clung to yielded in her grasp and rand with a cry sprung forward  but the next instant she quickly transferred her hold to a cleft in the cliff and was safe not so her companion the soil beneath him loosened by the impulse of his spring slipped away he was falling with it when she caught him sharply with her disengaged hand and together they scrambled to a more secure footing  i could have reached it alone said the pet if youd left me alone  thank heaven were saved said rand gravely  and without a rope said miss euphemia significantly  rand did not understand her but as they slowly returned to the summit he stammered out the always difficult thanks of a man who has been physically helped by one of the weaker sex miss euphemia was quick to see her error  i might have made you lose your footing by catching at you she said meekly but i was so frightened for you and could not help it  the superior animal thoroughly bamboozled thereupon complimented her on her dexterity  oh thats nothing she said with a sigh i used to do the flyingtrapeze business with papa when i was a child and ive not forgotten it with this and other confidences of her early life in which rand betrayed considerable interest they beguiled the tedious ascent i ought to have made you carry me up said the lady with a little laugh when they reached the summit but you havent known me as long as you have mornie have you with this mysterious speech she bade rand goodnight and hurried off to the cabin  and so a week passed bythe week so dreaded by rand yet passed so pleasantly that at times it seemed as if that dread were only a trick of his fancy or as if the circumstances that surrounded him were different from what he believed them to be on the seventh day the doctor had staid longer than usual and rand who had been sitting with euphemia on the ledge by the shaft watching the sunset had barely time to withdraw his hand from hers as mrs sol a trifle pale and weariedlooking approached him  i dont like to trouble you she saidindeed they had seldom troubled him with the details of mornies convalescence or even her needs and requirementsbut the doctor is alarmed about mornie and she has asked to see you i think youd better go in and speak to her you know continued mrs sol delicately you havent been in there since the night she was taken sick and maybe a new face might do her good  the guilty blood flew to rands face as he stammered i thought id be in the way i didnt believe she cared much to see me is she worse  the doctor is looking very anxious said mrs sol simply  the blood returned from rands face and settled around his heart he turned very pale he had consoled himself always for his complicity in ruths absence that he was taking good care of mornie orwhat is considered by most selfish natures an equivalentpermitting or encouraging some one else to take good care of her but here was a contingency utterly unforeseen it did not occur to him that this taking good care of her could result in anything but a perfect solution of her troubles or that there could be any future to her condition but one of recovery but what if she should die a sudden and helpless sense of his responsibility to ruth to her brought him trembling to his feet  he hurried to the cabin where mrs sol left him with a word of caution youll find her changed and quietvery quiet if i was you i wouldnt say anything to bring back her old self  the change which rand saw was so great the face that was turned to him so quiet that with a new fear upon him he would have preferred the savage eyes and reckless mien of the old mornie whom he hated with his habitual impulsiveness he tried to say something that should express that fact not unkindly but faltered and awkwardly sank into the chair by her bedside  i dont wonder you stare at me now she said in a faroff voice it seems to you strange to see me lying here so quiet you are thinking how wild i was when i came here that night i must have been crazy i think i dreamed that i said dreadful things to you but you must forgive me and not mind it i was crazy then she stopped and folded the blanket between her thin fingers i didnt ask you to come here to tell you that or to remind you of it butbut when i was crazy i said so many worse dreadful things of him and youyou will be left behind to tell him of it  rand was vaguely murmuring something to the effect that he knew she didnt mean anything that she musnt think of it again that hed forgotten all about it when she stopped him with a tired gesture  perhaps i was wrong to think that after i am gone you would care to tell him anything perhaps im wrong to think of it at all or to care what he will think of me except for the sake of the childhis child randthat i must leave behind me he will know that it never abused him no god bless its sweet heart it never was wild and wicked and hateful like its cruel crazy mother and he will love it and you perhaps will love it toojust a little rand look at it she tried to raise the helpless bundle beside her in her arms but failed you must lean over she said faintly to rand it looks like him doesnt it  rand with wondering embarrassed eyes tried to see some resemblance in the little bluered oval to the sad wistful face of his brother which even then was haunting him from some mysterious distance he kissed the childs forehead but even then so vaguely and perfunctorily that the mother sighed and drew it closer to her breast  the doctor says she continued in a calmer voice that im not doing as well as i ought to i dont think she faltered with something of her old bitter laugh that im ever doing as well as i ought to and perhaps its not strange now that i dont and he says that in case anything happens to me i ought to look ahead i have looked ahead its a dark look ahead randa horror of blackness without kind faces without the baby withoutwithout him  she turned her face away and laid it on the bundle by her side it was so quiet in the cabin that through the open door beyond the faint rhythmical moan of the pines below was distinctly heard  i know its foolish but that is what looking ahead always meant to me she said with a sigh but since the doctor has been gone ive talked to mrs sol and find its for the best and i look ahead and see more clearly i look ahead and see my disgrace removed far away from him and you i look ahead and see you and he living together happily as you did before i came between you i look ahead and see my past life forgotten my faults forgiven and i think i see you both loving my baby and perhaps loving me a little for its sake thank you rand thank you  for rands hand had caught hers beside the pillow and he was standing over her whiter than she something in the pressure of his hand emboldened her to go on and even lent a certain strength to her voice  when it comes to that rand youll not let these people take the baby away youll keep it here with you until he comes and something tells me that he will come when i am gone youll keep it here in the pure air and sunlight of the mountain and out of those wicked depths below and when i am gone and they are gone and only you and ruth and baby are here maybe youll think that it came to you in a cloud on the mountaina cloud that lingered only long enough to drop its burden and faded leaving the sunlight and dew behind what is it rand what are you looking at  i was thinking said rand in a strange altered voice that i must trouble you to let me take down those duds and furbelows that hang on the wall so that i can get at some traps of mine behind them he took some articles from the wall replaced the dresses of mrs sol and answered mornies look of inquiry  i was only getting at my purse and my revolver he said showing them ive got to get some stores at the ferry by daylight  mornie sighed im giving you great trouble rand i know but it wont be for long  he muttered something took her hand again and bade her goodnight when he reached the door he looked back the light was shining full upon her face as she lay there with her babe on her breast bravely looking ahead   iv   the clouds pass   it was early morning at the ferry the up coach had passed with lights unextinguished and the outsides still asleep the ferryman had gone up to the ferry mansion house swinging his lantern and had found the sleepylooking all night barkeeper on the point of withdrawing for the day on a mattress under the bar an indian halfbreed porter of the mansion house was washing out the stains of recent nocturnal dissipation from the barroom and veranda a few birds were twittering on the cottonwoods beside the river a bolder few had alighted upon the veranda and were trying to reconcile the existence of so much lemonpeel and cigarstumps with their ideas of a beneficent creator a faint earthly freshness and perfume rose along the river banks deep shadow still lay upon the opposite shore but in the distance four miles away morning along the level crest of table mountain walked with rosy tread  the sleepy barkeeper was that morning doomed to disappointment for scarcely had the coach passed when steps were heard upon the veranda and a weary dusty traveller threw his blanket and knapsack to the porter and then dropped into a vacant armchair with his eyes fixed on the distant crest of table mountain he remained motionless for some time until the barkeeper who had already concocted the conventional welcome of the mansion house appeared with it in a glass put it upon the table glanced at the stranger and then thoroughly awake cried out  ruth pinkneyor im a chinaman  the stranger lifted his eyes wearily hollow circles were around their orbits haggard lines were in his checks but it was ruth  he took the glass and drained it at a single draught yes he said absently ruth pinkney and fixed his eyes again on the distant rosy crest  on your way up home suggested the barkeeper following the direction of ruths eyes  perhaps  been upon a pasear haint yer been havin a little tear round sacramentoseein the sights  ruth smiled bitterly yes  the barkeeper lingered ostentatiously wiping a glass but ruth again became abstracted in the mountain and the barkeeper turned away  how pure and clear that summit looked to him how restful and steadfast with serenity and calm how unlike his own feverish dusty travelworn self a week had elapsed since he had last looked upon ita week of disappointment of anxious fears of doubts of wild imaginings of utter helplessness in his hopeless quest of the missing mornie he had in fancy seen this serene eminence haunting his remorseful passionstricken soul and now without a clew to guide him to her unknown hidingplace he was back again to face the brother whom he had deceived with only the confession of his own weakness hard as it was to lose forever the fierce reproachful glances of the woman he loved it was still harder to a man of ruths temperament to look again upon the face of the brother he feared a hand laid upon his shoulder startled him it was the barkeeper  if its a fair question ruth pinkney id like to ask ye how long ye kalkilate to hang around the ferry today  why demanded ruth haughtily  because whatever youve been and done i want ye to have a square show ole nixon has been cavoortin round yer the last two days swearin to kill you on sight for runnin off with his darter sabe now let me ax ye two questions first are you heeled  ruth responded to this dialectical inquiry affirmatively by putting his hand on his revolver  good now second have you got the gal along here with you  no responded ruth in a hollow voice  thats better yet said the man without heeding the tone of the reply a womanand especially the woman in a row of this kindhandicaps a man awful he paused and took up the empty glass look yer ruth pinkney im a square man and ill be square with you so ill just tell you youve got the demdest odds agin ye praps ye know it and dont keer well the boys around yer are all sidin with the old man nixon its the first time the old rip ever had a hand in his favor so the boys will see fair play for nixon and agin you but i reckon you dont mind him  so little i shall never pull trigger on him said ruth gravely  the barkeeper stared and rubbed his chin thoughtfully well thars that kanaka joe who used to be sorter sweet on morniehes an ugly devilhes helpin the old man  the sad look faded from ruths eyes suddenly a certain wild berserker ragea taint of the blood inherited from heaven knows what oldworld ancestry which had made the twinbrothers southwestern eccentricities respected in the settlementglowed in its place the barkeeper noted it and augured a lively future for the days festivities but it faded again and ruth as he rose turned hesitatingly towards him  have you seen my brother rand lately  nary  he hasnt been here or about the ferry  nary time  you havent heard said ruth with a faint attempt at a smile if hes been around here asking after mesorter looking me up you know  not much returned the barkeeper deliberately ez far ez i know randthat ar brother o yourshes one of yer hightoned chaps ez doesnt drink thinks barrooms is pizen and aint the sort to come round yer and sling yarns with me  ruth rose but the hand that he placed upon the table albeit a powerful one trembled so that it was with difficulty he resumed his knapsack when he did so his bent figure stooping shoulders and haggard face made him appear another man from the one who had sat down there was a slight touch of apologetic deference and humility in his manner as he paid his reckoning and slowly and hesitatingly began to descend the steps  the barkeeper looked after him thoughtfully well dog my skin he ejaculated to himself ef i hadnt seen that manthat same ruth pinkneystraddle a friends body in this yer very room and dare a whole crowd to come on id swar that he hadnt any grit in him thars something up  but here ruth reached the last step and turned again  if you see old man nixon say im in town if you see that   i regret to say that i cannot repeat his exact and brief characterization of the present condition and natal antecedents of kanaka joe say im looking out for him and was gone  he wandered down the road towards the one long straggling street of the settlement the few people who met him at that early hour greeted him with a kind of constrained civility certain cautious souls hurried by without seeing him all turned and looked after him and a few followed him at a respectful distance a somewhat notorious practical joker and recognized wag at the ferry apparently awaited his coming with something of invitation and expectation but catching sight of ruths haggard face and blazing eyes became instantly practical and by no means jocular in his greeting at the top of the hill ruth turned to look once more upon the distant mountain now again a mere cloudline on the horizon in the firm belief that he would never again see the sun rise upon it he turned aside into a hazelthicket and tearing out a few leaves from his pocketbook wrote two lettersone to rand and one to mornie but which as they were never delivered shall not burden this brief chronicle of that eventful day for while transcribing them he was startled by the sounds of a dozen pistolshots in the direction of the hotel he had recently quitted something in the mere sound provoked the old hereditary fighting instinct and sent him to his feet with a bound and a slight distension of the nostrils and sniffing of the air not unknown to certain men who become half intoxicated by the smell of powder he quickly folded his letters and addressed them carefully and taking off his knapsack and blanket methodically arranged them under a tree with the letters on top then he examined the lock of his revolver and then with the step of a man ten years younger leaped into the road he had scarcely done so when he was seized and by sheer force dragged into a blacksmiths shop at the roadside he turned his savage face and drawn weapon upon his assailant but was surprised to meet the anxious eyes of the barkeeper of the mansion house  dont be a dd fool said the man quickly thars fifty agin you down thar but why in hll didnt you wipe out old nixon when you had such a good chance  wipe out old nixon repeated ruth  yes just now when you had him covered  what  the barkeeper turned quickly upon ruth stared at him and then suddenly burst into a fit of laughter well ive knowed you two were twins but damn me if i ever thought id be sold like this and he again burst into a roar of laughter  what do you mean demanded ruth savagely  what do i mean returned the barkeeper why i mean this i mean that your brother rand as you call him hez binfor a young feller and a pious fellerdoin about the tallest kind o fightin today thats been done at the ferry he laid out that ar kanaka joe and two of his chums he was pitched into on your quarrel and he took it up for you like a little man i managed to drag him off up yer in the hazelbush for safety and out you pops and i thought you was him he cant be far away halloo there theyre comin and thars the doctor trying to keep them back  a crowd of angry excited faces filled the road suddenly but before them dr duchesne mounted and with a pistol in his hand opposed their further progress  back in the bush whispered the barkeeper nows your time  but ruth stirred not go you back he said in a low voice find rand and take him away i will fill his place here he drew his revolver and stepped into the road  a shout a report and the spatter of red dust from a bullet near his feet told him he was recognized he stirred not but another shout and a cry there they areboth of em made him turn  his brother rand with a smile on his lip and fire in his eye stood by his side neither spoke then rand quietly as of old slipped his hand into his brothers strong palm two or three bullets sang by them a splinter flew from the blacksmiths shed but the brothers hard gripping each others hands and looking into each others faces with a quiet joy stood there calm and imperturbable  there was a momentary pause the voice of dr duchesne rose above the crowd  keep back i say keep back or hear mefor five years ive worked among you and mended and patched the holes youve drilled through each others carcasseskeep back i sayor the next man that pulls trigger or steps forward will get a hole from me that no surgeon can stop im sick of your bungling ball practice keep backor by the living jingo ill show you where a mans vitals are  there was a burst of laughter from the crowd and for a moment the twins were forgotten in this audacious speech and coolly impertinent presence  thats right now let that infernal old hypocritical drunkard mat nixon step to the front  the crowd parted right and left and half pushed half dragged nixon before him  gentlemen said the doctor this is the man who has just shot at rand pinkney for hiding his daughter now i tell you gentlemen and i tell him that for the last week his daughter mornie nixon has been under my care as a patient and my protection as a friend if theres anybody to be shot the job must begin with me  there was another laugh and a cry of bully for old sawbones ruth started convulsively and rand answered his look with a confirming pressure of his hand  that isnt all gentlemen this drunken brute has just shot at a gentleman whose only offence to my knowledge is that he has for the last week treated her with a brothers kindness has taken her into his own home and cared for her wants as if she were his own sister  ruths hand again grasped his brothers rand colored and hung his head  theres more yet gentlemen i tell you that that girl mornie nixon has to my knowledge been treated like a lady has been cared for as she never was cared for in her fathers house and while that father has been proclaiming her shame in every barroom at the ferry has had the sympathy and care night and day of two of the most accomplished ladies of the ferrymrs sol saunders gentlemen and miss euphemia  there was a shout of approbation from the crowd nixon would have slipped away but the doctor stopped him  not yet ive one thing more to say ive to tell you gentlemen on my professional word of honor that besides being an old hypocrite this same old mat nixon is the ungrateful unnatural grandfather of the first boy born in the district  a wild huzza greeted the doctors climax by a common consent the crowd turned toward the twins who grasping each others hands stood apart the doctor nodded his head the next moment the twins were surrounded and lifted in the arms of the laughing throng and borne in triumph to the barroom of the mansion house  gentlemen said the barkeeper call for what you like the mansion house treats today in honor of its being the first time that rand pinkney has been admitted to the bar    it was agreed that as her condition was still precarious the news should be broken to her gradually and indirectly the indefatigable sol had a professional idea which was not displeasing to the twins it being a lovely summer afternoon the couch of mornie was lifted out on the ledge and she lay there basking in the sunlight drinking in the pure air and looking bravely ahead in the daylight as she had in the darkness for her couch commanded a view of the mountain flank and lying there she dreamed a pleasant dream and in her dream saw rand returning up the mountaintrail she was half conscious that he had good news for her and when he at last reached her bedside he began gently and kindly to tell his news but she heard him not or rather in her dream was most occupied with his ways and manners which seemed unlike him yet inexpressibly sweet and tender the tears were fast coming in her eyes when he suddenly dropped on his knees beside her threw away rands disguising hat and coat and clasped her in his arms and by that she knew it was ruth  but what they said what hurried words of mutual explanation and forgiveness passed between them what bitter yet tender recollections of hidden fears and doubts now forever chased away in the rain of tears and joyous sunshine of that mountaintop were then whispered whatever of this little chronicle that to the reader seems strange and inconsistent as all human record must ever be strange and imperfect except to the actors was then made clearwas never divulged by them and must remain with them forever the rest of the party had withdrawn and they were alone but when mornie turned and placed the baby in its fathers arms they were so isolated in their happiness that the lower world beneath them might have swung and drifted away and left that mountaintop the beginning and creation of a better planet    you know all about it now said sol the next day explaining the previous episodes of this history to ruth youve got the whole plot before you it dragged a little in the second act for the actors werent up in their parts but for an amateur performance on the whole it wasnt bad  i dont know im sure said rand impulsively how wed have got on without euphemia its too bad she couldnt be here today  she wanted to come said sol but the gentleman shes engaged to came up from marysville last night  gentlemanengaged repeated rand white and red by turns  well yes i say gentleman although hes in the variety profession she always said said sol quietly looking at rand that shed never marry out of it     an heiress of red dog   the first intimation given of the eccentricity of the testator was i think in the spring of 1854 he was at that time in possession of a considerable property heavily mortgaged to one friend and a wife of some attraction on whose affections another friend held an encumbering lien one day it was found that he had secretly dug or caused to be dug a deep trap before the frontdoor of his dwelling into which a few friends in the course of the evening casually and familiarly dropped this circumstance slight in itself seemed to point to the existence of a certain humor in the man which might eventually get into literature although his wifes lovera man of quick discernment whose leg was broken by the falltook other views it was some weeks later that while dining with certain other friends of his wife he excused himself from the table to quietly reappear at the frontwindow with a threequarter inch hydraulic pipe and a stream of water projected at the assembled company an attempt was made to take public cognizance of this but a majority of the citizens of red dog who were not at dinner decided that a man had a right to choose his own methods of diverting his company nevertheless there were some hints of his insanity his wife recalled other acts clearly attributable to dementia the crippled lover argued from his own experience that the integrity of her limbs could only be secured by leaving her husbands house and the mortgagee fearing a further damage to his property foreclosed but here the cause of all this anxiety took matters into his own hands and disappeared  when we next heard from him he had in some mysterious way been relieved alike of his wife and property and was living alone at rockville fifty miles away and editing a newspaper but that originality he had displayed when dealing with the problems of his own private life when applied to politics in the columns of the rockville vanguard was singularly unsuccessful an amusing exaggeration purporting to be an exact account of the manner in which the opposing candidate had murdered his chinese laundryman was i regret to say answered only by assault and battery a gratuitous and purely imaginative description of a great religious revival in calaveras in which the sheriff of the countya notoriously profane scepticwas alleged to have been the chief exhorter resulted only in the withdrawal of the county advertising from the paper in the midst of this practical confusion he suddenly died it was then discovered as a crowning proof of his absurdity that he had left a will bequeathing his entire effects to a frecklefaced maidservant at the rockville hotel but that absurdity became serious when it was also discovered that among these effects were a thousand shares in the rising sun mining company which a day or two after his demise and while people were still laughing at his grotesque benefaction suddenly sprang into opulence and celebrity three millions of dollars was roughly estimated as the value of the estate thus wantonly sacrificed for it is only fair to state as a just tribute to the enterprise and energy of that young and thriving settlement that there was not probably a single citizen who did not feel himself better able to control the deceased humorists property some had expressed a doubt of their ability to support a family others had felt perhaps too keenly the deep responsibility resting upon them when chosen from the panel as jurors and had evaded their public duties a few had declined office and a low salary but no one shrank from the possibility of having been called upon to assume the functions of peggy moffat the heiress  the will was contestedfirst by the widow who it now appeared had never been legally divorced from the deceased next by four of his cousins who awoke only too late to a consciousness of his moral and pecuniary worth but the humble legateea singularly plain unpretending uneducated western girlexhibited a dogged pertinacity in claiming her rights she rejected all compromises a rough sense of justice in the community while doubting her ability to take care of the whole fortune suggested that she ought to be content with three hundred thousand dollars shes bound to throw even that away on some derned skunk of a man natoorally but three millions is too much to give a chap for makin her onhappy its offerin a temptation to cussedness the only opposing voice to this counsel came from the sardonic lips of mr jack hamlin suppose suggested that gentleman turning abruptly on the speakersuppose when you won twenty thousand dollars of me last friday nightsuppose that instead of handing you over the money as i didsuppose id got up on my hindlegs and said look yer bill wethersbee youre a dd fool if i give ye that twenty thousand youll throw it away in the first skingame in frisco and hand it over to the first shortcard sharp youll meet theres a thousandenough for you to fling awaytake it and get suppose what id said to you was the frozen truth and you knowd it would that have been the square thing to play on you but here wethersbee quickly pointed out the inefficiency of the comparison by stating that he had won the money fairly with a stake and how do you know demanded hamlin savagely bending his black eyes on the astounded casuisthow do you know that the gal heznt put down a stake the man stammered an unintelligible reply the gambler laid his white hand on wethersbees shoulder look yer old man he said every gal stakes her whole pileyou can bet your life on thatwhatevers her little game if she took to keerds instead of her feelings if shed put up chips instead o body and soul shed bust every bank twixt this and frisco you hear me  somewhat of this idea was conveyed i fear not quite as sentimentally to peggy moffat herself the best legal wisdom of san francisco retained by the widow and relatives took occasion in a private interview with peggy to point out that she stood in the quasicriminal attitude of having unlawfully practised upon the affections of an insane elderly gentleman with a view of getting possession of his property and suggested to her that no vestige of her moral character would remain after the trial if she persisted in forcing her claims to that issue it is said that peggy on hearing this stopped washing the plate she had in her hands and twisting the towel around her fingers fixed her small pale blue eyes at the lawyer  and ez that the kind o chirpin these critters keep up  i regret to say my dear young lady responded the lawyer that the world is censorious i must add he continued with engaging frankness that we professional lawyers are apt to study the opinion of the world and that such will be the theory ofour side  then said peggy stoutly ez i allow ive got to go into court to defend my character i might as well pack in them three millions too  there is hearsay evidence that peg added to this speech a wish and desire to bust the crust of her traducers and remarking that that was the kind of hairpin she was closed the conversation with an unfortunate accident to the plate that left a severe contusion on the legal brow of her companion but this story popular in the barrooms and gulches lacked confirmation in higher circles better authenticated was the legend related of an interview with her own lawyer that gentleman had pointed out to her the advantage of being able to show some reasonable cause for the singular generosity of the testator  although he continued the law does not go back of the will for reason or cause for its provisions it would be a strong point with the judge and juryparticularly if the theory of insanity were set upfor us to show that the act was logical and natural of course you havei speak confidently miss moffatcertain ideas of your own why the late mr byways was so singularly generous to you  no i havent said peg decidedly  think again had he not expressed to youyou understand that this is confidential between us although i protest my dear young lady that i see no reason why it should not be made publichad he not given utterance to sentiments of a nature consistent with some future matrimonial relations but here miss pegs large mouth which had been slowly relaxing over her irregular teeth stopped him  if you mean he wanted to marry meno  i see but were there any conditionsof course you know the law takes no cognizance of any not expressed in the will but still for the sake of mere corroboration of the bequestdo you know of any conditions on which he gave you the property  you mean did he want anything in return  exactly my dear young lady  pegs face on one side turned a deep magenta color on the other a lighter cherry while her nose was purple and her forehead an indian red to add to the effect of this awkward and discomposing dramatic exhibition of embarrassment she began to wipe her hands on her dress and sat silent  i understand said the lawyer hastily no matterthe conditions were fulfilled  no said peg amazedly how could they be until he was dead  it was the lawyers turn to color and grow embarrassed  he did say something and make some conditions continued peg with a certain firmness through her awkwardness but thats nobodys business but mine and hisn and its no call o yours or theirs  but my dear miss moffat if these very conditions were proofs of his right mind you surely would not object to make them known if only to enable you to put yourself in a condition to carry them out  but said peg cunningly spose you and the court didnt think em satisfactory spose you thought em queer eh  with this helpless limitation on the part of the defence the case came to trial everybody remembers ithow for six weeks it was the daily food of calaveras county how for six weeks the intellectual and moral and spiritual competency of mr james byways to dispose of his property was discussed with learned and formal obscurity in the court and with unlettered and independent prejudice by campfires and in barrooms at the end of that time when it was logically established that at least ninetenths of the population of calaveras were harmless lunatics and everybody elses reason seemed to totter on its throne an exhausted jury succumbed one day to the presence of peg in the courtroom it was not a prepossessing presence at any time but the excitement and an injudicious attempt to ornament herself brought her defects into a glaring relief that was almost unreal every freckle on her face stood out and asserted itself singly her pale blue eyes that gave no indication of her force of character were weak and wandering or stared blankly at the judge her oversized head broad at the base terminating in the scantiest possible lightcolored braid in the middle of her narrow shoulders was as hard and uninteresting as the wooden spheres that topped the railing against which she sat  the jury who for six weeks had had her described to them by the plaintiffs as an arch wily enchantress who had sapped the failing reason of jim byways revolted to a man there was something so appallingly gratuitous in her plainness that it was felt that three millions was scarcely a compensation for it ef that money was give to her she earned it sure boys it wasnt no softness of the old man said the foreman when the jury retired it was felt that she had cleared her character when they reentered the room with their verdict it was known that she had been awarded three millions damages for its defamation  she got the money but those who had confidently expected to see her squander it were disappointed on the contrary it was presently whispered that she was exceedingly penurious that admirable woman mrs stiver of red dog who accompanied her to san francisco to assist her in making purchases was loud in her indignation she cares more for two bits than i do for five dollars she wouldnt buy anything at the city of paris because it was too expensive and at last rigged herself out a perfect guy at some cheap slopshops in market street and after all the care jane and me took of her giving up our time and experience to her she never so much as made jane a single present popular opinion which regarded mrs stivers attention as purely speculative was not shocked at this unprofitable denouement but when peg refused to give anything to clear the mortgage off the new presbyterian church and even declined to take shares in the union ditch considered by many as an equally sacred and safe investment she began to lose favor nevertheless she seemed to be as regardless of public opinion as she had been before the trial took a small house in which she lived with an old woman who had once been a fellowservant on apparently terms of perfect equality and looked after her money i wish i could say that she did this discreetly but the fact is she blundered the same dogged persistency she had displayed in claiming her rights was visible in her unsuccessful ventures she sunk two hundred thousand dollars in a wornout shaft originally projected by the deceased testator she prolonged the miserable existence of the rockville vanguard long after it had ceased to interest even its enemies she kept the doors of the rockville hotel open when its custom had departed she lost the cooperation and favor of a fellowcapitalist through a trifling misunderstanding in which she was derelict and impenitent she had three lawsuits on her hands that could have been settled for a trifle i note these defects to show that she was by no means a heroine i quote her affair with jack folinsbee to show she was scarcely the average woman  that handsome graceless vagabond had struck the outskirts of red dog in a cyclone of dissipation which left him a stranded but still rather interesting wreck in a ruinous cabin not far from peg moffats virgin bower pale crippled from excesses with a voice quite tremulous from sympathetic emotion more or less developed by stimulants he lingered languidly with much time on his hands and only a few neighbors in this fascinating kind of general deshabille of morals dress and the emotions he appeared before peg moffat more than that he occasionally limped with her through the settlement the critical eye of red dog took in the singular pairjack voluble suffering apparently overcome by remorse conscience vituperation and disease and peg openmouthed highcolored awkward yet delighted and the critical eye of red dog seeing this winked meaningly at rockville no one knew what passed between them but all observed that one summer day jack drove down the main street of red dog in an open buggy with the heiress of that town beside him jack albeit a trifle shaky held the reins with something of his old dash and mistress peggy in an enormous bonnet with pearlcolored ribbons a shade darker than her hair holding in her short pinkgloved fingers a bouquet of yellow roses absolutely glowed crimson in distressful gratification over the dashboard so these two fared on out of the busy settlement into the woods against the rosy sunset possibly it was not a pretty picture nevertheless as the dim aisles of the solemn pines opened to receive them miners leaned upon their spades and mechanics stopped in their toil to look after them the critical eye of red dog perhaps from the sun perhaps from the fact that it had itself once been young and dissipated took on a kindly moisture as it gazed  the moon was high when they returned those who had waited to congratulate jack on this near prospect of a favorable change in his fortunes were chagrined to find that having seen the lady safe home he had himself departed from red dog nothing was to be gained from peg who on the next day and ensuing days kept the even tenor of her way sunk a thousand or two more in unsuccessful speculation and made no change in her habits of personal economy weeks passed without any apparent sequel to this romantic idyl nothing was known definitely until jack a month later turned up in sacramento with a billiardcue in his hand and a heart overcharged with indignant emotion i dont mind saying to you gentlemen in confidence said jack to a circle of sympathizing playersi dont mind telling you regarding this thing that i was as soft on that freckledfaced redeyed tallowhaired gal as if shed beenaaan actress and i dont mind saying gentlemen that as far as i understand women she was just as soft on me you kin laugh but its so one day i took her out buggyridingin style tooand out on the road i offered to do the square thing just as if shed been a ladyoffered to marry her then and there and what did she do said jack with a hysterical laugh why blank it all offered me twentyfive dollars a week allowancepay to be stopped when i wasnt at home the roar of laughter that greeted this frank confession was broken by a quiet voice asking and what did you saysay screamed jack i just told her to go to  with her moneythey say continued the quiet voice that you asked her for the loan of two hundred and fifty dollars to get you to sacramentoand that you got itwho says so roared jack show me the blank liar there was a dead silence then the possessor of the quiet voice mr jack hamlin languidly reached under the table took the chalk and rubbing the end of his billiardcue began with gentle gravity it was an old friend of mine in sacramento a man with a wooden leg a game eye three fingers on his right hand and a consumptive cough being unable naturally to back himself he leaves things to me so for the sake of argument continued hamlin suddenly laying down his cue and fixing his wicked black eyes on the speaker say its me  i am afraid that this story whether truthful or not did not tend to increase pegs popularity in a community where recklessness and generosity condoned for the absence of all the other virtues and it is possible also that red dog was no more free from prejudice than other more civilized but equally disappointed matchmakers likewise during the following year she made several more foolish ventures and lost heavily in fact a feverish desire to increase her store at almost any risk seemed to possess her at last it was announced that she intended to reopen the infelix rockville hotel and keep it herself  wild as this scheme appeared in theory when put into practical operation there seemed to be some chance of success much doubtless was owing to her practical knowledge of hotelkeeping but more to her rigid economy and untiring industry the mistress of millions she cooked washed waited on table made the beds and labored like a common menial visitors were attracted by this novel spectacle the income of the house increased as their respect for the hostess lessened no anecdote of her avarice was too extravagant for current belief it was even alleged that she had been known to carry the luggage of guests to their rooms that she might anticipate the usual porters gratuity she denied herself the ordinary necessaries of life she was poorly clad she was illfedbut the hotel was making money  a few hinted of insanity others shook their heads and said a curse was entailed on the property it was believed also from her appearance that she could not long survive this tax on her energies and already there was discussion as to the probable final disposition of her property  it was the particular fortune of mr jack hamlin to be able to set the world right on this and other questions regarding her  a stormy december evening had set in when he chanced to be a guest of the rockville hotel he had during the past week been engaged in the prosecution of his noble profession at red dog and had in the graphic language of a coadjutor cleared out the town except his fare in the pockets of the stagedriver the red dog standard had bewailed his departure in playful obituary verse beginning dearest johnny thou hast left us wherein the rhymes bereft us and deplore carried a vague allusion to a thousand dollars more a quiet contentment naturally suffused his personality and he was more than usually lazy and deliberate in his speech at midnight when he was about to retire he was a little surprised however by a tap on his door followed by the presence of mistress peg moffat heiress and landlady of rockville hotel  mr hamlin despite his previous defence of peg had no liking for her his fastidious taste rejected her uncomeliness his habits of thought and life were all antagonistic to what he had heard of her niggardliness and greed as she stood there in a dirty calico wrapper still redolent with the days cuisine crimson with embarrassment and the recent heat of the kitchen range she certainly was not an alluring apparition happily for the lateness of the hour her loneliness and the infelix reputation of the man before her she was at least a safe one and i fear the very consciousness of this scarcely relieved her embarrassment  i wanted to say a few words to ye alone mr hamlin she began taking an unoffered seat on the end of his portmanteau or i shouldnt hev intruded but its the only time i can ketch you or you me for im down in the kitchen from sunup till now  she stopped awkwardly as if to listen to the wind which was rattling the windows and spreading a film of rain against the opaque darkness without then smoothing her wrapper over her knees she remarked as if opening a desultory conversation thars a power of rain outside  mr hamlins only response to this meteorological observation was a yawn and a preliminary tug at his coat as he began to remove it  i thought ye couldnt mind doin me a favor continued peg with a hard awkward laugh partikly seein ez folks allowed youd sorter bin a friend o mine and hed stood up for me at times when you hednt any partikler call to do it i hevnt she continued looking down on her lap and following with her finger and thumb a seam of her gowni hevnt so many friends ez slings a kind word for me these times that i disremember them her under lip quivered a little here and after vainly hunting for a forgotten handkerchief she finally lifted the hem of her gown wiped her snub nose upon it but left the tears still in her eyes as she raised them to the man mr hamlin who had by this time divested himself of his coat stopped unbuttoning his waistcoat and looked at her  like ez not tharll be high water on the north fork ef this rain keeps on said peg as if apologetically looking toward the window  the other rain having ceased mr hamlin began to unbutton his waistcoat again  i wanted to ask ye a favor about mraboutjack folinsbee began peg again hurriedly hes ailin agin and is mighty low and hes losin a heap o money here and thar and mostly to you you cleaned him out of two thousand dollars last nightall he had  well said the gambler coldly  well i thought ez you woz a friend o mine id ask ye to let up a little on him said peg with an affected laugh you kin do it dont let him play with ye  mistress margaret moffat said jack with lazy deliberation taking off his watch and beginning to wind it up ef youre that much stuck after jack folinsbee you kin keep him off of me much easier than i kin youre a rich woman give him enough money to break my bank or break himself for good and all but dont keep him forlin round me in hopes to make a raise it dont pay mistress moffatit dont pay  a finer nature than pegs would have misunderstood or resented the gamblers slang and the miserable truths that underlaid it but she comprehended him instantly and sat hopelessly silent  ef youll take my advice continued jack placing his watch and chain under his pillow and quietly unloosing his cravat youll quit this yer forlin marry that chap and hand over to him the money and the moneymakin thats killin you hell get rid of it soon enough i dont say this because i expect to git it for when hes got that much of a raise hell make a break for frisco and lose it to some firstclass sport there i dont say neither that you maynt be in luck enough to reform him i dont say neitherand its a derned sight more likelythat you maynt be luckier yet and hell up and die afore he gits rid of your money but i do say youll make him happy now and ez i reckon youre about ez badly stuck after that chap ez i ever saw any woman you wont be hurtin your own feelins either  the blood left pegs face as she looked up but thats why i cant give him the moneyand he wont marry me without it  mr hamlins hand dropped from the last button of his waistcoat cantgivehimthemoney he repeated slowly  no  why  becausebecause i love him  mr hamlin rebuttoned his waistcoat and sat down patiently on the bed peg arose and awkwardly drew the portmanteau a little nearer to him  when jim byways left me this yer property she began looking cautiously around he left it to me on conditions not conditions ez waz in his written will but conditions ez waz spoken a promise i made him in this very room mr hamlinthis very room and on that very bed youre sittin on in which he died  like most gamblers mr hamlin was superstitious he rose hastily from the bed and took a chair beside the window the wind shook it as if the discontented spirit of mr byways were without reenforcing his last injunction  i dont know if you remember him said peg feverishly he was a man ez hed suffered all that he lovedwife fammerly friendshad gone back on him he tried to make light of it afore folks but with me being a poor gal he let himself out i never told anybody this i dont know why he told me i dont know continued peg with a sniffle why he wanted to make me unhappy too but he made me promise that if he left me his fortune id never neverso help me godnever share it with any man or woman that i loved i didnt think it would be hard to keep that promise then mr hamlin for i was very poor and hednt a friend nor a living bein that was kind to me but him  but youve as good as broken your promise already said hamlin youve given jack money as i know  only what i made myself listen to me mr hamlin when jack proposed to me i offered him about what i kalkilated i could earn myself when he went away and was sick and in trouble i came here and took this hotel i knew that by hard work i could make it pay dont laugh at me please i did work hard and did make it paywithout takin one cent of the fortin and all i made workin by night and day i gave to him i did mr hamlin i aint so hard to him as you think though i might be kinder i know  mr hamlin rose deliberately resumed his coat watch hat and overcoat when he was completely dressed again he turned to peg do you mean to say that youve been givin all the money you made here to this a 1 firstclass cherubim  yes but he didnt know where i got it o mr hamlin he didnt know that  do i understand you that hes bin buckin agin faro with the money that you raised on hash and you makin the hash  but he didnt know that he wouldnt hev took it if id told him  no hed hev died fust said mr hamlin gravely why hes that sensitiveis jack folinsbeethat it nearly kills him to take money even of me but where does this angel reside when he isnt fightin the tiger and is so to speak visible to the naked eye  hehestops here said peg with an awkward blush  i see might i ask the number of his roomor should i be adisturbing him in his meditations continued jack hamlin with grave politeness  oh then youll promise and youll talk to him and make him promise  of course said hamlin quietly  and youll remember hes sickvery sick his rooms no 44 at the end of the hall perhaps id better go with you  ill find it  and you wont be too hard on him  ill be a father to him said hamlin demurely as he opened the door and stepped into the hall but he hesitated a moment and then turned and gravely held out his hand peg took it timidly he did not seem quite in earnest and his black eyes vainly questioned indicated nothing but he shook her hand warmly and the next moment was gone  he found the room with no difficulty a faint cough from within and a querulous protest answered his knock mr hamlin entered without further ceremony a sickening smell of drugs a palpable flavor of stale dissipation and the wasted figure of jack folinsbee halfdressed extended upon the bed greeted him mr hamlin was for an instant startled there were hollow circles round the sick mans eyes there was palsy in his trembling limbs there was dissolution in his feverish breath  whats up he asked huskily and nervously  i am and i want you to get up too  i cant jack im regularly done up he reached his shaking hand towards a glass halffilled with suspicious pungentsmelling liquid but mr hamlin stayed it  do you want to get back that two thousand dollars you lost  yes  well get up and marry that woman down stairs  folinsbee laughed half hysterically half sardonically  she wont give it to me  no but i will  you  yes  folinsbee with an attempt at a reckless laugh rose trembling and with difficulty to his swollen feet hamlin eyed him narrowly and then bade him lie down again tomorrow will do he said and then  if i dont  if you dont responded hamlin why ill just wade in and cut you out  but on the morrow mr hamlin was spared that possible act of disloyalty for in the night the already hesitating spirit of mr jack folinsbee took flight on the wings of the southeast storm when or how it happened nobody knew whether this last excitement and the near prospect of matrimony or whether an overdose of anodyne had hastened his end was never known i only know that when they came to awaken him the next morning the best that was left of hima face still beautiful and boylikelooked up coldly at the tearful eyes of peg moffat it serves me right its a judgment she said in a low whisper to jack hamlin for god knew that id broken my word and willed all my property to him  she did not long survive him whether mr hamlin ever clothed with action the suggestion indicated in his speech to the lamented jack that night is not of record he was always her friend and on her demise became her executor but the bulk of her property was left to a distant relation of handsome jack folinsbee and so passed out of the control of red dog forever     the great deadwood mystery   it was growing quite dark in the telegraphoffice at cottonwood tuolumne county california the office a boxlike enclosure was separated from the public room of the miners hotel by a thin partition and the operator who was also news and express agent at cottonwood had closed his window and was lounging by his newsstand preparatory to going home without the first monotonous rain of the season was dripping from the porches of the hotel in the waning light of a december day the operator accustomed as he was to long intervals of idleness was fast becoming bored  the tread of mudmuffled boots on the veranda and the entrance of two men offered a momentary excitement he recognized in the strangers two prominent citizens of cottonwood and their manner bespoke business one of them proceeded to the desk wrote a despatch and handed it to the other interrogatively  thats about the way the thing pints responded his companion assentingly  i reckoned it only squar to use his dientical words  thats so  the first speaker turned to the operator with the despatch  how soon can you shove her through  the operator glanced professionally over the address and the length of the despatch  now he answered promptly  and she gets there  tonight but theres no delivery until tomorrow  shove her through tonight and say theres an extra twenty left here for delivery  the operator accustomed to all kinds of extravagant outlay for expedition replied that he would lay this proposition with the despatch before the san francisco office he then took it and read itand reread it he preserved the usual professional apathyhad doubtless sent many more enigmatical and mysterious messagesbut nevertheless when he finished he raised his eyes inquiringly to his customer that gentleman who enjoyed a reputation for equal spontaneity of temper and revolver met his gaze a little impatiently the operator had recourse to a trick under the pretence of misunderstanding the message he obliged the sender to repeat it aloud for the sake of accuracy and even suggested a few verbal alterations ostensibly to insure correctness but really to extract further information nevertheless the man doggedly persisted in a literal transcript of his message the operator went to his instrument hesitatingly  i suppose he added halfquestioningly there aint no chance of a mistake this address is rightbody that rich old bostonian that everybody knows there aint but one  thats the address responded the first speaker coolly  didnt know the old chap had investments out here suggested the operator lingering at his instrument  no more did i was the insufficient reply  for some few moments nothing was heard but the click of the instrument as the operator worked the key with the usual appearance of imparting confidence to a somewhat reluctant hearer who preferred to talk himself the two men stood by watching his motions with the usual awe of the unprofessional when he had finished they laid before him two goldpieces as the operator took them up he could not help saying  the old man went off kinder sudden didnt he had no time to write  not sudden for that kind o man was the exasperating reply  but the speaker was not to be disconcerted if there is an answer he began  there aint any replied the first speaker quietly  why  because the man ez sent the message is dead  but its signed by you two  ony ez witnesseseh appealed the first speaker to his comrade  ony ez witnesses responded the other  the operator shrugged his shoulders the business concluded the first speaker slightly relaxed he nodded to the operator and turned to the barroom with a pleasing social impulse when their glasses were set down empty the first speaker with a cheerful condemnation of the hard times and the weather apparently dismissed all previous proceedings from his mind and lounged out with his companion at the corner of the street they stopped  well that jobs done said the first speaker by way of relieving the slight social embarrassment of parting  thets so responded his companion and shook his hand  they parted a gust of wind swept through the pines and struck a faint aeolian cry from the wires above their heads and the rain and the darkness again slowly settled upon cottonwood  the message lagged a little at san francisco laid over half an hour at chicago and fought longitude the whole way so that it was past midnight when the all night operator took it from the wires at boston but it was freighted with a mandate from the san francisco office and a messenger was procured who sped with it through dark snowbound streets between the high walls of closeshuttered rayless houses to a certain formal square ghostly with snowcovered statues here he ascended the broad steps of a reserved and solidlooking mansion and pulled a bronze bellknob that somewhere within those chaste recesses after an apparent reflective pause coldly communicated the fact that a stranger was waiting withoutas he ought despite the lateness of the hour there was a slight glow from the windows clearly not enough to warm the messenger with indications of a festivity within but yet bespeaking as it were some prolonged though subdued excitement the sober servant who took the despatch and receipted for it as gravely as if witnessing a last will and testament respectfully paused before the entrance of the drawingroom the sound of measured and rhetorical speech through which the occasional catarrhal cough of the newengland coast struggled as the only effort of nature not wholly repressed came from its heavilycurtained recesses for the occasion of the evening had been the reception and entertainment of various distinguished persons and as had been epigrammatically expressed by one of the guests the history of the country was taking its leave in phrases more or less memorable and characteristic some of these valedictory axioms were clever some witty a few profound but always left as a genteel contribution to the entertainer some had been already prepared and like a card had served and identified the guest at other mansions  the last guest departed the last carriage rolled away when the servant ventured to indicate the existence of the despatch to his master who was standing on the hearthrug in an attitude of wearied selfrighteousness he took it opened it read it reread it and said  there must be some mistake it is not for me call the boy waters  waters who was perfectly aware that the boy had left nevertheless obediently walked towards the halldoor but was recalled by his master  no matterat present  its nothing serious william asked mrs rightbody with languid wifely concern  no nothing is there a light in my study  yes but before you go can you give me a moment or two  mr rightbody turned a little impatiently towards his wife she had thrown herself languidly on the sofa her hair was slightly disarranged and part of a slippered foot was visible she might have been a finelyformed woman but even her careless deshabille left the general impression that she was severely flannelled throughout and that any ostentation of womanly charm was under vigorous sanitary surveillance  mrs marvin told me tonight that her son made no secret of his serious attachment for our alice and that if i was satisfied mr marvin would be glad to confer with you at once  the information did not seem to absorb mr rightbodys wandering attention but rather increased his impatience he said hastily that he would speak of that tomorrow and partly by way of reprisal and partly to dismiss the subject added  positively james must pay some attention to the register and the thermometer it was over 70 degrees tonight and the ventilating draught was closed in the drawingroom  that was because professor ammon sat near it and the old gentlemans tonsils are so sensitive  he ought to know from dr dyer doit that systematic and regular exposure to draughts stimulates the mucous membrane while fixed air over 60 degrees invariably  i am afraid william interrupted mrs rightbody with feminine adroitness adopting her husbands topic with a view of thereby directing him from itim afraid that people do not yet appreciate the substitution of bouillon for punch and ices i observed that mr spondee declined it and i fancied looked disappointed the fibrine and wheat in liqueurglasses passed quite unnoticed too  and yet each halfdrachm contained the halfdigested substance of a pound of beef im surprised at spondee continued mr rightbody aggrievedly exhausting his brain and nerve force by the highest creative efforts of the muse he prefers perfumed and diluted alcohol flavored with carbonic acid gas even mrs faringway admitted to me that the sudden lowering of the temperature of the stomach by the introduction of ice  yes but she took a lemon ice at the last dorothea reception and asked me if i had observed that the lower animals refused their food at a temperature over 60 degrees  mr rightbody again moved impatiently towards the door mrs rightbody eyed him curiously  you will not write i hope dr keppler told me tonight that your cerebral symptoms interdicted any prolonged mental strain  i must consult a few papers responded mr rightbody curtly as he entered his library  it was a richlyfurnished apartment morbidly severe in its decorations which were symptomatic of a gloomy dyspepsia of art then quite prevalent a few curios very ugly but providentially equally rare were scattered about there were various bronzes marbles and casts all requiring explanation and so fulfilling their purpose of promoting conversation and exhibiting the erudition of their owner there were souvenirs of travel with a history old bricabrac with a pedigree but little or nothing that challenged attention for itself alone in all cases the superiority of the owner to his possessions was admitted as a natural result nobody ever lingered there the servants avoided the room and no child was ever known to play in it  mr rightbody turned up the gas and from a cabinet of drawers precisely labelled drew a package of letters these he carefully examined all were discolored and made dignified by age but some in their original freshness must have appeared trifling and inconsistent with any correspondent of mr rightbody nevertheless that gentleman spent some moments in carefully perusing them occasionally referring to the telegram in his hand suddenly there was a knock at the door mr rightbody started made a halfunconscious movement to return the letters to the drawer turned the telegram face downwards and then somewhat harshly stammered  eh whos there come in  i beg your pardon papa said a very pretty girl entering without however the slightest trace of apology or awe in her manner and taking a chair with the selfpossession and familiarity of an habitue of the room but i knew it was not your habit to write late so i supposed you were not busy i am on my way to bed  she was so very pretty and withal so utterly unconscious of it or perhaps so consciously superior to it that one was provoked into a more critical examination of her face but this only resulted in a reiteration of her beauty and perhaps the added facts that her dark eyes were very womanly her rich complexion eloquent and her chiselled lips fell enough to be passionate or capricious notwithstanding that their general effect suggested neither caprice womanly weakness nor passion  with the instinct of an embarrassed man mr rightbody touched the topic he would have preferred to avoid  i suppose we must talk over tomorrow he hesitated this matter of yours and mr marvins mrs marvin has formally spoken to your mother  miss alice lifted her bright eyes intelligently but not joyfully and the color of action rather than embarrassment rose to her round cheeks  yes he said she would she answered simply  at present continued mr rightbody still awkwardly i see no objection to the proposed arrangement  miss alice opened her round eyes at this  why papa i thought it had been all settled long ago mamma knew it you knew it last july mamma and you talked it over  yes yes returned her father fumbling his papers that iswell we will talk of it tomorrow in fact mr rightbody had intended to give the affair a proper attitude of seriousness and solemnity by due precision of speech and some apposite reflections when he should impart the news to his daughter but felt himself unable to do it now i am glad alice he said at last that you have quite forgotten your previous whims and fancies you see we are right  oh i dare say papa if im to be married at all that mr marvin is in every way suitable  mr rightbody looked at his daughter narrowly there was not the slightest impatience nor bitterness in her manner it was as well regulated as the sentiment she expressed  mr marvin is he began  i know what mr marvin is interrupted miss alice and he has promised me that i shall be allowed to go on with my studies the same as before i shall graduate with my class and if i prefer to practise my profession i can do so in two years after our marriage  in two years queried mr rightbody curiously  yes you see in case we should have a child that would give me time enough to wean it  mr rightbody looked at this flesh of his flesh pretty and palpable flesh as it was but being confronted as equally with the brain of his brain all he could do was to say meekly  yes certainly we will see about all that tomorrow  miss alice rose something in the free unfettered swing of her arms as she rested them lightly after a half yawn on her lithe hips suggested his next speech although still distrait and impatient  you continue your exercise with the healthlift yet i see  yes papa but i had to give up the flannels i dont see how mamma could wear them but my dresses are highnecked and by bathing i toughen my skin see she added as with a childlike unconsciousness she unfastened two or three buttons of her gown and exposed the white surface of her throat and neck to her father i can defy a chill  mr rightbody with something akin to a genuine playful paternal laugh leaned forward and kissed her forehead  its getting late ally he said parentally but not dictatorially go to bed  i took a nap of three hours this afternoon said miss alice with a dazzling smile to anticipate this dissipation goodnight papa tomorrow then  tomorrow repeated mr rightbody with his eyes still fixed upon the girl vaguely goodnight  miss alice tripped from the room possibly a trifle the more lightheartedly that she had parted from her father in one of his rare moments of illogical human weakness and perhaps it was well for the poor girl that she kept this single remembrance of him when i fear in afteryears his methods his reasoning and indeed all he had tried to impress upon her childhood had faded from her memory  for when she had left mr rightbody fell again to the examination of his old letters this was quite absorbing so much so that he did not notice the footsteps of mrs rightbody on the staircase as she passed to her chamber nor that she had paused on the landing to look through the glass halfdoor on her husband as he sat there with the letters beside him and the telegram opened before him had she waited a moment later she would have seen him rise and walk to the sofa with a disturbed air and a slight confusion so that on reaching it he seemed to hesitate to lie down although pale and evidently faint had she still waited she would have seen him rise again with an agonized effort stagger to the table fumblingly refold and replace the papers in the cabinet and lock it and although now but halfconscious hold the telegram over the gasflame till it was consumed  for had she waited until this moment she would have flown unhesitatingly to his aid as this act completed he staggered again reached his hand toward the bell but vainly and then fell prone upon the sofa  but alas no providential nor accidental hand was raised to save him or anticipate the progress of this story and when half an hour later mrs rightbody a little alarmed and more indignant at his violation of the doctors rules appeared upon the threshold mr rightbody lay upon the sofa dead  with bustle with thronging feet with the irruption of strangers and a hurrying to and fro but more than all with an impulse and emotion unknown to the mansion when its owner was in life mrs rightbody strove to call back the vanished life but in vain the highest medical intelligence called from its bed at this strange hour saw only the demonstration of its theories made a year before mr rightbody was deadwithout doubt without mystery even as a correct man should dielogically and indorsed by the highest medical authority  but even in the confusion mrs rightbody managed to speed a messenger to the telegraphoffice for a copy of the despatch received by mr rightbody but now missing  in the solitude of her own room and without a confidant she read these words                              copy    to mr adams rightbody boston mass    joshua silsbie died suddenly this morning  his last request was    that you should remember your sacred compact with him of thirty    years ago          signed                       seventyfour                                         seventyfive   in the darkened home and amid the formal condolements of their friends who had called to gaze upon the scarcely cold features of their late associate mrs rightbody managed to send another despatch it was addressed to seventyfour and seventyfive cottonwood in a few hours she received the following enigmatical response  a horsethief named josh silsbie was lynched yesterday morning by the vigilantes at deadwood   part ii   the spring of 1874 was retarded in the california sierras so much so that certain eastern tourists who had early ventured into the yo semite valley found themselves one may morning snowbound against the tempestuous shoulders of el capitan so furious was the onset of the wind at the upper merced canyon that even so respectable a lady as mrs rightbody was fain to cling to the neck of her guide to keep her seat in the saddle while miss alice scorning all masculine assistance was hurled a lovely chaos against the snowy wall of the chasm mrs rightbody screamed miss alice raged under her breath but scrambled to her feet again in silence  i told you so said mrs rightbody in an indignant whisper as her daughter again ranged beside her i warned you especially alicethatthat  what interrupted miss alice curtly  that you would need your chemiloons and high boots said mrs rightbody in a regretful undertone slightly increasing her distance from the guides  miss alice shrugged her pretty shoulders scornfully but ignored her mothers implication  you were particularly warned against going into the valley at this season she only replied grimly  mrs rightbody raised her eyes impatiently  you know how anxious i was to discover your poor fathers strange correspondent alice you have no consideration  but when you have discovered himwhat then queried miss alice  what then  yes my belief is that you will find the telegram only a mere business cipher and all this quest mere nonsense  alice why you yourself thought your fathers conduct that night very strange have you forgotten  the young lady had not but for some farreaching feminine reason chose to ignore it at that moment when her late tumble in the snow was still fresh in her mind  and this woman whoever she may be continued mrs rightbody  how do you know theres a woman in the case interrupted miss alice wickedly i fear  how doiknowtheres a woman slowly ejaculated mrs rightbody floundering in the snow and the unexpected possibility of such a ridiculous question but here her guide flew to her assistance and estopped further speech and indeed a grave problem was before them  the road that led to their single place of refugea cabin half hotel half tradingpost scarce a mile awayskirted the base of the rocky dome and passed perilously near the precipitous wall of the valley there was a rapid descent of a hundred yards or more to this terracelike passage and the guides paused for a moment of consultation cooly oblivious alike to the terrified questioning of mrs rightbody or the halfinsolent independence of the daughter the elder guide was russetbearded stout and humorous the younger was darkbearded slight and serious  ef you kin git young bunker hill to let you tote her on your shoulders ill git the madam to hang on to me came to mrs rightbodys horrified ears as the expression of her particular companion  freeze to the old gal and dont reckon on me if the daughter starts in to play it alone was the enigmatical response of the younger guide  miss alice overheard both propositions and before the two men returned to their side that highspirited young lady had urged her horse down the declivity  alas at this moment a gust of whirling snow swept down upon her there was a flounder a misstep a fatal strain on the wrong rein a fall a few plucky but unavailing struggles and both horse and rider slid ignominiously down toward the rocky shelf mrs rightbody screamed miss alice from a confused debris of snow and ice uplifted a vexed and coloring face to the younger guide a little the more angrily perhaps that she saw a shade of impatience on his face  dont move but tie one end of the lass under your arms and throw me the other he said quietly  what do you mean by lassthe lasso asked miss alice disgustedly  yes maam  then why dont you say so  o alice reproachfully interpolated mrs rightbody encircled by the elder guides stalwart arm  miss alice deigned no reply but drew the loop of the lasso over her shoulders and let it drop to her round waist then she essayed to throw the other end to her guide dismal failure the first fling nearly knocked her off the ledge the second went all wild against the rocky wall the third caught in a thornbush twenty feet below her companions feet miss alices arm sunk helplessly to her side at which signal of unqualified surrender the younger guide threw himself half way down the slope worked his way to the thornbush hung for a moment perilously over the parapet secured the lasso and then began to pull away at his lovely burden miss alice was no dead weight however but steadily halfscrambled on her hands and knees to within a foot or two of her rescuer at this too familiar proximity she stood up and leaned a little stiffly against the line causing the guide to give an extra pull which had the lamentable effect of landing her almost in his arms  as it was her intelligent forehead struck his nose sharply and i regret to add treating of a romantic situation caused that somewhat prominent sign and token of a hero to bleed freely miss alice instantly clapped a handful of snow over his nostrils  now elevate your right arm she said commandingly  he did as he was bidden but sulkily  that compresses the artery  no man with a pretty womans hand and a handful of snow over his mouth and nose could effectively utter a heroic sentence nor with his arm elevated stiffly over his head assume a heroic attitude but when his mouth was free again he said halfsulkily halfapologetically  i might have known a girl couldnt throw worth a cent  why demanded miss alice sharply  becausewhybecauseyou seethey havent got the experience he stammered feebly  nonsense they havent the claviclethats all its because im a woman and smaller in the collarbone that i havent the play of the forearm which you have see she squared her shoulders slightly and turned the blaze of her dark eyes full on his experience indeed a girl can learn anything a boy can  apprehension took the place of illhumor in her hearer he turned his eyes hastily away and glanced above him the elder guide had gone forward to catch miss alices horse which relieved of his rider was floundering toward the trail mrs rightbody was nowhere to be seen and these two were still twenty feet below the trail  there was an awkward pause  shall i put you up the same way he queried miss alice looked at his nose and hesitated or will you take my hand he added in surly impatience to his surprise miss alice took his hand and they began the ascent together  but the way was difficult and dangerous once or twice her feet slipped on the smoothlyworn rock beneath and she confessed to an inward thankfulness when her uncertain feminine handgrip was exchanged for his strong arm around her waist not that he was ungentle but miss alice angrily felt that he had once or twice exercised his superior masculine functions in a rough way and yet the next moment she would have probably rejected the idea that she had even noticed it there was no doubt however that he was a little surly  a fierce scramble finally brought them back in safety to the trail but in the action miss alices shoulder striking a projecting bowlder wrung from her a feminine cry of pain her first sign of womanly weakness the guide stopped instantly  i am afraid i hurt you  she raised her brown lashes a trifle moist from suffering looked in his eyes and dropped her own why she could not tell and yet he had certainly a kind face despite its seriousness and a fine face albeit unshorn and weatherbeaten her own eyes had never been so near to any mans before save her lovers and yet she had never seen so much in even his she slipped her hand away not with any reference to him but rather to ponder over this singular experience and somehow felt uncomfortable thereat  nor was he less so it was but a few days ago that he had accepted the charge of this young woman from the elder guide who was the recognized escort of the rightbody party having been a former correspondent of her fathers he had been hired like any other guide but had undertaken the task with that chivalrous enthusiasm which the average californian always extends to the sex so rare to him but the illusion had passed and he had dropped into a sulky practical sense of his situation perhaps fraught with less danger to himself only when appealed to by his manhood or her weakness he had forgotten his wounded vanity  he strode moodily ahead dutifully breaking the path for her in the direction of the distant canyon where mrs rightbody and her friend awaited them miss alice was first to speak in this trackless uncharted terra incognita of the passions it is always the woman who steps out to lead the way  you know this place very well i suppose you have lived here long  yes  you were not born hereno  a long pause  i observe they call you stanislaus joe of course that is not your real name memmiss alice had never called him anything usually prefacing any request with a languid oerer please misterera explicit enough for his station  no  miss alice trotting after him and bawling in his earwhat name did you say  the man doggedlyi dont know nevertheless when they reached the cabin after an halfhours buffeting with the storm miss alice applied herself to her mothers escort mr ryder  whats the name of the man who takes care of my horse  stanislaus joe responded mr ryder  is that all  no sometimes hes called joe stanislaus  miss alice satiricallyi suppose its the custom here to send young ladies out with gentlemen who hide their names under an alias  mr ryder greatly perplexedwhy dear me miss alice you allers peared to me as a gal as was able to take keer  miss alice interrupting with a wounded dovelike timidityoh never mind please  the cabin offered but scanty accommodation to the tourists which fact when indignantly presented by mrs rightbody was explained by the goodhumored ryder from the circumstance that the usual hotel was only a slight affair of boards cloth and paper put up during the season and partly dismantled in the fall you couldnt be kept warm enough there he added nevertheless miss alice noticed that both mr ryder and stanislaus joe retired there with their pipes after having prepared the ladies supper with the assistance of an indian woman who apparently emerged from the earth at the coming of the party and disappeared as mysteriously  the stars came out brightly before they slept and the next morning a clear unwinking sun beamed with almost summer power through the shutterless window of their cabin and ironically disclosed the details of its rude interior two or three mangy halfeaten buffalorobes a bearskin some suspiciouslooking blankets rifles and saddles dealtables and barrels made up its scant inventory a strip of faded calico hung before a recess near the chimney but so blackened by smoke and age that even feminine curiosity respected its secret mrs rightbody was in high spirits and informed her daughter that she was at last on the track of her husbands unknown correspondent seventyfour and seventyfive represent two members of the vigilance committee my dear and mr ryder will assist me to find them  mr ryder ejaculated miss alice in scornful astonishment  alice said mrs rightbody with a suspicious assumption of sudden defence you injure yourself you injure me by this exclusive attitude mr ryder is a friend of your fathers an exceedingly wellinformed gentleman i have not of course imparted to him the extent of my suspicions but he can help me to what i must and will know you might treat him a little more civillyor at least a little better than you do his servant your guide mr ryder is a gentleman and not a paid courier  miss alice was suddenly attentive when she spoke again she asked why do you not find out something about this silsbiewho diedor was hungor something of that kind  child said mrs rightbody dont you see there was no silsbie or if there was he was simply the confidant of thatwoman  a knock at the door announcing the presence of mr ryder and stanislaus joe with the horses checked mrs rightbodys speech as the animals were being packed mrs rightbody for a moment withdrew in confidential conversation with mr ryder and to the young ladys still greater annoyance left her alone with stanislaus joe miss alice was not in good temper but she felt it necessary to say something  i hope the hotel offers better quarters for travellers than this in summer she began  it does  then this does not belong to it  no maam  who lives here then  i do  i beg your pardon stammered miss alice i thought you lived where we hiredwhere we met youininyou must excuse me  im not a regular guide but as times were hard and i was out of grub i took the job  out of grub job and she was the job what would henry marvin say it would nearly kill him she began herself to feel a little frightened and walked towards the door  one moment miss  the young girl hesitated the mans tone was surly and yet indicated a certain kind of halfpathetic grievance her curiosity got the better of her prudence and she turned back  this morning he began hastily when we were coming down the valley you picked me up twice  i picked you up repeated the astonished alice  yes contradicted me thats what i meanonce when you said those rocks were volcanic once when you said the flower you picked was a poppy i didnt let on at the time for it wasnt my say but all the while you were talking i might have laid for you  i dont understand you said alice haughtily  i might have entrapped you before folks but i only want you to know that im right and here are the books to show it  he drew aside the dingy calico curtain revealed a small shelf of bulky books took down two large volumesone of botany one of geologynervously sought his text and put them in alices outstretched hands  i had no intention she began halfproudly halfembarrassedly  am i right miss he interrupted  i presume you are if you say so  thats all maam thank you  before the girl had time to reply he was gone when he again returned it was with her horse and mrs rightbody and ryder were awaiting her but miss alice noticed that his own horse was missing  are you not going with us she asked  no maam  oh indeed  miss alice felt her speech was a feeble conventionalism but it was all she could say she however did something hitherto it had been her habit to systematically reject his assistance in mounting to her seat now she awaited him as he approached she smiled and put out her little foot he instantly stooped she placed it in his hand rose with a spring and for one supreme moment stanislaus joe held her unresistingly in his arms the next moment she was in the saddle but in that brief interval of sixty seconds she had uttered a volume in a single sentence  i hope you will forgive me  he muttered a reply and turned his face aside quickly as if to hide it  miss alice cantered forward with a smile but pulled her hat down over her eyes as she joined her mother she was blushing   part iii   mr ryder was as good as his word a day or two later he entered mrs rightbodys parlor at the chrysopolis hotel in stockton with the information that he had seen the mysterious senders of the despatch and that they were now in the office of the hotel waiting her pleasure mr ryder further informed her that these gentlemen had only stipulated that they should not reveal their real names and that they be introduced to her simply as the respective seventyfour and seventyfive who had signed the despatch sent to the late mr rightbody  mrs rightbody at first demurred to this but on the assurance from mr ryder that this was the only condition on which an interview would be granted finally consented  you will find them square men even if they are a little rough maam but if youd like me to be present ill stop though i reckon if yed calkilated on that youd have had me take care o your business by proxy and not come yourself three thousand miles to do it  mrs rightbody believed it better to see them alone  all right maam ill hang round out here and ef ye should happen to have a ticklin in your throat and a bad spell o coughin ill drop in careless like to see if you dont want them drops sabe  and with an exceedingly arch wink and a slight familiar tap on mrs rightbodys shoulder which might have caused the late mr rightbody to burst his sepulchre he withdrew  a very timid hesitating tap on the door was followed by the entrance of two men both of whom in general size strength and uncouthness were ludicrously inconsistent with their diffident announcement they proceeded in indian file to the centre of the room faced mrs rightbody acknowledged her deep courtesy by a strong shake of the hand and drawing two chairs opposite to her sat down side by side  i presume i have the pleasure of addressing began mrs rightbody  the man directly opposite mrs rightbody turned to the other inquiringly  the other man nodded his head and replied  seventyfour  seventyfive promptly followed the other  mrs rightbody paused a little confused  i have sent for you she began again to learn something more of the circumstances under which you gentlemen sent a despatch to my late husband  the circumstances replied seventyfour quietly with a sideglance at his companion panned out about in this yer style we hung a man named josh silsbie down at deadwood for hossstealin when i say we i speak for seventyfive yer as is present as well as representin so to speak seventytwo other gents as is scattered we hung josh silsbie on squar pretty squar evidence afore he was strung up seventyfive yer axed him accordin to custom ef ther was enny thing he had to say or enny request that he allowed to make of us he turns to seventyfive yer and  here he paused suddenly looking at his companion  he sez sez he began seventyfive taking up the narrativehe sez kin i write a letter sez he sez i not much ole man yeve got no time sez he kin i send a despatch by telegraph i sez heave ahead he sezthese is his dientikal wordssend to adam rightbody boston tell him to remember his sacred compack with me thirty years ago  his sacred compack with me thirty years ago echoed seventyfourhis dientikal words  what was the compact asked mrs rightbody anxiously  seventyfour looked at seventyfive and then both arose and retired to the corner of the parlor where they engaged in a slow but whispered deliberation presently they returned and sat down again  we allow said seventyfour quietly but decidedly that you know what that sacred compact was  mrs rightbody lost her temper and her truthfulness together of course she said hurriedly i know but do you mean to say that you gave this poor man no further chance to explain before you murdered him  seventyfour and seventyfive both rose again slowly and retired when they returned again and sat down seventyfive who by this time through some subtile magnetism mrs rightbody began to recognize as the superior power said gravely  we wish to say regarding this yer murder that seventyfour and me is equally responsible that we reckon also to represent so to speak seventytwo other gentlemen as is scattered that we are ready seventyfour and me to take and holt that responsibility now and at any time afore every man or men as kin be fetched agin us we wish to say that this yer say of ours holds good yer in californy or in any part of these united states  or in canady suggested seventyfour  or in canady we wouldnt agree to cross the water or go to furrin parts unless absolutely necessary we leaves the chise of weppings to your principal maam or being a lady maam and interested to any one you may fetch to act for him an advertisement in any of the sacramento papers or a playcard or handbill stuck unto a tree near deadwood saying that seventyfour or seventyfive will communicate with this yer principal or agent of yours will fetch usallers  mrs rightbody a little alarmed and desperate saw her blunder i mean nothing of the kind she said hastily i only expected that you might have some further details of this interview with silsbie that perhaps you could tell me a bold bright thought crossed mrs rightbodys mindsomething more about her  the two men looked at each other  i suppose your society have no objection to giving me information about her said mrs rightbody eagerly  another quiet conversation in the corner and the return of both men  we want to say that weve no objection  mrs rightbodys heart beat high her boldness had made her penetration good yet she felt she must not alarm the men heedlessly  will you inform me to what extent mr rightbody my late husband was interested in her  this time it seemed an age to mrs rightbody before the men returned from their solemn consultation in the corner she could both hear and feel that their discussion was more animated than their previous conferences she was a little mortified however when they sat down to hear seventyfour say slowly  we wish to say that we dont allow to say how much  do you not think that the sacred compact between mr rightbody and mr silsbie referred to her  we reckon it do  mrs rightbody flushed and animated would have given worlds had her daughter been present to hear this undoubted confirmation of her theory yet she felt a little nervous and uncomfortable even on this threshold of discovery  is she here now  shes in tuolumne said seventyfour  a little better looked arter than formerly added seventyfive  i see then mr silsbie enticed her away  well maam it was allowed as she runned away but it wasnt proved and it generally wasnt her style  mrs rightbody trifled with her next question  she was pretty of course  the eyes of both men brightened  she was that said seventyfour emphatically  it would have done you good to see her added seventyfive  mrs rightbody inwardly doubted it but before she could ask another question the two men again retired to the corner for consultation when they came back there was a shade more of kindliness and confidence in their manner and seventyfour opened his mind more freely  we wish to say maam looking at the thing by and large in a farminded way that ez you seem interested and ez mr rightbody was interested and was according to all accounts deceived and led away by silsbie that we dont mind listening to any proposition you might make as a ladyallowin you was ekally interested  i understand said mrs rightbody quickly and you will furnish me with any papers  the two men again consulted  we wish to say maam that we think shes got papers but  i must have them you understand interrupted mrs rightbody at any price  we was about to say maam said seventyfour slowly that considerin all thingsand you being a ladyyou kin have her papers pedigree and guaranty for twelve hundred dollars  it has been alleged that mrs rightbody asked only one question more and then fainted it is known however that by the next day it was understood in deadwood that mrs rightbody had confessed to the vigilance committee that her husband a celebrated boston millionaire anxious to gain possession of abner springers wellknown sorrel mare had incited the unfortunate josh silsbie to steal it and that finally failing in this the widow of the deceased boston millionaire was now in personal negotiation with the owners  howbeit miss alice returning home that afternoon found her mother with a violent headache  we will leave here by the next steamer said mrs rightbody languidly mr ryder has promised to accompany us  but mother  the climate alice is overrated my nerves are already suffering from it the associations are unfit for you and mr marvin is naturally impatient  miss alice colored slightly  but your quest mother  ive abandoned it  but i have not said alice quietly do you remember my guide at the yo semitestanislaus joe well stanislaus joe iswho do you think  mrs rightbody was languidly indifferent  well stanislaus joe is the son of joshua silsbie  mrs rightbody sat upright in astonishment  yes but mother he knows nothing of what we know his father treated him shamefully and set him cruelly adrift years ago and when he was hung the poor fellow in sheer disgrace changed his name  but if he knows nothing of his fathers compact of what interest is this  oh nothing only i thought it might lead to something  mrs rightbody suspected that something and asked sharply and pray how did you find it out you did not speak of it in the valley  oh i didnt find it out till today said miss alice walking to the window he happened to be here andtold me   part iv   if mrs rightbodys friends had been astounded by her singular and unexpected pilgrimage to california so soon after her husbands decease they were still more astounded by the information a year later that she was engaged to be married to a mr ryder of whom only the scant history was known that he was a californian and former correspondent of her husband it was undeniable that the man was wealthy and evidently no mere adventurer it was rumored that he was courageous and manly but even those who delighted in his odd humor were shocked at his grammar and slang  it was said that mr marvin had but one interview with his fatherinlaw elect and returned so supremely disgusted that the match was broken off the horsestealing story more or less garbled found its way through lips that pretended to decry it yet eagerly repeated it only one member of the rightbody familyand a new onesaved them from utter ostracism it was young mr ryder the adopted son of the prospective head of the household whose culture manners and general elegance fascinated and thrilled boston with a new sensation it seemed to many that miss alice should in the vicinity of this rare exotic forget her former enthusiasm for a professional life but the young man was pitied by society and various plans for diverting him from any mesalliance with the rightbody family were concocted  it was a wintry night and the second anniversary of mr rightbodys death that a light was burning in his library but the dead mans chair was occupied by young mr ryder adopted son of the new proprietor of the mansion and before him stood alice with her dark eyes fixed on the table  there must have been something in it joe believe me did you never hear your father speak of mine  never  but you say he was collegebred and born a gentleman and in his youth he must have had many friends  alice said the young man gravely when i have done something to redeem my name and wear it again before these people before you it would be well to revive the past but till then  but alice was not to be put down i remember she went on scarcely heeding him that when i came in that night papa was reading a letter and seemed to be disconcerted  a letter  yes but added alice with a sigh when we found him here insensible there was no letter on his person he must have destroyed it  did you ever look among his papers if found it might be a clew  the young man glanced toward the cabinet alice read his eyes and answered  oh dear no the cabinet contained only his papers all perfectly arrangedyou know how methodical were his habitsand some old business and private letters all carefully put away  let us see them said the young man rising  they opened drawer after drawer files upon files of letters and business papers accurately folded and filed suddenly alice uttered a little cry and picked up a quaint ivory paperknife lying at the bottom of a drawer  it was missing the next day and never could be found he must have mislaid it here this is the drawer said alice eagerly  here was a clew but the lower part of the drawer was filled with old letters not labelled yet neatly arranged in files suddenly he stopped and said put them back alice at once  why  some of these letters are in my fathers handwriting  the more reason why i should see them said the girl imperatively here you take part and ill take part and well get through quicker  there was a certain decision and independence in her manner which he had learned to respect he took the letters and in silence read them with her they were old college letters so filled with boyish dreams ambitions aspirations and utopian theories that i fear neither of these young people even recognized their parents in the dead ashes of the past they were both grave until alice uttered a little hysterical cry and dropped her face in her hands joe was instantly beside her  its nothing joe nothing dont read it please please dont its so funny its so very queer  but joe had after a slight halfplayful struggle taken the letter from the girl then he read aloud the words written by his father thirty years ago  i thank you dear friend for all you say about my wife and boy i thank you for reminding me of our boyish compact he will be ready to fulfil it i know if he loves those his father loves even if you should marry years later i am glad for your sake for both our sakes that it is a boy heaven send you a good wife dear adams and a daughter to make my son equally happy  joe silsbie looked down took the halflaughing halftearful face in his hands kissed her forehead and with tears in his grave eyes said amen    i am inclined to think that this sentiment was echoed heartily by mrs rightbodys former acquaintances when a year later miss alice was united to a professional gentleman of honor and renown yet who was known to be the son of a convicted horsethief a few remembered the previous californian story and found corroboration therefor but a majority believed it a just reward to miss alice for her conduct to mr marvin and as miss alice cheerfully accepted it in that light i do not see why i may not end my story with happiness to all concerned    a legend of sammtstadt   it was the sacred hour of noon at sammtstadt everybody was at dinner and the serious kellner of der wildemann glanced in mild reproach at mr james clinch who disregarding that fact and the invitatory table dhote stepped into the street for mr clinch had eaten a late breakfast at gladbach was dyspeptic and american and moveover preoccupied with business he was consequently indignant on entering the gardenlike court and cloisterlike countinghouse of von becheret sons uncles and cousins to find the comptoir deserted even by the porter and was furious at the maidservant who offered the sacred shibboleth mittagsessen as a reasonable explanation of the solitude a country said mr clinch to himself that stops business at midday to go to dinner and employs womenservants to talk to businessmen is played out  he stepped from the silent building into the equally silent kronprinzen strasse not a soul to be seen anywhere rows on rows of twostoried graystuccoed buildings that might be dwellings or might be offices all showing some traces of feminine taste and supervision in a flower or a curtain that belied the legended comptoir or direction over their portals mr clinch thought of boston and state street of new york and wall street and became coldly contemptuous  yet there was clearly nothing to do but to walk down the formal rows of chestnuts that lined the broad strasse and then walk back again at the corner of the first crossstreet he was struck with the fact that two men who were standing in front of a dwellinghouse appeared to be as inconsistent and out of proportion to the silent houses as were the actors on a stage to the painted canvas thoroughfares before which they strutted mr clinch usually had no fancies had no eye for quaintness besides this was not a quaint nor romantic district only an entrepot for silks and velvets and mr clinch was here not as a tourist but as a purchaser the guidebooks had ignored sammtstadt and he was too good an american to waste time in looking up uncatalogued curiosities besides he had been here once beforean entire day  one oclock still a full hour and a half before his friend would return to business what should he do the verein where he had once been entertained was deserted even by its waiters the garden with its ostentatious outofdoor tables looked bleak and bare mr clinch was not artistic in his tastes but even he was quick to detect the affront put upon nature by this continental theatrical gardening and turned disgustedly away born near a lake larger than the german ocean he resented a pool of water twentyfive feet in diameter under that alluring title and a frequenter of the adirondacks he could scarce contain himself over a bit of rockwork twelve feet high a country said mr clinch that but here he remembered that he had once seen in a park in his native city an imitation of the drachenfels in plaster on a scale of two inches to the foot and checked his speech  he turned into the principal allee of the town there was a long white building at one endthe bahnhof at the other end he remembered a dyehouse he had a year ago met its hospitable proprietor he would call upon him now  but the same solitude confronted him as he passed the porters lodge beside the gateway the countinghouse half villa half factory must have convoked its humanity in some outoftheway refectory for the halls and passages were tenantless for the first time he began to be impressed with a certain foreign quaintness in the surroundings he found himself also recalling something he had read when a boy about an enchanted palace whose inhabitants awoke on the arrival of a longpredestined prince to assure himself of the absolute ridiculousness of this fancy he took from his pocket the businesscard of its proprietor a sample of dye and recalled his own personality in a letter of credit having dismissed this idea from his mind he lounged on again through a rustic lane that might have led to a farmhouse yet was still absurdly enough a part of the factory gardens crossing a ditch by a causeway he presently came to another ditch and another causeway and then found himself idly contemplating a massive ivyclad venerable brick wall as a mere wall it might not have attracted his attention but it seemed to enter and bury itself at right angles in the sidewall of a quite modernlooking dwelling after satisfying himself of this fact he passed on before the dwelling but was amazed to see the wall reappear on the other side exactly the sameold ivygrown sturdy uncompromising and ridiculous  could it actually be a part of the house he turned back and repassed the front of the building the entrance door was hospitably open there was a hall and a staircase butby all that was preposterousthey were built over and around the central brick intrusion the wall actually ran through the house a country said mr clinch to himself where they build their houses over ruins to accommodate them or save the trouble of removal is but a very pleasant voice addressing him here stopped his usual hasty conclusion  guten morgen  mr clinch looked hastily up leaning on the parapet of what appeared to be a garden on the roof of the house was a young girl redcheeked brighteyed blondhaired the voice was soft subdued and mellow it was part of the new impression he was receiving that it seemed to be in some sort connected with the ivyclad wall before him his hat was in his hand as he answered  guten morgen  was the herr seeking anything  the herr was only waiting a longtimecoming friend and had strayed here to speak with the beforeknown proprietor  so but the beforeknown proprietor sleeping well at present after dinner would the herr on the terrace still a while linger  the herr would but looked around in vain for the means to do it he was thinking of a scalingladder when the young woman reappeared at the open door and bade him enter  following the youthful hostess mr clinch mounted the staircase but passing the mysterious wall could not forbear an allusion to it it is old very old said the girl it was here when i came  that was not very long ago said mr clinch gallantly  no but my grandfather found it here too  and built over it  why not it is very very hard and so thick  mr clinch here explained with masculine superiority the existence of such modern agents as nitroglycerine and dynamite persuasive in their effects upon timehonored obstructions and encumbrances  but there was not then what you callthisninitroglycerine  but since then  the young girl gazed at him in troubled surprise my greatgrandfather did not take it away when he built the house why should we  oh  they had passed through a hall and diningroom and suddenly stepped out of a window upon a gravelled terrace from this a few stone steps descended to another terrace on which trees and shrubs were growing and yet looking over the parapet mr clinch could see the road some twenty feet below it was nearly on a level with and part of the second story of the house had an earthquake lifted the adjacent ground or had the house burrowed into a hill mr clinch turned to his companion who was standing close beside him breathing quite audibly and leaving an impression on his senses as of a gentle and fragrant heifer  how was all this done  the maiden did not know it was always here  mr clinch reascended the steps he had quite forgotten his impatience possibly it was the gentle equable calm of the girl who but for her ready color did not seem to be moved by anything perhaps it was the peaceful repose of this mausoleum of the dead and forgotten wall that subdued him but he was quite willing to take the oldfashioned chair on the terrace which she offered him and follow her motions with not altogether mechanical eyes as she drew out certain bottles and glasses from a mysterious closet in the wall mr clinch had the weakness of a majority of his sex in believing that he was a good judge of wine and women the latter as shown in the specimen before him he would have invoiced as a fair sample of the middleclass german womanhealthy comfortloving homeabiding the very genius of domesticity even in her virgin outlines the future wholesome matron was already forecast from the curves of her broad hips to the flat lines of her back and shoulders of the wine he was to judge later that required an even more subtle and unimpassioned intellect  she placed two bottles before him on the tableone the traditional longnecked ambercolored rheinflasche the other an old quaint discolored amphoraxpatterned glass jug the first she opened  this she said pointing to the other cannot be opened  mr clinch paid his respects first to the opened bottle a good quality of niersteiner with his intellect thus clarified he glanced at the other  it is from my greatgrandfather it is old as the wall  mr clinch examined the bottle attentively it seemed to have no cork formed of some obsolete opaque glass its twisted neck was apparently hermetically sealed by the same material the maiden smiled as she said  it cannot be opened now without breaking the bottle it is not good luck to do so my grandfather and my father would not  but mr clinch was still examining the bottle its neck was flattened towards the mouth but a close inspection showed it was closed by some equally hard cement but not glass  if i can open it without breaking the bottle have i your permission  a mischievous glance rested on mr clinch as the maiden answered  i shall not object but for what will you do it  to taste it to try it  you are not afraid  there was just enough obvious admiration of mr clinchs audacity in the maidens manner to impel him to any risk his only answer was to take from his pocket a small steel instrument holding the neck of the bottle firmly in one hand he passed his thumb and the steel twice or thrice around it a faint rasping scratching sound was all the wondering girl heard then with a sudden dexterous twist of his thumb and finger to her utter astonishment he laid the top of the neck neatly cut off in her hand  theres a better and more modern bottle than you had before he said pointing to the cleanlydivided neck and any cork will fit it now  but the girl regarded him with anxiety and you still wish to taste the wine  with your permission yes  he looked up in her eyes there was permission there was something more that was flattering to his vanity he took the wineglass and slowly and in silence filled it from the mysterious flask  the wine fell into the glass clearly transparently heavily but still and cold as death there was no sparkle no cheap ebullition no evanescent bubble yet it was so clear that but for a faint ambertinting the glass seemed empty there was no aroma no ethereal diffusion from its equable surface perhaps it was fancy perhaps it was from nervous excitement but a slight chill seemed to radiate from the still goblet and bring down the temperature of the terrace mr clinch and his companion both insensibly shivered  but only for a moment mr clinch raised the glass to his lips as he did so he remembered seeing distinctly as in a picture before him the sunlit terrace the pretty girl in the foregroundan amused spectator of his sacrilegious actthe outlying ivycrowned wall the grassgrown ditch the tall factory chimneys rising above the chestnuts and the distant poplars that marked the rhine  the wine was delicious perhaps a trifle only a trifle heady he was conscious of a slight exaltation there was also a smile upon the girls lip and a roguish twinkle in her eye as she looked at him  do you find the wine to your taste she asked  fair enough i warrant said mr clinch with ponderous gallantry but methinks tis nothing compared with the nectar that grows on those ruby lips nay by st ursula i swear it  no sooner had this solemnly ridiculous speech passed the lips of the unfortunate man than he would have given worlds to have recalled it he knew that he must be intoxicated that the sentiment and language were utterly unlike him he was miserably aware that he did not even know exactly what it meant he was also hopelessly conscious yet feeling all thisfeeling too the shame of appearing before her as a man who had lost his senses through a single glass of winenevertheless he rose awkwardly seized her hand and by sheer force drew her towards him and kissed her with an exclamation that was half a cry and half a laugh she fled from him leaving him alone and bewildered on the terrace  for a moment mr clinch supported himself against the open window leaning his throbbing head on the cold glass shame mortification an hysterical halfconsciousness of his utter ridiculousness and yet an odd undefined terror of something by turns possessed him was he ever before guilty of such perfect folly had he ever before made such a spectacle of himself was it possible that he mr james clinch the coolest head at a late supperhe the american who had repeatedly drunk frenchmen and englishmen under the tablecould be transformed into a sentimental stagey idiot by a single glass of wine he was conscious too of asking himself these very questions in a stilted sort of rhetoric and with a rising brutality of anger that was new to him and then everything swam before him and he seemed to lose all consciousness  but only for an instant with a strong effort of his will he again recalled himself his situation his surroundings and above all his appointment he rose to his feet hurriedly descended the terracesteps and before he well knew how found himself again on the road once there his faculties returned in full vigor he was again himself he strode briskly forward toward the ditch he had crossed only a few moments before but was suddenly stopped it was filled with water he looked up and down it was clearly the same ditch but a flowing stream thirty feet wide now separated him from the other bank  the appearance of this unlookedfor obstacle made mr clinch doubt the full restoration of his faculties he stepped to the brink of the flood to bathe his head in the stream and wash away the last vestiges of his potations but as he approached the placid depths and knelt down he again started back and this time with a full conviction of his own madness for reflected from its mirrorlike surface was a figure he could scarcely call his own although here and there some trace of his former self remained  his closecropped hair trimmed a la mode had given way to long curling locks that dropped upon his shoulders his neat mustache was frightfully prolonged and curled up at the ends stiffly his piccadilly collar had changed shape and texture and reacheda mass of laceto a point midway of his breast his bootswhy had he not noticed his boots beforethese triumphs of his parisian bootmaker were lost in hideous leathern cases that reached half way up his thighs in place of his former high silk hat there lay upon the ground beside him the awful thing he had just taken offa mass of thickened felt flap feather and buckle that weighed at least a stone  a single terrible idea now took possession of him he had been sold taken in done for he saw it all in a state of intoxication he had lost his way had been dragged into some vile den stripped of his clothes and valuables and turned adrift upon the quiet town in this shameless masquerade how should he keep his appointment how inform the police of this outrage upon a stranger and an american citizen how establish his identity had they spared his papers he felt feverishly in his breast ahhis watch yes a watchheavy jewelled enamelledand by all that was ridiculous five others he ran his hands into his capacious trunk hose what was this brooches chains fingerringsone large episcopal oneearrings and a handful of battered gold and silver coins his papers his memorandums his passportall proofs of his identitywere gone in their place was the unmistakable omnium gatherum of an accomplished knight of the road not only was his personality but his character gone forever  it was a part of mr clinchs singular experience that this last stroke of ill fortune seemed to revive in him something of the brutal instinct he had felt a moment before he turned eagerly about with the intention of calling some onethe first person he metto account but the house that he had just quitted was gone the wall ah there it was no longer purposeless intrusive and ivyclad but part of the buttress of another massive wall that rose into battlements above him mr clinch turned again hopelessly toward sammtstadt there was the fringe of poplars on the rhine there were the outlying fields lit by the same meridian sun but the characteristic chimneys of sammtstadt were gone mr clinch was hopelessly lost  the sound of a horn breaking the stillness recalled his senses he now for the first time perceived that a little distance below him partly hidden in the trees was a queer towershaped structure with chains and pulleys that in some strange way recalled his boyish reading a drawbridge and portcullis and on the battlement a figure in a masquerading dress as absurd as his own flourishing a banner and trumpet and trying to attract his attention  was wollen sie  i want to see the proprietor said mr clinch choking back his rage  there was a pause and the figure turned apparently to consult with some one behind the battlements after a moment he reappeared and in a perfunctory monotone with an occasional breathing spell on the trumpet began  you do give warranty as a good knight and true as well as by the bones of the blessed st ursula that you bear no ill will secret enmity wicked misprise or conspiracy against the body of our noble lord and master von kolnsche and you bring with you no ambush siege or surprise of retainers neither secret warrant nor lettres de cachet nor carry on your knightly person poisoned dagger magic ring witchpowder nor enchanted bullet and that you have entered into no unhallowed alliance with the prince of darkness gnomes hexies dragons undines loreleis nor the like  come down out of that you dd old fool roared mr clinch now perfectly beside himself with ragecome down and let me in  as mr clinch shouted out the last words confused cries of recognition and welcome not unmixed with some consternation rose from the battlements ach gott mutter gottit is he it is jann der wanderer it is himself the chains rattled the ponderous drawbridge creaked and dropped and across it a medley of motley figures rushed pellmell but foremost among them the very maiden whom he had left not ten minutes before flew into his arms and with a cry of joyful greeting sank upon his breast mr clinch looked down upon the fair head and long braids it certainly was the same maiden his cruel enchantress but where did she get those absurd garments  willkommen said a stout figure advancing with some authority and seizing his disengaged hand where hast thou been so long  mr clinch by no means placated coldly dropped the extended hand it was not the proprietor he had known but there was a singular resemblance in his face to some one of mr clinchs own kin but who he could not remember may i take the liberty of asking your name he asked coldly  the figure grinned surely but if thou standest upon punctilio it is for me to ask thine most noble freiherr said he winking upon his retainers whom have i the honor of entertaining  my name is clinchjames clinch of chicago ill  a shout of laughter followed in the midst of his rage and mortification mr clinch fancied he saw a shade of pain and annoyance flit across the face of the maiden he was puzzled but pressed her hand in spite of his late experiences reassuringly she made a gesture of silence to him and then slipped away in the crowd  schames klnsche von schekargo mimicked the figure to the unspeakable delight of his retainers so that is the latest french style holy st ursula hark ye nephew i am not a travelled man since the crusades we simple rhine gentlemen have staid at home but i call myself kolnsche of koln at your service  very likely you are right said mr clinch hotly disregarding the caution of his fair companion but whoever you are i am a stranger entitled to protection i have been robbed  if mr clinch had uttered an exquisite joke instead of a very angry statement it could not have been more hilariously received he paused grew confused and then went on hesitatingly  in place of my papers and credentials i find only these and he produced the jewelry from his pockets  another shout of laughter and clapping of hands followed this second speech and the baron with a wink at his retainers prolonged the general mirth by saying by the way nephew there is little doubt but there has been robberysomewhere  it was done continued mr clinch hurrying to make an end of his explanation while i was inadvertently overcome with liquordrugged liquor  the laughter here was so uproarious that the baron albeit with tears of laughter in his own eyes made a peremptory gesture of silence the gesture was peculiar to the baron efficacious and simple it consisted merely in knocking down the nearest laugher having thus restored tranquillity he strode forward and took mr clinch by the hand by st adolph i did doubt thee a moment ago nephew but this last frank confession of thine shows me i did thee wrong willkommen zu hause jann drunk or sober willcommen zu cracowen  more and more mystified but convinced of the folly of any further explanation mr clinch took the extended hand of his alleged uncle and permitted himself to be led into the castle they passed into a large banquetinghall adorned with armor and implements of the chase mr clinch could not help noticing that although the appointments were liberal and picturesque the ventilation was bad and the smoke from the huge chimney made the air murky the oaken tables massive in carving and rich in color were unmistakably greasy and mr clinch slipped on a piece of meat that one of the dozen halfwild dogs who were occupying the room was tearing on the floor the dog yelping ran between the legs of a retainer precipitating him upon the baron who instantly with the equal foot of fate kicked him and the dog into a corner  and whence came you last asked the baron disregarding the little contretemps and throwing himself heavily on an oaken settle while he pushed a queer uncomfortablelooking stool with legs like a siamesetwinconnected double x towards his companion  mr clinch who had quite given himself up to fate answered mechanically  paris  the baron winked his eye with unutterable elderly wickedness ach gott it is nothing to what it was when i was your age ah there was manonsieur manon we used to call her i suppose shes getting old now how goes on the feud between the students and the citizens eh did you go to the bal in la cite  mr clinch stopped the flow of those justiceshallowlike reminiscences by an uneasy exclamation he was thinking of the maiden who had disappeared so suddenly the baron misinterpreted his nervousness what ho within theremax wolfganglazy rascals bring some wine  at the baleful word mr clinch started to his feet not for me bring me none of your bodyandsouldestroying poison ive enough of it  the baron stared the servitors stared also  i beg your pardon said mr clinch recalling himself slowly but i fear that rhine wine does not agree with me  the baron grinned perceiving however that the three servitors grinned also he kicked two of them into obscurity and felled the third to the floor with his fist hark ye nephew he said turning to the astonished clinch give over this nonsense by the mitre of bishop hatto thou art as big a fool as he  hatto repeated clinch mechanically what he of the mouse tower  ay of the mouse tower sneered the baron i see you know the story  why am i like him asked mr clinch in amazement  the baron grinned he punished the rhenish wine as thou dost without judgment he had  the jimjams said mr clinch mechanically again  the baron frowned i know not what gibberish thou sayest by jimjams but he had like thee the wildest fantasies and imaginings saw snakes toads rats in his boots but principally rats said they pursued him came to his room his bedach gott  oh said mr clinch with a sudden return to his firmer self and his native inquiring habits then that is the fact about bishop hatto of the story  his enemies made it the subject of a vile slander of an old friend of mine said the baron and those cursed poets who believe everything and then persuade others to do somay the devil fly away with themkept it up  here were facts quite to mr clinchs sceptical mind he forgot himself and his surroundings  and that story of the drachenfels he asked insinuatinglythe dragon you know was he too  the baron grinned a boar transformed by the drunken brains of the bauers of the siebengebirge ach gott ottefried had many a hearty laugh over it and it did him as thou knowest good service with the nervous mother of the silly maiden  and the seven sisters of schonberg asked mr clinch persuasively  schonberg seven sisters what of them demanded the baron sharply  why you knowthe maidens who were so coy to their suitors anddont you rememberjumped into the rhine to avoid them  coy jumped into the rhine to avoid suitors roared the baron purple with rage hark ye nephew i like not this jesting thou knowest i married one of the schonberg girls as did thy father how coy they were is neither here nor there but mayhap we might tell another story thy father as weak a fellow as thou art where a petticoat is concerned could not as a gentleman do other than he did and this is his reward ach gott coy and this i warrant is the way the story is delivered in paris  mr clinch would have answered that this was the way he read it in a guidebook but checked himself at the hopelessness of the explanation besides he was on the eve of historic information he was as it were interviewing the past and whether he would ever be able to profit by the opportunity or not he could not bear to lose it and how about the loreleiis she too a fiction he asked glibly  it was said observed the baron sardonically that when thou disappeared with the gamekeepers daughter at obercasselheaven knows wherethou wast swallowed up in a whirlpool with some creature ach gott i believe it but a truce to this balderdash and so thou wantest to know of the coy sisters of schoenberg hark ye jann that cousin of thine is a schonberg call you her coy did i not see thy greeting eh by st adolph knowing thee as she does to be robber and thief call you her greeting coy  furious as mr clinch inwardly became under these epithets he felt that his explanation would hardly relieve the maiden from deceit or himself from weakness but out of his very perplexity and turmoil a bright idea was born he turned to the baron  then you have no faith in the rhine legends  the baron only replied with a contemptuous shrug of his shoulders  but what if i told you a new one  you  yes a part of my experience  the baron was curious it was early in the afternoon just after dinner he might be worse bored  ive only one condition added mr clinch the young ladyi mean of course my cousinmust hear it too  oh ay i see of coursethe old trick well call the jade but mark ye sir nephew no enchanted maidens and knights keep to thyself be as thou art vagabond jann kolnische knight of the roadwhat ho there scoundrels call the lady wilhemina  it was the first time mr clinch had heard his fair friends name but it was not evidently the first time she had seen him as the very decided wink the gentle maiden dropped him testified nevertheless with hands lightly clasped together and downcast eyes she stood before them  mr clinch began without heeding the barons scornful grin he graphically described his meeting two years before with a lorelei her usual pressing invitation and his subsequent plunge into the rhine  i am free to confess added mr clinch with an affecting glance to wilhelmina that i was not enamoured of the graces of the lady but was actuated by my desire to travel and explore hitherto unknown regions i wished to travel to visit  paris interrupted the baron sarcastically  america continued mr clinch  whatamerica  tis a gnomelike sounding name this meriker go on nephew tell us of meriker  with the characteristic fluency of his nation mr clinch described his landing on those enchanted shores viz the rhine whirlpool and hell gate east river new york he described the railways tramways telegraphs hotels phonograph and telephone an occasional oath broke from the baron but he listened attentively and in a few moments mr clinch had the raconteurs satisfaction of seeing the vast hall slowly filling with openeyed and openmouthed retainers hanging upon his words mr clinch went on to describe his astonishment at meeting on these very shores some of his own blood and kin in fact said mr clinch here were a race calling themselves clinch but all claiming to have descended from kolnische  and how sneered the baron  through james kolnische and wilhelmina his wife returned mr clinch boldly they emigrated from koln and crefeld to philadelphia where there is a quarter named crefeld mr clinch felt himself shaky as to his chronology but wisely remembered that it was a chronology of the future to his hearers and they could not detect an anachronism with his eyes fixed upon those of the gentle wilhelmina mr clinch now proceeded to describe his return to his fatherland but his astonishment at finding the very face of the country changed and a city standing on those fields he had played in as a boy and how he had wandered hopelessly on until he at last sat wearily down in a humble cottage built upon the ruins of a lordly castle so utterly travelworn and weak had i become said mr clinch with adroitly simulated pathos that a single glass of wine offered me by the simple cottage maiden affected me like a prolonged debauch  a longdrawn snore was all that followed this affecting climax the baron was asleep the retainers were also asleep only one pair of eyes remained openarch luminous bluewilhelminas  there is a subterranean passage below us to linn let us fly she whispered  but why  they always do it in the legends she murmured modestly  but your father  he sleeps do you not hear him  certainly somebody was snoring but oddly enough it seemed to be wilhelmina mr clinch suggested this to her  fool it is yourself  mr clinch struck with the idea stopped to consider she was right it certainly was himself  with a struggle he awoke the sun was shining the maiden was looking at him but the castlethe castle was gone  you have slept well said the maiden archly everybody does after dinner at sammtstadt father has just awakened and is coming  mr clinch stared at the maiden at the terrace at the sky at the distant chimneys of sammtstadt at the more distant rhine at the table before him and finally at the empty glass the maiden smiled tell me said mr clinch looking in her eyes is there a secret passage underground between this place and the castle of linn  an underground passage  aywhence the daughter of the house fled with a stranger knight  they say there is said the maiden with a gentle blush  can you show it to me  she hesitated papa is coming ill ask him  i presume she did at least the herr consul at sammtstadt informs me of a marriagecertificate issued to one clinch of chicago and kolnische of koln and there is an amusing story extant in the verein at sammtstadt of an american connoisseur of rhine wines who mistook a flask of cognac and rockcandy used for craftily qualifying lower grades of wine to the american standard for the rarest rudesheimerberg     views from a german spion   outside of my window two narrow perpendicular mirrors parallel with the casement project into the street yet with a certain unobtrusiveness of angle that enables them to reflect the people who pass without any reciprocal disclosure of their own the men and women hurrying by not only do not know they are observed but what is worse do not even see their own reflection in this hypocritical plane and are consequently unable through its aid to correct any carelessness of garb gait or demeanor at first this seems to be taking an unfair advantage of the human animal who invariably assumes an attitude when he is conscious of being under human focus but i observe that my neighbors windows right and left have a similar apparatus that this custom is evidently a local one and the locality is german being an american stranger i am quite willing to leave the morality of the transaction with the locality and adapt myself to the custom indeed i had thought of offering it figuratively as an excuse for any unfairness of observation i might make in these pages but my german mirrors reflect without prejudice selection or comment and the american eye i fear is but mortal and like all mortal eyes figuratively as well as in that literal fact noted by an eminent scientific authority infinitely inferior to the work of the best german opticians  and this leads me to my first observation namely that a majority of those who pass my mirror have weak eyes and have already invoked the aid of the optician why are these people physically in all else so much stronger than my countrymen deficient in eyesight or to omit the passing testimony of my spion and take my own personal experience why does my young friend max brightest of all schoolboys who already wears the cap that denotes the highest classwhy does he shock me by suddenly drawing forth a pair of spectacles that upon his fresh rosy face would be an obvious mocking imitation of the herr papaif german children could ever by any possibility be irreverent or why does the fraulein marie his sister pink as aurora round as hebe suddenly veil her blue eyes with a golden lorgnette in the midst of our polyglot conversation is it to evade the direct admiring glance of the impulsive american dare i say no dare i say that that frank clear honest earnest return of the eye which has on the continent most unfairly brought my fair countrywomen under criticism is quite as common to her more carefullyguarded traditionhedged german sisters no it is not that is it any thing in these emerald and opal tinted skies which seem so unreal to the american eye and for the first time explain what seemed the unreality of german art in these mysterious yet restful rhine fogs which prolong the twilight and hang the curtain of romance even over midday surely not is it not rather o herr professor profound in analogy and philosophyis it not rather this abominable blackletter this elsewherediscarded uncouth slowlydecaying text known as the german alphabet that plucks out the bright eyes of youth and bristles the gateways of your language with a chevaux de frise of splintered rubbish why must i hesitate whether it is an accident of the printers press or the poor quality of the paper that makes this letter a k or a t why must i halt in an emotion or a thought because s and f are so nearly alike is it not enough that i an impulsive american accustomed to do a thing first and reflect upon it afterwards must grope my way through a blind alley of substantives and adjectives only to find the verb of action in an obscure corner without ruining my eyesight in the groping  but i dismiss these abstract reflections for a fresh and active resentment this is the fifth or sixth dog that has passed my spion harnessed to a small barrowlike cart and tugging painfully at a burden so ludicrously disproportionate to his size that it would seem a burlesque but for the poor dogs sad sincerity perhaps it is because i have the barbarians fondness for dogs and for their lawless gentle loving uselessness that i rebel against this unnatural servitude it seems as monstrous as if a child were put between the shafts and made to carry burdens and i have come to regard those men and women who in the weakest perfunctory way affect to aid the poor brute by laying idle hands on the barrow behind as i would unnatural parents pegasus harnessed to the thracian herdsmans plough was no more of a desecration i fancy the poor dog seems to feel the monstrosity of the performance and in sheer shame for his master forgivingly tries to assume it is play and i have seen a little colley running along barking and endeavoring to leap and gambol in the shafts before a load that any one out of this locality would have thought the direst cruelty nor do the older or more powerful dogs seem to become accustomed to it when his cruel taskmaster halts with his wares instantly the dog either by sitting down in his harness or crawling over the shafts or by some unmistakable doglike trick utterly scatters any such delusion of even the habit of servitude the few of his race who do not work in this ducal city seem to have lost their democratic canine sympathies and look upon him with something of that indifferent calm with which yonder officer eyes the roadmender in the ditch below him he loses even the characteristics of species the common cur and mastiff look alike in harness the burden levels all distinctions i have said that he was generally sincere in his efforts i recall but one instance to the contrary i remember a young colley who first attracted my attention by his persistent barking whether he did this as the ploughboy whistled for want of thought or whether it was a running protest against his occupation i could not determine until one day i noticed that in barking he slightly threw up his neck and shoulders and that the twowheeled barrowlike vehicle behind him having its weight evenly poised on the wheels by the trucks in the hands of its driver enabled him by this movement to cunningly throw the center of gravity and the greater weight on the mana fact which that less sagacious brute never discerned perhaps i am using a strong expression regarding his driver it may be that the purely animal wants of the dog in the way of food care and shelter are more bountifully supplied in servitude than in freedom becoming a valuable and useful property he may be cared for and protected as such an odd recollection that this argument had been used forcibly in regard to human slavery in my own country strikes me here but his picturesqueness and poetry are gone and i cannot help thinking that the people who have lost this gentle sympathetic characteristic figure from their domestic life and surroundings have not acquired an equal gain through his harsh labors  to the american eye there is throughout the length and breadth of this foreign city no more notable and striking object than the average german houseservant it is not that she has passed my spion a dozen times within the last hourfor here she is messenger porter and commissionnaire as well as housemaid and cookbut that she is always a phenomenon to the american stranger accustomed to be abused in his own country by his foreign irish handmaiden her presence is as refreshing and grateful as the morning light and as inevitable and regular when i add that with the novelty of being well served is combined the satisfaction of knowing that you have in your household an intelligent being who reads and writes with fluency and yet does not abstract your books nor criticise your literary composition who is cleanly clad and neat in her person without the suspicion of having borrowed her mistresss dresses who may be goodlooking without the least imputation of coquetry or addition to her followers who is obedient without servility polite without flattery willing and replete with supererogatory performance without the expectation of immediate pecuniary return what wonder that the american householder translated into german life feels himself in a new eden of domestic possibilities unrealized in any other country and begins to believe in a present and future of domestic happiness what wonder that the american bachelor living in german lodgings feels half the terrors of the conjugal future removed and rushes madly into loveand housekeeping what wonder that i a longsuffering and patient master who have been served by the reticent but too imitative chinaman who have been massa to the childlike but untruthful negro who have been the recipient of the brotherly but uncertain ministrations of the southsea islander and have been proudly disregarded by the american aborigine only in due time to meet the fate of my countrymen at the hands of bridget the celtwhat wonder that i gladly seize this opportunity to sing the praises of my german handmaid honor to thee lenchen wherever thou goest heaven bless thee in thy walks abroad whether with that tightlybooted cavalryman in thy sunday gown and best or in blue polkadotted apron and bare head as thou trottest nimbly on mine errandserrands which bridget oflaherty would scorn to undertake or undertaking would hopelessly blunder in heaven bless thee child in thy early risings and in thy later sittings at thy festive board overflowing with essig and fett in the mysteries of thy kuchen in the fulness of thy bier and in thy nightly suffocations beneath mountainous and multitudinous feathers good honest simpleminded cheerful dutyloving lenchen have not thy brothers strong and dutiful as thou lent their gravity and earnestness to sweeten and strengthen the fierce youth of the republic beyond the seas and shall not thy children inherit the broad prairies that still wait for them and discover the fatness thereof and send a portion transmuted in glittering shekels back to thee  almost as notable are the children whose round faces have as frequently been reflected in my spion whether it is only a fancy of mine that the average german retains longer than any other race his childish simplicity and unconsciousness or whether it is because i am more accustomed to the extreme selfassertion and early maturity of american children i know not but i am inclined to believe that among no other people is childhood as perennial and to be studied in such characteristic and quaint and simple phases as here the picturesqueness of spanish and italian childhood has a faint suspicion of the pantomime and the conscious attitudinizing of the latin races german children are not exuberant or volatile they are seriousa seriousness however not to be confounded with the grave reflectiveness of age but only the abstract wonderment of childhood for all those who have made a loving study of the young human animal will i think admit that its dominant expression is gravity and not playfulness and will be satisfied that he erred pitifully who first ascribed lightheartedness and thoughtlessness as part of its phenomena these little creatures i meet upon the streetwhether in quaint wooden shoes and short woollen petticoats or neatly booted and furred with school knapsacks jauntily borne upon little square shouldersall carry likewise in their round chubby faces their profound wonderment and astonishment at the big busy world into which they have so lately strayed if i stop to speak with this little maid who scarcely reaches to the topboots of yonder cavalry officer there is less of bashful selfconsciousness in her sweet little face than of grave wonder at the foreign accent and strange ways of this new figure obtruded upon her limited horizon she answers honestly frankly prettily but gravely there is a remote possibility that i might bite and with this suspicion plainly indicated in her round blue eyes she quietly slips her little red hand from mine and moves solemnly away i remember once to have stopped in the street with a fair countrywoman of mine to interrogate a little figure in sabotsthe one quaint object in the long formal perspective of narrow gray bastarditalian facaded houses of a rhenish german strasse the sweet little figure wore a darkblue woollen petticoat that came to its knees gray woollen stockings covered the shapely little limbs below and its very blonde hair the color of a bright dandelion was tied in a pathetic little knot at the back of its round head and garnished with an absurd green ribbon now although this gentlewomans sympathies were catholic and universal unfortunately their expression was limited to her own mothertongue she could not help pouring out upon the child the maternal love that was in her own womanly breast nor could she withhold the babytalk through which it was expressed but alas it was in english hence ensued a colloquy tender and extravagant on the part of the elder grave and wondering on the part of the child but the lady had a natural feminine desire for reciprocity particularly in the presence of our emotionscorning sex and as a last resource she emptied the small silver of her purse into the lap of the coy maiden it was a declaration of love susceptible of translation at the nearest cakeshop but the little maid whose dress and manner certainly did not betray an habitual disregard of gifts of this kind looked at the coin thoughtfully but not regretfully some innate sense of duty equally strong with that of being polite to strangers filled her consciousness with the utterly unexpected remark that her father did not allow her to take money the queer little figure moved away leaving the two americans covered with mortification the rare american child who could have done this would have done it with an attitude this little german bourgeoise did it naturally i do not intend to rush to the deduction that german children of the lower classes habitually refuse pecuniary gratuities indeed i remember to have wickedly suggested to my companion that to avoid impoverishment in a foreign land she should not repeat the story nor the experiment but i simply offer it as a fact and to an american at home or abroad a novel one  i owe to these little figures another experience quite as strange it was at the close of a dull winters daya day from which all outofdoor festivity seemed to be naturally excluded there was a baleful promise of snow in the air and a dismal reminiscence of it under foot when suddenly in striking contrast with the dreadful bleakness of the street a half dozen children masked and bedizened with cheap ribbons spangles and embroidery flashed across my spion i was quick to understand the phenomenon it was the carnival season only the night before i had been to the great opening masqueradea famous affair for which this artloving city is noted and to which strangers are drawn from all parts of the continent i remember to have wondered if the pleasureloving german in america had not broken some of his conventional shackles in emigration for certainly i had found the carnival balls of the lieder kranz society in new york although decorous and fashionable to the american taste to be wild dissipations compared with the practical seriousness of this native performance and i hailed the presence of these children in the open street as a promise of some extravagance real untrammelled and characteristic i seized my hat andovercoata dreadful incongruity to the spangles that had whisked by and followed the vanishing figures round the corner here they were reenforced by a dozen men and women fantastically but not expensively arrayed looking not unlike the supernumeraries of some provincial opera troupe following the crowd which already began to pour in from the sidestreets in a few moments i was in the broad grovelike allee and in the midst of the masqueraders  i remember to have been told that this was a characteristic annual celebration of the lower classes anticipated with eagerness and achieved with difficulty indeed often only through the alternative of pawning clothing and furniture to provide the means for this ephemeral transformation i remember being warned also that the buffoonery was coarse and some of the slang hardly fit for ears polite but i am afraid that i was not shocked at the prodigality of these poor people who purchased a holiday on such hard conditions and as to the coarseness of the performance i felt that i certainly might go where these children could  at first the masquerading figures appeared to be mainly composed of young girls of ages varying from nine to eighteen their costumesif what was often only the addition of a broad brightcolored stripe to the hem of a short dress could be called a costumewere plain and seemed to indicate no particular historical epoch or character a general suggestion of the peasants holiday attire was dominant in all the costumes everybody was closely masked all carried a short gaylystriped baton of split wood called a pritsche which when struck sharply on the back or shoulders of some spectator or sistermasker emitted a clattering rasping sound to wander hand in hand down this broad allee to strike almost mechanically and often monotonously at each other with their batons seemed to be the extent of that wild dissipation the crowd thickened young men with false noses hideous masks cheap black or red cotton dominoes soldiers in uniform crowded past each other up and down the promenade all carrying a pritsche and exchanging blows with each other but always with the same slow seriousness of demeanor which with their silence gave the performance the effect of a religious rite occasionally some one shouted perhaps a dozen young fellows broke out in song but the shout was provocative of nothing the song faltered as if the singers were frightened at their own voices one blithe fellow with a bears head on his furcapped shoulders began to dance but on the crowd stopping to observe him seriously he apparently thought better of it and slipped away nevertheless the solemn beating of pritschen over each others backs went on i remember that i was followed the whole length of the allee by a little girl scarcely twelve years old in a bright striped skirt and black mask who from time to time struck me over the shoulders with a regularity and sad persistency that was peculiarly irresistible to me the more so as i could not help thinking that it was not half as amusing to herself once only did the ordinary brusque gallantry of the carnival spirit show itself a man with an enormous pair of horns like a halfcivilized satyr suddenly seized a young girl and endeavored to kiss her a slight struggle ensued in which i fancied i detected in the girls face and manner the confusion and embarrassment of one who was obliged to overlook or seem to accept a familiarity that was distasteful rather than be laughed at for prudishness or ignorance but the incident was exceptional indeed it was particularly notable to my american eyes to find such decorum where there might easily have been the greatest license i am afraid that an american mob of this class would have scarcely been as orderly and civil under the circumstances they might have shown more humor but there would have probably been more effrontery they might have been more exuberant they would certainly have been drunker i did not notice a single masquerader unduly excited by liquor there was not a word or motion from the lighter sex that could have been construed into an impropriety there was something almost pathetic to me in this attempt to wrest gayety and excitement out of these dull materials to fight against the blackness of that wintry sky and the stubborn hardness of the frozen soil with these painted sticks of wood to mock the dreariness of their poverty with these flaunting raiments it did not seem like them or rather consistent with my idea of them there was incongruity deeper than their bizarre externals a halfmelancholy halfcrazy absurdity in their action the substitution of a grim spasmodic frenzy for levity that rightly or wrongly impressed me when the increasing gloom of the evening made their figures undistinguishable i turned into the first crossstreet as i lifted my hat to my persistent young friend with the pritsche i fancied she looked as relieved as myself if however i was mistaken if that childs pathway through life be strewn with rosy recollections of the unresisting back of the stranger american if any burden o gretchen laid upon thy young shoulders be lighter for the trifling one thou didst lay upon mineknow then that i too am content  and so day by day has my spion reflected the various changing forms of life before it it has seen the first flush of spring in the broad allee when the shadows of tiny leaflets overhead were beginning to checker the cool square flagstones it has seen the glare and fulness of summer sunshine and shadow the flying of november gold through the air the gaunt limbs and stark rigid deathlike whiteness of winter it has seen children in their queer wicker babycarriages old men and women and occasionally that grim usher of death in sable cloak and cocked hata baleful figure for the wandering invalid tourist to meetwho acts as undertaker for this ducal city and marshals the last melancholy procession i well remember my first meeting with this ominous functionary it was an early autumnal morning so early that the long formal perspective of the allee and the decorous smooth vanishinglines of creamandgray fronted houses were unrelieved by a single human figure suddenly a tall black spectre as theatrical and as unreal as the painted scenic distance turned the corner from a crossstreet and moved slowly towards me a long black cloak falling from its shoulders to its feet floated out on either side like sable wings a cocked hat trimmed with crape and surmounted by a hearselike feather covered a passionless face and its eyes looking neither left nor right were fixed fatefully upon some distant goal stranger as i was to this continental ceremonial figure there was no mistaking his functions as the grim messenger knocking with equal foot on every door and indeed so perfectly did he act and look his role that there was nothing ludicrous in the extraordinary spectacle facial expression and dignity of bearing were perfect the whole man seemed saturated with the accepted sentiment of his office recalling the halfconfused and halfconscious ostentatious hypocrisy of the american sexton the shameless absurdities of the english mutes and mourners i could not help feeling that if it were demanded that grief and fate should be personified it were better that it should be well done and it is one observation of my spion that this sincerity and belief is the characteristic of all continental functionaries  it is possible that my spion has shown me little that is really characteristic of the people and the few observations i have made i offer only as an illustration of the impressions made upon twothirds of american strangers in the larger towns of germany assimilation goes on more rapidly than we are led to imagine as i have seen my friend karl fresh and awkward in his first uniform lounging later down the allee with the blase listlessness of a fullblown militaire so i have seen american and english residents gradually lose their peculiarities and melt and merge into the general mass returning to my spion after a flying trip through belgium and france as i look down the long perspective of the strasse i am conscious of recalling the same style of architecture and humanity at aachen brussels lille and paris and am inclined to believe that even as i would have met in a journey of the same distance through a parallel of the same latitude in america a greater diversity of type and character and a more distinct flavor of locality even so would i have met a more heterogeneous and picturesque display from a club window on fifth avenue new york or montgomery street san francisco
