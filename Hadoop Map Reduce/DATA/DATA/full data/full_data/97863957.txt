behold  not another tho consumed be my wrought image   who opposeth  exalteth himself above all that is called god or is  worshipped      illustration  for god speaketh once yea twice  man percieveth it not   in a dream in a vision of the night in deep slumberings upon the bed  then he openeth the ears of men  sealeth their instruction   that he may withdraw man from his purpose  hide pride from man if  there be with him an interpreter one among a thousand   then he is gracious unto him  saith deliver him from going down to the  pit i have found a ransom   for his eyes are upon the ways of man  he observeth all his goings   i am young and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid   lo all these things worketh god oftentimes with man to bring back his  soul from the pit to be enlightened

tabernacle   also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth the bright  cloud also it is turned about by his counsels   of behemoth he saith he is chief of the ways of god of leviathan he  saith he is king over all the children of pride   behold now behemoth which i made with thee      illustration  hell is naked before him  destruction has no covering   canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out the almighty  to perfection   the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our  god day  night   it is higher than heaven what canst thou do it is deeper than hell what  canst thou know   the prince of this world shall be cast out   thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked   even the devils are subject to us thro thy name jesus said unto them i  saw satan as lightning fall from heaven   god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise  and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things  that are mighty

those that curse you do good to  those that hate you  pray for those that despitefully use  persecute  you   that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he  maketh his sun to shine on the evil  the good  sendeth the rain on  the just  the unjust   be ye therefor perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect      illustration  the lord maketh poor  maketh rich   he bringeth low  lifteth up   who provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto god   every one also gave him a piece of money   who remembered us in our low estate for his mercy endureth forever      illustration  how precious are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of  them   there were not found women fair as the daughters of job in all the land   their father gave them
