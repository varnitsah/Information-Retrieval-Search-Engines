93988331	a true relation  of the  apparition of one mrs veal  the next day after her death  to one  mrs bargrave at canterbury  the 8th of september 1705  which apparition recommends the perusal of drelincourts book of consolations against the fears of death     the preface   this relation is matter of fact and attended with such circumstances as may induce any reasonable man to believe it it was sent by a gentleman a justice of peace at maidstone in kent and a very intelligent person to his friend in london as it is here worded which discourse is attested by a very sober and understanding gentlewoman a kinswoman of the said gentlemans who lives in canterbury within a few doors of the house in which the withinnamed mrs bargrave lives who believes his kinswoman to be of so discerning a spirit as not to be put upon by any fallacy and who positively assured him that the whole matter as it is related and laid down is really true and what she herself had in the same words as near as may be from mrs bargraves own mouth who she knows had no reason to invent and publish such a story or any design to forge and tell a lie being a woman of much honesty and virtue and her whole life a course as it were of piety the use which we ought to make of it is to consider that there is a life to come after this and a just god who will retribute to every one according to the deeds done in the body and therefore to reflect upon our past course of life we have led in the world that our time is short and uncertain and that if we would escape the punishment of the ungodly and receive the reward of the righteous which is the laying hold of eternal life we ought for the time to come to return to god by a speedy repentance ceasing to do evil and learning to do well to seek after god early if happily he may be found of us and lead such lives for the future as may be well pleasing in his sight     a relation  of the  apparition of mrs veal   this thing is so rare in all its circumstances and on so good authority that my reading and conversation has not given me anything like it it is fit to gratify the most ingenious and serious inquirer mrs bargrave is the person to whom mrs veal appeared after her death she is my intimate friend and i can avouch for her reputation for these last fifteen or sixteen years on my own knowledge and i can confirm the good character she had from her youth to the time of my acquaintance though since this relation she is calumniated by some people that are friends to the brother of this mrs veal who appeared who think the relation of this appearance to be a reflection and endeavour what they can to blast mrs bargraves reputation and to laugh the story out of countenance but by the circumstances thereof and the cheerful disposition of mrs bargrave notwithstanding the illusage of a very wicked husband there is not yet the least sign of dejection in her face nor did i ever hear her let fall a desponding or murmuring expression nay not when actually under her husbands barbarity which i have been witness to and several other persons of undoubted reputation  now you must know mrs veal was a maiden gentlewoman of about thirty years of age and for some years last past had been troubled with fits which were perceived coming on her by her going off from her discourse very abruptly to some impertinence she was maintained by an only brother and kept his house in dover she was a very pious woman and her brother a very sober man to all appearance but now he does all he can to null or quash the story mrs veal was intimately acquainted with mrs bargrave from her childhood mrs veals circumstances were then mean her father did not take care of his children as he ought so that they were exposed to hardships and mrs bargrave in those days had as unkind a father though she wanted neither for food nor clothing whilst mrs veal wanted for both insomuch that she would often say mrs bargrave you are not only the best but the only friend i have in the world and no circumstance of life shall ever dissolve my friendship they would often condole each others adverse fortunes and read together drelincourt upon death and other good books and so like two christian friends they comforted each other under their sorrow  some time after mr veals friends got him a place in the customhouse at dover which occasioned mrs veal by little and little to fall off from her intimacy with mrs bargrave though there was never any such thing as a quarrel but an indifferency came on by degrees till at last mrs bargrave had not seen her in two years and a half though above a twelvemonth of the time mrs bargrave hath been absent from dover and this last half year has been in canterbury about two months of the time dwelling in a house of her own  in this house on the 8th of september 1705 she was sitting alone in the forenoon thinking over her unfortunate life and arguing herself into a due resignation to providence though her condition seemed hard and said she i have been provided for hitherto and doubt not but i shall be still and am well satisfied that my afflictions shall end when it is most fit for me and then took up her sewingwork which she had no sooner done but she hears a knocking at the door she went to see who was there and this proved to be mrs veal her old friend who was in a ridinghabit at that moment of time the clock struck twelve at noon  madam says mrs bargrave i am surprised to see you you have been so long a stranger but told her she was glad to see her and offered to salute her which mrs veal complied with till their lips almost touched and then mrs veal drew her hand across her own eyes and said i am not very well and so waived it she told mrs bargrave she was going a journey and had a great mind to see her first but says mrs bargrave how came you to take a journey alone i am amazed at it because i know you have a fond brother oh says mrs veal i gave my brother the slip and came away because i had so great a desire to see you before i took my journey so mrs bargrave went in with her into another room within the first and mrs veal sat her down in an elbowchair in which mrs bargrave was sitting when she heard mrs veal knock then says mrs veal my dear friend i am come to renew our old friendship again and beg your pardon for my breach of it and if you can forgive me you are the best of women o says mrs bargrave do not mention such a thing i have not had an uneasy thought about it i can easily forgive it what did you think of me said mrs veal says mrs bargrave i thought you were like the rest of the world and that prosperity had made you forget yourself and me then mrs veal reminded mrs bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity what books they read and what comfort in particular they received from drelincourts book of death which was the best she said on that subject ever written she also mentioned dr sherlock the two dutch books which were translated written upon death and several others but drelincourt she said had the clearest notions of death and of the future state of any who had handled that subject then she asked mrs bargrave whether she had drelincourt she said yes says mrs veal fetch it and so mrs bargrave goes up stairs and brings it down says mrs veal dear mrs bargrave if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard the notions we have of heaven now are nothing like what it is as drelincourt says therefore be comforted under your afflictions and believe that the almighty has a particular regard to you and that your afflictions are marks of gods favour and when they have done the business they are sent for they shall be removed from you and believe me my dear friend believe what i say to you one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings for i can never believe and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness which indeed ran through most of her discourse that ever god will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state but be assured that your afflictions shall leave you or you them in a short time she spake in that pathetical and heavenly manner that mrs bargrave wept several times she was so deeply affected with it  then mrs veal mentioned dr kenricks ascetick at the end of which he gives an account of the lives of the primitive christians their pattern she recommended to our imitation and said their conversation was not like this of our age for now says she there is nothing but frothy vain discourse which is far different from theirs theirs was to edification and to build one another up in faith so that they were not as we are nor are we as they were but says she we ought to do as they did there was an hearty friendship among them but where is it now to be found says mrs bargrave it is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days says mrs veal mr norris has a fine copy of verses called friendship in perfection which i wonderfully admire have you seen the book says mrs veal no says mrs bargrave but i have the verses of my own writing out have you says mrs veal then fetch them which she did from above stairs and offered them to mrs veal to read who refused and waived the thing saying holding down her head would make it ache and then desired mrs bargrave to read them to her which she did as they were admiring friendship mrs veal said dear mrs bargrave i shall love you for ever in these verses there is twice used the word elysian ah says mrs veal these poets have such names for heaven she would often draw her hand across her own eyes and say mrs bargrave do not you think i am mightily impaired by my fits no says mrs bargrave i think you look as well as ever i knew you after all this discourse which the apparition put in much finer words than mrs bargrave said she could pretend to and as much more than she can remember for it cannot be thought that an hour and three quarters conversation could all be retained though the main of it she thinks she does she said to mrs bargrave she would have her write a letter to her brother and tell him she would have him give rings to such and such and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin watson  talking at this rate mrs bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon her and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees to keep her from falling to the ground if her fits should occasion it for the elbowchair she thought would keep her from falling on either side and to divert mrs veal as she thought took hold of her gownsleeve several times and commended it mrs veal told her it was a scowered silk and newly made up but for all this mrs veal persisted in her request and told mrs bargrave she must not deny her and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation when she had opportunity dear mrs veal says mrs bargrave this seems so impertinent that i cannot tell how to comply with it and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman why says mrs bargrave it is much better methinks to do it yourself no says mrs veal though it seems impertinent to you now you will see more reason for it hereafter mrs bargrave then to satisfy her importunity was going to fetch a pen and ink but mrs veal said let it alone now but do it when i am gone but you must be sure to do it which was one of the last things she enjoined her at parting and so she promised her  then mrs veal asked for mrs bargraves daughter she said she was not at home but if you have a mind to see her says mrs bargrave ill send for her do says mrs veal on which she left her and went to a neighbours to see for her and by the time mrs bargrave was returning mrs veal was got without the door in the street in the face of the beastmarket on a saturday which is marketday and stood ready to part as soon as mrs bargrave came to her she asked her why she was in such haste she said she must be going though perhaps she might not go her journey till monday and told mrs bargrave she hoped she should see her again at her cousin watsons before she went whither she was going then she said she would take her leave of her and walked from mrs bargrave in her view till a turning interrupted the sight of her which was three quarters after one in the afternoon  mrs veal died the 7th of september at twelve oclock at noon of her fits and had not above four hours senses before her death in which time she received the sacrament the next day after mrs veals appearing being sunday mrs bargrave was mightily indisposed with a cold and a sore throat that she could not go out that day but on monday morning she sent a person to captain watsons to know if mrs veal was there they wondered at mrs bargraves inquiry and sent her word that she was not there nor was expected at this answer mrs bargrave told the maid she had certainly mistook the name or made some blunder and though she was ill she put on her hood and went herself to captain watsons though she knew none of the family to see if mrs veal was there or not they said they wondered at her asking for that she had not been in town they were sure if she had she would have been there says mrs bargrave i am sure she was with me on saturday almost two hours they said it was impossible for they must have seen her if she had in comes capt watson while they were in dispute and said that mrs veal was certainly dead and her escutcheons were making this strangely surprised mrs bargrave when she sent to the person immediately who had the care of them and found it true then she related the whole story to captain watsons family and what gown she had on and how striped and that mrs veal told her it was scowered then mrs watson cried out you have seen her indeed for none knew but mrs veal and myself that the gown was scowered and mrs watson owned that she described the gown exactly for said she i helped her to make it up this mrs watson blazed all about the town and avouched the demonstration of the truth of mrs bargraves seeing mrs veals apparition and captain watson carried two gentlemen immediately to mrs bargraves house to hear the relation of her own mouth and when it spread so fast that gentlemen and persons of quality the judicious and sceptical part of the world flocked in upon her it at last became such a task that she was forced to go out of the way for they were in general extremely satisfied of the truth of the thing and plainly saw that mrs bargrave was no hypocondriac for she always appears with such a cheerful air and pleasing mien that she has gained the favour and esteem of all the gentry and it is thought a great favour if they can but get the relation from her own mouth i should have told you before that mrs veal told mrs bargrave that her sister and brotherinlaw were just come down from london to see her says mrs bargrave how came you to order matters so strangely it could not be helped says mrs veal and her brother and sister did come to see her and entered the town of dover just as mrs veal was expiring mrs bargrave asked her whether she would drink some tea says mrs veal i do not care if i do but ill warrant you this mad fellow meaning mrs bargraves husband has broke all your trinkets but says mrs bargrave ill get something to drink in for all that but mrs veal waived it and said it is no matter let it alone and so it passed  all the time i sat with mrs bargrave which was some hours she recollected fresh sayings of mrs veal and one material thing more she told mrs bargrave that old mr breton allowed mrs veal ten pounds a year which was a secret and unknown to mrs bargrave till mrs veal told it her  mrs bargrave never varies in her story which puzzles those who doubt of the truth or are unwilling to believe it a servant in the neighbours yard adjoining to mrs bargraves house heard her talking to somebody an hour of the time mrs veal was with her mrs bargrave went out to her next neighbours the very moment she parted with mrs veal and told her what ravishing conversation she had with an old friend and told the whole of it drelincourts book of death is since this happened bought up strangely and it is to be observed that notwithstanding all the trouble and fatigue mrs bargrave has undergone upon this account she never took the value of a farthing nor suffered her daughter to take anything of anybody and therefore can have no interest in telling the story  but mr veal does what he can to stifle the matter and said he would see mrs bargrave but yet it is certain matter of fact that he has been at captain watsons since the death of his sister and yet never went near mrs bargrave and some of his friends report her to be a liar and that she knew of mr bretons ten pounds a year but the person who pretends to say so has the reputation of a notorious liar among persons whom i know to be of undoubted credit now mr veal is more of a gentleman than to say she lies but says a bad husband has crazed her but she needs only present herself and it will effectually confute that pretence mr veal says he asked his sister on her deathbed whether she had a mind to dispose of anything and she said no now the things which mrs veals apparition would have disposed of were so trifling and nothing of justice aimed at in their disposal that the design of it appears to me to be only in order to make mrs bargrave so to demonstrate the truth of her appearance as to satisfy the world of the reality thereof as to what she had seen and heard and to secure her reputation among the reasonable and understanding part of mankind and then again mr veal owns that there was a purse of gold but it was not found in her cabinet but in a combbox this looks improbable for that mrs watson owned that mrs veal was so very careful of the key of the cabinet that she would trust nobody with it and if so no doubt she would not trust her gold out of it and mrs veals often drawing her hand over her eyes and asking mrs bargrave whether her fits had not impaired her looks to me as if she did it on purpose to remind mrs bargrave of her fits to prepare her not to think it strange that she should put her upon writing to her brother to dispose of rings and gold which looked so much like a dying persons request and it took accordingly with mrs bargrave as the effects of her fits coming upon her and was one of the many instances of her wonderful love to her and care of her that she should not be affrighted which indeed appears in her whole management particularly in her coming to her in the daytime waiving the salutation and when she was alone and then the manner of her parting to prevent a second attempt to salute her  now why mr veal should think this relation a reflection as it is plain he does by his endeavouring to stifle it i cannot imagine because the generality believe her to be a good spirit her discourse was so heavenly her two great errands were to comfort mrs bargrave in her affliction and to ask her forgiveness for the breach of friendship and with a pious discourse to encourage her so that after all to suppose that mrs bargrave could hatch such an invention as this from friday noon till saturday noon supposing that she knew of mrs veals death the very first moment without jumbling circumstances and without any interest too she must be more witty fortunate and wicked too than any indifferent person i dare say will allow i asked mrs bargrave several times if she was sure she felt the gown she answered modestly if my senses be to be relied on i am sure of it i asked her if she heard a sound when she clapped her hand upon her knee she said she did not remember she did but said she appeared to be as much a substance as i did who talked with her and i may said she be as soon persuaded that your apparition is talking to me now as that i did not really see her for i was under no manner of fear and received her as a friend and parted with her as such i would not says she give one farthing to make any one believe it i have no interest in it nothing but trouble is entailed upon me for a long time for aught i know and had it not come to light by accident it would never have been made public but now she says she will make her own private use of it and keep herself out of the way as much as she can and so she has done since she says she had a gentleman who came thirty miles to her to hear the relation and that she had told it to a room full of people at a time several particular gentlemen have had the story from mrs bargraves own mouth  this thing has very much affected me and i am as well satisfied as i am of the bestgrounded matter of fact and why we should dispute matter of fact because we cannot solve things of which we can have no certain or demonstrative notions seems strange to me mrs bargraves authority and sincerity alone would have been undoubted in any other case     to the reader   the origin of the foregoing curious story seems to have been as follows  an adventurous bookseller had ventured to print a considerable edition of a work by the reverend charles drelincourt minister of the calvinist church in paris and translated by m dassigny under the title of the christians defence against the fear of death with several directions how to prepare ourselves to die well but however certain the prospect of death it is not so agreeable unfortunately as to invite the eager contemplation of the public and drelincourts book being neglected lay a dead stock on the hands of the publisher in this emergency he applied to de foe to assist him by dint of such means as were then as well as now pretty well understood in the literary world in rescuing the unfortunate book from the literary death to which general neglect seemed about to consign it  de foes genius and audacity devised a plan which for assurance and ingenuity defied even the powers of mr puff in the critic for who but himself would have thought of summoning up a ghost from the grave to bear witness in favour of a halting body of divinity there is a matteroffact businesslike style in the whole account of the transaction which bespeaks ineffable powers of selfpossession the narrative is drawn up by a gentleman a justice of peace at maidstone in kent a very intelligent person and moreover the discourse is attested by a very sober gentlewoman who lives in canterbury within a few doors of the house in which mrs bargrave lives the justice believes his kinswoman to be of so discerning a spirit as not to be put upon by any fallacyand the kinswoman positively assures the justice that the whole matter as it is related and laid down is really true and what she herself heard as near as may be from mrs bargraves own mouth who she knows had no reason to invent or publish such a story or any design to forge and tell a lie being a woman of so much honesty and virtue and her whole life a course as it were of piety scepticism itself could not resist this triple court of evidence so artfully combined the justice attesting for the discerning spirit of the sober and understanding gentlewoman his kinswoman and his kinswoman becoming bail for the veracity of mrs bargrave and here gentle reader admire the simplicity of those days had mrs veals visit to her friend happened in our time the conductors of the daily press would have given the word and seven gentlemen unto the said press belonging would with an obedient start have made off for kingston for canterbury for doverfor kamtschatka if necessaryto pose the justice crossexamine mrs bargrave confront the sober and understanding kinswoman and dig mrs veal up from her grave rather than not get to the bottom of the story but in our time we doubt and scrutinize our ancestors wondered and believed  before the story is commenced the understanding gentlewoman not the justice of peace who is the reporter takes some pains to repel the objections made against the story by some of the friends of mrs veals brother who consider the marvel as an aspersion on their family and do what they can to laugh it out of countenance indeed it is allowed with admirable impartiality that mr veal is too much of a gentleman to suppose mrs bargrave invented the storyscandal itself could scarce have supposed thatalthough one notorious liar who is chastised towards the conclusion of the story ventures to throw out such an insinuation no reasonable or respectable person however could be found to countenance the suspicion and mr veal himself opined that mrs bargrave had been driven crazy by a cruel husband and dreamed the whole story of the apparition now all this is sufficiently artful to have vouched the fact as universally known and believed by every one nem con would not have been half so satisfactory to a sceptic as to allow fairly that the narrative had been impugned and hint at the character of one of those sceptics and the motives of another as sufficient to account for their want of belief now to the fact itself  mrs bargrave and mrs veal had been friends in youth and had protested their attachment should last as long as they lived but when mrs veals brother obtained an office in the customs at dover some cessation of their intimacy ensued though without any positive quarrel mrs bargrave had removed to canterbury and was residing in a house of her own when she was suddenly interrupted by a visit from mrs veal as she was sitting in deep contemplation of certain distresses of her own the visitor was in a ridinghabit and announced herself as prepared for a distant journey which seems to intimate that spirits have a considerable distance to go before they arrive at their appointed station and that the females at least put on a habit for the occasion the spirit for such was the seeming mrs veal continued to waive the ceremony of salutation both in going and coming which will remind the reader of a ghostly lovers reply to his mistress in the fine old scottish ballad      why should i come within thy bower       i am no earthly man     and should i kiss thy rosy lips       thy days would not be lang  they then began to talk in the homely style of middleaged ladies and mrs veal proses concerning the conversations they had formerly held and the books they had read together her very recent experience probably led mrs veal to talk of death and the books written on the subject and she pronounced ex cathedrâ as a dead person was best entitled to do that drelincourts book on death was the best book on the subject ever written she also mentioned dr sherlock two dutch books which had been translated and several others but drelincourt she said had the clearest notions of death and the future state of any who had handled that subject she then asked for the work we marvel the edition and impress had not been mentioned and lectured on it with great eloquence and affection dr kenricks ascetick was also mentioned with approbation by this critical spectre the doctors work was no doubt a tenant of the shelf in some favourite publishers shop and mr norriss poem on friendship a work which i doubt though honoured with a ghosts approbation we may now seek for as vainly as correlli tormented his memory to recover the sonata which the devil played to him in a dream presently after from former habits we may suppose the guest desires a cup of tea but bethinking herself of her new character escapes from her own proposal by recollecting that mr bargrave was in the habit of breaking his wifes china it would have been indeed strangely out of character if the spirit had lunched or breakfasted upon tea and toast such a consummation would have sounded as ridiculous as if the statue of the commander in don juan had not only accepted of the invitation of the libertine to supper but had also committed a beefsteak to his flinty jaws and stomach of adamant a little more conversation ensued of a less serious nature and tending to show that even the passage from life to death leaves the female anxiety about person and dress somewhat alive the ghost asked mrs bargrave whether she did not think her very much altered and mrs bargrave of course complimented her on her good looks mrs bargrave also admired the gown which mrs veal wore and as a mark of her perfectly restored confidence the spirit let her into the important secret that it was a scoured silk and lately made up she informed her also of another secret namely that one mr bretton had allowed her ten pounds a year and lastly she requested that mrs bargrave would write to her brother and tell him how to distribute her mourning rings and mentioned there was a purse of gold in her cabinet she expressed some wish to see mrs bargraves daughter but when that good lady went to the next door to seek her she found on her return the guest leaving the house she had got without the door in the street in the face of the beast market on a saturday which is market day and stood ready to part she said she must be going as she had to call upon her cousin watson this appears to be a gratis dictum on the part of the ghost and maintaining the character of mortality to the last she quietly turned the corner and walked out of sight  then came the news of mrs veals having died the day before at noon says mrs bargrave i am sure she was with me on saturday almost two hours and in comes captain watson and says mrs veal was certainly dead and then come all the pieces of evidence and especially the striped silk gown then mrs watson cried out you have seen her indeed for none knew but mrs veal and i that that gown was scoured and she cried that the gown was described exactly for said she i helped her to make it up and next we have the silly attempts made to discredit the history even mr veal her brother was obliged to allow that the gold was found but with a difference and pretended it was not found in a cabinet but elsewhere and in short we have all the gossip of says i and thinks i and says she and thinks she which disputed matters usually excite in a country town  when we have thus turned the tale the seam without it may be thought too ridiculous to have attracted notice but whoever will read it as told by de foe himself will agree that could the thing have happened in reality so it would have been told the sobering the whole supernatural visit into the language of middle or low life gives it an air of probability even in its absurdity the ghost of an excisemans housekeeper and a seamstress were not to converse like brutus with his evil genius and the circumstances of scoured silks broken teachina and such like while they are the natural topics of such persons conversation would one might have thought be the last which an inventor would have introduced into a pretended narrative betwixt the dead and living in short the whole is so distinctly circumstantial that were it not for the impossibility or extreme improbability at least of such an occurrence the evidence could not but support the story  the effect was most wonderful drelincourt upon death attested by one who could speak from experience took an unequalled run the copies had hung on the booksellers hands as heavy as a pile of lead bullets they now traversed the town in every direction like the same balls discharged from a fieldpiece in short the object of mrs veals apparition was perfectly attainedsee the miscellaneous prose works of sir walter scott bart vol iv p 305 ed
