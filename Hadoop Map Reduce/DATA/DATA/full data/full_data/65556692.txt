life    table of contents           inn of tranquility           magpie over the hill           sheepshearing           evolution           riding in the mist           the procession           a christian           wind in the rocks           my distant relative           the black godmother      the inn of tranquillity  under a burning blue sky among the pinetrees and junipers the cypresses and olives of that odyssean coast we came one afternoon on a pink house bearing the legend osteria di tranquillita and partly because of the name and partly because we did not expect to find a house at all in those goathaunted groves above the waves we tarried for contemplation  to the familiar simplicity of that italian building there were not lacking signs of a certain spiritual change for out of the olivegrove which grew to its very doors a skittlealley had been formed and two baby cypresstrees were cut into the effigies of a cock and hen the song of a gramophone too was breaking forth into the air as it were the presiding voice of a high and cosmopolitan mind  and lost in admiration we became conscious of the odour of a fullflavoured cigar yesin the skittlealley a gentleman was standing who wore a bowler hat a bright brown suit pink tie and very yellow boots  his head was round his cheeks fat and wellcoloured his lips red and full under a black moustache and he was regarding us through very thick and halfclosed eyelids  perceiving him to be the proprietor of the high and cosmopolitan mind we accosted him  goodday he replied i spik english  been in amurrica yes  you have a lovely place here  sweeping a glance over the skittlealley he sent forth a long puff of smoke then turning to my companion of the politer sex with the air of one who has made himself perfect master of a foreign tongue he smiled and spoke  tooquiet  precisely the name of your inn perhaps suggests  i change all thatsoon i call it angloamerican hotel  ah yes you are very uptodate already  he closed one eye and smiled  having passed a few more compliments we saluted and walked on and coming presently to the edge of the cliff lay down on the thyme and the crumbled leafdust  all the small singing birds had long been shot and eaten there came to us no sound but that of the waves swimming in on a gentle south wind  the wanton creatures seemed stretching out white arms to the land flying desperately from a sea of such stupendous serenity and over their bare shoulders their hair floated back pale in the sunshine  if the air was void of sound it was full of scentthat delicious and enlivening perfume of mingled gum and herbs and sweet wood being burned somewhere a long way off and a silky golden warmth slanted on to us through the olives and umbrella pines  large winered violets were growing near  on such a cliff might theocritus have lain spinning his songs on that divine sea odysseus should have passed  and we felt that presently the goatgod must put his head forth from behind a rock  it seemed a little queer that our friend in the bowler hat should move and breathe within one short flight of a cuckoo from this home of pan one could not but at first feelingly remember the old boer saying o god what things man sees when he goes out without a gun but soon the infinite incongruity of this juxtaposition began to produce within one a curious eagerness a sort of halfphilosophical delight it began to seem too good almost too romantic to be true to think of the gramophone wedded to the thin sweet singing of the olive leaves in the evening wind to remember the scent of his rank cigar marrying with this wild incense to read that enchanted name inn of tranquillity and hear the bland and affable remark of the gentleman who owned itsuch were indeed phenomena to stimulate souls to speculation  and all unconsciously one began to justify them by thoughts of the other incongruities of existencethe strange the passionate incongruities of youth and age wealth and poverty life and death the wonderful odd bedfellows of this world all those lurid contrasts which haunt a mans spirit till sometimes he is ready to cry out rather than live where such things can be let me die  like a wild bird tracking through the air ones meditation wandered on following that trail of thought till the chance encounter became spiritually luminous  that italian gentleman of the world with his bowler hat his skittlealley his gramophone who had planted himself down in this temple of wild harmony was he not progress itselfthe blind figure with the stomach full of new meats and the brain of raw notions  was he not the very embodiment of the wonderful child civilisation so possessed by a new toy each day that she has no time to master its usenaive creature lost amid her own discoveries  was he not the very symbol of that which was making economists thin thinkers pale artists haggard statesmen baldthe symbol of indigestion incarnate did he not delicious gross unconscious man personify beneath his americoitalian polish all those rank and primitive instincts whose satisfaction necessitated the million miseries of his fellows all those thick rapacities which stir the hatred of the humane and thinskinned and yet ones meditation could not stop thereit was not convenient to the heart  a little above us among the olivetrees two blueclothed peasants man and woman were gathering the fruitfrom some such couple no doubt our friend in the bowler hat had sprung more virile and adventurous than his brothers he had not stayed in the home groves but had gone forth to drink the waters of hustle and commerce and come backwhat he was  and he in turn would beget children and having made his pile out of his angloamerican hotel would place those children beyond the coarser influences of life till they became perhaps even as our selves the salt of the earth and despised him  and i thought i do not despise those peasantsfar from it  i do not despise myselfno more than reason why then despise my friend in the bowler hat who is after all but the necessary link between them and me  i did not despise the olivetrees the warm sun the pine scent all those material things which had made him so thick and strong i did not despise the golden tenuous imaginings which the trees and rocks and sea were starting in my own spirit  why then despise the skittlealley the gramophone those expressions of the spirit of my friend in the billycock hat  to despise them was ridiculous  and suddenly i was visited by a sensation only to be described as a sort of smiling certainty emanating from and as it were still tingling within every nerve of myself but yet vibrating harmoniously with the world around  it was as if i had suddenly seen what was the truth of things not perhaps to anybody else but at all events to me  and i felt at once tranquil and elated as when something is met with which rouses and fascinates in a man all his faculties  for i thought if it is ridiculous in me to despise my friendthat perfect marvel of disharmonyit is ridiculous in me to despise anything if he is a little bit of continuity as perfectly logical an expression of a necessary phase or mood of existence as i myself am then surely there is nothing in all the world that is not a little bit of continuity the expression of a little necessary mood yes i thought he and i and those olivetrees and this spider on my hand and everything in the universe which has an individual shape are all fit expressions of the separate moods of a great underlying mood or principle which must be perfectly adjusted volving and revolving on itself  for if it did not volve and revolve on itself it would peter out at one end or the other and the image of this petering out no man with his mental apparatus can conceive therefore one must conclude it to be perfectly adjusted and everlasting  but if it is perfectly adjusted and everlasting we are all little bits of continuity and if we are all little bits of continuity it is ridiculous for one of us to despise another  so i thought i have now proved it from my friend in the billycock hat up to the universe and from the universe down back again to my friend  and i lay on my back and looked at the sky  it seemed friendly to my thought with its smile and few white clouds saffrontinged like the plumes of a white duck in sunlight  and yet i wondered though my friend and i may be equally necessary i am certainly irritated by him and shall as certainly continue to be irritated not only by him but by a thousand other men and so with a light heart you may go on being irritated with your friend in the bowler hat you may go on loving those peasants and this sky and sea  but since you have this theory of life you may not despise any one or any thing not even a skittlealley for they are all threaded to you and to despise them would be to blaspheme against continuity and to blaspheme against continuity would be to deny eternity  love you cannot help and hate you cannot help but contempt isfor youthe sovereign idiocy the irreligious fancy  there was a bee weighing down a blossom of thyme close by and underneath the stalk a very ugly little centipede  the wild bee with his little dark body and his busy bears legs was lovely to me and the creepy centipede gave me shudderings but it was a pleasant thing to feel so sure that he no less than the bee was a little mood expressing himself out in harmony with designs tiny thread on the miraculous quilt  and i looked at him with a sudden zest and curiosity it seemed to me that in the mystery of his queer little creepings i was enjoying the supreme mystery and i thought if i knew all about that wriggling beast then indeed i might despise him but truly if i knew all about him i should know all about everythingmystery would be gone and i could not bear to live  so i stirred him with my finger and he went away  but howi thought about such as do not feel it ridiculous to despise how about those whose temperaments and religions show them all things so plainly that they know they are right and others wrong  they must be in a bad way  and for some seconds i felt sorry for them and was discouraged  but then i thought not at allobviously not  for if they do not find it ridiculous to feel contempt they are perfectly right to feel contempt it being natural to them and you have no business to be sorry for them for that is after all only your euphemism for contempt  they are all right being the expressions of contemptuous moods having religions and so forth suitable to these moods and the religion of your mood would be greek to them and probably a matter for contempt  but this only makes it the more interesting  for though to you for instance it may seem impossible to worship mystery with one lobe of the brain and with the other to explain it the thought that this may not seem impossible to others should not discourage you it is but another little piece of that mystery which makes life so wonderful and sweet  the sun fallen now almost to the level of the cliff was slanting upward on to the burntred pine boughs which had taken to themselves a quaint resemblance to the great brown limbs of the wild men titian drew in his pagan pictures and down below us the seanymphs still swimming to shore seemed eager to embrace them in the enchanted groves  all was fused in that golden glow of the sun going downsea and land gathered into one transcendent mood of light and colour as if mystery desired to bless us by showing how perfect was that worshipful adjustment whose secret we could never know  and i said to myself none of those thoughts of yours are new and in a vague way even you have thought them before but all the same they have given you some little feeling of tranquillity  and at that word of fear i rose and invited my companion to return toward the town  but as we stealthy crept by the osteria di tranquillita our friend in the bowler hat came out with a gun over his shoulder and waved his hand toward the inn  you come again in two weeki change all that  and now he added i go to shoot little bird or two and he disappeared into the golden haze under the olivetrees  a minute later we heard his gun go off and returned homeward with a prayer  1910     magpie over the hill  i lay often that summer on a slope of sand and coarse grass close to the cornish sea trying to catch thoughts and i was trying very hard when i saw them coming hand in hand  she was dressed in blue linen and a little cloud of honeycoloured hair her small face had serious eyes the colour of the chicory flowers she was holding up to sniff ata clean sober little maid with a very touching upward look of trust  her companion was a strong active boy of perhaps fourteen and he too was serioushis deepset blacklashed eyes looked down at her with a queer protective wonder the while he explained in a soft voice broken up between two ages that exact process which bees adopt to draw honey out of flowers  once or twice this hoarse but charming voice became quite fervent when she had evidently failed to follow it was as if he would have been impatient only he knew he must not because she was a lady and younger than himself and he loved her  they sat down just below my nook and began to count the petals of a chicory flower and slowly she nestled in to him and he put his arm round her  never did i see such sedate sweet lovering so trusting on her part so guardianlike on his  they were like in miniaturethough more dewythose sober couples who have long lived together yet whom one still catches looking at each other with confidential tenderness and in whom one feels passion is atrophied from never having been in use  long i sat watching them in their cool communion halfembraced talking a little smiling a little never once kissing  they did not seem shy of that it was rather as if they were too much each others to think of such a thing  and then her head slid lower and lower down his shoulder and sleep buttoned the lids over those chicoryblue eyes  how careful he was then not to wake her though i could see his arm was getting stiff he still sat good as gold holding her till it began quite to hurt me to see his shoulder thus in chancery  but presently i saw him draw his arm away ever so carefully lay her head down on the grass and lean forward to stare at something  straight in front of them was a magpie balancing itself on a stripped twig of thorntree  the agitating bird painted of night and day was making a queer noise and flirting one wing as if trying to attract attention  rising from the twig it circled vivid and stealthy twice round the tree and flew to another a dozen paces off  the boy rose he looked at his little mate looked at the bird and began quietly to move toward it but uttering again its queer call the bird glided on to a third thorntree  the boy hesitated thenbut once more the bird flew on and suddenly dipped over the hill i saw the boy break into a run and getting up quickly i ran too  when i reached the crest there was the black and white bird flying low into a dell and there the boy with hair streaming back was rushing helterskelter down the hill  he reached the bottom and vanished into the dell  i too ran down the hill  for all that i was prying and must not be seen by bird or boy i crept warily in among the trees to the edge of a pool that could know but little sunlight so thickly arched was it by willows birchtrees and wild hazel  there in a swing of boughs above the water was perched no pied bird but a young darkhaired girl with dangling bare brown legs  and on the brink of the black water goldened with fallen leaves the boy was crouching gazing up at her with all his soul she swung just out of reach and looked down at him across the pool how old was she with her brown limbs and her gleaming slanting eyes  or was she only the spirit of the dell this elfthing swinging there entwined with boughs and the dark water and covered with a shift of wet birch leaves  so strange a face she had wild almost wicked yet so tender a face that i could not take my eyes from  her bare toes just touched the pool and flicked up drops of water that fell on the boys face  from him all the sober steadfastness was gone already he looked as wild as she and his arms were stretched out trying to reach her feet  i wanted to cry to him go back boy go back but could not her elf eyes held me dumbthey looked so lost in their tender wildness  and then my heart stood still for he had slipped and was struggling in deep water beneath her feet  what a gaze was that he was turning up to hernot frightened but so longing so desperate and hers how triumphant and how happy  and then he clutched her foot and clung and climbed and bending down she drew him up to her all wet and clasped him in the swing of boughs  i took a long breath then  an orange gleam of sunlight had flamed in among the shadows and fell round those two where they swung over the dark water with lips close together and spirits lost in one anothers and in their eyes such drowning ecstasy  and then they kissed  all round me pool and leaves and air seemed suddenly to swirl and melti could see nothing plain        what time passedi do not knowbefore their faces slowly again became visible  his face the sober boyswas turned away from her and he was listening for above the whispering of leaves a sound of weeping came from over the hill  it was to that he listened  and even as i looked he slid down from out of her arms back into the pool and began struggling to gain the edge  what grief and longing in her wild face then  but she did not wail  she did not try to pull him back that elfish heart of dignity could reach out to what was coming it could not drag at what was gone  unmoving as the boughs and water she watched him abandon her  slowly the struggling boy gained land and lay there breathless and still that sound of lonely weeping came from over the hill  listening but looking at those wild mourning eyes that never moved from him he lay  once he turned back toward the water but fire had died within him his hands dropped nervelesshis young face was all bewilderment  and the quiet darkness of the pool waited and the trees and those lost eyes of hers and my heart  and ever from over the hill came the little fair maidens lonely weeping  then slowly dragging his feet stumbling halfblinded turning and turning to look back the boy groped his way out through the trees toward that sound and as he went that dark spiritelf abandoned clasping her own lithe body with her arms never moved her gaze from him  i too crept away and when i was safe outside in the pale evening sunlight peered back into the dell  there under the dark trees she was no longer but round and round that cage of passion fluttering and wailing through the leaves over the black water was the magpie flighting on its twilight wings  i turned and ran and ran till i came over the hill and saw the boy and the little fair sober maiden sitting together once more on the open slope under the high blue heaven  she was nestling her tearstained face against his shoulder and speaking already of indifferent things and hehe was holding her with his arm and watching over her with eyes that seemed to see something else  and so i lay hearing their sober talk and gazing at their sober little figures till i awoke and knew i had dreamed all that little allegory of sacred and profane love and from it had returned to reason knowing no more than ever which was which 1912     sheepshearing  from early morning there had been bleating of sheep in the yard so that one knew the creatures were being sheared and toward evening i went along to see  thirty or forty nakedlooking ghosts of sheep were penned against the barn and perhaps a dozen still inhabiting their coats  into the wool of one of these bulky ewes the farmers small yellowhaired daughter was twisting her fist hustling it toward fate though pulled almost off her feet by the frightened stubborn creature she never let go till with a despairing cough the ewe had passed over the threshold and was fast in the hands of a shearer  at the far end of the barn close by the doors i stood a minute or two before shifting up to watch the shearing  into that dim beautiful home of age with its great rafters and mellow stone archways the june sunlight shone through loopholes and chinks in thin glamour powdering with its very strangeness the dark cathedraled air where high up clung a fog of old grey cobwebs so thick as ever were the stalactites of a huge cave  at this end the scent of sheep and wool and men had not yet routed that home essence of the barn like the savour of acorns and withering beech leaves  they were shearing by hand this year nine of them counting the postman who though farmbred didn putt much to the shearin but had come to round the sheep up and give general aid  sitting on the creatures or with a leg firmly crooked over their heads each shearer even the two boys had an air of going at it in his own way  in their white canvas shearing suits they worked very steadily almost in silence as if drowsed by the clickclip clickclip of the shears  and the sheep but for an occasional wriggle of legs or head lay quiet enough having an inborn sense perhaps of the fitness of things even when once in a way they lost more than wool glad too mayhap to be rid of their matted vestments  from time to time the little damsel offered each shearer a jug and glass but no man drank till he had finished his sheep then he would get up stretch his cramped muscles drink deep and almost instantly sit down again on a fresh beast  and always there was the buzz of flies swarming in the sunlight of the open doorway the dry rustle of the pollarded limetrees in the sharp wind outside the bleating of some released ewe upset at her own nakedness the scrape and shuffle of heels and sheeps limbs on the floor together with the clickclip clickclip of the shears  as each ewe finished with struggled up helped by a friendly shove and bolted out dazedly into the pen i could not help wondering what was passing in her headin the heads of all those unceremoniously treated creatures and moving nearer to the postman i said  theyre really very good on the whole  he looked at me i thought queerly  yaas he answered mr moltons the best of them  i looked askance at mr molton but with his knee crooked round a young ewe he was shearing calmly  yes i admitted he is certainly good  yaas replied the postman  edging back into the darkness away from that uncomprehending youth i escaped into the air and passing the remains of last years stacks under the tall toppling elms sat down in a field under the bank it seemed to me that i had food for thought  in that little misunderstanding between me and the postman was all the essence of the difference between that state of civilisation in which sheep could prompt a sentiment and that state in which sheep could not  the heat from the dropping sun not far now above the moorline struck full into the ferns and long grass of the bank where i was sitting and the midges rioted on me in this last warmth  the wind was barred out so that one had the full sweetness of the clover fast becoming hay over which the swallows were wheeling and swooping after flies  and far up as it were the crown of natures beautiful devouring circle a buzzard hawk almost stationary on the air floated intent on something pleasant below him  a number of little hens crept through the gate one by one and came round me  it seemed to them that i was there to feed them and they held their neat red or yellow heads to one side and the other inquiring with their beady eyes surprised at my stillness  they were pretty with their speckled feathers and as it seemed to me plump and young so that i wondered how many of them would in time feed me finding however that i gave them nothing to eat they went away and there arose in place of their clucking the thin singing of air passing through some long tube  i knew it for the whining of my dog who had nosed me out but could not get through the padlocked gate  and as i lifted him over i was glad the postman could not see mefor i felt that to lift a dog over a gate would be against the principles of one for whom the connection of sheep with good behaviour had been too strange a thought and it suddenly rushed into my mind that the time would no doubt come when the conduct of apples being plucked from the mother tree would inspire us and we should say theyre really very good  and i wondered were those future watchers of applegathering farther from me than i watching sheepshearing from the postman  i thought too of the pretty dreams being dreamt about the land and of the people who dreamed them  and i looked at that land covered with the sweet pinkishgreen of the clover and considered how much of it through the medium of sheep would find its way into me to enable me to come out here and be eaten by midges and speculate about things and conceive the sentiment of how good the sheep were and it all seemed queer  i thought too of a world entirely composed of people who could see the sheen rippling on that clover and feel a sort of sweet elation at the scent of it and i wondered how much clover would be sown then  many things i thought of sitting there till the sun sank below the moor line the wind died off the clover and the midges slept  here and there in the iriscoloured sky a star crept out the softhooting owls awoke  but still i lingered watching how one after another shapes and colours died into twilight and i wondered what the postman thought of twilight that inconvenient state when things were neither dark nor light and i wondered what the sheep were thinking this first night without their coats  then slinking along the hedge noiseless unheard by my sleeping spaniel i saw a tawny dog stealing by  he passed without seeing us licking his lean chops  yes friend i thought you have been after something very unholy you have been digging up buried lamb or some desirable person of that kind  sneaking past in this sweet night which stirred in one such sentiment that ghoulish cur was like the omnivorousness of nature and it came to me how wonderful and queer was a world which embraced within it not only this red gloating dog fresh from his feast on the decaying flesh of lamb but all those hundreds of beings in whom the sight of a fly with one leg shortened produced a quiver of compassion  for in this savage slinking shadow i knew that i had beheld a manifestation of divinity no less than in the smile of the sky each minute growing more starry  with what harmonyi thoughtcan these two be enwrapped in this round world so fast that it cannot be moved  what secret marvellous allpervading principle can harmonise these things  and the old words good and evil seemed to me more than ever quaint  it was almost dark and the dew falling fast i roused my spaniel to go in  over the highwalled yard the barns the moonwhite porch dusk had brushed its velvet  through an open window came a roaring sound mr molton was singing the happy warrior to celebrate the finish of the shearing  the big doors into the garden passed through cut off the full sweetness of that song for there the owls were already masters of night with their music  on the dewwhitened grass of the lawn we came on a little dark beast my spaniel liking its savour stood with his nose at point but being called off i could feel him obedient still quivering under my hand  in the field a wan huddle in the blackness the dismantled sheep lay under a holly hedge  the wind had died it was mistwarm 1910     evolution  coming out of the theatre we found it utterly impossible to get a taxicab and though it was raining slightly walked through leicester square in the hope of picking one up as it returned down piccadilly numbers of hansoms and fourwheelers passed or stood by the curb hailing us feebly or not even attempting to attract our attention but every taxi seemed to have its load  at piccadilly circus losing patience we beckoned to a fourwheeler and resigned ourselves to a long slow journey  a souwesterly air blew through the open windows and there was in it the scent of change that wet scent which visits even the hearts of towns and inspires the watcher of their myriad activities with thought of the restless force that forever cries on on  but gradually the steady patter of the horses hoofs the rattling of the windows the slow thudding of the wheels pressed on us so drowsily that when at last we reached home we were more than half asleep  the fare was two shillings and standing in the lamplight to make sure the coin was a halfcrown before handing it to the driver we happened to look up this cabman appeared to be a man of about sixty with a long thin face whose chin and drooping grey moustaches seemed in permanent repose on the upturned collar of his old blue overcoat  but the remarkable features of his face were the two furrows down his cheeks so deep and hollow that it seemed as though that face were a collection of bones without coherent flesh among which the eyes were sunk back so far that they had lost their lustre  he sat quite motionless gazing at the tail of his horse and almost unconsciously one added the rest of ones silver to that halfcrown  he took the coins without speaking but as we were turning into the garden gate we heard him say  thank you youve saved my life  not knowing either of us what to reply to such a curious speech we closed the gate again and came back to the cab  are things so very bad  they are replied the cabman  its done withis this job  were not wanted now  and taking up his whip he prepared to drive away  how long have they been as bad as this  the cabman dropped his hand again as though glad to rest it and answered incoherently  thirtyfive year ive been drivin a cab  and sunk again in contemplation of his horses tail he could only be roused by many questions to express himself having as it seemed no knowledge of the habit  i dont blame the taxis i dont blame nobody  its come on us thats what it has  i left the wife this morning with nothing in the house she was saying to me only yesterday what have you brought home the last four months  put it at six shillings a week i said  no she said seven  well thats rightshe enters it all down in her book  you are really going short of food  the cabman smiled and that smile between those two deep hollows was surely as strange as ever shone on a human face  you may say that he said  well what does it amount to  before i picked you up i had one eighteenpenny fare today and yesterday i took five shillings  and ive got seven bob a day to pay for the cab and thats low too  theres many and many a proprietor thats broke and goneevery bit as bad as us  they let us down as easy as ever they can you cant get blood from a stone can you  once again he smiled  im sorry for them too and im sorry for the horses though they come out best of the three of us i do believe  one of us muttered something about the public  the cabman turned his face and stared down through the darkness  the public he said and his voice had in it a faint surprise well they all want the taxis  its natural  they get about faster in them and times money  i was seven hours before i picked you up and then you was lookin for a taxi  them as take us because they cant get better theyre not in a good temper as a rule  and theres a few old ladies thats frightened of the motors but old ladies arent never very free with their moneycant afford to be the most of them i expect  everybodys sorry for you one would have thought that  he interrupted quietly sorrow dont buy bread         i never had nobody ask me about things before  and slowly moving his long face from side to side he added besides what could people do  they cant be expected to support you and if they started askin you questions theyd feel it very awkward  they know that i suspect of course theres such a lot of us the hansoms are pretty nigh as bad off as we are  well were gettin fewer every day thats one thing  not knowing whether or no to manifest sympathy with this extinction we approached the horse  it was a horse that stood over a good deal at the knee and in the darkness seemed to have innumerable ribs  and suddenly one of us said many people want to see nothing but taxis on the streets if only for the sake of the horses  the cabman nodded  this old fellow he said never carried a deal of flesh  his grub dont put spirit into him nowadays its not up to much in quality but he gets enough of it  and you dont  the cabman again took up his whip  i dont suppose he said without emotion any one could ever find another job for me now  ive been at this too long  itll be the workhouse if its not the other thing  and hearing us mutter that it seemed cruel he smiled for the third time  yes he said slowly its a bit ard on us because weve done nothing to deserve it  but things are like that so far as i can see  one thing comes pushin out another and so you go on  ive thought about ityou get to thinkin and worryin about the rights o things sittin up here all day  no i dont see anything for it itll soon be the end of us nowcant last much longer  and i dont know that ill be sorry to have done with it  its pretty well broke my spirit  there was a fund got up  yes it helped a few of us to learn the motordrivin but whats the good of that to me at my time of life  sixty thats my age im not the only onetheres hundreds like me  were not fit for it thats the fact we havent got the nerve now  itd want a mint of money to help us  and what you says the truthpeople want to see the end of us they want the taxisour days over  im not complaining you asked me about it yourself  and for the third time he raised his whip  tell me what you would have done if you had been given your fare and just sixpence over  the cabman stared downward as though puzzled by that question  done  why nothing  what could i have done  but you said that it had saved your life  yes i said that he answered slowly i was feelin a bit low you cant help it sometimes its the thing comin on you and no way out of itthats what gets over you  we try not to think about it as a rule  and this time with a thank you kindly he touched his horses flank with the whip  like a thing aroused from sleep the forgotten creature started and began to draw the cabman away from us  very slowly they travelled down the road among the shadows of the trees broken by lamplight  above us white ships of cloud were sailing rapidly across the dark river of sky on the wind which smelled of change  and after the cab was lost to sight that wind still brought to us the dying sound of the slow wheels 1910     riding in mist  wet and hot having her winter coat the mare exactly matched the drenched foxcoloured beechleaf drifts  as was her wont on such misty days she danced along with head held high her neck a little arched her ears pricked pretending that things were not what they seemed and now and then vigorously trying to leave me planted on the air  stones which had rolled out of the lane banks were her especial goblins for one such had maltreated her nerves before she came into this ballroom world and she had not forgotten  there was no wind that day  on the beechtrees were still just enough of coppery leaves to look like fires lighted highup to air the eeriness but most of the twigs pearled with water were patterned very naked against universal grey  berries were few except the pink spindle one so far the most beautiful of which there were more than earth generally vouchsafes  there was no sound in the deep lanes none of that sweet overhead sighing of yesterday at the same hour but there was a quality of silencea dumb mist murmuration  we passed a tree with a proud pigeon sitting on its top spire quite too heavy for the twig delicacy below undisturbed by the mares hoofs or the creaking of saddle leather he let us pass absorbed in his world of tranquil turtledoves  the mist had thickened to a white infinitesimal raindust and in it the trees began to look strange as though they had lost one another  the world seemed inhabited only by quick soundless wraiths as one trotted past  close to a farmhouse the mare stood still with that extreme suddenness peculiar to her at times and four black pigs scuttled by and at once became white air  by now we were both hot and inclined to cling closely together and take liberties with each other i telling her about her nature name and appearance together with comments on her manners and she giving forth that sterterous sweet snuffle which begins under the star on her forehead  on such days she did not sneeze reserving those expressions of her joy for sunny days and the crisp winds  at a forking of the ways we came suddenly on one grey and three brown ponies who shied round and flung away in front of us a vision of pretty heads and haunches tangled in the thin lane till conscious that they were beyond their beat they faced the bank and one by one scrambled over to join the other ghosts out on the dim common  dipping down now over the road we passed hounds going home  pied dumbfooted shapes padding along in that softeyed remote world of theirs with a tall riding splash of red in front and a tall splash of riding red behind  then through a gate we came on to the moor amongst whitened furze  the mist thickened  a curlew was whistling on its invisible way far up and that wistful wild calling seemed the very voice of the day  keeping in view the glint of the road we galloped rejoicing both of us to be free of the jog jog of the lanes  and first the voice of the curlew died then the glint of the road vanished and we were quite alone  even the furze was gone no shape of anything left only the black peaty ground and the thickening mist  we might as well have been that lonely bird crossing up there in the blind white nothingness like a human spirit wandering on the undiscovered moor of its own future  the mare jumped a pile of stones which appeared as it were after we had passed over and it came into my mind that if we happened to strike one of the old quarry pits we should infallibly be killed somehow there was pleasure in this thought that we might or might not strike that old quarry pit  the blood in us being hot we had pure joy in charging its white impalpable solidity which made way and at once closed in behind us  there was great fun in this yardbyyard discovery that we were not yet dead this flying shelterless challenge to whatever might lie out there five yards in front  we felt supremely above the wish to know that our necks were safe we were happy panting in the vapour that beat against our faces from the sheer speed of our galloping suddenly the ground grew lumpy and made uphill  the mare slackened pace we stopped  before us behind to right and left white vapour no sky no distance barely the earth  no wind in our faces no wind anywhere at first we just got our breath thought nothing talked a little  then came a chillness a faint clutching over the heart  the mare snuffled we turned and made downhill  and still the mist thickened and seemed to darken ever so little we went slowly suddenly doubtful of all that was in front  there came into our minds visions so distant in that darkening vapour of a warm stall and manger of oats of tea and a log fire  the mist seemed to have fingers now long dark white crawling fingers it seemed too to have in its sheer silence a sort of muttered menace a shuddery lurkingness as if from out of it that spirit of the unknown which in hot blood we had just now so gleefully mocked were creeping up at us intent on its vengeance since the ground no longer sloped we could not go downhill there were no means left of telling in what direction we were moving and we stopped to listen  there was no sound not one tiny noise of water wind in trees or man not even of birds or the moor ponies and the mist darkened  the mare reached her head down and walked on smelling at the heather every time she sniffed ones heart quivered hoping she had found the way she threw up her head snorted and stood still and there passed just in front of us a pony and her foal shapes of scampering dusk whisked like blurred shadows across a sheet  hoofsilent in the long heatheras ever were visiting ghoststhey were gone in a flash  the mare plunged forward following  but in the feel of her gallop and the feel of my heart there was no more that ecstasy of facing the unknown there was only the cold hasty dread of loneliness  far asunder as the poles were those two sensations evoked by this same motion  the mare swerved violently and stopped  there passing within three yards from the same direction as before the soundless shapes of the pony and her foal flew by again more intangible less dusky now against the darker screen were we then to be haunted by those bewildering uncanny ones flitting past ever from the same direction  this time the mare did not follow but stood still knowing as well as i that direction was quite lost  soon with a whimper she picked her way on again smelling at the heather and the mist darkened  then out of the heart of that dusky whiteness came a tiny sound we stood not breathing turning our heads  i could see the mares eye fixed and straining at the vapour  the tiny sound grew till it became the muttering of wheels  the mare dashed forward  the muttering ceased untimely but she did not stop turning abruptly to the left she slid scrambled and dropped into a trot  the mist seemed whiter below us we were on the road  and involuntarily there came from me a sound not quite a shout not quite an oath  i saw the mares eye turn back faintly derisive as who should say alone i did it  then slowly comfortably a little ashamed we jogged on in the mood of men and horses when danger is over  so pleasant it seemed now in one short halfhour to have passed through the circleswing of the emotions from the ecstasy of hot recklessness to the clutching of chill fear  but the meetingpoint of those two sensations we had left out there on the mysterious moor  why at one moment had we thought it finer than anything on earth to risk the breaking of our necks and the next shuddered at being lost in the darkening mist with winter night fast coming on  and very luxuriously we turned once more into the lanes enjoying the past scenting the future  close to home the first little eddy of wind stirred and the song of dripping twigs began an owl hooted honeysoft in the fog  we came on two farm hands mending the lane at the turn of the avenue and curled on the top of the bank their cosy red collie pup waiting for them to finish work for the day he raised his sharp nose and looked at us dewily  we turned down padding softly in the wet foxred drifts under the beechtrees whereon the last leaves still flickered out in the darkening whiteness that now seemed so little eerie  we passed the greygreen skeleton of the farmyard gate  a hen ran across us clucking into the dusk  the maze drew her long homecoming snuffle and stood still 1910     the procession  in one of those corners of our land canopied by the fumes of blind industry there was on that day a lull in darkness  a fresh wind had split the customary heaven or roof of hell was sweeping long drifts of creamy clouds across a blue still pallid with reek  the sun even shonea sun whose face seemed white and wondering  and under that rare sun all the little town among its slag heaps and few tall chimneys had an air of living faster  in those continuous courts and alleys where the women worked smoke from each little forge rose and dispersed into the wind with strange alacrity amongst the women too there was that same eagerness for the sunshine had crept in and was making pale all those darkraftered sooted ceilings which covered them in together with their immortal comrades the small open furnaces  about their work they had been busy since seven oclock their feet pressing the leather lungs which fanned the conical heaps of glowing fuel their hands poking into the glow a thin iron rod till the end could be curved into a fiery hook snapping it with a mallet threading it with tongs on to the chain hammering closing the link and without a seconds pause thrusting the iron rod again into the glow  and while they worked they chattered laughed sometimes now and then sighed  they seemed of all ages and all types from her who looked like a peasant of provence broad brown and strong to the weariest white consumptive wisp from old women of seventy with straggling grey hair to fifteenyearold girls  in the cottage forges there would be but one worker or two at most in the shop forges four or even five little glowing heaps four or five of the grimy pale lungbellows and never a moment without a fiery hook about to take its place on the growing chains never a second when the thin smoke of the forges and of those lives consuming slowly in front of them did not escape from out of the dingy whitewashed spaces past the dark rafters away to freedom  but there had been in the air that morning something more than the white sunlight  there had been anticipation  and at two oclock began fulfilment  the forges were stilled and from court and alley forth came the women  in their ragged working clothes in their best clothesso little different in bonnets in hats bareheaded with babies born and unborn they swarmed into the high street and formed across it behind the band  a strange magpie jaylike flock black white patched with brown and green and blue shifting chattering laughing seeming unconscious of any purpose  a thousand and more of them with faces twisted and scored by those myriad deformings which a desperate towntoiling and little food fasten on human visages yet with hardly a single evil or brutal face  seemingly it was not easy to be evil or brutal on a wage that scarcely bound soul and body  a thousand and more of the poorestpaid and hardestworked human beings in the world  on the pavement alongside this strange acquiescing assembly of revolt about to march in protest against the conditions of their lives stood a young woman without a hat and in poor clothes but with a sort of beauty in her roughhaired high cheekboned darkeyed face  she was not one of them yet by a stroke of natures irony there was graven on her face alone of all those faces the true look of rebellion a haughty almost fierce uneasy lookan untamed look  on all the other thousand faces one could see no bitterness no fierceness not even enthusiasm only a halfstolid halfvivacious patience and eagerness as of children going to a party  the band played and they began to march  laughing talking waving flags trying to keep step with the same expression slowly but surely coming over every face the future was not only the presentthis happy present of marching behind the discordance of a brass band this strange present of crowded movement and laughter in open air  we otherssome dozen accidentals like myself and the tall greyhaired lady interested in the people together with those few kind spirits in charge of the showmarched too a little selfconscious desiring with a vague military sensation to hold our heads up but not too much under the eyes of the curious bystanders thesenearly all menwere wellwishers it was said though their faces pale from their own work in shop or furnace expressed nothing but apathy  they wished well very dumbly in the presence of this new thing as if they found it queer that women should be doing something for themselves queer and rather dangerous  a few indeed shuffled along between the column and the little hopeless shops and grimy factory sheds and one or two accompanied their women carrying the baby  now and then there passed us some bettertodo citizena housewife or lawyers clerk or ironmonger with lips pressed rather tightly together and an air of taking no notice of this disturbance of traffic as though the whole thing were a rather poor joke which they had already heard too often  so with laughter and a continual crack of voices our jaylike crew swung on swaying and thumping in the strange ecstasy of irreflection happy to be moving they knew not where nor greatly why under the visiting sun to the sound of murdered music whenever the band stopped playing discipline became as tatterdemalion as the very flags and garments but never once did they lose that look of essential order as if indeed they knew that being the worstserved creatures in the christian world they were the chief guardians of the inherent dignity of man  hatless in the very front row marched a tall slip of a girl arrowstraight and so thin with dirty fair hair in a blouse and skirt gaping behind ever turning her pretty face on its pretty slim neck from side to side so that one could see her blue eyes sweeping here there everywhere with a sort of flowerlike wildness as if a secret embracing of each moment forbade her to let them rest on anything and break this pleasure of just marching  it seemed that in the neverstill eyes of that anaemic happy girl the spirit of our march had elected to enshrine itself and to make thence its little excursions to each ecstatic follower  just behind her marched a little old womana maker of chains they said for forty yearswhose black slits of eyes were sparkling who fluttered a bit of ribbon and reeled with her sense of the exquisite humour of the world  every now and then she would make a rush at one of her leaders to demonstrate how immoderately glorious was life  and each time she spoke the woman next to her laden with a heavy baby went off into squeals of laughter  behind her again marched one who beat time with her head and waved a little bit of stick intoxicated by this noble music  for an hour the pageant wound through the dejected street pursuing neither method nor set route till it came to a deserted slagheap selected for the speechmaking  slowly the motley regiment swung into that grim amphitheatre under the pale sunshine and as i watched a strange fancy visited my brain  i seemed to see over every ragged head of those marching women a little yellow flame a thin flickering gleam spiring upward and blown back by the wind  a trick of the sunlight maybe  or was it that the life in their hearts the inextinguishable breath of happiness had for a moment escaped prison and was fluttering at the pleasure of the breeze  silent now just enjoying the sound of the words thrown down to them they stood unimaginably patient with that happiness of they knew not what gilding the air above them between the patchwork ribands of their poor flags  if they could not tell very much why they had come nor believe very much that they would gain anything by coming if their demonstration did not mean to the world quite all that oratory would have them think if they themselves were but the poorest humblest least learned women in the landfor all that it seemed to me that in those tattered wistful figures so still so trustful i was looking on such beauty as i had never beheld  all the elaborated glory of things made the perfected dreams of aesthetes the embroideries of romance seemed as nothing beside this sudden vision of the wild goodness native in humble hearts 1910     a christian  one day that summer i came away from a luncheon in company of an old college chum  always exciting to meet those one hasnt seen for years and as we walked across the park together i kept looking at him askance he had altered a good deal  lean he always was but now very lean and so upright that his parsons coat was overhung by the back of his long and narrow head with its dark grizzled hair which thought had not yet loosened on his forehead  his cleanshorn face so thin and oblong was remarkable only for the eyes darkbrowed and lashed and coloured like bright steel they had a fixity in them a sort of absence on one couldnt tell what business  they made me think of torture  and his mouth always gently smiling as if its pinched curly sweetness had been commanded was the mouth of a man crucifiedyes crucified  tramping silently over the parched grass i felt that if we talked we must infallibly disagree his straightup narrow forehead so suggested a nature divided within itself into compartments of iron  it was hot that day and we rested presently beside the serpentine on its bright waters were the usual young men sculling themselves to and fro with their usual sad energy the usual promenaders loitering and watching them the usual dog that swam when it did not bark and barked when it did not swim and my friend sat smiling twisting between his thin fingers the little gold cross on his silk vest  then all of a sudden we did begin to talk and not of those matters of which the wellbred naturally conversethe habits of the rarer kinds of ducks and the careers of our college friends but of something never mentioned in polite society  at lunch our hostess had told me the sad story of an unhappy marriage and i had itched spiritually to find out what my friend who seemed so far away from me felt about such things  and now i determined to find out  tell me i asked him which do you consider most importantthe letter or the spirit of christs teachings  my dear fellow he answered gently what a question  how can you separate them  well is it not the essence of his doctrine that the spirit is all important and the forms of little value  does not that run through all the sermon on the mount  certainly  if then i said christs teaching is concerned with the spirit do you consider that christians are justified in holding others bound by formal rules of conduct without reference to what is passing in their spirits  if it is for their good  what enables you to decide what is for their good  surely we are told  not to judge that ye be not judged  oh but we do not ourselves judge we are but impersonal ministers of the rules of god  ah  do general rules of conduct take account of the variations of the individual spirit  he looked at me hard as if he began to scent heresy  you had better explain yourself more fully he said  i really dont follow  well let us take a concrete instance  we know christs saying of the married that they are one flesh  but we know also that there are wives who continue to live the married life with dreadful feelings of spiritual revolt wives who have found out that in spite of all their efforts they have no spiritual affinity with their husbands  is that in accordance with the spirit of christs teaching or is it not  we are told he began  i have admitted the definite commandment they twain shall be one flesh  there could not be seemingly any more rigid law laid down how do you reconcile it with the essence of christs teaching  frankly i want to know is there or is there not a spiritual coherence in christianity or is it only a gathering of laws and precepts with no inherent connected spiritual philosophy  of course he said in his longsuffering voice we dont look at things like thatfor us there is no questioning  but how do you reconcile such marriages as i speak of with the spirit of christs teaching  i think you ought to answer me  oh  i can perfectly he answered the reconciliation is through suffering  what a poor woman in such a case must suffer makes for the salvation of her spirit  that is the spiritual fulfilment and in such a case the justification of the law  so then i said sacrifice or suffering is the coherent thread of christian philosophy  suffering cheerfully borne he answered  you do not think i said that there is a touch of extravagance in that  would you say for example that an unhappy marriage is a more christian thing than a happy one where there is no suffering but only love  a line came between his brows  well he said at last i would say i think that a woman who crucifies her flesh with a cheerful spirit in obedience to gods law stands higher in the eyes of god than one who undergoes no such sacrifice in her married life  and i had the feeling that his stare was passing through me on its way to an unseen goal  you would desire then i suppose suffering as the greatest blessing for yourself  humbly he said i would try to  and naturally for others  god forbid  but surely that is inconsistent  he murmured you see i have suffered  we were silent  at last i said yes that makes much which was dark quite clear to me  oh he asked  i answered slowly not many men you know even in your profession have really suffered  that is why they do not feel the difficulty which you feel in desiring suffering for others  he threw up his head exactly as if i had hit him on the jaw its weakness in me i know he said  i should have rather called it weakness in them  but suppose you are right and that its weakness not to be able to desire promiscuous suffering for others would you go further and say that it is christian for those who have not experienced a certain kind of suffering to force that particular kind on others  he sat silent for a full minute trying evidently to reach to the bottom of my thought  surely not he said at last except as ministers of gods laws  you do not then think that it is christian for the husband of such a woman to keep her in that state of sufferingnot being of course a minister of god  he began stammering at that ii he said  no that is i think notnot christian  no certainly  then such a marriage if persisted in makes of the wife indeed a christian but of the husbandthe reverse  the answer to that is clear he said quietly the husband must abstain  yes that is perhaps coherently christian on your theory they would then both suffer  but the marriage of course has become no marriage they are no longer one flesh  he looked at me almost impatiently as if to say do not compel me to enforce silence on you  but suppose i went on and this you know is the more frequent case the man refuses to abstain  would you then say it was more christian to allow him to become daily less christian through his unchristian conduct than to relieve the woman of her suffering at the expense of the spiritual benefit she thence derives  why in fact do you favour one case more than the other  all question of relief he replied is a matter for caesar it cannot concern me  there had come into his face a rigidityas if i might hit it with my questions till my tongue was tired and it be no more moved than the bench on which we were sitting  one more question i said and i have done  since the christian teaching is concerned with the spirit and not forms and the thread in it which binds all together and makes it coherent is that of suffering  redemption by suffering he put in  if you willin one word selfcrucifixioni must ask you and dont take it personally because of what you told me of yourself in life generally one does not accept from people any teaching that is not the result of firsthand experience on their parts  do you believe that this christian teaching of yours is valid from the mouths of those who have not themselves sufferedwho have not themselves as it were been crucified  he did not answer for a minute then he said with painful slowness christ laid hands on his apostles and sent them forth and they in turn and so on to our day  do you say then that this guarantees that they have themselves suffered so that in spirit they are identified with their teaching  he answered bravely noi do noti cannot say that in fact it is always so  is not then their teaching born of forms and not of the spirit  he rose and with a sort of deep sorrow at my stubbornness said we are not permitted to know the way of this it is so ordained we must have faith  as he stood there turned from me with his hat off and his neck painfully flushed under the sharp outcurve of his dark head a feeling of pity surged up in me as if i had taken an unfair advantage  reasoncoherencephilosophy he said suddenly  you dont understand  all that is nothing to menothingnothing 1911     wind in the rocks  though dewdark when we set forth there was stealing into the frozen air an invisible white host of the wanwinged lightborn beyond the mountains and already like a drift of doves harbouring greywhite high up on the snowy skycaves of monte cristallo and within us tramping over the valley meadows was the incredible elation of those who set out before the sun has risen every minute of the precious day before uswe had not lost one  at the mouth of that enchanted chine across which for a million years the howdahed rock elephant has marched but never yet passed from sight we crossed the stream and among the trees began our ascent  very far away the first cowbells chimed and over the dark heights we saw the thin sinking moon looking like the white horns of some devotional beast watching and waiting up there for the god of light  that god came slowly stalking across far over our heads from top to top then of a sudden his flamewhite form was seen standing in a gap of the valley walls the trees flung themselves along the ground before him and censers of pine gum began swinging in the dark aisles releasing their perfumed steam  throughout these happy ravines where no man lives he shows himself naked and unashamed the colour of pale honey on his golden hair such shining as one has not elsewhere seen his eyes like old wine on fire  and already he had swept his hand across the invisible strings for there had arisen the music of uncurling leaves and flitting things  a legend runs that driven from land to land by christians apollo hid himself in lower austria but those who ever they saw him there in the thirteenth century were wrong it was to these enchanted chines frequented only by the mountain shepherds that he certainly came  and as we were lying on the grass of the first alp with the star gentiansthose fallen drops of the skyand the burntbrown dandelions and scattered shrubs of alpenrose round us we were visited by one of these very shepherds passing with his flockthe fiercestlooking man who ever spoke in a gentle voice six feet high with an orange cloak bare knees burnt as the very dandelions a beard blacker than black and eyes more glorious than if sun and night had dived and were lying imprisoned in their depths  he spoke in an unknown tongue and could certainly not understand any word of ours but he smelled of the good earth and only through interminable watches under sun and stars could so great a gentleman have been perfected  presently while we rested outside that alpine hut which faces the three sphinxlike mountains there came back from climbing the smallest and most dangerous of those peaks one pale from heat and trembling with fatigue a tall man with long brown hands and a long thin bearded face  and as he sipped cautiously of red wine and water he looked at his little conquered mountain  his kindly screwedup eyes his kindly bearded lips even his limbs seemed smiling and not for the world would we have jarred with words that rapt smiling man enjoying the sacred hour of him who has just proved himself  in silence we watched in silence left him smiling knowing somehow that we should remember him all our days  for there was in his smile the glamour of adventure just for the sake of danger all that high instinct which takes a man out of his chair to brave what he need not  between that hut and the three mountains lies a saddleastride of all beauty and all colour master of a titanic chaos of deep clefts tawny heights red domes far snow and the purple of long shadows and standing there we comprehended a little of what earth had been through in her time to have made this playground for most glorious demons mother earth  what travail undergone what long heroic throes had brought on her face such majesty  hereabout edelweiss was clinging to smoothedout rubble but a little higher even the everlasting plant was lost there was no more life and presently we lay down on the mountain side rather far apart  up here above trees and pasture the wind had a strange bare voice free from all outer influence sweeping along with a cold whiffing sound on the warm stones in full sunlight uplifted over all the beauty of italy one felt at first only delight in space and wild loveliness in the unknown valleys and the strength of the sun  it was so good to be alive so ineffably good to be living in this most wonderful world drinking air nectar  behind us from the three mountains came the frequent thud and scuffle of falling rocks loosened by rains  the wind mist and winter snow had ground the powdery stones on which we lay to a pleasant bed but once on a time they too had clung up there  and very slowly one could not say how or when the sense of joy began changing to a sense of fear  the awful impersonality of those great rockcreatures the terrible impartiality of that cold clinging wind which swept by never an inch lifted above ground  not one tiny soul the size of a midge or rock flower lived here  not one little i breathed here and loved  and we too some day would no longer love having become part of this monstrous lovely earth of that cold whiffling air  to be no longer able to love  it seemed incredible too grim to bear yet it was true to become powder and the wind no more to feel the sunlight to be loved no more  to become a whiffling noise cold without ones self  to drift on the breath of that noise homeless  up here there were not even those little velvet greywhite flowercomrades we had plucked  no life nothing but the creeping wind and those great rocky heights whence came the sound of fallingsymbols of that cold untimely state into which we too must pass never more to love nor to be loved  one could but turn to the earth and press ones face to it away from the wild loveliness of what use loveliness that must be lost of what use loveliness when one could not love  the earth was warm and firm beneath the palms of the hands but there still came the sound of the impartial wind and the careless roar of the stories falling  below in those valleys amongst the living trees and grass was the comradeship of unnumbered life so that to pass out into peace to step beyond to die seemed but a brotherly act amongst all those others but up here where no creature breathed we saw the heart of the desert that stretches before each little human soul  up here it froze the spirit even peace seemed mockinghard as a stone  yet to try and hide to tuck ones head under ones own wing was not possible in this air so crystal clear so far above incense and the narcotics of set creeds and the fevered breath of prayers and protestations  even to know that between organic and inorganic matter there is no gulf fixed was of no peculiar comfort  the jealous wind came creeping over the lifeless limestone removing even the poor solace of its warmth one turned from it desperate to look up at the sky the blue burning wide ineffable far sky  then slowly without reason that icy fear passed into a feeling not of joy not of peace but as if life and death were exalted into what was neither life nor death a strange and motionless vibration in which one had been merged and rested utterly content equipoised divested of desire endowed with life and death  but since this moment had come before its time we got up and close together marched on rather silently in the hot sun 1910     my distant relative  though i had not seen my distant relative for yearsnot in fact since he was obliged to give vancouver island up as a bad jobi knew him at once when with head a little on one side and teacup held high as if to confer a blessing he said hallo across the club smokingroom  thin as a lathnot one ounce heaviertall and very upright with his pale forehead and pale eyes and pale beard he had the air of a ghost of a man  he had always had that air  and his voicethat matteroffact and slightly nasal voice with its thin pragmatical tonewas like a wraith of optimism issuing between pale lips  i noticed too that his town habiliments still had their unspeakable pale neatness as if poor things they were trying to stare the daylight out of countenance  he brought his tea across to my bay window with that wistful sociability of his as of a man who cannot always find a listener  but what are you doing in town i said  i thought you were in yorkshire with your aunt  over his round light eyes fixed on something in the street the lids fell quickly twice as the film falls over the eyes of a parrot  im after a job he answered  must be on the spot just now  and it seemed to me that i had heard those words from him before  ah yes i said and do you think youll get it  but even as i spoke i felt sorry remembering how many jobs he had been after in his time and how soon they ended when he had got them  he answered  oh yes  they ought to give it me then added rather suddenly you never know though  people are so funny  and crossing his thin legs he went on to tell me with quaint impersonality a number of instances of how people had been funny in connection with jobs he had not been given  you see he ended the countrys in such a statecapital going out of it every day  enterprise being killed all over the place theres practically nothing to be had  ah i said you think its worse then than it used to be  he smiled in that smile there was a shade of patronage  were going downhill as fast as ever we can  national characters losing all its backbone  no wonder with all this mollycoddling going on  oh i murmured mollycoddling  isnt that excessive  well  look at the way everythings being done for them  the working classes are losing their selfrespect as fast as ever they can  their independence is gone already  you think  sure of it  ill give you an instance and he went on to describe to me the degeneracy of certain working men employed by his aunt and his eldest brother claud and his youngest brother alan  they dont do a stroke more than theyre obliged he ended they know jolly well theyve got their unions and their pensions and this insurance to fall back on  it was evidently a subject on which he felt strongly  yes he muttered the nation is being rotted down  and a faint thrill of surprise passed through me  for the affairs of the nation moved him so much more strongly than his own  his voice already had a different ring his eyes a different look  he eagerly leaned forward and his long straight backbone looked longer and straighter than ever  he was less the ghost of a man  a faint flush even had come into his pale cheeks and he moved his wellkept hands emphatically  oh yes he said the country is going to the dogs right enough but you cant get them to see it  they go on sapping and sapping the independence of the people  if the working mans to be looked after whatever he doeswhat on earths to become of his go and foresight and perseverance  in his rising voice a certain piquancy was left to its accent of the ruling class by that faint twang which came i remembered from some slight defect in his tonsils  mark my words  so long as were on these lines we shall do nothing its going against evolution  they say darwins getting oldfashioned all i know is hes good enough for me  competition is the only thing  but competition i said is bitter cruel and some people cant stand against it  and i looked at him rather hard do you object to putting any sort of floor under the feet of people like that  he let his voice drop a little as if in deference to my scruples  ah he said but if you once begin this sort of thing theres no end to it  its so insidious  the more they have the more they want and all the time theyre losing fighting power  ive thought pretty deeply about this  its shortsighted it really doesnt do  but i said surely youre not against saving people from being knocked out of time by old age and accidents like illness and the fluctuations of trade  oh he said im not a bit against charity  aunt emmas splendid about that  and clauds awfully good  i do what i can myself  he looked at me so queerly deprecating that i quite liked him at that moment  at hearti felt he was a good fellow  all i think is he went on that to give them something that they can rely on as a matter of course apart from their own exertions is the wrong principle altogether and suddenly his voice began to rise again and his eyes to stare  im convinced that all this doing things for other people and bolstering up the weak is rotten  it stands to reason that it must be  he had risen to his feet so preoccupied with the wrongness of that principle that he seemed to have forgotten my presence  and as he stood there in the window the light was too strong for him  all the thin incapacity of that shadowy figure was pitilessly displayed the desperate narrowness in that long pale face the wambling look of those pale wellkept handsall that made him such a ghost of a man but his nasal dogmatic voice rose and rose  theres nothing for it but bracing up  we must cut away all this state support we must teach them to rely on themselves  its all sheer pauperisation  and suddenly there shot through me the fear that he might burst one of those little blue veins in his pale forehead so vehement had he become and hastily i changed the subject  do you like living up there with your aunt i asked isnt it a bit quiet  he turned as if i had awakened him from a dream  oh well he said its only till i get this job  let me seehow long is it since you  four years  shes very glad to have me of course  and hows your brother claud  oh  all right thanks a bit worried with the estate  the poor old govnor left it in rather a mess you know  ah  yes  does he do other work  oh  always busy in the parish  and your brother richard  hes all right  came home this year  got just enough to live on with his pensionhasnt saved a rap of course  and willie  is he still delicate  yes  im sorry  easy job his you know  and even if his health does give out his college pals will always find him some sort of sinecure  so jolly popular old willie  and alan  i havent heard anything of him since his peruvian thing came to grief  he married didnt he  rather  one of the burleys  nice girlheiress lot of property in hampshire  he looks after it for her now  doesnt do anything else i suppose  keeps up his antiquarianism  i had exhausted the members of his family  then as though by eliciting the good fortunes of his brothers i had cast some slur upon himself he said suddenly if the railway had come as it ought to have while i was out there i should have done quite well with my fruit farm  of course i agreed it was bad luck  but after all youre sure to get a job soon andso long as you can live up there with your auntyou can afford to wait and not bother  yes he murmured  and i got up  well its been very jolly to hear about you all  he followed me out  awfully glad old man he said to have seen you and had this talk i was feeling rather low  waiting to know whether i get that jobits not lively  he came down the club steps with me  by the door of my cab a loafer was standing a tall tatterdemalion with a pale bearded face  my distant relative fended him away and leaning through the window murmured awful lot of these chaps about now  for the life of me i could not help looking at him very straight but no flicker of apprehension crossed his face  well goodby again he said youve cheered me up a lot  i glanced back from my moving cab  some monetary transaction was passing between him and the loafer but shortsighted as i am i found it difficult to decide which of those tall pale bearded figures was giving the other one a penny and by some strange freak an awful vision shot up before meof myself and my distant relative and claud and richard and willie and alan all suddenly relying on ourselves  i took out my handkerchief to mop my brow but a thought struck me and i put it back was it possible for me and my distant relatives and their distant relatives and so on to infinity of those who be longed to a class provided by birth with a certain position raised by providence on to a platform made up of money inherited of interest of education fitting us for certain privileged pursuits of friends similarly endowed of substantial homes and substantial relatives of some sort or other on whom we could fall backwas it possible for any of us ever to be in the position of having to rely absolutely on ourselves  for several minutes i pondered that question and slowly i came to the conclusion that short of crime or that unlikely event marooning it was not possible  never nevertry as we mightcould any single one of us be quite in the position of one of those whose approaching pauperisation my distant relative had so vehemently deplored  we were already pauperised  if we served our country we were pensioned  if we inherited land it could not be taken from us if we went into the church we were there for life whether we were suitable or no  if we attempted the more hazardous occupations of the law medicine the arts or business there were always those homes those relations those friends of ours to fall back on if we failed  no  we could never have to rely entirely on ourselves we could never be pauperised more than we were already  and a light burst in on me  that explained why my distant relative felt so keenly  it bit him for he saw of course how dreadful it would be for these poor people of the working classes when legislation had succeeded in placing them in the humiliating position in which we already werethe dreadful position of having something to depend on apart from our own exertions some sort of security in our lives i saw it now  it was his secret pride gnawing at him all the time that made him so rabid on the point  he was longing doubtless day and night not to have had a father who had land and had left a sister well enough off to keep him while he was waiting for his job he must be feeling how horribly degrading was the position of claudinheriting that land and of richard who just because he had served in the indian civil service had got to live on a pension all the rest of his days and of willie who was in danger at any moment if his healthalways delicategave out of having a sinecure found for him by his college friends and of alan whose educated charm had enabled him to marry an heiress and live by managing her estates all all sapped of go and foresight and perseverance by a cruel providence  that was what he was really feeling and concealing be cause he was too wellbred to show his secret grief and i felt suddenly quite warm toward him now that i saw how he was suffering i understood how bound he felt in honour to combat with all his force this attempt to place others in his own distressing situation at the same time i was honest enough to confess to myself sitting there in the cabthat i did not personally share that pride of his or feel that i was being rotted by my own position i even felt some dim gratitude that if my powers gave out at any time and i had not saved anything i should still not be left destitute to face the prospect of a bleak and impoverished old age and i could not help a weak pleasure in the thought that a certain relative security was being guaranteed to those people of the working classes who had never had it before  at the same moment i quite saw that to a prouder and stronger heart it must indeed be bitter to have to sit still under your own security and even more bitter to have to watch that pauperising security coming closer and closer to othersfor the generous soul is always more concerned for others than for himself no doubt i thought if truth were known my distant relative is consumed with longing to change places with that loafer who tried to open the door of my cabfor surely he must see as i do that that is just what he himselfhaving failed to stand the pressure of competition in his lifewould be doing if it were not for the accident of his birth which has so lamentably insured him against coming to that  yes i thought you have learnt something today it does not do you see hastily to despise those distant relatives of yours who talk about pauperising and mollycoddling the lower classes  no no  one must look deeper than that  one must have generosity  and with that i stopped the cab and got out for i wanted a breath of air 1911     the black godmother  sitting out on the lawn at tea with our friend and his retriever we had been discussing those massacres of the helpless which had of late occurred and wondering that they should have been committed by the soldiery of so civilised a state when in a momentary pause of our astonishment our friend who had been listening in silence crumpling the drooping soft ear of his dog looked up and said the cause of atrocities is generally the violence of fear  panics at the back of most crimes and follies  knowing that his philosophical statements were always the result of concrete instance and that he would not tell us what that instance was if we asked himsuch being his naturewe were careful not to agree  he gave us a look out of those eyes of his so like the eyes of a mild eagle and said abruptly what do you say to this then    i was out in the dogdays last year with this fellow of mine looking for osmunda and stayed some days in a villagenever mind the name coming back one evening from my tramp i saw some boys stoning a mealycoloured dog  i went up and told the young devils to stop it  they only looked at me in the injured way boys do and one of them called out its mad guvnor i told them to clear off and they took to their heels  the dog followed me  it was a young leggy mild looking mongrel crossi should saybetween a brown retriever and an irish terrier  there was froth about its lips and its eyes were watery it looked indeed as if it might be in distemper  i was afraid of infection for this fellow of mine and whenever it came too close shooed it away till at last it slunk off altogether  well about nine oclock when i was settling down to write by the open window of my sittingroomstill daylight and very quiet and warmthere began that most maddening sound the barking of an unhappy dog  i could do nothing with that continual yap yap going on and it was too hot to shut the window so i went out to see if i could stop it the men were all at the pub and the women just finished with their gossip there was no sound at all but the continual barking of this dog somewhere away out in the fields  i travelled by ear across three meadows till i came on a haystack by a pool of water  there was the dog sure enoughthe same mealycoloured mongrel tied to a stake yapping and making frantic little runs on a bit of rusty chain whirling round and round the stake then standing quite still and shivering  i went up and spoke to it but it backed into the haystack and there it stayed shrinking away from me with its tongue hanging out  it had been heavily struck by something on the head the cheek was cut one eye halfclosed and an ear badly swollen  i tried to get hold of it but the poor thing was beside itself with fear  it snapped and flew round so that i had to give it up and sit down with this fellow here beside me to try and quiet ita strange dog you know will generally form his estimate of you from the way it sees you treat another dog  i had to sit there quite half an hour before it would let me go up to it pull the stake out and lead it away  the poor beast though it was so feeble from the blows it had received was still halffrantic and i didnt dare to touch it and all the time i took good care that this fellow here didnt come too near  then came the question what was to be done  there was no vet of course and id no place to put it except my sittingroom which didnt belong to me  but looking at its battered head and its halfmad eyes i thought no trusting you with these bumpkins youll have to come in here for the night well i got it in and heaped two or three of those hairy little red rugs landladies are so fond of up in a corner and got it on to them and put down my bread and milk  but it wouldnt eatits sense of proportion was all gone fairly destroyed by terror  it lay there moaning and every now and then it raised its head with a yap of sheer fright dreadful to hear and bit the air as if its enemies were on it again and this fellow of mine lay in the opposite corner with his head on his paw watching it  i sat up for a long time with that poor beast sick enough and wondering how it had come to be stoned and kicked and battered into this state and next day i made it my business to find out  our friend paused scanned us a little angrily and then went on it had made its first appearance it seems following a bicyclist there are men you knowsave the markwho when their beasts get ill or too expensive jump on their bicycles and take them for a quick run taking care never to look behind them  when they get back home they say hallo wheres fido  fido is nowhere and theres an end  well this poor puppy gave up just as it got to our village and roaming shout in search of water attached itself to a farm labourer  the man with excellent intentionsas he told me himselftried to take hold of it but too abruptly so that it was startled and snapped at him  whereon he kicked it for a dangerous cur and it went drifting back toward the village and fell in with the boys coming home from school  it thought no doubt that they were going to kick it too and nipped one of them who took it by the collar thereupon they hullabalooed and stoned it down the road to where i found them  then i put in my little bit of torture and drove it away through fear of infection to my own dog  after that it seems to have fallen in with a man who told me well you see he came sneakin round my house with the children playin and snapped at them when they went to stroke him so that they came running in to their mother an she called to me in a fine takin about a mad dog i ran out with a shovel and gave im one and drove him out  im sorry if he wasnt mad he looked it right enough you cant be too careful with strange dogs  its next acquaintance was an old stonebreaker a very decent sort  well you see the old man explained to me the dog came smellin round my stones an it wouldn come near an it wouldn go away it was all froth and blood about the jaw and its eyes glared green at me  i thought to meself bein the dogdaysi dont like the look o you you look funny  so i took a stone an got it here just on the ear an it fell over  and i thought to meself well youve got to finish it or itll go bitin somebody for sure  but when i come to it with my hammer the dog it got upan you know how it is when theres somethin youve alf killed and you feel sorry and yet you feel you must finish it an you hit at it blind you hit at it agen an agen the poor thing it wriggled and snapped an i was terrified itd bite me an someow it got away  again our friend paused and this time we dared not look at him  the next hospitality it was shown he went on presently was by a farmer who seeing it all bloody drove it off thinking it had been digging up a lamb that hed just buried  the poor homeless beast came sneaking back so he told his men to get rid of it  well they got hold of it somehowthere was a hole in its neck that looked as if theyd used a pitchforkand mortally afraid of its biting them but not liking as they told me to drown it for fear the owner might come on them they got a stake and a chain and fastened it up and left it in the water by the haystack where i found it  i had some conversation with that farmer  thats right he said but who was to know  i couldnt have my sheep worried  the brute had blood on his muzzle  these curs do a lot of harm when theyve once been blooded  you cant run risks  our friend cut viciously at a dandelion with his stick  run risks he broke out suddenly that was it from beginning to end of that poor beasts sufferings fear  from that fellow on the bicycle afraid of the worry and expense as soon as it showed signs of distemper to myself and the man with the pitch forknot one of us i daresay would have gone out of our way to do ita harm  but we felt fear and so by the law of selfpreservation or what ever you likeit all began till there the poor thing was with a battered head and a hole in its neck ravenous with hunger and too distraught even to lap my bread and milk  yes and theres something uncanny about a suffering animalwe sat watching it and again we were afraid looking at its eyes and the way it bit the air fear  its the black godmother of all damnable things  our friend bent down crumpling and crumpling at his dogs ears  we too gazed at the ground thinking of that poor lost puppy and the horrible inevitability of all that happens seeing men are what they are thinking of all the foul doings in the world whose black godmother is fear  and what became of the poor dog one of us asked at last  when said our friend slowly id had my fill of watching i covered it with a rug took this fellow away with me and went to bed  there was nothing else to do  at dawn i was awakened by three dreadful criesnot like a dogs at all  i hurried down  there was the poor beastwriggled out from under the rugstretched on its side dead  this fellow of mine had followed me in and he went and sat down by the body  when i spoke to him he just looked round and wagged his tail along the ground but would not come away and there he sat till it was buried very interested but not sorry at all  our friend was silent looking angrily at something in the distance  and we too were silent seeing in spirit that vigil of early morning the thin lifeless sandycoloured body stretched on those red mats and this black creaturenow lying at our feetpropped on its haunches like the dog in the death of procris patient curious ungrieved staring down at it with his bright interested eyes 1912
