                               to                      robert alan mowbray stevenson  our friendship was not only founded before we were born by a community of blood but is in itself near as old as my life it began with our early ages and like a history has been continued to the present time although we may not be old in the world we are old to each other having so long been intimates we are now widely separated a great sea and continent intervening but memory like care mounts into iron ships and rides post behind the horseman neither time nor space nor enmity can conquer old affection and as i dedicate these sketches it is not to you only but to all in the old country that i send the greeting of my heart    1879                                                r l s                                      part i                         from the clyde to sandy hook                              the amateur emigrant                             the second cabin   i first encountered my fellowpassengers on the broomielaw in glasgow thence we descended the clyde in no familiar spirit but looking askance on each other as on possible enemies a few scandinavians who had already grown acquainted on the north sea were friendly and voluble over their long pipes but among english speakers distance and suspicion reigned supreme the sun was soon overclouded the wind freshened and grew sharp as we continued to descend the widening estuary and with the falling temperature the gloom among the passengers increased two of the women wept any one who had come aboard might have supposed we were all absconding from the law there was scarce a word interchanged and no common sentiment but that of cold united us until at length having touched at greenock a pointing arm and rush to the starboard bow announced that our ocean steamer was in sight there she lay in midriver at the tail of the bank her seasignal flying a wall of bulwark a street of white deckhouses an aspiring forest of spars larger than a church and soon to be as populous as many an incorporated town in the land to which she was to bear us  i was not in truth a steerage passenger although anxious to see the worst of emigrant life i had some work to finish on the voyage and was advised to go by the second cabin where at least i should have a table at command the advice was excellent but to understand the choice and what i gained some outline of the internal disposition of the ship will first be necessary in her very nose is steerage no 1 down two pair of stairs a little abaft another companion labelled steerage no 2 and 3 gives admission to three galleries two running forward towards steerage no 1 and the third aft towards the engines the starboard forward gallery is the second cabin away abaft the engines and below the officers cabins to complete our survey of the vessel there is yet a third nest of steerages labelled 4 and 5 the second cabin to return is thus a modified oasis in the very heart of the steerages through the thin partition you can hear the steerage passengers being sick the rattle of tin dishes as they sit at meals the varied accents in which they converse the crying of their children terrified by this new experience or the clean flat smack of the parental hand in chastisement  there are however many advantages for the inhabitant of this strip he does not require to bring his own bedding or dishes but finds berths and a table completely if somewhat roughly furnished he enjoys a distinct superiority in diet but this strange to say differs not only on different ships but on the same ship according as her head is to the east or west in my own experience the principal difference between our table and that of the true steerage passenger was the table itself and the crockery plates from which we ate but lest i should show myself ungrateful let me recapitulate every advantage at breakfast we had a choice between tea and coffee for beverage a choice not easy to make the two were so surprisingly alike i found that i could sleep after the coffee and lay awake after the tea which is proof conclusive of some chemical disparity and even by the palate i could distinguish a smack of snuff in the former from a flavour of boiling and dishcloths in the second as a matter of fact i have seen passengers after many sips still doubting which had been supplied them in the way of eatables at the same meal we were gloriously favoured for in addition to porridge which was common to all we had irish stew sometimes a bit of fish and sometimes rissoles the dinner of soup roast fresh beef boiled salt junk and potatoes was i believe exactly common to the steerage and the second cabin only i have heard it rumoured that our potatoes were of a superior brand and twice a week on pudding days instead of duff we had a saddlebag filled with currants under the name of a plumpudding at tea we were served with some broken meat from the saloon sometimes in the comparatively elegant form of spare patties or rissoles but as a general thing mere chickenbones and flakes of fish neither hot nor cold if these were not the scrapings of plates their looks belied them sorely yet we were all too hungry to be proud and fell to these leavings greedily these the bread which was excellent and the soup and porridge which were both good formed my whole diet throughout the voyage so that except for the broken meat and the convenience of a table i might as well have been in the steerage outright had they given me porridge again in the evening i should have been perfectly contented with the fare as it was with a few biscuits and some whisky and water before turning in i kept my body going and my spirits up to the mark  the last particular in which the second cabin passenger remarkably stands ahead of his brother of the steerage is one altogether of sentiment in the steerage there are males and females in the second cabin ladies and gentlemen for some time after i came aboard i thought i was only a male but in the course of a voyage of discovery between decks i came on a brass plate and learned that i was still a gentleman nobody knew it of course i was lost in the crowd of males and females and rigorously confined to the same quarter of the deck who could tell whether i housed on the port or starboard side of steerage no 2 and 3 and it was only there that my superiority became practical everywhere else i was incognito moving among my inferiors with simplicity not so much as a swagger to indicate that i was a gentleman after all and had broken meat to tea still i was like one with a patent of nobility in a drawer at home and when i felt out of spirits i could go down and refresh myself with a look of that brass plate  for all these advantages i paid but two guineas six guineas is the steerage fare eight that by the second cabin and when you remember that the steerage passenger must supply bedding and dishes and in five cases out of ten either brings some dainties with him or privately pays the steward for extra rations the difference in price becomes almost nominal air comparatively fit to breathe food comparatively varied and the satisfaction of being still privately a gentleman may thus be had almost for the asking two of my fellowpassengers in the second cabin had already made the passage by the cheaper fare and declared it was an experiment not to be repeated as i go on to tell about my steerage friends the reader will perceive that they were not alone in their opinion out of ten with whom i was more or less intimate i am sure not fewer than five vowed if they returned to travel second cabin and all who had left their wives behind them assured me they would go without the comfort of their presence until they could afford to bring them by saloon  our party in the second cabin was not perhaps the most interesting on board perhaps even in the saloon there was as much goodwill and character yet it had some elements of curiosity there was a mixed group of swedes danes and norsemen one of whom generally known by the name of johnny in spite of his own protests greatly diverted us by his clever crosscountry efforts to speak english and became on the strength of that an universal favouriteit takes so little in this world of shipboard to create a popularity there was besides a scots mason known from his favourite dish as irish stew three or four nondescript scots a fine young irishman oreilly and a pair of young men who deserve a special word of condemnation one of them was scots the other claimed to be american admitted after some fencing that he was born in england and ultimately proved to be an irishman born and nurtured but ashamed to own his country he had a sister on board whom he faithfully neglected throughout the voyage though she was not only sick but much his senior and had nursed and cared for him in childhood in appearance he was like an imbecile henry the third of france the scotsman though perhaps as big an ass was not so dead of heart and i have only bracketed them together because they were fast friends and disgraced themselves equally by their conduct at the table  next to turn to topics more agreeable we had a newlymarried couple devoted to each other with a pleasant story of how they had first seen each other years ago at a preparatory school and that very afternoon he had carried her books home for her i do not know if this story will be plain to southern readers but to me it recalls many a school idyll with wrathful swains of eight and nine confronting each other stridelegs flushed with jealousy for to carry home a young ladys books was both a delicate attention and privilege  then there was an old lady or indeed i am not sure that she was as much old as antiquated and strangely out of place who had left her husband and was travelling all the way to kansas by herself we had to take her own word that she was married for it was sorely contradicted by the testimony of her appearance nature seemed to have sanctified her for the single state even the colour of her hair was incompatible with matrimony and her husband i thought should be a man of saintly spirit and phantasmal bodily presence she was ill poor thing her soul turned from the viands the dirty tablecloth shocked her like an impropriety and the whole strength of her endeavour was bent upon keeping her watch true to glasgow time till she should reach new york they had heard reports her husband and she of some unwarrantable disparity of hours between these two cities and with a spirit commendably scientific had seized on this occasion to put them to the proof it was a good thing for the old lady for she passed much leisure time in studying the watch once when prostrated by sickness she let it run down it was inscribed on her harmless mind in letters of adamant that the hands of a watch must never be turned backwards and so it behoved her to lie in wait for the exact moment ere she started it again when she imagined this was about due she sought out one of the young secondcabin scotsmen who was embarked on the same experiment as herself and had hitherto been less neglectful she was in quest of two oclock and when she learned it was already seven on the shores of clyde she lifted up her voice and cried gravy i had not heard this innocent expletive since i was a young child and i suppose it must have been the same with the other scotsmen present for we all laughed our fill  last but not least i come to my excellent friend mr jones it would be difficult to say whether i was his righthand man or he mine during the voyage thus at table i carved while he only scooped gravy but at our concerts of which more anon he was the president who called up performers to sing and i but his messenger who ran his errands and pleaded privately with the overmodest i knew i liked mr jones from the moment i saw him i thought him by his face to be scottish nor could his accent undeceive me for as there is a lingua franca of many tongues on the moles and in the feluccas of the mediterranean so there is a free or common accent among englishspeaking men who follow the sea they catch a twang in a new england port from a cockney skipper even a scotsman sometimes learns to drop an h a word of a dialect is picked up from another hand in the forecastle until often the result is undecipherable and you have to ask for the mans place of birth so it was with mr jones i thought him a scotsman who had been long to sea and yet he was from wales and had been most of his life a blacksmith at an inland forge a few years in america and half a score of ocean voyages having sufficed to modify his speech into the common pattern by his own account he was both strong and skilful in his trade a few years back he had been married and after a fashion a rich man now the wife was dead and the money gone but his was the nature that looks forward and goes on from one year to another and through all the extremities of fortune undismayed and if the sky were to fall tomorrow i should look to see jones the day following perched on a stepladder and getting things to rights he was always hovering round inventions like a bee over a flower and lived in a dream of patents he had with him a patent medicine for instance the composition of which he had bought years ago for five dollars from an american pedlar and sold the other day for a hundred pounds i think it was to an english apothecary it was called golden oil cured all maladies without exception and i am bound to say that i partook of it myself with good results it is a character of the man that he was not only perpetually dosing himself with golden oil but wherever there was a head aching or a finger cut there would be jones with his bottle  if he had one taste more strongly than another it was to study character many an hour have we two walked upon the deck dissecting our neighbours in a spirit that was too purely scientific to be called unkind whenever a quaint or human trait slipped out in conversation you might have seen jones and me exchanging glances and we could hardly go to bed in comfort till we had exchanged notes and discussed the days experience we were then like a couple of anglers comparing a days kill but the fish we angled for were of a metaphysical species and we angled as often as not in one anothers baskets once in the midst of a serious talk each found there was a scrutinising eye upon himself i own i paused in embarrassment at this double detection but jones with a better civility broke into a peal of unaffected laughter and declared what was the truth that there was a pair of us indeed                                early impressions   we steamed out of the clyde on thursday night and early on the friday forenoon we took in our last batch of emigrants at lough foyle in ireland and said farewell to europe the company was now complete and began to draw together by inscrutable magnetisms upon the deck there were scots and irish in plenty a few english a few americans a good handful of scandinavians a german or two and one russian all now belonging for ten days to one small iron country on the deep  as i walked the deck and looked round upon my fellowpassengers thus curiously assorted from all northern europe i began for the first time to understand the nature of emigration day by day throughout the passage and thenceforward across all the states and on to the shores of the pacific this knowledge grew more clear and melancholy emigration from a word of the most cheerful import came to sound most dismally in my ear there is nothing more agreeable to picture and nothing more pathetic to behold the abstract idea as conceived at home is hopeful and adventurous a young man you fancy scorning restraints and helpers issues forth into life that great battle to fight for his own hand the most pleasant stories of ambition of difficulties overcome and of ultimate success are but as episodes to this great epic of selfhelp the epic is composed of individual heroisms it stands to them as the victorious war which subdued an empire stands to the personal act of bravery which spiked a single cannon and was adequately rewarded with a medal for in emigration the young men enter direct and by the shipload on their heritage of work empty continents swarm as at the bosuns whistle with industrious hands and whole new empires are domesticated to the service of man  this is the closet picture and is found on trial to consist mostly of embellishments the more i saw of my fellow passengers the less i was tempted to the lyric note comparatively few of the men were below thirty many were married and encumbered with families not a few were already up in years and this itself was out of tune with my imaginations for the ideal emigrant should certainly be young again i thought he should offer to the eye some bold type of humanity with bluff or hawklike features and the stamp of an eager and pushing disposition now those around me were for the most part quiet orderly obedient citizens family men broken by adversity elderly youths who had failed to place themselves in life and people who had seen better days mildness was the prevailing character mild mirth and mild endurance in a word i was not taking part in an impetuous and conquering sally such as swept over mexico or siberia but found myself like marmion in the lost battle borne down by the flying  labouring mankind had in the last years and throughout great britain sustained a prolonged and crushing series of defeats i had heard vaguely of these reverses of whole streets of houses standing deserted by the tyne the cellardoors broken and removed for firewood of homeless men loitering at the streetcorners of glasgow with their chests beside them of closed factories useless strikes and starving girls but i had never taken them home to me or represented these distresses livingly to my imagination a turn of the market may be a calamity as disastrous as the french retreat from moscow but it hardly lends itself to lively treatment and makes a trifling figure in the morning papers we may struggle as we please we are not born economists the individual is more affecting than the mass it is by the scenic accidents and the appeal to the carnal eye that for the most part we grasp the significance of tragedies thus it was only now when i found myself involved in the rout that i began to appreciate how sharp had been the battle we were a company of the rejected the drunken the incompetent the weak the prodigal all who had been unable to prevail against circumstances in the one land were now fleeing pitifully to another and though one or two might still succeed all had already failed we were a shipful of failures the broken men of england yet it must not be supposed that these people exhibited depression the scene on the contrary was cheerful not a tear was shed on board the vessel all were full of hope for the future and showed an inclination to innocent gaiety some were heard to sing and all began to scrape acquaintance with small jests and ready laughter  the children found each other out like dogs and ran about the decks scraping acquaintance after their fashion also what do you call your mither i heard one ask mawmaw was the reply indicating i fancy a shade of difference in the social scale when people pass each other on the high seas of life at so early an age the contact is but slight and the relation more like what we may imagine to be the friendship of flies than that of men it is so quickly joined so easily dissolved so open in its communications and so devoid of deeper human qualities the children i observed were all in a band and as thick as thieves at a fair while their elders were still ceremoniously manoeuvring on the outskirts of acquaintance the sea the ship and the seamen were soon as familiar as home to these halfconscious little ones it was odd to hear them throughout the voyage employ shore words to designate portions of the vessel co way doon to yon dyke i heard one say probably meaning the bulwark i often had my heart in my mouth watching them climb into the shrouds or on the rails while the ship went swinging through the waves and i admired and envied the courage of their mothers who sat by in the sun and looked on with composure at these perilous feats hell maybe be a sailor i heard one remark nows the time to learn i had been on the point of running forward to interfere but stood back at that reproved very few in the more delicate classes have the nerve to look upon the peril of one dear to them but the life of poorer folk where necessity is so much more immediate and imperious braces even a mother to this extreme of endurance and perhaps after all it is better that the lad should break his neck than that you should break his spirit  and since i am here on the chapter of the children i must mention one little fellow whose family belonged to steerage no 4 and 5 and who wherever he went was like a strain of music round the ship he was an ugly merry unbreeched child of three his lintwhite hair in a tangle his face smeared with suet and treacle but he ran to and fro with so natural a step and fell and picked himself up again with such grace and goodhumour that he might fairly be called beautiful when he was in motion to meet him crowing with laughter and beating an accompaniment to his own mirth with a tin spoon upon a tin cup was to meet a little triumph of the human species even when his mother and the rest of his family lay sick and prostrate around him he sat upright in their midst and sang aloud in the pleasant heartlessness of infancy  throughout the friday intimacy among us men made but few advances we discussed the probable duration of the voyage we exchanged pieces of information naming our trades what we hoped to find in the new world or what we were fleeing from in the old and above all we condoled together over the food and the vileness of the steerage one or two had been so near famine that you may say they had run into the ship with the devil at their heels and to these all seemed for the best in the best of possible steamers but the majority were hugely discontented coming as they did from a country in so low a state as great britain many of them from glasgow which commercially speaking was as good as dead and many having long been out of work i was surprised to find them so dainty in their notions i myself lived almost exclusively on bread porridge and soup precisely as it was supplied to them and found it if not luxurious at least sufficient but these working men were loud in their outcries it was not food for human beings it was only fit for pigs it was a disgrace many of them lived almost entirely upon biscuit others on their own private supplies and some paid extra for better rations from the ship this marvellously changed my notion of the degree of luxury habitual to the artisan i was prepared to hear him grumble for grumbling is the travellers pastime but i was not prepared to find him turn away from a diet which was palatable to myself words i should have disregarded or taken with a liberal allowance but when a man prefers dry biscuit there can be no question of the sincerity of his disgust  with one of their complaints i could most heartily sympathise a single night of the steerage had filled them with horror i had myself suffered even in my decent secondcabin berth from the lack of air and as the night promised to be fine and quiet i determined to sleep on deck and advised all who complained of their quarters to follow my example i dare say a dozen of others agreed to do so and i thought we should have been quite a party yet when i brought up my rug about seven bells there was no one to be seen but the watch that chimerical terror of good nightair which makes men close their windows list their doors and seal themselves up with their own poisonous exhalations had sent all these healthy workmen down below one would think we had been brought up in a fever country yet in england the most malarious districts are in the bedchambers  i felt saddened at this defection and yet halfpleased to have the night so quietly to myself the wind had hauled a little ahead on the starboard bow and was dry but chilly i found a shelter near the firehole and made myself snug for the night the ship moved over the uneven sea with a gentle and cradling movement the ponderous organic labours of the engine in her bowels occupied the mind and prepared it for slumber from time to time a heavier lurch would disturb me as i lay and recall me to the obscure borders of consciousness or i heard as it were through a veil the clear note of the clapper on the brass and the beautiful seacry alls well i know nothing whether for poetry or music that can surpass the effect of these two syllables in the darkness of a night at sea  the day dawned fairly enough and during the early part we had some pleasant hours to improve acquaintance in the open air but towards nightfall the wind freshened the rain began to fall and the sea rose so high that it was difficult to keep ones footing on the deck i have spoken of our concerts we were indeed a musical ships company and cheered our way into exile with the fiddle the accordion and the songs of all nations good bad or indifferentscottish english irish russian german or norsethe songs were received with generous applause once or twice a recitation very spiritedly rendered in a powerful scottish accent varied the proceedings and once we sought in vain to dance a quadrille eight men of us together to the music of the violin the performers were all humorous frisky fellows who loved to cut capers in private life but as soon as they were arranged for the dance they conducted themselves like so many mutes at a funeral i have never seen decorum pushed so far and as this was not expected the quadrille was soon whistled down and the dancers departed under a cloud eight frenchmen even eight englishmen from another rank of society would have dared to make some fun for themselves and the spectators but the working man when sober takes an extreme and even melancholy view of personal deportment a fifthform schoolboy is not more careful of dignity he dares not be comical his fun must escape from him unprepared and above all it must be unaccompanied by any physical demonstration i like his society under most circumstances but let me never again join with him in public gambols  but the impulse to sing was strong and triumphed over modesty and even the inclemencies of sea and sky on this rough saturday night we got together by the main deckhouse in a place sheltered from the wind and rain some clinging to a ladder which led to the hurricane deck and the rest knitting arms or taking hands we made a ring to support the women in the violent lurching of the ship and when we were thus disposed sang to our hearts content some of the songs were appropriate to the scene others strikingly the reverse bastard doggrel of the musichall such as around her splendid form i weaved the magic circle sounded bald bleak and pitifully silly we dont want to fight but by jingo if we do was in some measure saved by the vigour and unanimity with which the chorus was thrown forth into the night i observed a plattdeutsch mason entirely innocent of english adding heartily to the general effect and perhaps the german mason is but a fair example of the sincerity with which the song was rendered for nearly all with whom i conversed upon the subject were bitterly opposed to war and attributed their own misfortunes and frequently their own taste for whisky to the campaigns in zululand and afghanistan  every now and again however some song that touched the pathos of our situation was given forth and you could hear by the voices that took up the burden how the sentiment came home to each the anchors weighed was true for us we were indeed rocked on the bosom of the stormy deep how many of us could say with the singer im lonely tonight love without you or go someone and tell them from me to write me a letter from home and when was there a more appropriate moment for auld lang syne than now when the land the friends and the affections of that mingled but beloved time were fading and fleeing behind us in the vessels wake it pointed forward to the hour when these labours should be overpast to the return voyage and to many a meeting in the sanded inn when those who had parted in the spring of youth should again drink a cup of kindness in their age had not burns contemplated emigration i scarce believe he would have found that note  all sunday the weather remained wild and cloudy many were prostrated by sickness only five sat down to tea in the second cabin and two of these departed abruptly ere the meal was at an end the sabbath was observed strictly by the majority of the emigrants i heard an old woman express her surprise that the ship didna gae doon as she saw some one pass her with a chessboard on the holy day some sang scottish psalms many went to service and in true scottish fashion came back ill pleased with their divine i didna think he was an experienced preacher said one girl to me  it was a bleak uncomfortable day but at night by six bells although the wind had not yet moderated the clouds were all wrecked and blown away behind the rim of the horizon and the stars came out thickly overhead i saw venus burning as steadily and sweetly across this hurlyburly of the winds and waters as ever at home upon the summer woods the engine pounded the screw tossed out of the water with a roar and shook the ship from end to end the bows battled with loud reports against the billows and as i stood in the leescuppers and looked up to where the funnel leaned out over my head vomiting smoke and the black and monstrous topsails blotted at each lurch a different crop of stars it seemed as if all this trouble were a thing of small account and that just above the mast reigned peace unbroken and eternal                                 steerage scenes   our companion steerage no 2 and 3 was a favourite resort down one flight of stairs there was a comparatively large open space the centre occupied by a hatchway which made a convenient seat for about twenty persons while barrels coils of rope and the carpenters bench afforded perches for perhaps as many more the canteen or steerage bar was on one side of the stair on the other a no less attractive spot the cabin of the indefatigable interpreter i have seen people packed into this space like herrings in a barrel and many merry evenings prolonged there until five bells when the lights were ruthlessly extinguished and all must go to roost  it had been rumoured since friday that there was a fiddler aboard who lay sick and unmelodious in steerage no 1 and on the monday forenoon as i came down the companion i was saluted by something in strathspey time a whitefaced orpheus was cheerily playing to an audience of whitefaced women it was as much as he could do to play and some of his hearers were scarce able to sit yet they had crawled from their bunks at the first experimental flourish and found better than medicine in the music some of the heaviest heads began to nod in time and a degree of animation looked from some of the palest eyes humanly speaking it is a more important matter to play the fiddle even badly than to write huge works upon recondite subjects what could mr darwin have done for these sick women but this fellow scraped away and the world was positively a better place for all who heard him we have yet to understand the economical value of these mere accomplishments i told the fiddler he was a happy man carrying happiness about with him in his fiddlecase and he seemed alive to the fact  it is a privilege i said he thought a while upon the word turning it over in his scots head and then answered with conviction yes a privilege  that night i was summoned by merrily danced the quakers wife into the companion of steerage no 4 and 5 this was properly speaking but a strip across a deckhouse lit by a sickly lantern which swung to and fro with the motion of the ship through the open slidedoor we had a glimpse of the grey night sea with patches of phosphorescent foam flying swift as birds into the wake and the horizon rising and falling as the vessel rolled to the wind in the centre the companion ladder plunged down sheerly like an open pit below on the first landing and lighted by another lamp lads and lasses danced not more than three at a time for lack of space in jigs and reels and hornpipes above on either side there was a recess railed with iron perhaps two feet wide and four long which stood for orchestra and seats of honour in the one balcony five slatternly irish lasses sat woven in a comely group in the other was posted orpheus his body which was convulsively in motion forming an odd contrast to his somnolent imperturbable scots face his brother a dark man with a vehement interested countenance who made a god of the fiddler sat by with open mouth drinking in the general admiration and throwing out remarks to kindle it  thats a bonny hornpipe now he would say its a great favourite with performers they dance the sand dance to it and he expounded the sand dance then suddenly it would be a long hush with uplifted finger and glowing supplicating eyes hes going to play auld robin gray on one string and throughout this excruciating movementon one string thats on one string he kept crying i would have given something myself that it had been on none but the hearers were much awed i called for a tune or two and thus introduced myself to the notice of the brother who directed his talk to me for some little while keeping i need hardly mention true to his topic like the seamen to the star hes grand of it he said confidentially his master was a musichall man indeed the musichall man had left his mark for our fiddler was ignorant of many of our best old airs logie o buchan for instance he only knew as a quick jigging figure in a set of quadrilles and had never heard it called by name perhaps after all the brother was the more interesting performer of the two i have spoken with him afterwards repeatedly and found him always the same quick fiery bit of a man not without brains but he never showed to such advantage as when he was thus squiring the fiddler into public note there is nothing more becoming than a genuine admiration and it shares this with love that it does not become contemptible although misplaced  the dancing was but feebly carried on the space was almost impracticably small and the irish wenches combined the extreme of bashfulness about this innocent display with a surprising impudence and roughness of address most often either the fiddle lifted up its voice unheeded or only a couple of lads would be footing it and snapping fingers on the landing and such was the eagerness of the brother to display all the acquirements of his idol and such the sleepy indifference of the performer that the tune would as often as not be changed and the hornpipe expire into a ballad before the dancers had cut half a dozen shuffles  in the meantime however the audience had been growing more and more numerous every moment there was hardly standingroom round the top of the companion and the strange instinct of the race moved some of the newcomers to close both the doors so that the atmosphere grew insupportable it was a good place as the saying is to leave  the wind hauled ahead with a head sea by ten at night heavy sprays were flying and drumming over the forecastle the companion of steerage no 1 had to be closed and the door of communication through the second cabin thrown open either from the convenience of the opportunity or because we had already a number of acquaintances in that part of the ship mr jones and i paid it a late visit steerage no 1 is shaped like an isosceles triangle the sides opposite the equal angles bulging outward with the contour of the ship it is lined with eight pens of sixteen bunks apiece four bunks below and four above on either side at night the place is lit with two lanterns one to each table as the steamer beat on her way among the rough billows the light passed through violent phases of change and was thrown to and fro and up and down with startling swiftness you were tempted to wonder as you looked how so thin a glimmer could control and disperse such solid blackness when jones and i entered we found a little company of our acquaintances seated together at the triangular foremost table a more forlorn party in more dismal circumstances it would be hard to imagine the motion here in the ships nose was very violent the uproar of the sea often overpoweringly loud the yellow flicker of the lantern spun round and round and tossed the shadows in masses the air was hot but it struck a chill from its foetor from all round in the dark bunks the scarcely human noises of the sick joined into a kind of farmyard chorus in the midst these five friends of mine were keeping up what heart they could in company singing was their refuge from discomfortable thoughts and sensations one piped in feeble tones oh why left i my hame which seemed a pertinent question in the circumstances another from the invisible horrors of a pen where he lay dogsick upon the upper shelf found courage in a blink of his sufferings to give us several verses of the death of nelson and it was odd and eerie to hear the chorus breathe feebly from all sorts of dark corners and this day has done his dooty rise and fall and be taken up again in this dim inferno to an accompaniment of plunging hollowsounding bows and the rattling sprayshowers overhead  all seemed unfit for conversation a certain dizziness had interrupted the activity of their minds and except to sing they were tonguetied there was present however one tall powerful fellow of doubtful nationality being neither quite scotsman nor altogether irish but of surprising clearness of conviction on the highest problems he had gone nearly beside himself on the sunday because of a general backwardness to indorse his definition of mind as a living thinking substance which cannot be felt heard or seennor i presume although he failed to mention it smelt now he came forward in a pause with another contribution to our culture  just by way of change said he ill ask you a scripture riddle theres profit in them too he added ungrammatically  this was the riddle                        c and p                       did agree                       to cut down c                       but c and p                       could not agree                       without the leave of g                       all the people cried to see                       the crueltie                       of c and p  harsh are the words of mercury after the songs of apollo we were a long while over the problem shaking our heads and gloomily wondering how a man could be such a fool but at length he put us out of suspense and divulged the fact that c and p stood for caiaphas and pontius pilate  i think it must have been the riddle that settled us but the motion and the close air likewise hurried our departure we had not been gone long we heard next morning ere two or even three out of the five fell sick we thought it little wonder on the whole for the sea kept contrary all night i now made my bed upon the second cabin floor where although i ran the risk of being stepped upon i had a free current of air more or less vitiated indeed and running only from steerage to steerage but at least not stagnant and from this couch as well as the usual sounds of a rough night at sea the hateful coughing and retching of the sick and the sobs of children i heard a man run wild with terror beseeching his friend for encouragement the ships going down he cried with a thrill of agony the ships going down he repeated now in a blank whisper now with his voice rising towards a sob and his friend might reassure him reason with him joke at himall was in vain and the old cry came back the ships going down there was something panic and catching in the emotion of his tones and i saw in a clear flash what an involved and hideous tragedy was a disaster to an emigrant ship if this whole parishful of people came no more to land into how many houses would the newspaper carry woe and what a great part of the web of our corporate human life would be rent across for ever  the next morning when i came on deck i found a new world indeed the wind was fair the sun mounted into a cloudless heaven through great dark blue seas the ship cut a swathe of curded foam the horizon was dotted all day with companionable sails and the sun shone pleasantly on the long heaving deck  we had many fineweather diversions to beguile the time there was a single chessboard and a single pack of cards sometimes as many as twenty of us would be playing dominoes for love feats of dexterity puzzles for the intelligence some arithmetical some of the same order as the old problem of the fox and goose and cabbage were always welcome and the latter i observed more popular as well as more conspicuously well done than the former we had a regular daily competition to guess the vessels progress and twelve oclock when the result was published in the wheelhouse came to be a moment of considerable interest but the interest was unmixed not a bet was laid upon our guesses from the clyde to sandy hook i never heard a wager offered or taken we had besides romps in plenty puss in the corner which we had rebaptised in more manly style devil and four corners was my own favourite game but there were many who preferred another the humour of which was to box a persons ears until he found out who had cuffed him  this tuesday morning we were all delighted with the change of weather and in the highest possible spirits we got in a cluster like bees sitting between each others feet under lee of the deckhouses stories and laughter went around the children climbed about the shrouds white faces appeared for the first time and began to take on colour from the wind i was kept hard at work making cigarettes for one amateur after another and my less than moderate skill was heartily admired lastly down sat the fiddler in our midst and began to discourse his reels and jigs and ballads with now and then a voice or two to take up the air and throw in the interest of human speech  through this merry and goodhearted scene there came three cabin passengers a gentleman and two young ladies picking their way with little gracious titters of indulgence and a ladybountiful air about nothing which galled me to the quick i have little of the radical in social questions and have always nourished an idea that one person was as good as another but i began to be troubled by this episode it was astonishing what insults these people managed to convey by their presence they seemed to throw their clothes in our faces their eyes searched us all over for tatters and incongruities a laugh was ready at their lips but they were too wellmannered to indulge it in our hearing wait a bit till they were all back in the saloon and then hear how wittily they would depict the manners of the steerage we were in truth very innocently cheerfully and sensibly engaged and there was no shadow of excuse for the swaying elegant superiority with which these damsels passed among us or for the stiff and waggish glances of their squire not a word was said only when they were gone mackay sullenly damned their impudence under his breath but we were all conscious of an icy influence and a dead break in the course of our enjoyment                                 steerage types   we had a fellow on board an irishamerican for all the world like a beggar in a print by callot oneeyed with great splay crowsfeet round the sockets a knotty squab nose coming down over his moustache a miraculous hat a shirt that had been white ay ages long ago an alpaca coat in its last sleeves and without hyperbole no buttons to his trousers even in these rags and tatters the man twinkled all over with impudence like a piece of sham jewellery and i have heard him offer a situation to one of his fellowpassengers with the air of a lord nothing could overlie such a fellow a kind of base success was written on his brow he was then in his ill days but i can imagine him in congress with his mouth full of bombast and sawder as we moved in the same circle i was brought necessarily into his society i do not think i ever heard him say anything that was true kind or interesting but there was entertainment in the mans demeanour you might call him a halfeducated irish tigg  our russian made a remarkable contrast to this impossible fellow rumours and legends were current in the steerages about his antecedents some said he was a nihilist escaping others set him down for a harmless spendthrift who had squandered fifty thousand roubles and whose father had now despatched him to america by way of penance either tale might flourish in security there was no contradiction to be feared for the hero spoke not one word of english i got on with him lumberingly enough in broken german and learned from his own lips that he had been an apothecary he carried the photograph of his betrothed in a pocketbook and remarked that it did not do her justice the cut of his head stood out from among the passengers with an air of startling strangeness the first natural instinct was to take him for a desperado but although the features to our western eyes had a barbaric and unhomely cast the eye both reassured and touched it was large and very dark and soft with an expression of dumb endurance as if it had often looked on desperate circumstances and never looked on them without resolution  he cried out when i used the word no no he said not resolution  the resolution to endure i explained  and then he shrugged his shoulders and said ach ja with gusto like a man who has been flattered in his favourite pretensions indeed he was always hinting at some secret sorrow and his life he said had been one of unusual trouble and anxiety so the legends of the steerage may have represented at least some shadow of the truth once and once only he sang a song at our concerts standing forth without embarrassment his great stature somewhat humped his long arms frequently extended his kalmuck head thrown backward it was a suitable piece of music as deep as a cows bellow and wild like the white sea he was struck and charmed by the freedom and sociality of our manners at home he said no one on a journey would speak to him but those with whom he would not care to speak thus unconsciously involving himself in the condemnation of his countrymen but russia was soon to be changed the ice of the neva was softening under the sun of civilisation the new ideas wie eine feine violine were audible among the big empty drumnotes of imperial diplomacy and he looked to see a great revival though with a somewhat indistinct and childish hope  we had a father and son who made a pair of jacksofalltrades it was the son who sang the death of nelson under such contrarious circumstances he was by trade a shearer of ship plates but he could touch the organ and led two choirs and played the flute and piccolo in a professional string band his repertory of songs was besides inexhaustible and ranged impartially from the very best to the very worst within his reach nor did he seem to make the least distinction between these extremes but would cheerfully follow up tom bowling with around her splendid form  the father an old cheery small piece of manhood could do everything connected with tinwork from one end of the process to the other use almost every carpenters tool and make picture frames to boot i sat down with silver plate every sunday said he and pictures on the wall i have made enough money to be rolling in my carriage but sir looking at me unsteadily with his bright rheumy eyes i was troubled with a drunken wife he took a hostile view of matrimony in consequence its an old saying he remarked god made em and the devil he mixed em  i think he was justified by his experience it was a dreary story he would bring home three pounds on saturday and on monday all the clothes would be in pawn sick of the useless struggle he gave up a paying contract and contented himself with small and illpaid jobs a bad job was as good as a good job for me he said it all went the same way once the wife showed signs of amendment she kept steady for weeks on end it was again worth while to labour and to do ones best the husband found a good situation some distance from home and to make a little upon every hand started the wife in a cookshop the children were here and there busy as mice savings began to grow together in the bank and the golden age of hope had returned again to that unhappy family but one week my old acquaintance getting earlier through with his work came home on the friday instead of the saturday and there was his wife to receive him reeling drunk he took and gave her a pair o black eyes for which i pardon him nailed up the cookshop door gave up his situation and resigned himself to a life of poverty with the workhouse at the end as the children came to their full age they fled the house and established themselves in other countries some did well some not so well but the father remained at home alone with his drunken wife all his soundhearted pluck and varied accomplishments depressed and negatived  was she dead now or after all these years had he broken the chain and run from home like a schoolboy i could not discover which but here at least he was out on the adventure and still one of the bravest and most youthful men on board  now i suppose i must put my old bones to work again said he but i can do a turn yet  and the son to whom he was going i asked was he not able to support him  oh yes he replied but im never happy without a job on hand and im stout i can eat amost anything you see no craze about me  this tale of a drunken wife was paralleled on board by another of a drunken father he was a capable man with a good chance in life but he had drunk up two thriving businesses like a bottle of sherry and involved his sons along with him in ruin now they were on board with us fleeing his disastrous neighbourhood  total abstinence like all ascetical conclusions is unfriendly to the most generous cheerful and human parts of man but it could have adduced many instances and arguments from among our ships company i was one day conversing with a kind and happy scotsman running to fat and perspiration in the physical but with a taste for poetry and a genial sense of fun i had asked him his hopes in emigrating they were like those of so many others vague and unfounded times were bad at home they were said to have a turn for the better in the states and a man could get on anywhere he thought that was precisely the weak point of his position for if he could get on in america why could he not do the same in scotland but i never had the courage to use that argument though it was often on the tip of my tongue and instead i agreed with him heartily adding with reckless originality if the man stuck to his work and kept away from drink  ah said he slowly the drink you see thats just my trouble  he spoke with a simplicity that was touching looking at me at the same time with something strange and timid in his eye halfashamed halfsorry like a good child who knows he should be beaten you would have said he recognised a destiny to which he was born and accepted the consequences mildly like the merchant abudah he was at the same time fleeing from his destiny and carrying it along with him the whole at an expense of six guineas  as far as i saw drink idleness and incompetency were the three great causes of emigration and for all of them and drink first and foremost this trick of getting transported overseas appears to me the silliest means of cure you cannot run away from a weakness you must some time fight it out or perish and if that be so why not now and where you stand coelum non animam change glenlivet for bourbon and it is still whisky only not so good a seavoyage will not give a man the nerve to put aside cheap pleasure emigration has to be done before we climb the vessel an aim in life is the only fortune worth the finding and it is not to be found in foreign lands but in the heart itself  speaking generally there is no vice of this kind more contemptible than another for each is but a result and outward sign of a soul tragically shipwrecked in the majority of cases cheap pleasure is resorted to by way of anodyne the pleasureseeker sets forth upon life with high and difficult ambitions he meant to be nobly good and nobly happy though at as little pains as possible to himself and it is because all has failed in his celestial enterprise that you now behold him rolling in the garbage hence the comparative success of the teetotal pledge because to a man who had nothing it sets at least a negative aim in life somewhat as prisoners beguile their days by taming a spider the reformed drunkard makes an interest out of abstaining from intoxicating drinks and may live for that negation there is something at least not to be done each day and a cold triumph awaits him every evening  we had one on board with us whom i have already referred to under the name of mackay who seemed to me not only a good instance of this failure in life of which we have been speaking but a good type of the intelligence which here surrounded me physically he was a small scotsman standing a little back as though he were already carrying the elements of a corporation and his looks somewhat marred by the smallness of his eyes mentally he was endowed above the average there were but few subjects on which he could not converse with understanding and a dash of wit delivering himself slowly and with gusto like a man who enjoyed his own sententiousness he was a dry quick pertinent debater speaking with a small voice and swinging on his heels to launch and emphasise an argument when he began a discussion he could not bear to leave it off but would pick the subject to the bone without once relinquishing a point an engineer by trade mackay believed in the unlimited perfectibility of all machines except the human machine the latter he gave up with ridicule for a compound of carrion and perverse gases he had an appetite for disconnected facts which i can only compare to the savage taste for beads what is called information was indeed a passion with the man and he not only delighted to receive it but could pay you back in kind  with all these capabilities here was mackay already no longer young on his way to a new country with no prospects no money and but little hope he was almost tedious in the cynical disclosures of his despair the ship may go down for me he would say now or tomorrow i have nothing to lose and nothing to hope and again i am sick of the whole damned performance he was like the kind little man already quoted another socalled victim of the bottle but mackay was miles from publishing his weakness to the world laid the blame of his failure on corrupt masters and a corrupt state policy and after he had been one night overtaken and had played the buffoon in his cups sternly though not without tact suppressed all reference to his escapade it was a treat to see him manage this the various jesters withered under his gaze and you were forced to recognise in him a certain steely force and a gift of command which might have ruled a senate  in truth it was not whisky that had ruined him he was ruined long before for all good human purposes but conversation his eyes were sealed by a cheap schoolbook materialism he could see nothing in the world but money and steamengines he did not know what you meant by the word happiness he had forgotten the simple emotions of childhood and perhaps never encountered the delights of youth he believed in production that useful figment of economy as if it had been real like laughter and production without prejudice to liquor was his god and guide one day he took me to taska novel cry to meupon the overpayment of literature literary men he said were more highly paid than artisans yet the artisan made threshing machines and butterchurns and the man of letters except in the way of a few useful handbooks made nothing worth the while he produced a mere fancy article mackays notion of a book was hoppuss measurer now in my time i have possessed and even studied that work but if i were to be left tomorrow on juan fernandez hoppuss is not the book that i should choose for my companion volume  i tried to fight the point with mackay i made him own that he had taken pleasure in reading books otherwise to his view insignificant but he was too wary to advance a step beyond the admission it was in vain for me to argue that here was pleasure readymade and running from the spring whereas his ploughs and butterchurns were but means and mechanisms to give men the necessary food and leisure before they start upon the search for pleasure he jibbed and ran away from such conclusions the thing was different he declared and nothing was serviceable but what had to do with food eat eat eat he cried thats the bottom and the top by an odd irony of circumstance he grew so much interested in this discussion that he let the hour slip by unnoticed and had to go without his tea he had enough sense and humour indeed he had no lack of either to have chuckled over this himself in private and even to me he referred to it with the shadow of a smile  mackay was a hot bigot he would not hear of religion i have seen him waste hours of time in argument with all sorts of poor human creatures who understood neither him nor themselves and he had had the boyishness to dissect and criticise even so small a matter as the riddlers definition of mind he snorted aloud with zealotry and the lust for intellectual battle anything whatever it was that seemed to him likely to discourage the continued passionate production of corn and steamengines he resented like a conspiracy against the people thus when i put in the plea for literature that it was only in good books or in the society of the good that a man could get help in his conduct he declared i was in a different world from him damn my conduct said he i have given it up for a bad job my question is can i drive a nail and he plainly looked upon me as one who was insidiously seeking to reduce the peoples annual bellyful of corn and steamengines  it may be argued that these opinions spring from the defect of culture that a narrow and pinching way of life not only exaggerates to a man the importance of material conditions but indirectly by denying him the necessary books and leisure keeps his mind ignorant of larger thoughts and that hence springs this overwhelming concern about diet and hence the bald view of existence professed by mackay had this been an english peasant the conclusion would be tenable but mackay had most of the elements of a liberal education he had skirted metaphysical and mathematical studies he had a thoughtful hold of what he knew which would be exceptional among bankers he had been brought up in the midst of hothouse piety and told with incongruous pride the story of his own brothers deathbed ecstasies yet he had somehow failed to fulfil himself and was adrift like a dead thing among external circumstances without hope or lively preference or shaping aim and further there seemed a tendency among many of his fellows to fall into the same blank and unlovely opinions one thing indeed is not to be learned in scotland and that is the way to be happy yet that is the whole of culture and perhaps twothirds of morality can it be that the puritan school by divorcing a man from nature by thinning out his instincts and setting a stamp of its disapproval on whole fields of human activity and interest leads at last directly to material greed  nature is a good guide through life and the love of simple pleasures next if not superior to virtue and we had on board an irishman who based his claim to the widest and most affectionate popularity precisely upon these two qualities that he was natural and happy he boasted a fresh colour a tight little figure unquenchable gaiety and indefatigable goodwill his clothes puzzled the diagnostic mind until you heard he had been once a private coachman when they became eloquent and seemed a part of his biography his face contained the rest and i fear a prophecy of the future the hawks nose above accorded so ill with the pink babys mouth below his spirit and his pride belonged you might say to the nose while it was the general shiftlessness expressed by the other that had thrown him from situation to situation and at length on board the emigrant ship barney ate so to speak nothing from the galley his own tea butter and eggs supported him throughout the voyage and about mealtime you might often find him up to the elbows in amateur cookery his was the first voice heard singing among all the passengers he was the first who fell to dancing from loch foyle to sandy hook there was not a piece of fun undertaken but there was barney in the midst  you ought to have seen him when he stood up to sing at our concertshis tight little figure stepping to and fro and his feet shuffling to the air his eyes seeking and bestowing encouragementand to have enjoyed the bow so nicely calculated between jest and earnest between grace and clumsiness with which he brought each song to a conclusion he was not only a great favourite among ourselves but his songs attracted the lords of the saloon who often leaned to hear him over the rails of the hurricanedeck he was somewhat pleased but not at all abashed by this attention and one night in the midst of his famous performance of billy keogh i saw him spin half round in a pirouette and throw an audacious wink to an old gentleman above  this was the more characteristic as for all his daffing he was a modest and very polite little fellow among ourselves  he would not hurt the feelings of a fly nor throughout the passage did he give a shadow of offence yet he was always by his innocent freedoms and love of fun brought upon that narrow margin where politeness must be natural to walk without a fall he was once seriously angry and that in a grave quiet manner because they supplied no fish on friday for barney was a conscientious catholic he had likewise strict notions of refinement and when late one evening after the women had retired a young scotsman struck up an indecent song barneys drab clothes were immediately missing from the group his taste was for the society of gentlemen of whom with the readers permission there was no lack in our five steerages and second cabin and he avoided the rough and positive with a girlish shrinking mackay partly from his superior powers of mind which rendered him incomprehensible partly from his extreme opinions was especially distasteful to the irishman i have seen him slink off with backward looks of terror and offended delicacy while the other in his witty ugly way had been professing hostility to god and an extreme theatrical readiness to be shipwrecked on the spot these utterances hurt the little coachmans modesty like a bad word                                  the sick man   one night jones the young oreilly and myself were walking arminarm and briskly up and down the deck six bells had rung a headwind blew chill and fitful the fog was closing in with a sprinkle of rain and the fogwhistle had been turned on and now divided time with its unwelcome outcries loud like a bull thrilling and intense like a mosquito even the watch lay somewhere snugly out of sight  for some time we observed something lying black and huddled in the scuppers which at last heaved a little and moaned aloud we ran to the rails an elderly man but whether passenger or seaman it was impossible in the darkness to determine lay grovelling on his belly in the wet scuppers and kicking feebly with his outspread toes we asked him what was amiss and he replied incoherently with a strange accent and in a voice unmanned by terror that he had cramp in the stomach that he had been ailing all day had seen the doctor twice and had walked the deck against fatigue till he was overmastered and had fallen where we found him  jones remained by his side while oreilly and i hurried off to seek the doctor we knocked in vain at the doctors cabin there came no reply nor could we find anyone to guide us it was no time for delicacy so we ran once more forward and i whipping up a ladder and touching my hat to the officer of the watch addressed him as politely as i could  i beg your pardon sir but there is a man lying bad with cramp in the lee scuppers and i cant find the doctor  he looked at me peeringly in the darkness and then somewhat harshly well i cant leave the bridge my man said he  no sir but you can tell me what to do i returned  is it one of the crew he asked  i believe him to be a fireman i replied  i dare say officers are much annoyed by complaints and alarmist information from their freight of human creatures but certainly whether it was the idea that the sick man was one of the crew or from something conciliatory in my address the officer in question was immediately relieved and mollified and speaking in a voice much freer from constraint advised me to find a steward and despatch him in quest of the doctor who would now be in the smokingroom over his pipe  one of the stewards was often enough to be found about this hour down our companion steerage no 2 and 3 that was his smokingroom of a night let me call him blackwood oreilly and i rattled down the companion breathing hurry and in his shortsleeves and perched across the carpenters bench upon one thigh found blackwood a neat bright dapper glasgowlooking man with a bead of an eye and a rank twang in his speech i forget who was with him but the pair were enjoying a deliberate talk over their pipes i dare say he was tired with his days work and eminently comfortable at that moment and the truth is i did not stop to consider his feelings but told my story in a breath  steward said i theres a man lying bad with cramp and i cant find the doctor  he turned upon me as pert as a sparrow but with a black look that is the prerogative of man and taking his pipe out of his mouth  thats none of my business said he i dont care  i could have strangled the little ruffian where he sat the thought of his cabin civility and cabin tips filled me with indignation i glanced at oreilly he was pale and quivering and looked like assault and battery every inch of him but we had a better card than violence  you will have to make it your business said i for i am sent to you by the officer on the bridge  blackwood was fairly tripped he made no answer but put out his pipe gave me one murderous look and set off upon his errand strolling from that day forward i should say he improved to me in courtesy as though he had repented his evil speech and were anxious to leave a better impression  when we got on deck again jones was still beside the sick man and two or three late stragglers had gathered round and were offering suggestions one proposed to give the patient water which was promptly negatived another bade us hold him up he himself prayed to be let lie but as it was at least as well to keep him off the streaming decks oreilly and i supported him between us it was only by main force that we did so and neither an easy nor an agreeable duty for he fought in his paroxysms like a frightened child and moaned miserably when he resigned himself to our control  o let me lie he pleaded ill no get better anyway and then with a moan that went to my heart o why did i come upon this miserable journey  i was reminded of the song which i had heard a little while before in the close tossing steerage o why left i my hame  meantime jones relieved of his immediate charge had gone off to the galley where we could see a light there he found a belated cook scouring pans by the radiance of two lanterns and one of these he sought to borrow the scullion was backward was it one of the crew he asked and when jones smitten with my theory had assured him that it was a fireman he reluctantly left his scouring and came towards us at an easy pace with one of the lanterns swinging from his finger the light as it reached the spot showed us an elderly man thickset and grizzled with years but the shifting and coarse shadows concealed from us the expression and even the design of his face  so soon as the cook set eyes on him he gave a sort of whistle  its only a passenger said he and turning about made lantern and all for the galley  hes a man anyway cried jones in indignation  nobody said he was a woman said a gruff voice which i recognised for that of the bosun  all this while there was no word of blackwood or the doctor and now the officer came to our side of the ship and asked over the hurricanedeck rails if the doctor were not yet come we told him not  no he repeated with a breathing of anger and we saw him hurry aft in person  ten minutes after the doctor made his appearance deliberately enough and examined our patient with the lantern he made little of the case had the man brought aft to the dispensary dosed him and sent him forward to his bunk two of his neighbours in the steerage had now come to our assistance expressing loud sorrow that such a fine cheery body should be sick and these claiming a sort of possession took him entirely under their own care the drug had probably relieved him for he struggled no more and was led along plaintive and patient but protesting his heart recoiled at the thought of the steerage o let me lie down upon the bieldy side he cried o dinna take me down and again o why did ever i come upon this miserable voyage and yet once more with a gasp and a wailing prolongation of the fourth word i had no call to come but there he was and by the doctors order and the kind force of his two shipmates disappeared down the companion of steerage no 1 into the den allotted him  at the foot of our own companion just where i had found blackwood jones and the bosun were now engaged in talk this last was a gruff cruellooking seaman who must have passed near half a century upon the seas squareheaded goatbearded with heavy blonde eyebrows and an eye without radiance but inflexibly steady and hard i had not forgotten his rough speech but i remembered also that he had helped us about the lantern and now seeing him in conversation with jones and being choked with indignation i proceeded to blow off my steam  well said i i make you my compliments upon your steward and furiously narrated what had happened  ive nothing to do with him replied the bosun theyre all alike they wouldnt mind if they saw you all lying dead one upon the top of another  this was enough a very little humanity went a long way with me after the experience of the evening a sympathy grew up at once between the bosun and myself and that night and during the next few days i learned to appreciate him better he was a remarkable type and not at all the kind of man you find in books he had been at sebastopol under english colours and again in a states ship after the alabama and praying god we shouldnt find her he was a high tory and a high englishman no manufacturer could have held opinions more hostile to the working man and his strikes the workmen he said think nothing of their country they think of nothing but themselves theyre damned greedy selfish fellows he would not hear of the decadence of england they say they send us beef from america he argued but who pays for it all the money in the worlds in england the royal navy was the best of possible services according to him anyway the officers are gentlemen said he and you cant get hazed to death by a damned noncommissioned  as you can in the army among nations england was the first then came france he respected the french navy and liked the french people and if he were forced to make a new choice in life by god he would try frenchmen for all his looks and rough cold manners i observed that children were never frightened by him they divined him at once to be a friend and one night when he had chalked his hand and went about stealthily setting his mark on peoples clothes it was incongruous to hear this formidable old salt chuckling over his boyish monkey trick  in the morning my first thought was of the sick man i was afraid i should not recognise him so baffling had been the light of the lantern and found myself unable to decide if he were scots english or irish he had certainly employed northcountry words and elisions but the accent and the pronunciation seemed unfamiliar and incongruous in my ear  to descend on an empty stomach into steerage no 1 was an adventure that required some nerve the stench was atrocious each respiration tasted in the throat like some horrible kind of cheese and the squalid aspect of the place was aggravated by so many people worming themselves into their clothes in the twilight of the bunks you may guess if i was pleased not only for him but for myself also when i heard that the sick man was better and had gone on deck  the morning was raw and foggy though the sun suffused the fog with pink and amber the foghorn still blew stertorous and intermittent and to add to the discomfort the seamen were just beginning to wash down the decks but for a sick man this was heaven compared to the steerage i found him standing on the hotwater pipe just forward of the saloon deckhouse he was smaller than i had fancied and plainlooking but his face was distinguished by strange and fascinating eyes limpid grey from a distance but when looked into full of changing colours and grains of gold his manners were mild and uncompromisingly plain and i soon saw that when once started he delighted to talk his accent and language had been formed in the most natural way since he was born in ireland had lived a quarter of a century on the banks of the tyne and was married to a scots wife a fisherman in the season he had fished the east coast from fisherrow to whitby when the season was over and the great boats which required extra hands were once drawn up on shore till the next spring he worked as a labourer about chemical furnaces or along the wharves unloading vessels in this comparatively humble way of life he had gathered a competence and could speak of his comfortable house his hayfield and his garden on this ship where so many accomplished artisans were fleeing from starvation he was present on a pleasure trip to visit a brother in new york  ere he started he informed me he had been warned against the steerage and the steerage fare and recommended to bring with him a ham and tea and a spice loaf but he laughed to scorn such counsels im not afraid he had told his adviser ill get on for ten days ive not been a fisherman for nothing for it is no light matter as he reminded me to be in an open boat perhaps waistdeep with herrings day breaking with a scowl and for miles on every hand leeshores unbroken ironbound surfbeat with only here and there an anchorage where you dare not lie or a harbour impossible to enter with the wind that blows the life of a north sea fisher is one long chapter of exposure and hard work and insufficient fare and even if he makes land at some bleak fisher port perhaps the season is bad or his boat has been unlucky and after fifty hours unsleeping vigilance and toil not a shop will give him credit for a loaf of bread yet the steerage of the emigrant ship had been too vile for the endurance of a man thus rudely trained he had scarce eaten since he came on board until the day before when his appetite was tempted by some excellent peasoup we were all much of the same mind on board and beginning with myself had dined upon peasoup not wisely but too well only with him the excess had been punished perhaps because he was weakened by former abstinence and his first meal had resulted in a cramp he had determined to live henceforth on biscuit and when two months later he should return to england to make the passage by saloon the second cabin after due inquiry he scouted as another edition of the steerage  he spoke apologetically of his emotion when ill ye see i had no call to be here said he and i thought it was by with me last night ive a good house at home and plenty to nurse me and i had no real call to leave them speaking of the attentions he had received from his shipmates generally they were all so kind he said that theres none to mention and except in so far as i might share in this he troubled me with no reference to my services  but what affected me in the most lively manner was the wealth of this daylabourer paying a two months pleasure visit to the states and preparing to return in the saloon and the new testimony rendered by his story not so much to the horrors of the steerage as to the habitual comfort of the working classes one foggy frosty december evening i encountered on liberton hill near edinburgh an irish labourer trudging homeward from the fields our roads lay together and it was natural that we should fall into talk he was covered with mud an inoffensive ignorant creature who thought the atlantic cable was a secret contrivance of the masters the better to oppress labouring mankind and i confess i was astonished to learn that he had nearly three hundred pounds in the bank but this man had travelled over most of the world and enjoyed wonderful opportunities on some american railroad with two dollars a shift and double pay on sunday and at night whereas my fellowpassenger had never quitted tyneside and had made all that he possessed in that same accursed downfalling england whence skilled mechanics engineers millwrights and carpenters were fleeing as from the native country of starvation  fitly enough we slid off on the subject of strikes and wages and hard times being from the tyne and a man who had gained and lost in his own pocket by these fluctuations he had much to say and held strong opinions on the subject he spoke sharply of the masters and when i led him on of the men also the masters had been selfish and obstructive the men selfish silly and lightheaded he rehearsed to me the course of a meeting at which he had been present and the somewhat long discourse which he had there pronounced calling into question the wisdom and even the good faith of the union delegates and although he had escaped himself through flush times and starvation times with a handsomely provided purse he had so little faith in either man or master and so profound a terror for the unerring nemesis of mercantile affairs that he could think of no hope for our country outside of a sudden and complete political subversion down must go lords and church and army and capital by some happy direction must change hands from worse to better or england stood condemned such principles he said were growing like a seed  from this mild soft domestic man these words sounded unusually ominous and grave i had heard enough revolutionary talk among my workmen fellowpassengers but most of it was hot and turgid and fell discredited from the lips of unsuccessful men this man was calm he had attained prosperity and ease he disapproved the policy which had been pursued by labour in the past and yet this was his panaceato rend the old country from end to end and from top to bottom and in clamour and civil discord remodel it with the hand of violence                                 the stowaways   on the sunday among a party of men who were talking in our companion steerage no 2 and 3 we remarked a new figure he wore tweed clothes well enough made if not very fresh and a plain smokingcap his face was pale with pale eyes and spiritedly enough designed but though not yet thirty a sort of blackguardly degeneration had already overtaken his features the fine nose had grown fleshy towards the point the pale eyes were sunk in fat his hands were strong and elegant his experience of life evidently varied his speech full of pith and verve his manners forward but perfectly presentable the lad who helped in the second cabin told me in answer to a question that he did not know who he was but thought by his way of speaking and because he was so polite that he was some one from the saloon  i was not so sure for to me there was something equivocal in his air and bearing he might have been i thought the son of some good family who had fallen early into dissipation and run from home but making every allowance how admirable was his talk i wish you could have heard him tell his own stories they were so swingingly set forth in such dramatic language and illustrated here and there by such luminous bits of acting that they could only lose in any reproduction there were tales of the p and o company where he had been an officer of the east indies where in former years he had lived lavishly of the royal engineers where he had served for a period and of a dozen other sides of life each introducing some vigorous thumbnail portrait he had the talk to himself that night we were all so glad to listen the best talkers usually address themselves to some particular society there they are kings elsewhere campfollowers as a man may know russian and yet be ignorant of spanish but this fellow had a frank headlong power of style and a broad human choice of subject that would have turned any circle in the world into a circle of hearers he was a homeric talker plain strong and cheerful and the things and the people of which he spoke became readily and clearly present to the minds of those who heard him this with a certain added colouring of rhetoric and rodomontade must have been the style of burns who equally charmed the ears of duchesses and hostlers  yet freely and personally as he spoke many points remained obscure in his narration the engineers for instance was a service which he praised highly it is true there would be trouble with the sergeants but then the officers were gentlemen and his own in particular one among ten thousand it sounded so far exactly like an episode in the rakish topsyturvy life of such an one as i had imagined but then there came incidents more doubtful which showed an almost impudent greed after gratuities and a truly impudent disregard for truth and then there was the tale of his departure he had wearied it seems of woolwich and one fine day with a companion slipped up to london for a spree i have a suspicion that spree was meant to be a long one but god disposes all things and one morning near westminster bridge whom should he come across but the very sergeant who had recruited him at first what followed he himself indicated cavalierly that he had then resigned let us put it so but these resignations are sometimes very trying  at length after having delighted us for hours he took himself away from the companion and i could ask mackay who and what he was that said mackay why thats one of the stowaways  no man said the same authority who has had anything to do with the sea would ever think of paying for a passage i give the statement as mackays without endorsement yet i am tempted to believe that it contains a grain of truth and if you add that the man shall be impudent and thievish or else deadbroke it may even pass for a fair representation of the facts we gentlemen of england who live at home at ease have i suspect very insufficient ideas on the subject all the world over people are stowing away in coalholes and dark corners and when ships are once out to sea appearing again begrimed and bashful upon deck the career of these seatramps partakes largely of the adventurous they may be poisoned by coalgas or die by starvation in their place of concealment or when found they may be clapped at once and ignominiously into irons thus to be carried to their promised land the port of destination and alas brought back in the same way to that from which they started and there delivered over to the magistrates and the seclusion of a county jail since i crossed the atlantic one miserable stowaway was found in a dying state among the fuel uttered but a word or two and departed for a farther country than america  when the stowaway appears on deck he has but one thing to pray for that he be set to work which is the price and sign of his forgiveness after half an hour with a swab or a bucket he feels himself as secure as if he had paid for his passage it is not altogether a bad thing for the company who get more or less efficient hands for nothing but a few plates of junk and duff and every now and again find themselves better paid than by a whole family of cabin passengers not long ago for instance a packet was saved from nearly certain loss by the skill and courage of a stowaway engineer as was no more than just a handsome subscription rewarded him for his success but even without such exceptional good fortune as things stand in england and america the stowaway will often make a good profit out of his adventure four engineers stowed away last summer on the same ship the circassia and before two days after their arrival each of the four had found a comfortable berth this was the most hopeful tale of emigration that i heard from first to last and as you see the luck was for stowaways  my curiosity was much inflamed by what i heard and the next morning as i was making the round of the ship i was delighted to find the exroyal engineer engaged in washing down the white paint of a deck house there was another fellow at work beside him a lad not more than twenty in the most miraculous tatters his handsome face sown with grains of beauty and lighted up by expressive eyes four stowaways had been found aboard our ship before she left the clyde but these two had alone escaped the ignominy of being put ashore alick my acquaintance of last night was scots by birth and by trade a practical engineer the other was from devonshire and had been to sea before the mast two people more unlike by training character and habits it would be hard to imagine yet here they were together scrubbing paint  alick had held all sorts of good situations and wasted many opportunities in life i have heard him end a story with these words that was in my golden days when i used fingerglasses situation after situation failed him then followed the depression of trade and for months he had hung round with other idlers playing marbles all day in the west park and going home at night to tell his landlady how he had been seeking for a job i believe this kind of existence was not unpleasant to alick himself and he might have long continued to enjoy idleness and a life on tick but he had a comrade let us call him brown who grew restive this fellow was continually threatening to slip his cable for the states and at last one wednesday glasgow was left widowed of her brown some months afterwards alick met another old chum in sauchiehall street  by the bye alick said he i met a gentleman in new york who was asking for you  who was that asked alick  the new second engineer on board the soandso was the reply  well and who is he  brown to be sure  for brown had been one of the fortunate quartette aboard the circassia if that was the way of it in the states alick thought it was high time to follow browns example he spent his last day as he put it reviewing the yeomanry and the next morning says he to his landlady mrs x ill not take porridge today please ill take some eggs  why have you found a job she asked delighted  well yes returned the perfidious alick i think ill start today  and so well lined with eggs start he did but for america i am afraid that landlady has seen the last of him  it was easy enough to get on board in the confusion that attends a vessels departure and in one of the dark corners of steerage no 1 flat in a bunk and with an empty stomach alick made the voyage from the broomielaw to greenock that night the ships yeoman pulled him out by the heels and had him before the mate two other stowaways had already been found and sent ashore but by this time darkness had fallen they were out in the middle of the estuary and the last steamer had left them till the morning  take him to the forecastle and give him a meal said the mate and see and pack him off the first thing tomorrow  in the forecastle he had supper a good nights rest and breakfast and was sitting placidly with a pipe fancying all was over and the game up for good with that ship when one of the sailors grumbled out an oath at him with a what are you doing there and do you call that hiding anyway there was need of no more alick was in another bunk before the day was older shortly before the passengers arrived the ship was cursorily inspected he heard the round come down the companion and look into one pen after another until they came within two of the one in which he lay concealed into these last two they did not enter but merely glanced from without and alick had no doubt that he was personally favoured in this escape it was the character of the man to attribute nothing to luck and but little to kindness whatever happened to him he had earned in his own right amply favours came to him from his singular attraction and adroitness and misfortunes he had always accepted with his eyes open half an hour after the searchers had departed the steerage began to fill with legitimate passengers and the worst of alicks troubles was at an end he was soon making himself popular smoking other peoples tobacco and politely sharing their private stock of delicacies and when night came he retired to his bunk beside the others with composure  next day by afternoon lough foyle being already far behind and only the rough northwestern hills of ireland within view alick appeared on deck to court inquiry and decide his fate as a matter of fact he was known to several on board and even intimate with one of the engineers but it was plainly not the etiquette of such occasions for the authorities to avow their information every one professed surprise and anger on his appearance and he was led prisoner before the captain  what have you got to say for yourself inquired the captain  not much said alick but when a man has been a long time out of a job he will do things he would not under other circumstances  are you willing to work  alick swore he was burning to be useful  and what can you do asked the captain  he replied composedly that he was a brassfitter by trade  i think you will be better at engineering suggested the officer with a shrewd look  no sir says alick simplytheres few can beat me at a lie was his engaging commentary to me as he recounted the affair  have you been to sea again asked the captain  ive had a trip on a clyde steamboat sir but no more replied the unabashed alick  well we must try and find some work for you concluded the officer  and hence we behold alick clear of the hot engineroom lazily scraping paint and now and then taking a pull upon a sheet you leave me alone was his deduction when i get talking to a man i can get round him  the other stowaway whom i will call the devonianit was noticeable that neither of them told his namehad both been brought up and seen the world in a much smaller way his father a confectioner died and was closely followed by his mother his sisters had taken i think to dressmaking he himself had returned from sea about a year ago and gone to live with his brother who kept the george hotelit was not quite a real hotel added the candid fellowand had a hired man to mind the horses at first the devonian was very welcome but as time went on his brother not unnaturally grew cool towards him and he began to find himself one too many at the george hotel i dont think brothers care much for you he said as a general reflection upon life hurt at this change nearly penniless and too proud to ask for more he set off on foot and walked eighty miles to weymouth living on the journey as he could he would have enlisted but he was too small for the army and too old for the navy and thought himself fortunate at last to find a berth on board a trading dandy somewhere in the bristol channel the dandy sprung a leak and went down and though the crew were picked up and brought ashore by fishermen they found themselves with nothing but the clothes upon their back his next engagement was scarcely better starred for the ship proved so leaky and frightened them all so heartily during a short passage through the irish sea that the entire crew deserted and remained behind upon the quays of belfast  evil days were now coming thick on the devonian he could find no berth in belfast and had to work a passage to glasgow on a steamer she reached the broomielaw on a wednesday the devonian had a bellyful that morning laying in breakfast manfully to provide against the future and set off along the quays to seek employment but he was now not only penniless his clothes had begun to fall in tatters he had begun to have the look of a street arab and captains will have nothing to say to a ragamuffin for in that trade as in all others it is the coat that depicts the man you may hand reef and steer like an angel but if you have a hole in your trousers it is like a millstone round your neck the devonian lost heart at so many refusals he had not the impudence to beg although as he said when i had money of my own i always gave it it was only on saturday morning after three whole days of starvation that he asked a scone from a milkwoman who added of her own accord a glass of milk he had now made up his mind to stow away not from any desire to see america but merely to obtain the comfort of a place in the forecastle and a supply of familiar seafare he lived by begging always from milkwomen and always scones and milk and was not once refused it was vile wet weather and he could never have been dry by night he walked the streets and by day slept upon glasgow green and heard in the intervals of his dozing the famous theologians of the spot clear up intricate points of doctrine and appraise the merits of the clergy he had not much instruction he could read bills on the street but was main bad at writing yet these theologians seemed to have impressed him with a genuine sense of amusement why he did not go to the sailors home i know not i presume there is in glasgow one of these institutions which are by far the happiest and the wisest effort of contemporaneous charity but i must stand to my author as they say in old books and relate the story as i heard it in the meantime he had tried four times to stow away in different vessels and four times had been discovered and handed back to starvation the fifth time was lucky and you may judge if he were pleased to be aboard ship again at his old work and with duff twice a week he was said alick a devil for the duff or if devil was not the word it was one if anything stronger  the difference in the conduct of the two was remarkable the devonian was as willing as any paid hand swarmed aloft among the first pulled his natural weight and firmly upon a rope and found work for himself when there was none to show him alick on the other hand was not only a skulker in the grain but took a humorous and fine gentlemanly view of the transaction he would speak to me by the hour in ostentatious idleness and only if the bosun or a mate came by fellto languidly for just the necessary time till they were out of sight im not breaking my heart with it he remarked  once there was a hatch to be opened near where he was stationed he watched the preparations for a second or so suspiciously and then hullo said he heres some real work comingim off and he was gone that moment again calculating the six guinea passagemoney and the probable duration of the passage he remarked pleasantly that he was getting six shillings a day for this job and its pretty dear to the company at that they are making nothing by me was another of his observations theyre making something by that fellow and he pointed to the devonian who was just then busy to the eyes  the more you saw of alick the more it must be owned you learned to despise him his natural talents were of no use either to himself or others for his character had degenerated like his face and become pulpy and pretentious even his power of persuasion which was certainly very surprising stood in some danger of being lost or neutralised by overconfidence he lied in an aggressive brazen manner like a pert criminal in the dock and he was so vain of his own cleverness that he could not refrain from boasting ten minutes after of the very trick by which he had deceived you why now i have more money than when i came on board he said one night exhibiting a sixpence and yet i stood myself a bottle of beer before i went to bed yesterday and as for tobacco i have fifteen sticks of it that was fairly successful indeed yet a man of his superiority and with a less obtrusive policy might who knows have got the length of half a crown a man who prides himself upon persuasion should learn the persuasive faculty of silence above all as to his own misdeeds it is only in the farce and for dramatic purposes that scapin enlarges on his peculiar talents to the world at large  scapin is perhaps a good name for this clever unfortunate alick for at the bottom of all his misconduct there was a guiding sense of humour that moved you to forgive him it was more than half as a jest that he conducted his existence oh man he said to me once with unusual emotion like a man thinking of his mistress i would give up anything for a lark  it was in relation to his fellowstowaway that alick showed the best or perhaps i should say the only good points of his nature mind you he said suddenly changing his tone mind you thats a good boy he wouldnt tell you a lie a lot of them think he is a scamp because his clothes are ragged but he isnt hes as good as gold to hear him you become aware that alick himself had a taste for virtue he thought his own idleness and the others industry equally becoming he was no more anxious to insure his own reputation as a liar than to uphold the truthfulness of his companion and he seemed unaware of what was incongruous in his attitude and was plainly sincere in both characters  it was not surprising that he should take an interest in the devonian for the lad worshipped and served him in love and wonder busy as he was he would find time to warn alick of an approaching officer or even to tell him that the coast was clear and he might slip off and smoke a pipe in safety tom he once said to him for that was the name which alick ordered him to use if you dont like going to the galley ill go for you you aint used to this kind of thing you aint but im a sailor and i can understand the feelings of any fellow i can again he was hard up and casting about for some tobacco for he was not so liberally used in this respect as others perhaps less worthy when alick offered him the half of one of his fifteen sticks i think for my part he might have increased the offer to a whole one or perhaps a pair of them and not lived to regret his liberality but the devonian refused no he said youre a stowaway like me i wont take it from you ill take it from some one whos not down on his luck  it was notable in this generous lad that he was strongly under the influence of sex if a woman passed near where he was working his eyes lit up his hand paused and his mind wandered instantly to other thoughts it was natural that he should exercise a fascination proportionally strong upon women he begged you will remember from women only and was never refused without wishing to explain away the charity of those who helped him i cannot but fancy he may have owed a little to his handsome face and to that quick responsive nature formed for love which speaks eloquently through all disguises and can stamp an impression in ten minutes talk or an exchange of glances he was the more dangerous in that he was far from bold but seemed to woo in spite of himself and with a soft and pleading eye ragged as he was and many a scarecrow is in that respect more comfortably furnished even on board he was not without some curious admirers  there was a girl among the passengers a tall blonde handsome strapping irishwoman with a wild accommodating eye whom alick had dubbed tommy with that transcendental appropriateness that defies analysis one day the devonian was lying for warmth in the upper stokehole which stands open on the deck when irish tommy came past very neatly attired as was her custom  poor fellow she said stopping you havent a vest  no he said i wish i ad  then she stood and gazed on him in silence until in his embarrassment for he knew not how to look under this scrutiny he pulled out his pipe and began to fill it with tobacco  do you want a match she asked and before he had time to reply she ran off and presently returned with more than one  that was the beginning and the end as far as our passage is concerned of what i will make bold to call this loveaffair there are many relations which go on to marriage and last during a lifetime in which less human feeling is engaged than in this scene of five minutes at the stokehole  rigidly speaking this would end the chapter of the stowaways but in a larger sense of the word i have yet more to add jones had discovered and pointed out to me a young woman who was remarkable among her fellows for a pleasing and interesting air she was poorly clad to the verge if not over the line of disrespectability with a ragged old jacket and a bit of a sealskin cap no bigger than your fist but her eyes her whole expression and her manner even in ordinary moments told of a true womanly nature capable of love anger and devotion she had a look too of refinement like one who might have been a better lady than most had she been allowed the opportunity when alone she seemed preoccupied and sad but she was not often alone there was usually by her side a heavy dull gross man in rough clothes chary of speech and gesturenot from caution but poverty of disposition a man like a ditcher unlovely and uninteresting whom she petted and tended and waited on with her eyes as if he had been amadis of gaul it was strange to see this hulking fellow dogsick and this delicate sad woman caring for him he seemed from first to last insensible of her caresses and attentions and she seemed unconscious of his insensibility the irish husband who sang his wife to sleep and this scottish girl serving her orson were the two bits of human nature that most appealed to me throughout the voyage  on the thursday before we arrived the tickets were collected and soon a rumour began to go round the vessel and this girl with her bit of sealskin cap became the centre of whispering and pointed fingers she also it was said was a stowaway of a sort for she was on board with neither ticket nor money and the man with whom she travelled was the father of a family who had left wife and children to be hers the ships officers discouraged the story which may therefore have been a story and no more but it was believed in the steerage and the poor girl had to encounter many curious eyes from that day forth                          personal experience and review   travel is of two kinds and this voyage of mine across the ocean combined both out of my country and myself i go sings the old poet and i was not only travelling out of my country in latitude and longitude but out of myself in diet associates and consideration part of the interest and a great deal of the amusement flowed at least to me from this novel situation in the world  i found that i had what they call fallen in life with absolute success and verisimilitude i was taken for a steerage passenger no one seemed surprised that i should be so and there was nothing but the brass plate between decks to remind me that i had once been a gentleman in a former book describing a former journey i expressed some wonder that i could be readily and naturally taken for a pedlar and explained the accident by the difference of language and manners between england and france i must now take a humbler view for here i was among my own countrymen somewhat roughly clad to be sure but with every advantage of speech and manner and i am bound to confess that i passed for nearly anything you please except an educated gentleman the sailors called me mate the officers addressed me as my man my comrades accepted me without hesitation for a person of their own character and experience but with some curious information one a mason himself believed i was a mason several and among these at least one of the seamen judged me to be a petty officer in the american navy and i was so often set down for a practical engineer that at last i had not the heart to deny it from all these guesses i drew one conclusion which told against the insight of my companions they might be close observers in their own way and read the manners in the face but it was plain that they did not extend their observation to the hands  to the saloon passengers also i sustained my part without a hitch it is true i came little in their way but when we did encounter there was no recognition in their eye although i confess i sometimes courted it in silence all these my inferiors and equals took me like the transformed monarch in the story for a mere common human man they gave me a hard dead look with the flesh about the eye kept unrelaxed  with the women this surprised me less as i had already experimented on the sex by going abroad through a suburban part of london simply attired in a sleevewaistcoat the result was curious i then learned for the first time and by the exhaustive process how much attention ladies are accustomed to bestow on all male creatures of their own station for in my humble rig each one who went by me caused me a certain shock of surprise and a sense of something wanting in my normal circumstances it appeared every young lady must have paid me some passing tribute of a glance and though i had often been unconscious of it when given i was well aware of its absence when it was withheld my height seemed to decrease with every woman who passed me for she passed me like a dog this is one of my grounds for supposing that what are called the upper classes may sometimes produce a disagreeable impression in what are called the lower and i wish some one would continue my experiment and find out exactly at what stage of toilette a man becomes invisible to the wellregulated female eye  here on shipboard the matter was put to a more complete test for even with the addition of speech and manner i passed among the ladies for precisely the average man of the steerage it was one afternoon that i saw this demonstrated a very plainly dressed woman was taken ill on deck i think i had the luck to be present at every sudden seizure during all the passage and on this occasion found myself in the place of importance supporting the sufferer there was not only a large crowd immediately around us but a considerable knot of saloon passengers leaning over our heads from the hurricanedeck one of these an elderly managing woman hailed me with counsels of course i had to reply and as the talk went on i began to discover that the whole group took me for the husband i looked upon my new wife poor creature with mingled feelings and i must own she had not even the appearance of the poorest class of city servantmaids but looked more like a country wench who should have been employed at a roadside inn now was the time for me to go and study the brass plate  to such of the officers as knew about methe doctor the purser and the stewardsi appeared in the light of a broad joke the fact that i spent the better part of my day in writing had gone abroad over the ship and tickled them all prodigiously whenever they met me they referred to my absurd occupation with familiarity and breadth of humorous intention their manner was well calculated to remind me of my fallen fortunes you may be sincerely amused by the amateur literary efforts of a gentleman but you scarce publish the feeling to his face well they would say still writing and the smile would widen into a laugh the purser came one day into the cabin and touched to the heart by my misguided industry offered me some other kind of writing for which he added pointedly you will be paid this was nothing else than to copy out the list of passengers  another trick of mine which told against my reputation was my choice of roostingplace in an active draught upon the cabin floor i was openly jeered and flouted for this eccentricity and a considerable knot would sometimes gather at the door to see my last dispositions for the night this was embarrassing but i learned to support the trial with equanimity  indeed i may say that upon the whole my new position sat lightly and naturally upon my spirits i accepted the consequences with readiness and found them far from difficult to bear the steerage conquered me i conformed more and more to the type of the place not only in manner but at heart growing hostile to the officers and cabin passengers who looked down upon me and day by day greedier for small delicacies such was the result as i fancy of a diet of bread and butter soup and porridge we think we have no sweet tooth as long as we are full to the brim of molasses but a man must have sojourned in the workhouse before he boasts himself indifferent to dainties every evening for instance i was more and more preoccupied about our doubtful fare at tea if it was delicate my heart was much lightened if it was but broken fish i was proportionally downcast the offer of a little jelly from a fellowpassenger more provident than myself caused a marked elevation in my spirits and i would have gone to the ships end and back again for an oyster or a chipped fruit  in other ways i was content with my position it seemed no disgrace to be confounded with my company for i may as well declare at once i found their manners as gentle and becoming as those of any other class i do not mean that my friends could have sat down without embarrassment and laughable disaster at the table of a duke that does not imply an inferiority of breeding but a difference of usage thus i flatter myself that i conducted myself well among my fellowpassengers yet my most ambitious hope is not to have avoided faults but to have committed as few as possible i know too well that my tact is not the same as their tact and that my habit of a different society constituted not only no qualification but a positive disability to move easily and becomingly in this when jones complimented mebecause i managed to behave very pleasantly to my fellowpassengers was how he put iti could follow the thought in his mind and knew his compliment to be such as we pay foreigners on their proficiency in english i dare say this praise was given me immediately on the back of some unpardonable solecism which had led him to review my conduct as a whole we are all ready to laugh at the ploughman among lords we should consider also the case of a lord among the ploughmen i have seen a lawyer in the house of a hebridean fisherman and i know but nothing will induce me to disclose which of these two was the better gentleman some of our finest behaviour though it looks well enough from the boxes may seem even brutal to the gallery we boast too often manners that are parochial rather than universal that like a country wine will not bear transportation for a hundred miles nor from the parlour to the kitchen to be a gentleman is to be one all the world over and in every relation and grade of society it is a high calling to which a man must first be born and then devote himself for life and unhappily the manners of a certain socalled upper grade have a kind of currency and meet with a certain external acceptation throughout all the others and this tends to keep us well satisfied with slight acquirements and the amateurish accomplishments of a clique but manners like art should be human and central  some of my fellowpassengers as i now moved among them in a relation of equality seemed to me excellent gentlemen they were not rough nor hasty nor disputatious debated pleasantly differed kindly were helpful gentle patient and placid the type of manners was plain and even heavy there was little to please the eye but nothing to shock and i thought gentleness lay more nearly at the spring of behaviour than in many more ornate and delicate societies i say delicate where i cannot say refined a thing may be fine like ironwork without being delicate like lace there was here less delicacy the skin supported more callously the natural surface of events the mind received more bravely the crude facts of human existence but i do not think that there was less effective refinement less consideration for others less polite suppression of self i speak of the best among my fellowpassengers for in the steerage as well as in the saloon there is a mixture those then with whom i found myself in sympathy and of whom i may therefore hope to write with a greater measure of truth were not only as good in their manners but endowed with very much the same natural capacities and about as wise in deduction as the bankers and barristers of what is called society one and all were too much interested in disconnected facts and loved information for its own sake with too rash a devotion but people in all classes display the same appetite as they gorge themselves daily with the miscellaneous gossip of the newspaper newspaperreading as far as i can make out is often rather a sort of brown study than an act of culture i have myself palmed off yesterdays issue on a friend and seen him reperuse it for a continuance of minutes with an air at once refreshed and solemn workmen perhaps pay more attention but though they may be eager listeners they have rarely seemed to me either willing or careful thinkers culture is not measured by the greatness of the field which is covered by our knowledge but by the nicety with which we can perceive relations in that field whether great or small workmen certainly those who were on board with me i found wanting in this quality or habit of the mind they did not perceive relations but leaped to a socalled cause and thought the problem settled thus the cause of everything in england was the form of government and the cure for all evils was by consequence a revolution it is surprising how many of them said this and that none should have had a definite thought in his head as he said it some hated the church because they disagreed with it some hated lord beaconsfield because of war and taxes all hated the masters possibly with reason but these feelings were not at the root of the matter the true reasoning of their souls ran thusi have not got on i ought to have got on if there was a revolution i should get on how they had no idea why becausebecausewell look at america  to be politically blind is no distinction we are all so if you come to that at bottom as it seems to me there is but one question in modern home politics though it appears in many shapes and that is the question of money and but one political remedy that the people should grow wiser and better my workmen fellowpassengers were as impatient and dull of hearing on the second of these points as any member of parliament but they had some glimmerings of the first they would not hear of improvement on their part but wished the world made over again in a crack so that they might remain improvident and idle and debauched and yet enjoy the comfort and respect that should accompany the opposite virtues and it was in this expectation as far as i could see that many of them were now on their way to america but on the point of money they saw clearly enough that inland politics so far as they were concerned were reducible to the question of annual income a question which should long ago have been settled by a revolution they did not know how and which they were now about to settle for themselves once more they knew not how by crossing the atlantic in a steamship of considerable tonnage  and yet it has been amply shown them that the second or income question is in itself nothing and may as well be left undecided if there be no wisdom and virtue to profit by the change it is not by a mans purse but by his character that he is rich or poor barney will be poor alick will be poor mackay will be poor let them go where they will and wreck all the governments under heaven they will be poor until they die  nothing is perhaps more notable in the average workman than his surprising idleness and the candour with which he confesses to the failing it has to me been always something of a relief to find the poor as a general rule so little oppressed with work i can in consequence enjoy my own more fortunate beginning with a better grace the other day i was living with a farmer in america an old frontiersman who had worked and fought hunted and farmed from his childhood up he excused himself for his defective education on the ground that he had been overworked from first to last even now he said anxious as he was he had never the time to take up a book in consequence of this i observed him closely he was occupied for four or at the extreme outside for five hours out of the twentyfour and then principally in walking and the remainder of the day he passed in sheer idleness either eating fruit or standing with his back against the door i have known men do hard literary work all morning and then undergo quite as much physical fatigue by way of relief as satisfied this powerful frontiersman for the day he at least like all the educated class did so much homage to industry as to persuade himself he was industrious but the average mechanic recognises his idleness with effrontery he has even as i am told organised it  i give the story as it was told me and it was told me for a fact a man fell from a housetop in the city of aberdeen and was brought into hospital with broken bones he was asked what was his trade and replied that he was a tapper no one had ever heard of such a thing before the officials were filled with curiosity they besought an explanation it appeared that when a party of slaters were engaged upon a roof they would now and then be taken with a fancy for the publichouse now a seamstress for example might slip away from her work and no one be the wiser but if these fellows adjourned the tapping of the mallets would cease and thus the neighbourhood be advertised of their defection hence the career of the tapper he has to do the tapping and keep up an industrious bustle on the housetop during the absence of the slaters when he taps for only one or two the thing is childsplay but when he has to represent a whole troop it is then that he earns his money in the sweat of his brow then must he bound from spot to spot reduplicate triplicate sexduplicate his single personality and swell and hasten his blows until he produce a perfect illusion for the ear and you would swear that a crowd of emulous masons were continuing merrily to roof the house it must be a strange sight from an upper window  i heard nothing on board of the tapper but i was astonished at the stories told by my companions skulking shirking malingering were all established tactics it appeared they could see no dishonesty when a man who is paid for an hours work gives half an hours consistent idling in its place thus the tapper would refuse to watch for the police during a burglary and call himself an honest man it is not sufficiently recognised that our race detests to work if i thought that i should have to work every day of my life as hard as i am working now i should be tempted to give up the struggle and the workman early begins on his career of toil he has never had his fill of holidays in the past and his prospect of holidays in the future is both distant and uncertain in the circumstance it would require a high degree of virtue not to snatch alleviations for the moment  there were many good talkers on the ship and i believe good talking of a certain sort is a common accomplishment among working men where books are comparatively scarce a greater amount of information will be given and received by word of mouth and this tends to produce good talkers and what is no less needful for conversation good listeners they could all tell a story with effect i am sometimes tempted to think that the less literary class show always better in narration they have so much more patience with detail are so much less hurried to reach the points and preserve so much juster a proportion among the facts at the same time their talk is dry they pursue a topic ploddingly have not an agile fancy do not throw sudden lights from unexpected quarters and when the talk is over they often leave the matter where it was they mark time instead of marching they think only to argue not to reach new conclusions and use their reason rather as a weapon of offence than as a tool for selfimprovement hence the talk of some of the cleverest was unprofitable in result because there was no give and take they would grant you as little as possible for premise and begin to dispute under an oath to conquer or to die  but the talk of a workman is apt to be more interesting than that of a wealthy merchant because the thoughts hopes and fears of which the workmans life is built lie nearer to necessity and nature they are more immediate to human life an income calculated by the week is a far more human thing than one calculated by the year and a small income simply from its smallness than a large one i never wearied listening to the details of a workmans economy because every item stood for some real pleasure if he could afford pudding twice a week you know that twice a week the man ate with genuine gusto and was physically happy while if you learn that a rich man has seven courses a day ten to one the half of them remain untasted and the whole is but misspent money and a weariness to the flesh  the difference between england and america to a working man was thus most humanly put to me by a fellowpassenger in america said he you get pies and puddings i do not hear enough in economy books of pies and pudding a man lives in and for the delicacies adornments and accidental attributes of life such as pudding to eat and pleasant books and theatres to occupy his leisure the bare terms of existence would be rejected with contempt by all if a man feeds on bread and butter soup and porridge his appetite grows wolfish after dainties and the workman dwells in a borderland and is always within sight of those cheerless regions where life is more difficult to sustain than worth sustaining every detail of our existence where it is worth while to cross the ocean after pie and pudding is made alive and enthralling by the presence of genuine desire but it is all one to me whether croesus has a hundred or a thousand thousands in the bank there is more adventure in the life of the working man who descends as a common soldier into the battle of life than in that of the millionaire who sits apart in an office like von moltke and only directs the manoeuvres by telegraph give me to hear about the career of him who is in the thick of the business to whom one change of market means an empty belly and another a copious and savoury meal this is not the philosophical but the human side of economics it interests like a story and the life of all who are thus situated partakes in a small way of the charm of robinson crusoe for every step is critical and human life is presented to you naked and verging to its lowest terms                                     new york   as we drew near to new york i was at first amused and then somewhat staggered by the cautions and the grisly tales that went the round you would have thought we were to land upon a cannibal island you must speak to no one in the streets as they would not leave you till you were rooked and beaten you must enter a hotel with military precautions for the least you had to apprehend was to awake next morning without money or baggage or necessary raiment a lone forked radish in a bed and if the worst befell you would instantly and mysteriously disappear from the ranks of mankind  i have usually found such stories correspond to the least modicum of fact thus i was warned i remember against the roadside inns of the cÃ©vennes and that by a learned professor and when i reached pradelles the warning was explained it was but the faraway rumour and reduplication of a single terrifying story already half a century old and half forgotten in the theatre of the events so i was tempted to make light of these reports against america but we had on board with us a man whose evidence it would not do to put aside he had come near these perils in the body he had visited a robber inn the public has an old and wellgrounded favour for this class of incident and shall be gratified to the best of my power  my fellowpassenger whom we shall call mnaughten had come from new york to boston with a comrade seeking work they were a pair of rattling blades and leaving their baggage at the station passed the day in beer saloons and with congenial spirits until midnight struck then they applied themselves to find a lodging and walked the streets till two knocking at houses of entertainment and being refused admittance or themselves declining the terms by two the inspiration of their liquor had begun to wear off they were weary and humble and after a great circuit found themselves in the same street where they had begun their search and in front of a french hotel where they had already sought accommodation seeing the house still open they returned to the charge a man in a white cap sat in an office by the door he seemed to welcome them more warmly than when they had at first presented themselves and the charge for the night had somewhat unaccountably fallen from a dollar to a quarter they thought him illlooking but paid their quarter apiece and were shown upstairs to the top of the house there in a small room the man in the white cap wished them pleasant slumbers  the room was furnished with a bed a chair and some conveniences the door did not lock on the inside and the only sign of adornment was a couple of framed pictures one close above the head of the bed and the other opposite the foot and both curtained as we may sometimes see valuable watercolours or the portraits of the dead or works of art more than usually skittish in the subject it was perhaps in the hope of finding something of this last description that mnaughtens comrade pulled aside the curtain of the first he was startlingly disappointed there was no picture the frame surrounded and the curtain was designed to hide an oblong aperture in the partition through which they looked forth into the dark corridor a person standing without could easily take a purse from under the pillow or even strangle a sleeper as he lay abed mnaughten and his comrade stared at each other like balboa and his men with a wild surmise and then the latter catching up the lamp ran to the other frame and roughly raised the curtain there he stood petrified and mnaughten who had followed grasped him by the wrist in terror they could see into another room larger in size than that which they occupied where three men sat crouching and silent in the dark for a second or so these five persons looked each other in the eyes then the curtain was dropped and mnaughten and his friend made but one bolt of it out of the room and down the stairs the man in the white cap said nothing as they passed him and they were so pleased to be once more in the open night that they gave up all notion of a bed and walked the streets of boston till the morning  no one seemed much cast down by these stories but all inquired after the address of a respectable hotel and i for my part put myself under the conduct of mr jones before noon of the second sunday we sighted the low shores outside of new york harbour the steerage passengers must remain on board to pass through castle garden on the following morning but we of the second cabin made our escape along with the lords of the saloon and by six oclock jones and i issued into west street sitting on some straw in the bottom of an open baggagewaggon it rained miraculously and from that moment till on the following night i left new york there was scarcely a lull and no cessation of the downpour the roadways were flooded a loud strident noise of falling water filled the air the restaurants smelt heavily of wet people and wet clothing  it took us but a few minutes though it cost us a good deal of money to be rattled along west street to our destination reunion house no 10 west street one minutes walk from castle garden convenient to castle garden the steamboat landings california steamers and liverpool ships board and lodging per day 1 dollar single meals 25 cents lodging per night 25 cents private rooms for families no charge for storage or baggage satisfaction guaranteed to all persons michael mitchell proprietor reunion house was i may go the length of saying a humble hostelry you entered through a long barroom thence passed into a little diningroom and thence into a still smaller kitchen the furniture was of the plainest but the bar was hung in the american taste with encouraging and hospitable mottoes  jones was well known we were received warmly and two minutes afterwards i had refused a drink from the proprietor and was going on in my plain european fashion to refuse a cigar when mr mitchell sternly interposed and explained the situation he was offering to treat me it appeared whenever an american barkeeper proposes anything it must be borne in mind that he is offering to treat and if i did not want a drink i must at least take the cigar i took it bashfully feeling i had begun my american career on the wrong foot i did not enjoy that cigar but this may have been from a variety of reasons even the best cigar often failing to please if you smoke threequarters of it in a drenching rain  for many years america was to me a sort of promised land westward the march of empire holds its way the race is for the moment to the young what has been and what is we imperfectly and obscurely know what is to be yet lies beyond the flight of our imaginations greece rome and judÃ¦a are gone by for ever leaving to generations the legacy of their accomplished work china still endures an oldinhabited house in the brandnew city of nations england has already declined since she has lost the states and to these states therefore yet undeveloped full of dark possibilities and grown like another eve from one rib out of the side of their own old land the minds of young men in england turn naturally at a certain hopeful period of their age it will be hard for an american to understand the spirit but let him imagine a young man who shall have grown up in an old and rigid circle following bygone fashions and taught to distrust his own fresh instincts and who now suddenly hears of a family of cousins all about his own age who keep house together by themselves and live far from restraint and tradition let him imagine this and he will have some imperfect notion of the sentiment with which spirited english youths turn to the thought of the american republic it seems to them as if out west the war of life was still conducted in the open air and on free barbaric terms as if it had not yet been narrowed into parlours nor begun to be conducted like some unjust and dreary arbitration by compromise costume forms of procedure and sad senseless selfdenial which of these two he prefers a man with any youth still left in him will decide rightly for himself he would rather be houseless than denied a passkey rather go without food than partake of a stalled ox in stiff respectable society rather be shot out of hand than direct his life according to the dictates of the world  he knows or thinks nothing of the maine laws the puritan sourness the fierce sordid appetite for dollars or the dreary existence of country towns a few wild storybooks which delighted his childhood form the imaginative basis of his picture of america in course of time there is added to this a great crowd of stimulating detailsvast cities that grow up as by enchantment the birds that have gone south in autumn returning with the spring to find thousands camped upon their marshes and the lamps burning far and near along populous streets forests that disappear like snow countries larger than britain that are cleared and settled one man running forth with his household gods before another while the bear and the indian are yet scarce aware of their approach oil that gushes from the earth gold that is washed or quarried in the brooks or glens of the sierras and all that bustle courage action and constant kaleidoscopic change that walt whitman has seized and set forth in his vigorous cheerful and loquacious verses  here i was at last in america and was soon out upon new york streets spying for things foreign the place had to me an air of liverpool but such was the rain that not paradise itself would have looked inviting we were a party of four under two umbrellas jones and i and two scots lads recent immigrants and not indisposed to welcome a compatriot they had been six weeks in new york and neither of them had yet found a single job or earned a single halfpenny up to the present they were exactly out of pocket by the amount of the fare  the lads soon left us now i had sworn by all my gods to have such a dinner as would rouse the dead there was scarce any expense at which i should have hesitated the devil was in it but jones and i should dine like heathen emperors i set to work asking after a restaurant and i chose the wealthiest and most gastronomicallooking passersby to ask from yet although i had told them i was willing to pay anything in reason one and all sent me off to cheap fixedprice houses where i would not have eaten that night for the cost of twenty dinners i do not know if this were characteristic of new york or whether it was only jones and i who looked undinerly and discouraged enterprising suggestions but at length by our own sagacity we found a french restaurant where there was a french waiter some fair french cooking some socalled french wine and french coffee to conclude the whole i never entered into the feelings of jack on land so completely as when i tasted that coffee  i suppose we had one of the private rooms for families at reunion house it was very small furnished with a bed a chair and some clothespegs and it derived all that was necessary for the life of the human animal through two borrowed lights one looking into the passage and the second opening without sash into another apartment where three men fitfully snored or in intervals of wakefulness drearily mumbled to each other all night long it will be observed that this was almost exactly the disposition of the room in mnaughtens story jones had the bed i pitched my camp upon the floor he did not sleep until near morning and i for my part never closed an eye  at sunrise i heard a cannon fired and shortly afterwards the men in the next room gave over snoring for good and began to rustle over their toilettes the sound of their voices as they talked was low and moaning like that of people watching by the sick jones who had at last begun to doze tumbled and murmured and every now and then opened unconscious eyes upon me where i lay i found myself growing eerier and eerier for i dare say i was a little fevered by my restless night and hurried to dress and get downstairs  you had to pass through the rain which still fell thick and resonant to reach a lavatory on the other side of the court there were three basinstands and a few crumpled towels and pieces of wet soap white and slippery like fish nor should i forget a lookingglass and a pair of questionable combs another scots lad was here scrubbing his face with a good will he had been three months in new york and had not yet found a single job nor earned a single halfpenny up to the present he also was exactly out of pocket by the amount of the fare i began to grow sick at heart for my fellowemigrants  of my nightmare wanderings in new york i spare to tell i had a thousand and one things to do only the day to do them in and a journey across the continent before me in the evening it rained with patient fury every now and then i had to get under cover for a while in order so to speak to give my mackintosh a rest for under this continued drenching it began to grow damp on the inside i went to banks postoffices railwayoffices restaurants publishers booksellers moneychangers and wherever i went a pool would gather about my feet and those who were careful of their floors would look on with an unfriendly eye wherever i went too the same traits struck me the people were all surprisingly rude and surprisingly kind the moneychanger crossquestioned me like a french commissary asking my age my business my average income and my destination beating down my attempts at evasion and receiving my answer in silence and yet when all was over he shook hands with me up to the elbows and sent his lad nearly a quarter of a mile in the rain to get me books at a reduction again in a very large publishing and bookselling establishment a man who seemed to be the manager received me as i had certainly never before been received in any human shop indicated squarely that he put no faith in my honesty and refused to look up the names of books or give me the slightest help or information on the ground like the steward that it was none of his business i lost my temper at last said i was a stranger in america and not learned in their etiquette but i would assure him if he went to any bookseller in england of more handsome usage the boast was perhaps exaggerated but like many a long shot it struck the gold the manager passed at once from one extreme to the other i may say that from that moment he loaded me with kindness he gave me all sorts of good advice wrote me down addresses and came bareheaded into the rain to point me out a restaurant where i might lunch nor even then did he seem to think that he had done enough these are it is as well to be bold in statement the manners of america it is this same opposition that has most struck me in people of almost all classes and from east to west by the time a man had about strung me up to be the death of him by his insulting behaviour he himself would be just upon the point of melting into confidence and serviceable attentions yet i suspect although i have met with the like in so many parts that this must be the character of some particular state or group of states for in america and this again in all classes you will find some of the softestmannered gentlemen in the world  i was so wet when i got back to mitchells towards the evening that i had simply to divest myself of my shoes socks and trousers and leave them behind for the benefit of new york city no fire could have dried them ere i had to start and to pack them in their present condition was to spread ruin among my other possessions with a heavy heart i said farewell to them as they lay a pulp in the middle of a pool upon the floor of mitchells kitchen i wonder if they are dry by now mitchell hired a man to carry my baggage to the station which was hard by accompanied me thither himself and recommended me to the particular attention of the officials no one could have been kinder those who are out of pocket may go safely to reunion house where they will get decent meal and find an honest and obliging landlord i owed him this word of thanks before i enter fairly on the second chapter of my emigrant experience

heard the name of vailima most likely not even that of upolu and samoa itself may be strange to your ears to these barbaric seats there came the other day a yellow book with your name on the title and filled in every page with the exquisite gifts of your art let me take and change your own words jai beau admirer les autres de toutes mes forces cest avec vous que je me complais Ã  vivre

choice and arrangement of these papers written before you departed to the south seas and have asked me to add a preface to the volume but it is your prose the public wish to read not mine and i am sure they will willingly be spared the preface acknowledgments are due in your name to the publishers of the several magazines from which the papers are collected viz frasers longmans the magazine of art and scribners i will only add lest any reader should find the tone of the concluding pieces less inspiriting than your wont that they were written under circumstances of especial gloom and sickness i agree with you the lights seem a little turned down so you write to me now the truth is i was far through and came none too soon to the south seas where i was to recover peace of body and mind and however low the lights the stuff is true well inasmuch as the south sea sirens have breathed new life into you we are bound to be heartily grateful to them though as they keep you so far removed from us it is difficult not to bear them a grudge and if they would reconcile us quite they have but to do two things moreto teach you new tales that shall charm us like your old and to spare you at least once in a while in summer to climates within reach of us who are taskbound for ten months in the year beside the thames                                               yours ever

signalled to be present at the ferry depÃ´t of the railroad an emigrant ship had arrived at new york on the saturday night another on the sunday morning our own on sunday afternoon a fourth early on monday and as there is no emigrant train on sunday a great part of the passengers from these four ships was concentrated on the train by which i was to travel there was a babel of bewildered men women and children the wretched little booking office and the baggageroom which was not much larger were crowded thick with emigrants and were heavy and rank with the atmosphere of dripping clothes open carts full of bedding stood by the halfhour in the rain the officials loaded each other with recriminations a bearded mildewed little man whom i take to have been an emigrant agent was all over the place his mouth full of brimstone blustering and interfering it was plain that the whole system if system there was had utterly broken down under the strain of so many passengers  my own ticket was given me at once and an oldish man who preserved his head in the midst of this turmoil got my baggage registered and counselled me to stay quietly where i was till he should give me the word to move i had taken along with me a small valise a knapsack which i carried on my shoulders and in the bag of my railway rug the whole of bancrofts history of the united states in six fat volumes it was as much as i could carry with convenience even for short distances but it insured me plenty of clothing and the valise was at that moment and often after useful for a stool i am sure i sat for an hour in the baggageroom and wretched enough it was yet when at last the word was passed to me and i picked up my bundles and got under way it was only to exchange discomfort for downright misery and danger  i followed the porters into a long shed reaching downhill from west street to the river it was dark the wind blew clean through it from end to end and here i found a great block of passengers and baggage hundreds of one and tons of the other i feel i shall have a difficulty to make myself believed and certainly the scene must have been exceptional for it was too dangerous for daily repetition it was a tight jam there was no fairway through the mingled mass of brute and living obstruction into the upper skirts of the crowd porters infuriated by hurry and overwork clove their way with shouts i may say that we stood like sheep and that the porters charged among us like so many maddened sheepdogs and i believe these men were no longer answerable for their acts it mattered not what they were carrying they drove straight into the press and when they could get no farther blindly discharged their barrowful with my own hand for instance i saved the life of a child as it sat upon its mothers knee she sitting on a box and since i heard of no accident i must suppose that there were many similar interpositions in the course of the evening it will give some idea of the state of mind to which we were reduced if i tell you that neither the porter nor the mother of the child paid the least attention to my act it was not till some time after that i understood what i had done myself for to ward off heavy boxes seemed at the moment a natural incident of human life cold wet clamour dead opposition to progress such as one encounters in an evil dream had utterly daunted the spirits we had accepted this purgatory as a child accepts the conditions of the world for my part i shivered a little and my back ached wearily but i believe i had neither a hope nor a fear and all the activities of my nature had become tributary to one massive sensation of discomfort  at length and after how long an interval i hesitate to guess the crowd began to move heavily straining through itself about the same time some lamps were lighted and threw a sudden flare over the shed we were being filtered out into the river boat for jersey city you may imagine how slowly this filtering proceeded through the dense choking crush every one overladen with packages or children and yet under the necessity of fishing out his ticket by the way but it ended at length for me and i found myself on deck under a flimsy awning and with a trifle of elbowroom to stretch and breathe in this was on the starboard for the bulk of the emigrants stuck hopelessly on the port side by which we had entered in vain the seamen shouted to them to move on and threatened them with shipwreck these poor people were under a spell of stupor and did not stir a foot it rained as heavily as ever but the wind now came in sudden claps and capfuls not without danger to a boat so badly ballasted as ours and we crept over the river in the darkness trailing one paddle in the water like a wounded duck and passed ever and again by huge illuminated steamers running many knots and heralding their approach by strains of music the contrast between these pleasure embarkations and our own grim vessel with her list to port and her freight of wet and silent emigrants was of that glaring description which we count too obvious for the purposes of art  the landing at jersey city was done in a stampede i had a fixed sense of calamity and to judge by conduct the same persuasion was common to us all a panic selfishness like that produced by fear presided over the disorder of our landing people pushed and elbowed and ran their families following how they could children fell and were picked up to be rewarded by a blow one child who had lost her parents screamed steadily and with increasing shrillness as though verging towards a fit an official kept her by him but no one else seemed so much as to remark her distress and i am ashamed to say that i ran among the rest i was so weary that i had twice to make a halt and set down my bundles in the hundred yards or so between the pier and the railway station so that i was quite wet by the time that i got under cover there was no waitingroom no refreshmentroom the cars were locked and for at least another hour or so it seemed we had to camp upon the draughty gaslit platform i sat on my valise too crushed to observe my neighbours but as they were all cold and wet and weary and driven stupidly crazy by the mismanagement to which we had been subjected i believe they can have been no happier than myself i bought half a dozen oranges from a boy for oranges and nuts were the only refection to be had as only two of them had even a pretence of juice i threw the other four under the cars and beheld as in a dream grown people and children groping on the track after my leavings  at last we were admitted into the cars utterly dejected and far from dry for my own part i got out a clothesbrush and brushed my trousers as hard as i could till i had dried them and warmed my blood into the bargain but no one else except my next neighbour to whom i lent the brush appeared to take the least precaution as they were they composed themselves to sleep i had seen the lights of philadelphia and been twice ordered to change carriages and twice countermanded before i allowed myself to follow their example  tuesdaywhen i awoke it was already day the train was standing idle i was in the last carriage and seeing some others strolling to and fro about the lines i opened the door and stepped forth as from a caravan by the wayside we were near no station nor even as far as i could see within reach of any signal a green open undulating country stretched away upon all sides locust trees and a single field of indian corn gave it a foreign grace and interest but the contours of the land were soft and english it was not quite england neither was it quite france yet like enough either to seem natural in my eyes and it was in the sky and not upon the earth that i was surprised to find a change explain it how you may and for my part i cannot explain it at all the sun rises with a different splendour in america and europe there is more clear gold and scarlet in our old country mornings more purple brown and smoky orange in those of the new it may be from habit but to me the coming of day is less fresh and inspiriting in the latter it has a duskier glory and more nearly resembles sunset it seems to fit some subsequential evening epoch of the world as though america were in fact and not merely in fancy farther from the orient of aurora and the springs of day i thought so then by the railroadside in pennsylvania and i have thought so a dozen times since in far distant parts of the continent if it be an illusion it is one very deeply rooted and in which my eyesight is accomplice  soon after a train whisked by announcing and accompanying its passage by the swift beating of a sort of chapelbell upon the engine and as it was for this we had been waiting we were summoned by the cry of all aboard and went on again upon our way the whole line it appeared was topsyturvy an accident at midnight having thrown all the traffic hours into arrear we paid for this in the flesh for we had no meals all that day fruit we could buy upon the cars and now and then we had a few minutes at some station with a meagre show of rolls and sandwiches for sale but we were so many and so ravenous that though i tried at every opportunity the coffee was always exhausted before i could elbow my way to the counter  our american sunrise had ushered in a noble summers day there was not a cloud the sunshine was baking yet in the woody river valleys among which we wound our way the atmosphere preserved a sparkling freshness till late in the afternoon it had an inland sweetness and variety to one newly from the sea it smelt of woods rivers and the delved earth these though in so far a country were airs from home i stood on the platform by the hour and as i saw one after another pleasant villages carts upon the highway and fishers by the stream and heard cockcrows and cheery voices in the distance and beheld the sun no longer shining blankly on the plains of ocean but striking among shapely hills and his light dispersed and coloured by a thousand accidents of form and surface i began to exult with myself upon this rise in life like a man who had come into a rich estate and when i had asked the name of the river from the brakesman and heard that it was called the susquehanna the beauty of the name seemed to be part and parcel of the beauty of the land as when adam with divine fitness named the creatures so this word susquehanna was at once accepted by the fancy that was the name as no other could be for that shining river and desirable valley  none can care for literature in itself who do not take a special pleasure in the sound of names and there is no part of the world where nomenclature is so rich poetical humorous and picturesque as the united states of america all times races and languages have brought their contribution pekin is in the same state with euclid with bellefontaine and with sansdusky chelsea with its london associations of red brick sloane square and the kings road is own suburb to stately and primeval memphis there they have their seat translated names of cities where the mississippi runs by tennessee and arkansas1 and both while i was crossing the continent lay watched by armed men in the horror and isolation of a plague old red manhattan lies like an indian arrowhead under a steam factory below anglified new york the names of the states and territories themselves form a chorus of sweet and most romantic vocables delaware ohio indiana florida dakota iowa wyoming minnesota and the carolinas there are few poems with a nobler music for the ear a songful tuneful land and if the new homer shall arise from the western continent his verse will be enriched his pages sing spontaneously with the names of states and cities that would strike the fancy in a business circular  late in the evening we were landed in a waitingroom at pittsburg i had now under my charge a young and sprightly dutch widow with her children these i was to watch over providentially for a certain distance farther on the way but as i found she was furnished with a basket of eatables i left her in the waitingroom to seek a dinner for myself  i mention this meal not only because it was the first of which i had partaken for about thirty hours but because it was the means of my first introduction to a coloured gentleman he did me the honour to wait upon me after a fashion while i was eating and with every word look and gesture marched me farther into the country of surprise he was indeed strikingly unlike the negroes of mrs beecher stowe or the christy minstrels of my youth imagine a gentleman certainly somewhat dark but of a pleasant warm hue speaking english with a slight and rather odd foreign accent every inch a man of the world and armed with manners so patronisingly superior that i am at a loss to name their parallel in england a butler perhaps rides as high over the unbutlered but then he sets you right with a reserve and a sort of sighing patience which one is often moved to admire and again the abstract butler never stoops to familiarity but the coloured gentleman will pass you a wink at a time he is familiar like an upperform boy to a fag he unbends to you like prince hal with poins and falstaff he makes himself at home and welcome indeed i may say this waiter behaved himself to me throughout that supper much as with us a young free and not very selfrespecting master might behave to a goodlooking chambermaid i had come prepared to pity the poor negro to put him at his ease to prove in a thousand condescensions that i was no sharer in the prejudice of race but i assure you i put my patronage away for another occasion and had the grace to be pleased with that result  seeing he was a very honest fellow i consulted him upon a point of etiquette if one should offer to tip the american waiter certainly not he told me never it would not do they considered themselves too highly to accept they would even resent the offer as for him and me we had enjoyed a very pleasant conversation he in particular had found much pleasure in my society i was a stranger this was exactly one of those rare conjunctures without being very clearseeing i can still perceive the sun at noonday and the coloured gentleman deftly pocketed a quarter  wednesdaya little after midnight i convoyed my widow and orphans on board the train and morning found us far into ohio this had early been a favourite home of my imagination i have played at being in ohio by the week and enjoyed some capital sport there with a dummy gun my person being still unbreeched my preference was founded on a work which appeared in cassells family paper and was read aloud to me by my nurse it narrated the doings of one custaloga an indian brave who in the last chapter very obligingly washed the paint off his face and became sir reginald somebodyorother a trick i never forgave him the idea of a man being an indian brave and then giving that up to be a baronet was one which my mind rejected it offended verisimilitude like the pretended anxiety of robinson crusoe and others to escape from uninhabited islands  but ohio was not at all as i had pictured it we were now on those great plains which stretch unbroken to the rocky mountains the country was flat like holland but far from being dull all through ohio indiana illinois and iowa or for as much as i saw of them from the train and in my waking moments it was rich and various and breathed an elegance peculiar to itself the tall corn pleased the eye the trees were graceful in themselves and framed the plain into long aÃ«rial vistas and the clean bright gardened townships spoke of country fare and pleasant summer evenings on the stoop it was a sort of flat paradise but i am afraid not unfrequented by the devil that morning dawned with such a freezing chill as i have rarely felt a chill that was not perhaps so measurable by instrument as it struck home upon the heart and seemed to travel with the blood day came in with a shudder white mists lay thinly over the surface of the plain as we see them more often on a lake and though the sun had soon dispersed and drunk them up leaving an atmosphere of fever heat and crystal pureness from horizon to horizon the mists had still been there and we knew that this paradise was haunted by killing damps and foul malaria the fences along the line bore but two descriptions of advertisement one to recommend tobaccos and the other to vaunt remedies against the ague at the point of day and while we were all in the grasp of that first chill a native of the state who had got in at some way station pronounced it with a doctoral air a fever and ague morning  the dutch widow was a person of some character she had conceived at first sight a great aversion for the present writer which she was at no pains to conceal but being a woman of a practical spirit she made no difficulty about accepting my attentions and encouraged me to buy her children fruits and candies to carry all her parcels and even to sleep upon the floor that she might profit by my empty seat nay she was such a rattle by nature and so powerfully moved to autobiographical talk that she was forced for want of a better to take me into confidence and tell me the story of her life i heard about her late husband who seemed to have made his chief impression by taking her out pleasuring on sundays i could tell you her prospects her hopes the amount of her fortune the cost of her housekeeping by the week and a variety of particular matters that are not usually disclosed except to friends at one station she shook up her children to look at a man on the platform and say if he were not like mr z while to me she explained how she had been keeping company with this mr z how far matters had proceeded and how it was because of his desistance that she was now travelling to the west then when i was thus put in possession of the facts she asked my judgment on that type of manly beauty i admired it to her hearts content she was not i think remarkably veracious in talk but broidered as fancy prompted and built castles in the air out of her past yet she had that sort of candour to keep me in spite of all these confidences steadily aware of her aversion her parting words were ingeniously honest i am sure said she we all ought to be very much obliged to you i cannot pretend that she put me at my ease but i had a certain respect for such a genuine dislike a poor nature would have slipped in the course of these familiarities into a sort of worthless toleration for me  we reached chicago in the evening i was turned out of the cars bundled into an omnibus and driven off through the streets to the station of a different railroad chicago seemed a great and gloomy city i remember having subscribed let us say sixpence towards its restoration at the period of the fire and now when i beheld street after street of ponderous houses and crowds of comfortable burghers i thought it would be a graceful act for the corporation to refund that sixpence or at the least to entertain me to a cheerful dinner but there was no word of restitution i was that citys benefactor yet i was received in a thirdclass waitingroom and the best dinner i could get was a dish of ham and eggs at my own expense  i can safely say i have never been so dogtired as that night in chicago when it was time to start i descended the platform like a man in a dream it was a long train lighted from end to end and car after car as i came up with it was not only filled but overflowing my valise my knapsack my rug with those six ponderous tomes of bancroft weighed me double i was hot feverish painfully athirst and there was a great darkness over me an internal darkness not to be dispelled by gas when at last i found an empty bench i sank into it like a bundle of rags the world seemed to swim away into the distance and my consciousness dwindled within me to a mere pins head like a taper on a foggy night  when i came a little more to myself i found that there had sat down before me a very cheerful rosy little german gentleman somewhat gone in drink who was talking away to me nineteen to the dozen as they say i did my best to keep up the conversation for it seemed to me dimly as if something depended upon that i heard him relate among many other things that there were pickpockets on the train who had already robbed a man of forty dollars and a return ticket but though i caught the words i do not think i properly understood the sense until next morning and i believe i replied at the time that i was very glad to hear it what else he talked about i have no guess i remember a gabbling sound of words his profuse gesticulation and his smile which was highly explanatory but no more and i suppose i must have shown my confusion very plainly for first i saw him knit his brows at me like one who has conceived a doubt next he tried me in german supposing perhaps that i was unfamiliar with the english tongue and finally in despair he rose and left me i felt chagrined but my fatigue was too crushing for delay and stretching myself as far as that was possible upon the bench i was received at once into a dreamless stupor  the little german gentleman was only going a little way into the suburbs after a dÃ®ner fin and was bent on entertainment while the journey lasted having failed with me he pitched next upon another emigrant who had come through from canada and was not one jot less weary than myself nay even in a natural state as i found next morning when we scraped acquaintance he was a heavy uncommunicative man after trying him on different topics it appears that the little german gentleman flounced into a temper swore an oath or two and departed from that car in quest of livelier society poor little gentleman i suppose he thought an emigrant should be a rollicking freehearted blade with a flask of foreign brandy and a long comical story to beguile the moments of digestion  thursdayi suppose there must be a cycle in the fatigue of travelling for when i awoke next morning i was entirely renewed in spirits and ate a hearty breakfast of porridge with sweet milk and coffee and hot cakes at burlington upon the mississippi another long days ride followed with but one feature worthy of remark at a place called creston a drunken man got in he was aggressively friendly but according to english notions not at all unpresentable upon a train for one stage he eluded the notice of the officials but just as we were beginning to move out of the next station cromwell by name by came the conductor there was a word or two of talk and then the official had the man by the shoulders twitched him from his seat marched him through the car and sent him flying on to the track it was done in three motions as exact as a piece of drill the train was still moving slowly although beginning to mend her pace and the drunkard got his feet without a fall he carried a red bundle though not so red as his cheeks and he shook this menacingly in the air with one hand while the other stole behind him to the region of the kidneys it was the first indication that i had come among revolvers and i observed it with some emotion the conductor stood on the steps with one hand on his hip looking back at him and perhaps this attitude imposed upon the creature for he turned without further ado and went off staggering along the track towards cromwell followed by a peal of laughter from the cars they were speaking english all about me but i knew i was in a foreign land  twenty minutes before nine that night we were deposited at the pacific transfer station near council bluffs on the eastern bank of the missouri river here we were to stay the night at a kind of caravanserai set apart for emigrants but i gave way to a thirst for luxury separated myself from my companions and marched with my effects into the union pacific hotel a white clerk and a coloured gentleman whom in my plain european way i should call the boots were installed behind a counter like bank tellers they took my name assigned me a number and proceeded to deal with my packages and here came the tug of war i wished to give up my packages into safe keeping but i did not wish to go to bed and this it appeared was impossible in an american hotel  it was of course some inane misunderstanding and sprang from my unfamiliarity with the language for although two nations use the same words and read the same books intercourse is not conducted by the dictionary the business of life is not carried on by words but in set phrases each with a special and almost a slang signification some international obscurity prevailed between me and the coloured gentleman at council bluffs so that what i was asking which seemed very natural to me appeared to him a monstrous exigency he refused and that with the plainness of the west this american manner of conducting matters of business is at first highly unpalatable to the european when we approach a man in the way of his calling and for those services by which he earns his bread we consider him for the time being our hired servant but in the american opinion two gentlemen meet and have a friendly talk with a view to exchanging favours if they will agree to please i know not which is the more convenient nor even which is the more truly courteous the english stiffness unfortunately tends to be continued after the particular transaction is at an end and thus favours class separations but on the other hand these equalitarian plainnesses leave an open field for the insolence of jackinoffice  i was nettled by the coloured gentlemans refusal and unbuttoned my wrath under the similitude of ironical submission i knew nothing i said of the ways of american hotels but i had no desire to give trouble if there was nothing for it but to get to bed immediately let him say the word and though it was not my habit i should cheerfully obey  he burst into a shout of laughter ah said he you do not know about america they are fine people in america oh you will like them very well but you mustnt get mad i know what you want you come along with me  and issuing from behind the counter and taking me by the arm like an old acquaintance he led me to the bar of the hotel  there said he pushing me from him by the shoulder go and have a drink   footnote    1 please pronounce arkansaw with the accent on the first                               the emigrant train   all this while i had been travelling by mixed trains where i might meet with dutch widows and little german gentry fresh from table i had been but a latent emigrant now i was to be branded once more and put apart with my fellows it was about two in the afternoon of friday that i found myself in front of emigrant house with more than a hundred others to be sorted and boxed for the journey a whitehaired official with a stick under one arm and a list in the other hand stood apart in front of us and called name after name in the tone of a command at each name you would see a family gather up its brats and bundles and run for the hindmost of the three cars that stood awaiting us and i soon concluded that this was to be set apart for the women and children the second or central car it turned out was devoted to men travelling alone and the third to the chinese the official was easily moved to anger at the least delay but the emigrants were both quick at answering their names and speedy in getting themselves and their effects on board  the families once housed we men carried the second car without ceremony by simultaneous assault i suppose the reader has some notion of an american railroad car that long narrow wooden box like a flatroofed noahs ark with a stove and a convenience one at either end a passage down the middle and transverse benches upon either hand those destined for emigrants on the union pacific are only remarkable for their extreme plainness nothing but wood entering in any part into their constitution and for the usual inefficacy of the lamps which often went out and shed but a dying glimmer even while they burned the benches are too short for anything but a young child where there is scarce elbowroom for two to sit there will not be space enough for one to lie hence the company or rather as it appears from certain bills about the transfer station the companys servants have conceived a plan for the better accommodation of travellers they prevail on every two to chum together to each of the chums they sell a board and three square cushions stuffed with straw and covered with thin cotton the benches can be made to face each other in pairs for the backs are reversible on the approach of night the boards are laid from bench to bench making a couch wide enough for two and long enough for a man of the middle height and the chums lie down side by side upon the cushions with the head to the conductors van and the feet to the engine when the train is full of course this plan is impossible for there must not be more than one to every bench neither can it be carried out unless the chums agree it was to bring about this last condition that our whitehaired official now bestirred himself he made a most active master of ceremonies introducing likely couples and even guaranteeing the amiability and honesty of each the greater the number of happy couples the better for his pocket for it was he who sold the raw material of the beds his price for one board and three straw cushions began with two dollars and a half but before the train left and i am sorry to say long after i had purchased mine it had fallen to one dollar and a half  the matchmaker had a difficulty with me perhaps like some ladies i showed myself too eager for union at any price but certainly the first who was picked out to be my bedfellow declined the honour without thanks he was an old heavy slowspoken man i think from yankeeland looked me all over with great timidity and then began to excuse himself in broken phrases he didnt know the young man he said the young man might be very honest but how was he to know that there was another young man whom he had met already in the train he guessed he was honest and would prefer to chum with him upon the whole all this without any sort of excuse as though i had been inanimate or absent i began to tremble lest every one should refuse my company and i be left rejected but the next in turn was a tall strapping longlimbed smallheaded curlyhaired pennsylvania dutchman with a soldierly smartness in his manner to be exact he had acquired it in the navy but that was all one he had at least been trained to desperate resolves so he accepted the match and the whitehaired swindler pronounced the connubial benediction and pocketed his fees  the rest of the afternoon was spent in making up the train i am afraid to say how many baggagewaggons followed the enginecertainly a score then came the chinese then we then the families and the rear was brought up by the conductor in what if i have it rightly is called his caboose the class to which i belonged was of course far the largest and we ran over so to speak to both sides so that there were some caucasians among the chinamen and some bachelors among the families but our own car was pure from admixture save for one little boy of eight or nine who had the whoopingcough at last about six the long train crawled out of the transfer station and across the wide missouri river to omaha westward bound  it was a troubled uncomfortable evening in the cars there was thunder in the air which helped to keep us restless a man played many airs upon the cornet and none of them were much attended to until he came to home sweet home it was truly strange to note how the talk ceased at that and the faces began to lengthen i have no idea whether musically this air is to be considered good or bad but it belongs to that class of art which may be best described as a brutal assault upon the feelings pathos must be relieved by dignity of treatment if you wallow naked in the pathetic like the author of home sweet home you make your hearers weep in an unmanly fashion and even while yet they are moved they despise themselves and hate the occasion of their weakness it did not come to tears that night for the experiment was interrupted an elderly hardlooking man with a goatee beard and about as much appearance of sentiment as you would expect from a retired slaver turned with a start and bade the performer stop that damned thing ive heard about enough of that he added give us something about the good country were going to a murmur of adhesion ran round the car the performer took the instrument from his lips laughed and nodded and then struck into a dancing measure and like a new timotheus stilled immediately the emotion he had raised  the day faded the lamps were lit a party of wild young men who got off next evening at north platte stood together on the stern platform singing the sweet byandbye with very tuneful voices the chums began to put up their beds and it seemed as if the business of the day were at an end but it was not so for the train stopping at some station the cars were instantly thronged with the natives wives and fathers young men and maidens some of them in little more than nightgear some with stable lanterns and all offering beds for sale their charge began with twentyfive cents a cushion but fell before the train went on again to fifteen with the bedboard gratis or less than onefifth of what i had paid for mine at the transfer this is my contribution to the economy of future emigrants  a great personage on an american train is the newsboy he sells books such books papers fruit lollipops and cigars and on emigrant journeys soap towels tin washingdishes tin coffeepitchers coffee tea sugar and tinned eatables mostly hash or beans and bacon early next morning the newsboy went round the cars and chumming on a more extended principle became the order of the hour it requires but a copartnery of two to manage beds but washing and eating can be carried on most economically by a syndicate of three i myself entered a little after sunrise into articles of agreement and became one of the firm of pennsylvania shakespeare and dubuque shakespeare was my own nickname on the cars pennsylvania that of my bedfellow and dubuque the name of a place in the state of iowa that of an amiable young fellow going west to cure an asthma and retarding his recovery by incessantly chewing or smoking and sometimes chewing and smoking together i have never seen tobacco so sillily abused shakespeare bought a tin washingdish dubuque a towel and pennsylvania a brick of soap the partners used these instruments one after another according to the order of their first awaking and when the firm had finished there was no want of borrowers each filled the tin dish at the water filter opposite the stove and retired with the whole stock in trade to the platform of the car there he knelt down supporting himself by a shoulder against the woodwork or one elbow crooked about the railing and made a shift to wash his face and neck and handsa cold an insufficient and if the train is moving rapidly a somewhat dangerous toilet  on a similar division of expense the firm of pennsylvania shakespeare and dubuque supplied themselves with coffee sugar and necessary vessels and their operations are a type of what went on through all the cars before the sun was up the stove would be brightly burning at the first station the natives would come on board with milk and eggs and coffee cakes and soon from end to end the car would be filled with little parties breakfasting upon the bedboards it was the pleasantest hour of the day  there were meals to be had however by the wayside a breakfast in the morning a dinner somewhere between eleven and two and supper from five to eight or nine at night we had rarely less than twenty minutes for each and if we had not spent many another twenty minutes waiting for some express upon a side track among many miles of desert we might have taken an hour to each repast and arrived at san francisco up to time for haste is not the foible of an emigrant train it gets through on sufferance running the gauntlet among its more considerable brethren should there be a block it is unhesitatingly sacrificed and they cannot in consequence predict the length of the passage within a day or so civility is the main comfort that you miss equality though conceived very largely in america does not extend so low down as to an emigrant thus in all other trains a warning cry of all aboard recalls the passengers to take their seats but as soon as i was alone with emigrants and from the transfer all the way to san francisco i found this ceremony was pretermitted the train stole from the station without note of warning and you had to keep an eye upon it even while you ate the annoyance is considerable and the disrespect both wanton and petty  many conductors again will hold no communication with an emigrant i asked a conductor one day at what time the train would stop for dinner as he made no answer i repeated the question with a like result a third time i returned to the charge and then jackinoffice looked me coolly in the face for several seconds and turned ostentatiously away i believe he was half ashamed of his brutality for when another person made the same inquiry although he still refused the information he condescended to answer and even to justify his reticence in a voice loud enough for me to hear it was he said his principle not to tell people where they were to dine for one answer led to many other questions as what oclock it was or how soon should we be there and he could not afford to be eternally worried  as you are thus cut off from the superior authorities a great deal of your comfort depends on the character of the newsboy he has it in his power indefinitely to better and brighten the emigrants lot the newsboy with whom we started from the transfer was a dark bullying contemptuous insolent scoundrel who treated us like dogs indeed in his case matters came nearly to a fight it happened thus he was going his rounds through the cars with some commodities for sale and coming to a party who were at sevenup or cascino our two games upon a bedboard slung down a cigarbox in the middle of the cards knocking one mans hand to the floor it was the last straw in a moment the whole party were upon their feet the cigars were upset and he was ordered to get out of that directly or he would get more than he reckoned for the fellow grumbled and muttered but ended by making off and was less openly insulting in the future on the other hand the lad who rode with us in this capacity from ogden to sacramento made himself the friend of all and helped us with information attention assistance and a kind countenance he told us where and when we should have our meals and how long the train would stop kept seats at table for those who were delayed and watched that we should neither be left behind nor yet unnecessarily hurried you who live at home at ease can hardly realise the greatness of this service even had it stood alone when i think of that lad coming and going train after train with his bright face and civil words i see how easily a good man may become the benefactor of his kind perhaps he is discontented with himself perhaps troubled with ambitions why if he but knew it he is a hero of the old greek stamp and while he thinks he is only earning a profit of a few cents and that perhaps exorbitant he is doing a mans work and bettering the world  i must tell here an experience of mine with another newsboy i tell it because it gives so good an example of that uncivil kindness of the american which is perhaps their most bewildering character to one newly landed it was immediately after i had left the emigrant train and i am told i looked like a man at deaths door so much had this long journey shaken me i sat at the end of a car and the catch being broken and myself feverish and sick i had to hold the door open with my foot for the sake of air in this attitude my leg debarred the newsboy from his box of merchandise i made haste to let him pass when i observed that he was coming but i was busy with a book and so once or twice he came upon me unawares on these occasions he most rudely struck my foot aside and though i myself apologised as if to show him the way he answered me never a word i chafed furiously and i fear the next time it would have come to words but suddenly i felt a touch upon my shoulder and a large juicy pear was put into my hand it was the newsboy who had observed that i was looking ill and so made this present out of a tender heart for the rest of the journey i was petted like a sick child he lent me newspapers thus depriving himself of his legitimate profit on their sale and came repeatedly to sit by me and cheer me up                             the plains of nebraska   it had thundered on the friday night but the sun rose on saturday without a cloud we were at seathere is no other adequate expressionon the plains of nebraska i made my observatory on the top of a fruitwaggon and sat by the hour upon that perch to spy about me and to spy in vain for something new it was a world almost without a feature an empty sky an empty earth front and back the line of railway stretched from horizon to horizon like a cue across a billiardboard on either hand the green plain ran till it touched the skirts of heaven along the track innumerable wild sunflowers no bigger than a crownpiece bloomed in a continuous flowerbed grazing beasts were seen upon the prairie at all degrees of distance and diminution and now and again we might perceive a few dots beside the railroad which grew more and more distinct as we drew nearer till they turned into wooden cabins and then dwindled and dwindled in our wake until they melted into their surroundings and we were once more alone upon the billiardboard the train toiled over this infinity like a snail and being the one thing moving it was wonderful what huge proportions it began to assume in our regard it seemed miles in length and either end of it within but a step of the horizon even my own body or my own head seemed a great thing in that emptiness i note the feeling the more readily as it is the contrary of what i have read of in the experience of others day and night above the roar of the train our ears were kept busy with the incessant chirp of grasshoppersa noise like the winding up of countless clocks and watches which began after a while to seem proper to that land  to one hurrying through by steam there was a certain exhilaration in this spacious vacancy this greatness of the air this discovery of the whole arch of heaven this straight unbroken prisonline of the horizon yet one could not but reflect upon the weariness of those who passed by there in old days at the foots pace of oxen painfully urging their teams and with no landmark but that unattainable evening sun for which they steered and which daily fled them by an equal stride they had nothing it would seem to overtake nothing by which to reckon their advance no sight for repose or for encouragement but stage after stage only the dead green waste under foot and the mocking fugitive horizon but the eye as i have been told found differences even here and at the worst the emigrant came by perseverance to the end of his toil it is the settlers after all at whom we have a right to marvel our consciousness by which we live is itself but the creature of variety upon what food does it subsist in such a land what livelihood can repay a human creature for a life spent in this huge sameness he is cut off from books from news from company from all that can relieve existence but the prosecution of his affairs a sky full of stars is the most varied spectacle that he can hope for he may walk five miles and see nothing ten and it is as though he had not moved twenty and still he is in the midst of the same great level and has approached no nearer to the one object within view the flat horizon which keeps pace with his advance we are full at home of the question of agreeable wallpapers and wise people are of opinion that the temper may be quieted by sedative surroundings but what is to be said of the nebraskan settler his is a wallpaper with a vengeanceone quarter of the universe laid bare in all its gauntness his eye must embrace at every glance the whole seeming concave of the visible world it quails before so vast an outlook it is tortured by distance yet there is no rest or shelter till the man runs into his cabin and can repose his sight upon things near at hand hence i am told a sickness of the vision peculiar to these empty plains  yet perhaps with sunflowers and cicadÃ¦ summer and winter cattle wife and family the settler may create a full and various existence one person at least i saw upon the plains who seemed in every way superior to her lot this was a woman who boarded us at a way station selling milk she was largely formed her features were more than comely she had that great raritya fine complexion which became her and her eyes were kind dark and steady she sold milk with patriarchal grace there was not a line in her countenance not a note in her soft and sleepy voice but spoke of an entire contentment with her life it would have been fatuous arrogance to pity such a woman yet the place where she lived was to me almost ghastly less than a dozen wooden houses all of a shape and all nearly of a size stood planted along the railway lines each stood apart in its own lot each opened direct off the billiardboard as if it were a billiardboard indeed and these only models that had been set down upon it ready made her own into which i looked was clean but very empty and showed nothing homelike but the burning fire this extreme newness above all in so naked and flat a country gives a strong impression of artificiality with none of the litter and discoloration of human life with the paths unworn and the houses still sweating from the axe such a settlement as this seems purely scenic the mind is loth to accept it for a piece of reality and it seems incredible that life can go on with so few properties or the great child man find entertainment in so bare a playroom  and truly it is as yet an incomplete society in some points or at least it contained as i passed through one person incompletely civilised at north platte where we supped that evening one man asked another to pass the milkjug this other was well dressed and of what we should call a respectable appearance a darkish man highspoken eating as though he had some usage of society but he turned upon the first speaker with extraordinary vehemence of tone  theres a waiter here he cried  i only asked you to pass the milk explained the first  here is the retort verbatim  pass hell im not paid for that business the waiters paid for it you should use civility at table and by god ill show you how  the other man very wisely made no answer and the bully went on with his supper as though nothing had occurred it pleases me to think that some day soon he will meet one of his own kidney and perhaps both may fall                              the desert of wyoming   to cross such a plain is to grow homesick for the mountains i longed for the black hills of wyoming which i knew we were soon to enter like an icebound whaler for the spring alas and it was a worse country than the other all sunday and monday we travelled through these sad mountains or over the main ridge of the rockies which is a fair match to them for misery of aspect hour after hour it was the same unhomely and unkindly world about our onward path tumbled boulders cliffs that drearily imitate the shape of monuments and fortificationshow drearily how tamely none can tell who has not seen them not a tree not a patch of sward not one shapely or commanding mountain form sagebrush eternal sagebrush over all the same weariful and gloomy colouring greys warming into brown greys darkening towards black and for sole sign of life here and there a few fleeing antelopes here and there but at incredible intervals a creek running in a caÃ±on the plains have a grandeur of their own but here there is nothing but a contorted smallness except for the air which was light and stimulating there was not one good circumstance in that godforsaken land  i had been suffering in my health a good deal all the way and at last whether i was exhausted by my complaint or poisoned in some wayside eatinghouse the evening we left laramie i fell sick outright that was a night which i shall not readily forget the lamps did not go out each made a faint shining in its own neighbourhood and the shadows were confounded together in the long hollow box of the car the sleepers lay in uneasy attitudes here two chums alongside flat upon their backs like dead folk there a man sprawling on the floor with his face upon his arm there another half seated with his head and shoulders on the bench the most passive were continually and roughly shaken by the movement of the train others stirred turned or stretched out their arms like children it was surprising how many groaned and murmured in their sleep and as i passed to and fro stepping across the prostrate and caught now a snore now a gasp now a halfformed word it gave me a measure of the worthlessness of rest in that unresting vehicle although it was chill i was obliged to open my window for the degradation of the air soon became intolerable to one who was awake and using the full supply of life outside in a glimmering night i saw the black amorphous hills shoot by unweariedly into our wake they that long for morning have never longed for it more earnestly than i  and yet when day came it was to shine upon the same broken and unsightly quarter of the world mile upon mile and not a tree a bird or a river only down the long sterile caÃ±ons the train shot hooting and awoke the resting echo that train was the one piece of life in all the deadly land it was the one actor the one spectacle fit to be observed in this paralysis of man and nature and when i think how the railroad has been pushed through this unwatered wilderness and haunt of savage tribes and now will bear an emigrant for some Â£12 from the atlantic to the golden gates how at each stage of the construction roaring impromptu cities full of gold and lust and death sprang up and then died away again and are now but wayside stations in the desert how in these uncouth places pigtailed chinese pirates worked side by side with border ruffians and broken men from europe talking together in a mixed dialect mostly oaths gambling drinking quarrelling and murdering like wolves how the plumed hereditary lord of all america heard in this last fastness the scream of the bad medicine waggon charioting his foes and then when i go on to remember that all this epical turmoil was conducted by gentlemen in frockcoats and with a view to nothing more extraordinary than a fortune and a subsequent visit to paris it seems to me i own as if this railway were the one typical achievement of the age in which we live as if it brought together into one plot all the ends of the world and all the degrees of social rank and offered to some great writer the busiest the most extended and the most varied subject for an enduring literary work if it be romance if it be contrast if it be heroism that we require what was troy town to this but alas it is not these things that are necessaryit is only homer  here also we are grateful to the train as to some god who conducts us swiftly through these shades and by so many hidden perils thirst hunger the sleight and ferocity of indians are all no more feared so lightly do we skim these horrible lands as the gull who wings safely through the hurricane and past the shark yet we should not be forgetful of these hardships of the past and to keep the balance true since i have complained of the trifling discomforts of my journey perhaps more than was enough let me add an original document it was not written by homer but by a boy of eleven long since dead and is dated only twenty years ago i shall punctuate to make things clearer but not change the spelling  my dear sister maryi am afraid you will go nearly crazy when you read my letter if jerry the writers eldest brother has not written to you before now you will be surprised to heare that we are in california and that poor thomas another brother of fifteen is dead we started from  in july with plenty of provisions and too yoke oxen we went along very well till we got within six or seven hundred miles of california when the indians attacked us we found places where they had killed the emigrants we had one passenger with us too guns and one revolver so we ran all the lead we had into bullets and hung the guns up in the wagon so we could get at them in a minit it was about two oclock in the afternoon droave the cattel a little way when a prairie chicken alited a little way from the wagon  jerry took out one of the guns to shoot it and told tom drive the oxen tom and i drove the oxen and jerry and the passenger went on then after a little i left tom and caught up with jerry and the other man jerry stopped for tom to come up me and the man went on and sit down by a little stream in a few minutes we heard some noise then three shots they all struck poor tom i suppose then they gave the war hoop and as many as twenty of the red skins came down upon us the three that shot tom was hid by the side of the road in the bushes  i thought the tom and jerry were shot so i told the other man that tom and jerry were dead and that we had better try to escape if possible i had no shoes on having a sore foot i thought i would not put them on the man and me run down the road but we was soon stopt by an indian on a pony we then turend the other way and run up the side of the mountain and hid behind some cedar trees and stayed there till dark the indians hunted all over after us and verry close to us so close that we could here there tomyhawks jingle at dark the man and me started on i stubing my toes against sticks and stones we traveld on all night and next morning just as it was getting gray we saw something in the shape of a man it layed down in the grass we went up to it and it was jerry he thought we ware indians you can imagine how glad he was to see me he thought we was all dead but him and we thought him and tom was dead he had the gun that he took out of the wagon to shoot the prairie chicken all he had was the load that was in it  we traveld on till about eight oclock we caught up with one wagon with too men with it we had traveld with them before one day we stopt and they drove on we knew that they was ahead of us unless they had been killed to my feet was so sore when we caught up with them that i had to ride i could not step we traveld on for too days when the men that owned the cattle said they would could not drive them another inch we unyoked the oxen we had about seventy pounds of flour we took it out and divided it into four packs each of the men took about 18 pounds apiece and a blanket i carried a little bacon dried meat and little quilt i had in all about twelve pounds we had one pint of flour a day for our alloyance sometimes we made soup of it sometimes we made pancakes and sometimes mixed it up with cold water and eat it that way we traveld twelve or fourteen days the time came at last when we should have to reach some place or starve we saw fresh horse and cattle tracks the morning come we scraped all the flour out of the sack mixed it up and baked it into bread and made some soup and eat everything we had we traveld on all day without anything to eat and that evening we caught up with a sheep train of eight wagons we traveld with them till we arrived at the settlements and know i am safe in california and got to good home and going to school  jerry is working in  it is a good country you can get from 50 to 60 and 75 dollars for cooking tell me all about the affairs in the states and how all the folks get along  and so ends this artless narrative the little man was at school again god bless him while his brother lay scalped upon the desert                               fellow passengers   at ogden we changed cars from the union pacific to the central pacific line of railroad the change was doubly welcome for first we had better cars on the new line and second those in which we had been cooped for more than ninety hours had begun to stink abominably several yards away as we returned let us say from dinner our nostrils were assailed by rancid air i have stood on a platform while the whole train was shunting and as the dwellingcars drew near there would come a whiff of pure menagerie only a little sourer as from men instead of monkeys i think we are human only in virtue of open windows without fresh air you only require a bad heart and a remarkable command of the queens english to become such another as dean swift a kind of leering human goat leaping and wagging your scut on mountains of offence i do my best to keep my head the other way and look for the human rather than the bestial in this yahoolike business of the emigrant train but one thing i must say the car of the chinese was notably the least offensive  the cars on the central pacific were nearly twice as high and so proportionally airier they were freshly varnished which gave us all a sense of cleanliness as though we had bathed the seats drew out and joined in the centre so that there was no more need for bedboards and there was an upper tier of berths which could be closed by day and opened at night  i had by this time some opportunity of seeing the people whom i was among they were in rather marked contrast to the emigrants i had met on board ship while crossing the atlantic they were mostly lumpish fellows silent and noisy a common combination somewhat sad i should say with an extraordinary poor taste in humour and little interest in their fellowcreatures beyond that of a cheap and merely external curiosity if they heard a mans name and business they seemed to think they had the heart of that mystery but they were as eager to know that much as they were indifferent to the rest some of them were on nettles till they learned your name was dickson and you a journeyman baker but beyond that whether you were catholic or mormon dull or clever fierce or friendly was all one to them others who were not so stupid gossiped a little and i am bound to say unkindly a favourite witticism was for some lout to raise the alarm of all aboard while the rest of us were dining thus contributing his mite to the general discomfort such a one was always much applauded for his high spirits when i was ill coming through wyoming i was astonishedfresh from the eager humanity on board shipto meet with little but laughter one of the young men even amused himself by incommoding me as was then very easy and that not from illnature but mere clodlike incapacity to think for he expected me to join the laugh i did so but it was phantom merriment later on a man from kansas had three violent epileptic fits and though of course there were not wanting some to help him it was rather superstitious terror than sympathy that his case evoked among his fellowpassengers oh i hope hes not going to die cried a woman it would be terrible to have a dead body and there was a very general movement to leave the man behind at the next station this by good fortune the conductor negatived  there was a good deal of storytelling in some quarters in others little but silence in this society more than any other that ever i was in it was the narrator alone who seemed to enjoy the narrative it was rarely that any one listened for the listening if he lent an ear to another mans story it was because he was in immediate want of a hearer for one of his own food and the progress of the train were the subjects most generally treated many joined to discuss these who otherwise would hold their tongues one small knot had no better occupation than to worm out of me my name and the more they tried the more obstinately fixed i grew to baffle them they assailed me with artful questions and insidious offers of correspondence in the future but i was perpetually on my guard and parried their assaults with inward laughter i am sure dubuque would have given me ten dollars for the secret he owed me far more had he understood life for thus preserving him a lively interest throughout the journey i met one of my fellowpassengers months after driving a street tramway car in san francisco and as the joke was now out of season told him my name without subterfuge you never saw a man more chapfallen but had my name been demogorgon after so prolonged a mystery he had still been disappointed  there were no emigrants direct from europesave one german family and a knot of cornish miners who kept grimly by themselves one reading the new testament all day long through steel spectacles the rest discussing privately the secrets of their oldworld mysterious race lady hester stanhope believed she could make something great of the cornish for my part i can make nothing of them at all a division of races older and more original than that of babel keeps this close esoteric family apart from neighbouring englishmen not even a red indian seems more foreign in my eyes this is one of the lessons of travelthat some of the strangest races dwell next door to you at home  the rest were all american born but they came from almost every quarter of that continent all the states of the north had sent out a fugitive to cross the plains with me from virginia from pennsylvania from new york from far western iowa and kansas from maine that borders on the canadas and from the canadas themselvessome one or two were fleeing in quest of a better land and better wages the talk in the train like the talk i heard on the steamer ran upon hard times short commons and hope that moves ever westward i thought of my shipful from great britain with a feeling of despair they had come 3000 miles and yet not far enough hard times bowed them out of the clyde and stood to welcome them at sandy hook where were they to go pennsylvania maine iowa kansas these were not places for immigration but for emigration it appeared not one of them but i knew a man who had lifted up his heel and left it for an ungrateful country and it was still westward that they ran hunger you would have thought came out of the east like the sun and the evening was made of edible gold and meantime in the car in front of me were there not half a hundred emigrants from the opposite quarter hungry europe and hungry china each pouring from their gates in search of provender had here come face to face the two waves had met east and west had alike failed the whole round world had been prospected and condemned there was no el dorado anywhere and till one could emigrate to the moon it seemed as well to stay patiently at home nor was there wanting another sign at once more picturesque and more disheartening for as we continued to steam westward towards the land of gold we were continually passing other emigrant trains upon the journey east and these were as crowded as our own had all these return voyagers made a fortune in the mines were they all bound for paris and to be in rome by easter it would seem not for whenever we met them the passengers ran on the platform and cried to us through the windows in a kind of wailing chorus to come back on the plains of nebraska in the mountains of wyoming it was still the same cry and dismal to my heart come back that was what we heard by the way about the good country we were going to and at that very hour the sandlot of san francisco was crowded with the unemployed and the echo from the other side of market street was repeating the rant of demagogues  if in truth it were only for the sake of wages that men emigrate how many thousands would regret the bargain but wages indeed are only one consideration out of many for we are a race of gipsies and love change and travel for themselves                                 despised races   of all stupid illfeelings the sentiment of my fellowcaucasians towards our companions in the chinese car was the most stupid and the worst they seemed never to have looked at them listened to them or thought of them but hated them a priori the mongols were their enemies in that cruel and treacherous battlefield of money they could work better and cheaper in half a hundred industries and hence there was no calumny too idle for the caucasians to repeat and even to believe they declared them hideous vermin and affected a kind of choking in the throat when they beheld them now as a matter of fact the young chinese man is so like a large class of european women that on raising my head and suddenly catching sight of one at a considerable distance i have for an instant been deceived by the resemblance i do not say it is the most attractive class of our women but for all that many a mans wife is less pleasantly favoured again my emigrants declared that the chinese were dirty i cannot say they were clean for that was impossible upon the journey but in their efforts after cleanliness they put the rest of us to shame we all pigged and stewed in one infamy wet our hands and faces for half a minute daily on the platform and were unashamed but the chinese never lost an opportunity and you would see them washing their feetan act not dreamed of among ourselvesand going as far as decency permitted to wash their whole bodies i may remark by the way that the dirtier people are in their persons the more delicate is their sense of modesty a clean man strips in a crowded boathouse but he who is unwashed slinks in and out of bed without uncovering an inch of skin lastly these very foul and malodorous caucasians entertained the surprising illusion that it was the chinese waggon and that alone which stank i have said already that it was the exception and notably the freshest of the three  these judgments are typical of the feeling in all western america the chinese are considered stupid because they are imperfectly acquainted with english they are held to be base because their dexterity and frugality enable them to underbid the lazy luxurious caucasian they are said to be thieves i am sure they have no monopoly of that they are called cruel the anglosaxon and the cheerful irishman may each reflect before he bears the accusation i am told again that they are of the race of river pirates and belong to the most despised and dangerous class in the celestial empire but if this be so what remarkable pirates have we here and what must be the virtues the industry the education and the intelligence of their superiors at home  awhile ago it was the irish now it is the chinese that must go such is the cry it seems after all that no country is bound to submit to immigration any more than to invasion each is war to the knife and resistance to either but legitimate defence yet we may regret the free tradition of the republic which loved to depict herself with open arms welcoming all unfortunates and certainly as a man who believes that he loves freedom i may be excused some bitterness when i find her sacred name misused in the contention it was but the other day that i heard a vulgar fellow in the sandlot the popular tribune of san francisco roaring for arms and butchery at the call of abreham lincoln said the orator ye rose in the name of freedom to set free the negroes can ye not rise and liberate yourselves from a few dhirty mongolians  for my own part i could not look but with wonder and respect on the chinese their forefathers watched the stars before mine had begun to keep pigs gunpowder and printing which the other day we imitated and a school of manners which we never had the delicacy so much as to desire to imitate were theirs in a longpast antiquity they walked the earth with us but it seems they must be of different clay they hear the clock strike the same hour yet surely of a different epoch they travel by steam conveyance yet with such a baggage of old asiatic thoughts and superstitions as might check the locomotive in its course whatever is thought within the circuit of the great wall what the wryeyed spectacled schoolmaster teaches in the hamlets round pekin religions so old that our language looks a halfling boy alongside philosophy so wise that our best philosophers find things therein to wonder at all this travelled alongside of me for thousands of miles over plain and mountain heaven knows if we had one common thought or fancy all that way or whether our eyes which yet were formed upon the same design beheld the same world out of the railway windows and when either of us turned his thoughts to home and childhood what a strange dissimilarity must there not have been in these pictures of the mindwhen i beheld that old grey castled city high throned above the firth with the flag of britain flying and the redcoat sentry pacing over all and the man in the next car to me would conjure up some junks and a pagoda and a fort of porcelain and call it with the same affection home  another race shared among my fellowpassengers in the disfavour of the chinese and that it is hardly necessary to say was the noble red man of old storyhe over whose own hereditary continent we had been steaming all these days i saw no wild or independent indian indeed i hear that such avoid the neighbourhood of the train but now and again at way stations a husband and wife and a few children disgracefully dressed out with the sweepings of civilisation came forth and stared upon the emigrants the silent stoicism of their conduct and the pathetic degradation of their appearance would have touched any thinking creature but my fellowpassengers danced and jested round them with a truly cockney baseness i was ashamed for the thing we call civilisation we shall carry upon our consciences so much at least of our forefathers misconduct as we continue to profit by ourselves  if oppression drives a wise man mad what should be raging in the hearts of these poor tribes who have been driven back and back step after step their promised reservations torn from them one after another as the states extended westward until at length they are shut up into these hideous mountain deserts of the centreand even there find themselves invaded insulted and hunted out by ruffianly diggers the eviction of the cherokees to name but an instance the extortion of indian agents the outrages of the wicked the illfaith of all nay down to the ridicule of such poor beings as were here with me upon the train make up a chapter of injustice and indignity such as a man must be in some ways base if his heart will suffer him to pardon or forget these old wellfounded historical hatreds have a savour of nobility for the independent that the jew should not love the christian nor the irishman love the english nor the indian brave tolerate the thought of the american is not disgraceful to the nature of man rather indeed honourable since it depends on wrongs ancient like the race and not personal to him who cherishes the indignation                               to the golden gates   a little corner of utah is soon traversed and leaves no particular impressions on the mind by an early hour on wednesday morning we stopped to breakfast at toano a little station on a bleak highlying plateau in nevada the man who kept the station eatinghouse was a scot and learning that i was the same he grew very friendly and gave me some advice on the country i was now entering you see said he i tell you this because i come from your country hail brither scots  his most important hint was on the moneys of this part of the world there is something in the simplicity of a decimal coinage which is revolting to the human mind thus the french in small affairs reckon strictly by halfpence and you have to solve by a spasm of mental arithmetic such posers as thirtytwo fortyfive or even a hundred halfpence in the pacific states they have made a bolder push for complexity and settle their affairs by a coin that no longer existsthe bit or old mexican real the supposed value of the bit is twelve and a half cents eight to the dollar when it comes to two bits the quarterdollar stands for the required amount but how about an odd bit the nearest coin to it is a dime which is short by a fifth that then is called a short bit if you have one you lay it triumphantly down and save two and a half cents but if you have not and lay down a quarter the barkeeper or shopman calmly tenders you a dime by way of change and thus you have paid what is called a long bit and lost two and a half cents or even by comparison with a short bit five cents in country places all over the pacific coast nothing lower than a bit is ever asked or taken which vastly increases the cost of life as even for a glass of beer you must pay fivepence or sevenpencehalfpenny as the case may be you will say that this system of mutual robbery was as broad as it was long but i have discovered a plan to make it broader with which i here endow the public it is brief and simpleradiantly simple there is one place where five cents are recognised and that is the postoffice a quarter is only worth two bits a short and a long whenever you have a quarter go to the post office and buy five cents worth of postagestamps you will receive in change two dimes that is two short bits the purchasing power of your money is undiminished you can go and have your two glasses of beer all the same and you have made yourself a present of five cents worth of postagestamps into the bargain benjamin franklin would have patted me on the head for this discovery  from toano we travelled all day through deserts of alkali and sand horrible to man and bare sagebrush country that seemed little kindlier and came by suppertime to elko as we were standing after our manner outside the station i saw two men whip suddenly from underneath the cars and take to their heels across country they were tramps it appeared who had been riding on the beams since eleven of the night before and several of my fellowpassengers had already seen and conversed with them while we broke our fast at toano these land stowaways play a great part over here in america and i should have liked dearly to become acquainted with them  at elko an odd circumstance befell me i was coming out from supper when i was stopped by a small stout ruddy man followed by two others taller and ruddier than himself  excuse me sir he said but do you happen to be going on  i said i was whereupon he said he hoped to persuade me to desist from that intention he had a situation to offer me and if we could come to terms why good and well you see he continued im running a theatre here and were a little short in the orchestra youre a musician i guess  i assured him that beyond a rudimentary acquaintance with auld lang syne and the wearing of the green i had no pretension whatever to that style he seemed much put out of countenance and one of his taller companions asked him on the nail for five dollars  you see sir added the latter to me he bet you were a musician i bet you werent no offence i hope  none whatever i said and the two withdrew to the bar where i presume the debt was liquidated  this little adventure woke bright hopes in my fellowtravellers who thought they had now come to a country where situations went abegging but i am not so sure that the offer was in good faith indeed i am more than half persuaded it was but a feeler to decide the bet  of all the next day i will tell you nothing for the best of all reasons that i remember no more than that we continued through desolate and desert scenes fiery hot and deadly weary but some time after i had fallen asleep that night i was awakened by one of my companions it was in vain that i resisted a fire of enthusiasm and whisky burned in his eyes and he declared we were in a new country and i must come forth upon the platform and see with my own eyes the train was then in its patient way standing halted in a bytrack it was a clear moonlit night but the valley was too narrow to admit the moonshine direct and only a diffused glimmer whitened the tall rocks and relieved the blackness of the pines a hoarse clamour filled the air it was the continuous plunge of a cascade somewhere near at hand among the mountains the air struck chill but tasted good and vigorous in the nostrilsa fine dry old mountain atmosphere i was dead sleepy but i returned to roost with a grateful mountain feeling at my heart  when i awoke next morning i was puzzled for a while to know if it were day or night for the illumination was unusual i sat up at last and found we were grading slowly downward through a long snowshed and suddenly we shot into an open and before we were swallowed into the next length of wooden tunnel i had one glimpse of a huge pineforested ravine upon my left a foaming river and a sky already coloured with the fires of dawn i am usually very calm over the displays of nature but you will scarce believe how my heart leaped at this it was like meeting ones wife i had come home againhome from unsightly deserts to the green and habitable corners of the earth every spire of pine along the hilltop every trouty pool along that mountain river was more dear to me than a blood relation few people have praised god more happily than i did and thenceforward down by blue caÃ±on alta dutch flat and all the old mining camps through a sea of mountain forests dropping thousands of feet toward the far sealevel as we went not i only but all the passengers on board threw off their sense of dirt and heat and weariness and bawled like schoolboys and thronged with shining eyes upon the platform and became new creatures within and without the sun no longer oppressed us with heat it only shone laughingly along the mountainside until we were fain to laugh ourselves for glee at every turn we could see farther into the land and our own happy futures at every town the cocks were tossing their clear notes into the golden air and crowing for the new day and the new country for this was indeed our destination this was the good country we had been going to so long  by afternoon we were at sacramento the city of gardens in a plain of corn and the next day before the dawn we were lyingto upon the oakland side of san francisco bay the day was breaking as we crossed the ferry the fog was rising over the citied hills of san francisco the day was perfectnot a ripple scarce a stain upon its blue expanse everything was waiting breathless for the sun a spot of cloudy gold lit first upon the head of tamalpais and then widened downward on its shapely shoulder the air seemed to awaken and began to sparkle and suddenly                   the tall hills titan discovered  and the city of san francisco and the bay of gold and corn were lit from end to end with summer daylight                       the old and new pacific capitals                       the old and new pacific capitals                                       i                                monterey   the bay of monterey has been compared by no less a person than general sherman to a bent fishinghook and the comparison if less important than the march through georgia still shows the eye of a soldier for topography santa cruz sits exposed at the shank the mouth of the salinas river is at the middle of the bend and monterey itself is cosily ensconced beside the barb thus the ancient capital of california faces across the bay while the pacific ocean though hidden by low hills and forest bombards her left flank and rear with neverdying surf in front of the town the long line of seabeach trends north and northwest and then westward to enclose the bay the waves which lap so quietly about the jetties of monterey grew louder and larger in the distance you can see the breakers leaping high and white by day at night the outline of the shore is traced in transparent silver by the moonlight and the flying foam and from all round even in quiet weather the low distant thrilling roar of the pacific hangs over the coast and the adjacent country like smoke above a battle  these long beaches are enticing to the idle man it would be hard to find a walk more solitary and at the same time more exciting to the mind crowds of ducks and seagulls hover over the sea sandpipers trot in and out by troops after the retiring waves trilling together in a chorus of infinitesimal song strange seatangles new to the european eye the bones of whales or sometimes a whole whales carcase white with carriongulls and poisoning the wind lie scattered here and there along the sands the waves come in slowly vast and green curve their translucent necks and burst with a surprising uproar that runs waxing and waning up and down the long keyboard of the beach the foam of these great ruins mounts in an instant to the ridge of the sand glacis swiftly fleets back again and is met and buried by the next breaker the interest is perpetually fresh on no other coast that i know shall you enjoy in calm sunny weather such a spectacle of oceans greatness such beauty of changing colour or such degrees of thunder in the sound the very air is more than usually salt by this homeric deep  inshore a tract of sandhills borders on the beach here and there a lagoon more or less brackish attracts the birds and hunters a rough spotty undergrowth partially conceals the sand the crouching hardy live oaks flourish singly or in thicketsthe kind of wood for murderers to crawl amongand here and there the skirts of the forest extend downward from the hills with a floor of turf and long aisles of pinetrees hung with spaniards beard through this quaint desert the railway cars drew near to monterey from the junction at salinas citythough that and so many other things are now for ever alteredand it was from here that you had the first view of the old township lying in the sands its white windmills bickering in the chill perpetual wind and the first fogs of the evening drawing drearily around it from the sea  the one common note of all this country is the haunting presence of the ocean a great faint sound of breakers follows you high up into the inland caÃ±ons the roar of water dwells in the clean empty rooms of monterey as in a shell upon the chimney go where you will you have but to pause and listen to hear the voice of the pacific you pass out of the town to the southwest and mount the hill among pine woods glade thicket and grove surround you you follow winding sandy tracks that lead nowhither you see a deer a multitude of quail arises but the sound of the sea still follows you as you advance like that of wind among the trees only harsher and stranger to the ear and when at length you gain the summit out breaks on every hand and with freshened vigour that same unending distant whispering rumble of the ocean for now you are on the top of monterey peninsula and the noise no longer only mounts to you from behind along the beach towards santa cruz but from your right also round by chinatown and pinos lighthouse and from down before you to the mouth of the carmello river the whole woodland is begirt with thundering surges the silence that immediately surrounds you where you stand is not so much broken as it is haunted by this distant circling rumour it sets your senses upon edge you strain your attention you are clearly and unusually conscious of small sounds near at hand you walk listening like an indian hunter and that voice of the pacific is a sort of disquieting company to you in your walk  when once i was in these woods i found it difficult to turn homeward all woods lure a rambler onward but in those of monterey it was the surf that particularly invited me to prolong my walks i would push straight for the shore where i thought it to be nearest indeed there was scarce a direction that would not sooner or later have brought me forth on the pacific the emptiness of the woods gave me a sense of freedom and discovery in these excursions i never in all my visits met but one man he was a mexican very dark of hue but smiling and fat and he carried an axe though his true business at that moment was to seek for straying cattle i asked him what oclock it was but he seemed neither to know nor care and when he in his turn asked me for news of his cattle i showed myself equally indifferent we stood and smiled upon each other for a few seconds and then turned without a word and took our several ways across the forest  one dayi shall never forget iti had taken a trail that was new to me after a while the woods began to open the sea to sound nearer hand i came upon a road and to my surprise a stile a step or two farther and without leaving the woods i found myself among trim houses i walked through street after street parallel and at right angles paved with sward and dotted with trees but still undeniable streets and each with its name posted at the corner as in a real town facing down the main thoroughfarecentral avenue as it was ticketedi saw an openair temple with benches and soundingboard as though for an orchestra the houses were all tightly shuttered there was no smoke no sound but of the waves no moving thing i have never been in any place that seemed so dreamlike pompeii is all in a bustle with visitors and its antiquity and strangeness deceive the imagination but this town had plainly not been built above a year or two and perhaps had been deserted overnight indeed it was not so much like a deserted town as like a scene upon the stage by daylight and with no one on the boards the barking of a dog led me at last to the only house still occupied where a scots pastor and his wife pass the winter alone in this empty theatre the place was the pacific camp grounds the christian seaside resort thither in the warm season crowds come to enjoy a life of teetotalism religion and flirtation which i am willing to think blameless and agreeable the neighbourhood at least is well selected the pacific booms in front westward is point pinos with the lighthouse in a wilderness of sand where you will find the lightkeeper playing the piano making models and bows and arrows studying dawn and sunrise in amateur oilpainting and with a dozen other elegant pursuits and interests to surprise his brave oldcountry rivals to the east and still nearer you will come upon a space of open down a hamlet a haven among rocks a world of surge and screaming seagulls such scenes are very similar in different climates they appear homely to the eyes of all to me this was like a dozen spots in scotland and yet the boats that ride in the haven are of strange outlandish design and if you walk into the hamlet you will behold costumes and faces and hear a tongue that are unfamiliar to the memory the jossstick burns the opiumpipe is smoked the floors are strewn with slips of coloured paperprayers you would say that had somehow missed their destinationand a man guiding his upright pencil from right to left across the sheet writes home the news of monterey to the celestial empire  the woods and the pacific rule between them the climate of this seaboard region on the streets of monterey when the air does not smell salt from the one it will be blowing perfumed from the resinous treetops of the other for days together a hot dry air will overhang the town close as from an oven yet healthful and aromatic in the nostrils the cause is not far to seek for the woods are afire and the hot wind is blowing from the hills these fires are one of the great dangers of california i have seen from monterey as many as three at the same time by day a cloud of smoke by night a red coal of conflagration in the distance a little thing will start them and if the wind be favourable they gallop over miles of country faster than a horse the inhabitants must turn out and work like demons for it is not only the pleasant groves that are destroyed the climate and the soil are equally at stake and these fires prevent the rains of the next winter and dry up perennial fountains california has been a land of promise in its time like palestine but if the woods continue so swiftly to perish it may become like palestine a land of desolation  to visit the woods while they are languidly burning is a strange piece of experience the fire passes through the underbrush at a run every here and there a tree flares up instantaneously from root to summit scattering tufts of flame and is quenched it seems as quickly but this last is only in semblance for after this first squiblike conflagration of the dry moss and twigs there remains behind a deeprooted and consuming fire in the very entrails of the tree the resin of the pitchpine is principally condensed at the base of the bole and in the spreading roots thus after the light showy skirmishing flames which are only as the match to the explosion have already scampered down the wind into the distance the true harm is but beginning for this giant of the woods you may approach the tree from one side and see it scorched indeed from top to bottom but apparently survivor of the peril make the circuit and there on the other side of the column is a clear mass of living coal spreading like an ulcer while underground to their most extended fibre the roots are being eaten out by fire and the smoke is rising through the fissures to the surface a little while and without a nod of warning the huge pinetree snaps off short across the ground and falls prostrate with a crash meanwhile the fire continues its silent business the roots are reduced to a fine ash and long afterwards if you pass by you will find the earth pierced with radiating galleries and preserving the design of all these subterranean spurs as though it were the mould for a new tree instead of the print of an old one these pitchpines of monterey are with the single exception of the monterey cypress the most fantastic of forest trees no words can give an idea of the contortion of their growth they might figure without change in a circle of the nether hell as dante pictured it and at the rate at which trees grow and at which forest fires spring up and gallop through the hills of california we may look forward to a time when there will not be one of them left standing in that land of their nativity at least they have not so much to fear from the axe but perish by what may be called a natural although a violent death while it is man in his shortsighted greed that robs the country of the nobler redwood yet a little while and perhaps all the hills of seaboard california may be as bald as tamalpais  i have an interest of my own in these forest fires for i came so near to lynching on one occasion that a braver man might have retained a thrill from the experience i wished to be certain whether it was the moss that quaint funereal ornament of californian forests which blazed up so rapidly when the flame first touched the tree i suppose i must have been under the influence of satan for instead of plucking off a piece for my experiment what should i do but walk up to a great pine tree in a portion of the wood which had escaped so much as scorching strike a match and apply the flame gingerly to one of the tassels the tree went off simply like a rocket in three seconds it was a roaring pillar of fire close by i could hear the shouts of those who were at work combating the original conflagration i could see the waggon that had brought them tied to a live oak in a piece of open i could even catch the flash of an axe as it swung up through the underwood into the sunlight had any one observed the result of my experiment my neck was literally not worth a pinch of snuff after a few minutes of passionate expostulation i should have been run up to a convenient bough               to die for faction is a common evil               but to be hanged for nonsense is the devil  i have run repeatedly but never as i ran that day at night i went out of town and there was my own particular fire quite distinct from the other and burning as i thought with even greater vigour  but it is the pacific that exercises the most direct and obvious power upon the climate at sunset for months together vast wet melancholy fogs arise and come shoreward from the ocean from the hilltop above monterey the scene is often noble although it is always sad the upper air is still bright with sunlight a glow still rests upon the gabelano peak but the fogs are in possession of the lower levels they crawl in scarves among the sandhills they float a little higher in clouds of a gigantic size and often of a wild configuration to the south where they have struck the seaward shoulder of the mountains of santa lucia they double back and spire up skyward like smoke where their shadow touches colour dies out of the world the air grows chill and deadly as they advance the tradewind freshens the trees begin to sigh and all the windmills in monterey are whirling and creaking and filling their cisterns with the brackish water of the sands it takes but a little while till the invasion is complete the sea in its lighter order has submerged the earth monterey is curtained in for the night in thick wet salt and frigid clouds so to remain till day returns and before the suns rays they slowly disperse and retreat in broken squadrons to the bosom of the sea and yet often when the fog is thickest and most chill a few steps out of the town and up the slope the night will be dry and warm and full of inland perfume                                   monterey                      mexicans americans and indians  the history of monterey has yet to be written founded by catholic missionaries a place of wise beneficence to indians a place of arms a mexican capital continually wrested by one faction from another an american capital when the first house of representatives held its deliberations and then falling lower and lower from the capital of the state to the capital of a county and from that again by the loss of its charter and town lands to a mere bankrupt village its rise and decline is typical of that of all mexican institutions and even mexican families in california  nothing is stranger in that strange state than the rapidity with which the soil has changed hands the mexicans you may say are all poor and landless like their former capital and yet both it and they hold themselves apart and preserve their ancient customs and something of their ancient air  the town when i was there was a place of two or three streets economically paved with seasand and two or three lanes which were watercourses in the rainy season and at all times were rent up by fissures four or five feet deep there were no street lights short sections of wooden sidewalk only added to the dangers of the night for they were often high above the level of the roadway and no one could tell where they would be likely to begin or end the houses were for the most part built of unbaked adobe brick many of them old for so new a country some of very elegant proportions with low spacious shapely rooms and walls so thick that the heat of summer never dried them to the heart at the approach of the rainy season a deathly chill and a graveyard smell began to hang about the lower floors and diseases of the chest are common and fatal among housekeeping people of either sex  there was no activity but in and around the saloons where people sat almost all day long playing cards the smallest excursion was made on horseback you would scarcely ever see the main street without a horse or two tied to posts and making a fine figure with their mexican housings it struck me oddly to come across some of the cornhill illustrations to mr blackmores erema and see all the characters astride on english saddles as a matter of fact an english saddle is a rarity even in san francisco and you may say a thing unknown in all the rest of california in a place so exclusively mexican as monterey you saw not only mexican saddles but true vaquero ridingmen always at the handgallop up hill and down dale and round the sharpest corner urging their horses with cries and gesticulations and cruel rotatory spurs checking them dead with a touch or wheeling them rightaboutface in a square yard the type of face and character of bearing are surprisingly unamerican the first ranged from something like the pure spanish to something in its sad fixity not unlike the pure indian although i do not suppose there was one pure blood of either race in all the country as for the second it was a matter of perpetual surprise to find in that world of absolutely mannerless americans a people full of deportment solemnly courteous and doing all things with grace and decorum in dress they ran to colour and bright sashes not even the most americanised could always resist the temptation to stick a red rose into his hatband not even the most americanised would descend to wear the vile dresshat of civilisation spanish was the language of the streets it was difficult to get along without a word or two of that language for an occasion the only communications in which the population joined were with a view to amusement a weekly public ball took place with great etiquette in addition to the numerous fandangoes in private houses there was a really fair amateur brass band night after night serenaders would be going about the street sometimes in a company and with several instruments and voices together sometimes severally each guitar before a different window it was a strange thing to lie awake in nineteenthcentury america and hear the guitar accompany and one of these old heartbreaking spanish lovesongs mount into the night air perhaps in a deep baritone perhaps in that highpitched pathetic womanish alto which is so common among mexican men and which strikes on the unaccustomed ear as something not entirely human but altogether sad  the town then was essentially and wholly mexican and yet almost all the land in the neighbourhood was held by americans and it was from the same class numerically so small that the principal officials were selected this mexican and that mexican would describe to you his old family estates not one rood of which remained to him you would ask him how that came about and elicit some tangled story backforemost from which you gathered that the americans had been greedy like designing men and the mexicans greedy like children but no other certain fact their merits and their faults contributed alike to the ruin of the former landholders it is true they were improvident and easily dazzled with the sight of ready money but they were gentlefolk besides and that in a way which curiously unfitted them to combat yankee craft suppose they have a paper to sign they would think it a reflection on the other party to examine the terms with any great minuteness nay suppose them to observe some doubtful clause it is ten to one they would refuse from delicacy to object to it i know i am speaking within the mark for i have seen such a case occur and the mexican in spite of the advice of his lawyer has signed the imperfect paper like a lamb to have spoken in the matter he said above all to have let the other party guess that he had seen a lawyer would have been like doubting his word the scruple sounds oddly to one of ourselves who have been brought up to understand all business as a competition in fraud and honesty itself to be a virtue which regards the carrying out but not the creation of agreements this single unworldly trait will account for much of that revolution of which we are speaking the mexicans have the name of being great swindlers but certainly the accusation cuts both ways in a contest of this sort the entire booty would scarcely have passed into the hands of the more scrupulous race  physically the americans have triumphed but it is not entirely seen how far they have themselves been morally conquered this is of course but a part of a part of an extraordinary problem now in the course of being solved in the various states of the american union i am reminded of an anecdote some years ago at a great sale of wine all the odd lots were purchased by a grocer in a small way in the old town of edinburgh the agent had the curiosity to visit him some time after and inquire what possible use he could have for such material he was shown by way of answer a huge vat where all the liquors from humble gladstone to imperial tokay were fermenting together and what he asked do you propose to call this im no very sure replied the grocer but i think its going to turn out port in the older eastern states i think we may say that this hotchpotch of races is going to turn out english or thereabout but the problem is the territorial belt and in the group of states on the pacific coast above all in these last we may look to see some singular hybridwhether good or evil who shall forecast but certainly original and all their own in my little restaurant at monterey we have sat down to table day after day a frenchman two portuguese an italian a mexican and a scotsman we had for common visitors an american from illinois a nearly pureblood indian woman and a naturalised chinese and from time to time a switzer and a german came down from country ranches for the night no wonder that the pacific coast is a foreign land to visitors from the eastern states for each race contributes something of its own even the despised chinese have taught the youth of california none indeed of their virtues but the debasing use of opium and chief among these influences is that of the mexicans  the mexicans although in the state are out of it they still preserve a sort of international independence and keep their affairs snug to themselves only four or five years ago vasquez the bandit his troops being dispersed and the hunt too hot for him in other parts of california returned to his native monterey and was seen publicly in her streets and saloons fearing no man the year that i was there there occurred two reputed murders as the montereyans are exceptionally vile speakers of each other and of every one behind his back it is not possible for me to judge how much truth there may have been in these reports but in the one case every one believed and in the other some suspected that there had been foul play and nobody dreamed for an instant of taking the authorities into their counsel now this is of course characteristic enough of the mexicans but it is a noteworthy feature that all the americans in monterey acquiesced without a word in this inaction even when i spoke to them upon the subject they seemed not to understand my surprise they had forgotten the traditions of their own race and upbringing and become in a word wholly mexicanised  again the mexicans having no ready money to speak of rely almost entirely in their business transactions upon each others worthless paper pedro the penniless pays you with an i o u from the equally penniless miguel it is a sort of local currency by courtesy credit in these parts has passed into a superstition i have seen a strong violent man struggling for months to recover a debt and getting nothing but an exchange of waste paper the very storekeepers are averse to asking for cash payments and are more surprised than pleased when they are offered they fear there must be something under it and that you mean to withdraw your custom from them i have seen the enterprising chemist and stationer begging me with fervour to let my account run on although i had my purse open in my hand and partly from the commonness of the case partly from some remains of that generous old mexican tradition which made all men welcome to their tables a person may be notoriously both unwilling and unable to pay and still find credit for the necessaries of life in the stores of monterey now this villainous habit of living upon tick has grown into californian nature i do not mean that the american and european storekeepers of monterey are as lax as mexicans i mean that american farmers in many parts of the state expect unlimited credit and profit by it in the meanwhile without a thought for consequences jew storekeepers have already learned the advantage to be gained from this they lead on the farmer into irretrievable indebtedness and keep him ever after as their bondslave hopelessly grinding in the mill so the whirligig of time brings in its revenges and except that the jew knows better than to foreclose you may see americans bound in the same chains with which they themselves had formerly bound the mexican it seems as if certain sorts of follies like certain sorts of grain were natural to the soil rather than to the race that holds and tills it for the moment  in the meantime however the americans rule in monterey county the new county seat salinas city in the bald cornbearing plain under the gabelano peak is a town of a purely american character the land is held for the most part in those enormous tracts which are another legacy of mexican days and form the present chief danger and disgrace of california and the holders are mostly of american or british birth we have here in england no idea of the troubles and inconveniences which flow from the existence of these large landholderslandthieves landsharks or landgrabbers they are more commonly and plainly called thus the townlands of monterey are all in the hands of a single man how they came there is an obscure vexatious question and rightly or wrongly the man is hated with a great hatred his life has been repeatedly in danger not very long ago i was told the stage was stopped and examined three evenings in succession by disguised horsemen thirsting for his blood a certain house on the salinas road they say he always passes in his buggy at full speed for the squatter sent him warning long ago but a year since he was publicly pointed out for death by no less a man than mr dennis kearney kearney is a man too well known in california but a word of explanation is required for english readers originally an irish drayman he rose by his command of bad language to almost dictatorial authority in the state throned it there for six months or so his mouth full of oaths gallowses and conflagrations was first snuffed out last winter by mr coleman backed by his san francisco vigilantes and three gatling guns completed his own ruin by throwing in his lot with the grotesque greenbacker party and had at last to be rescued by his old enemies the police out of the hands of his rebellious followers it was while he was at the top of his fortune that kearney visited monterey with his battlecry against chinese labour the railroad monopolists and the landthieves and his one articulate counsel to the montereyans was to hang david jacks had the town been american in my private opinion this would have been done years ago land is a subject on which there is no jesting in the west and i have seen my friend the lawyer drive out of monterey to adjust a competition of titles with the face of a captain going into battle and his smithandwesson convenient to his hand  on the ranche of another of these landholders you may find our old friend the truck system in full operation men live there year in year out to cut timber for a nominal wage which is all consumed in supplies the longer they remain in this desirable service the deeper they will fall in debta burlesque injustice in a new country where labour should be precious and one of those typical instances which explains the prevailing discontent and the success of the demagogue kearney  in a comparison between what was and what is in california the praisers of times past will fix upon the indians of carmel the valley drained by the river so named is a true californian valley bare dotted with chaparal overlooked by quaint unfinished hills the carmel runs by many pleasant farms a clear and shallow river loved by wading kine and at last as it is falling towards a quicksand and the great pacific passes a ruined mission on a hill from the mission church the eye embraces a great field of ocean and the ear is filled with a continuous sound of distant breakers on the shore but the day of the jesuit has gone by the day of the yankee has succeeded and there is no one left to care for the converted savage the church is roofless and ruinous seabreezes and seafogs and the alternation of the rain and sunshine daily widening the breaches and casting the crockets from the wall as an antiquity in this new land a quaint specimen of missionary architecture and a memorial of good deeds it had a triple claim to preservation from all thinking people but neglect and abuse have been its portion there is no sign of american interference save where a headboard has been torn from a grave to be a mark for pistol bullets so it is with the indians for whom it was erected their lands i was told are being yearly encroached upon by the neighbouring american proprietor and with that exception no man troubles his head for the indians of carmel only one day in the year the day before our guy fawkes the padre drives over the hill from monterey the little sacristy which is the only covered portion of the church is filled with seats and decorated for the service the indians troop together their bright dresses contrasting with their dark and melancholy faces and there among a crowd of somewhat unsympathetic holidaymakers you may hear god served with perhaps more touching circumstances than in any other temple under heaven an indian stoneblind and about eighty years of age conducts the singing other indians compose the choir yet they have the gregorian music at their finger ends and pronounce the latin so correctly that i could follow the meaning as they sang the pronunciation was odd and nasal the singing hurried and staccato in sÃ¦cula sÃ¦culohohorum they went with a vigorous aspirate to every additional syllable i have never seen faces more vividly lit up with joy than the faces of these indian singers it was to them not only the worship of god nor an act by which they recalled and commemorated better days but was besides an exercise of culture where all they knew of art and letters was united and expressed and it made a mans heart sorry for the good fathers of yore who had taught them to dig and to reap to read and to sing who had given them european massbooks which they still preserve and study in their cottages and who had now passed away from all authority and influence in that landto be succeeded by greedy landthieves and sacrilegious pistolshots so ugly a thing may our anglosaxon protestantism appear beside the doings of the society of jesus  but revolution in this world succeeds to revolution all that i say in this paper is in a paulopast tense the monterey of last year2 exists no longer a huge hotel has sprung up in the desert by the railway three sets of diners sit down successively to table invaluable toilettes figure along the beach and between the live oaks and monterey is advertised in the newspapers and posted in the waitingrooms at railway stations as a resort for wealth and fashion alas for the little town it is not strong enough to resist the influence of the flaunting caravanserai and the poor quaint penniless native gentlemen of monterey must perish like a lower race before the millionaire vulgarians of the big bonanza   footnote    2 1879                                        ii                               san francisco   the pacific coast of the united states as you may see by the map and still better in that admirable book two years before the mast by dana is one of the most exposed and shelterless on earth the tradewind blows fresh the huge pacific swell booms along degree after degree of an unbroken line of coast south of the joint firth of the columbia and williamette there flows in no considerable river south of puget sound there is no protected inlet of the ocean along the whole seaboard of california there are but two unexceptionable anchoragesthe bight of the bay of monterey and the inland sea that takes its name from san francisco  whether or not it was here that drake put in in 1597 we cannot tell there is no other place so suitable and yet the narrative of francis pretty scarcely seems to suit the features of the scene viewed from seaward the golden gates should give no very english impression to justify the name of a new albion on the west the deep lies open nothing near but the still vexed farallones the coast is rough and barren tamalpais a mountain of a memorable figure springing direct from the sealevel overplumbs the narrow entrance from the north on the south the loud music of the pacific sounds along beaches and cliffs and among broken reefs the sportingplace of the sealion dismal shifting sandhills wrinkled by the wind appear behind perhaps too in the days of drake tamalpais would be clothed to its peak with the majestic redwoods  within the memory of persons not yet old a mariner might have steered into these narrowsnot yet the golden gatesopened out the surface of the bayhere girt with hills there lying broad to the horizonand beheld a scene as empty of the presence as pure from the handiwork of man as in the days of our old seacommander a spanish mission fort and church took the place of those houses of the people of the country which were seen by pretty close to the waterside all else would be unchanged now a generation later a great city covers the sandhills on the west a growing town lies along the muddy shallows of the east steamboats pant continually between them from before sunrise till the small hours of the morning lines of great seagoing ships lie ranged at anchor colours fly upon the islands and from all around the hum of corporate life of beaten bells and steam and running carriages goes cheerily abroad in the sunshine choose a place on one of the huge throbbing ferryboats and when you are midway between the city and the suburb look around the air is fresh and salt as if you were at sea on the one hand is oakland gleaming white among its gardens on the other to seaward hill after hill is crowded and crowned with the palaces of san francisco its long streets lie in regular bars of darkness east and west across the sparkling picture a forest of masts bristles like bulrushes about its feet nothing remains of the days of drake but the faithful tradewind scattering the smoke the fogs that will begin to muster about sundown and the fine bulk of tamalpais looking down on san francisco like arthurs seat on edinburgh  thus in the course of a generation only this city and its suburb have arisen men are alive by the score who have hunted all over the foundations in a dreary waste i have dined near the punctual centre of san francisco with a gentleman then newly married who told me of his former pleasures wading with his fowlingpiece in sand and scrub on the site of the house where we were dining in this busy moving generation we have all known cities to cover our boyish playgrounds we have all started for a country walk and stumbled on a new suburb but i wonder what enchantment of the arabian nights can have equalled this evocation of a roaring city in a few years of a mans life from the marshes and the blowing sand such swiftness of increase as with an overgrown youth suggests a corresponding swiftness of destruction the sandy peninsula of san francisco mirroring itself on one side in the bay beaten on the other by the surge of the pacific and shaken to the heart by frequent earthquakes seems in itself no very durable foundation according to indian tales perhaps older than the name of california it once rose out of the sea in a moment and sometime or other shall in a moment sink again no indian they say cares to linger on that doubtful land the earth hath bubbles as the water has and this is of them here indeed all is new nature as well as towns the very hills of california have an unfinished look the rains and the streams have not yet carved them to their perfect shape the forests spring like mushrooms from the unexhausted soil and they are mown down yearly by the forest fires we are in early geological epochs changeful and insecure and we feel as with a sculptors model that the author may yet grow weary of and shatter the rough sketch  fancy apart san francisco is a city beleaguered with alarms the lower parts along the bay side sit on piles old wrecks decaying fish dwelling unsunned beneath the populous houses and a trifling subsidence might drown the business quarters in an hour earthquakes are not only common they are sometimes threatening in their violence the fear of them grows yearly on a resident he begins with indifference ends in sheer panic and no one feels safe in any but a wooden house hence it comes that in that rainless clime the whole city is built of timbera woodyard of unusual extent and complication that fires spring up readily and served by the unwearying tradewind swiftly spread that all over the city there are firesignal boxes that the sound of the bell telling the number of the threatened ward is soon familiar to the ear and that nowhere else in the world is the art of the fireman carried to so nice a point  next perhaps in order of strangeness to the rapidity of its appearance is the mingling of the races that combine to people it the town is essentially not anglosaxon still more essentially not american the yankee and the englishman find themselves alike in a strange country there are none of these touchesnot of nature and i dare scarcely say of artby which the anglosaxon feels himself at home in so great a diversity of lands here on the contrary are airs of marseilles and of pekin the shops along the street are like the consulates of different nations the passersby vary in feature like the slides of a magiclantern for we are here in that city of gold to which adventurers congregated out of all the winds of heaven we are in a land that till the other day was ruled and peopled by the countrymen of cortes and the sea that laves the piers of san francisco is the ocean of the east and of the isles of summer there goes the mexican unmistakable there the blueclad chinaman with his white slippers there the softspoken brown kanaka or perhaps a waif from faraway malaya you hear french german italian spanish and english indifferently you taste the food of all nations in the various restaurants passing from a french prixfixe where every one is french to a roaring german ordinary where every one is german ending perhaps in a cool and silent chinese teahouse for every man for every race and nation that city is a foreign city humming with foreign tongues and customs and yet each and all have made themselves at home the germans have a german theatre and innumerable beergardens the french fall of the bastille is celebrated with squibs and banners and marching patriots as noisily as the american fourth of july the italians have their dear domestic quarter with italian caricatures in the windows chianti and polenta in the taverns the chinese are settled as in china the goods they offer for sale are as foreign as the lettering on the signboard of the shop dried fish from the china seas pale cakes and sweetmeatsthe like perhaps once eaten by badroubadour nuts of unfriendly shape ambiguous outlandish vegetables misshapen lean or bulboustelling of a country where the trees are not as our trees and the very backgarden is a cabinet of curiosities the josshouse is hard by heavy with incense packed with quaint carvings and the paraphernalia of a foreign ceremonial all these you behold crowded together in the narrower arteries of the city cool sunless a little mouldy with the unfamiliar faces at your elbow and the high musical singsong of that alien language in your ears yet the houses are of occidental build the lines of a hundred telegraphs pass thick as a ships rigging overhead a kite hanging among them perhaps or perhaps two one european one chinese in shape and colour mercantile jack the italian fisher the dutch merchant the mexican vaquero go hustling by at the sunny end of the street a thoroughfare roars with european traffic and meanwhile high and clear out breaks perhaps the san francisco firealarm and people pause to count the strokes and in the stations of the double fireservice you know that the electric bells are ringing the traps opening and clapping to and the engine manned and harnessed being whisked into the street before the sound of the alarm has ceased to vibrate on your ear of all romantic places for a boy to loiter in that chinese quarter is the most romantic there on a halfholiday three doors from home he may visit an actual foreign land foreign in people language things and customs the very barber of the arabian nights shall be at work before him shaving heads he shall see aladdin playing on the streets who knows but among those nameless vegetables the fruit of the nosetree itself may be exposed for sale and the interest is heightened with a chill of horror below you hear the cellars are alive with mystery opium dens where the smokers lie one above another shelf above shelf closepacked and grovelling in deadly stupor the seats of unknown vices and cruelties the prisons of unacknowledged slaves and the secret lazarettos of disease  with all this mass of nationalities crime is common there are rough quarters where it is dangerous o nights cellars of public entertainment which the wary pleasureseeker chooses to avoid concealed weapons are unlawful but the law is continually broken one editor was shot dead while i was there another walked the streets accompanied by a bravo his guardian angel i have been quietly eating a dish of oysters in a restaurant where not more than ten minutes after i had left shots were exchanged and took effect and one night about ten oclock i saw a man standing watchfully at a streetcorner with a long smithandwesson glittering in his hand behind his back somebody had done something he should not and was being looked for with a vengeance it is odd too that the seat of the last vigilance committee i know ofa mediÃ¦val vehmgerichtwas none other than the palace hotel the worlds greatest caravanserai served by lifts and lit with electricity where in the great glazed court a band nightly discourses music from a grove of palms so do extremes meet in this city of contrasts extremes of wealth and poverty apathy and excitement the conveniences of civilisation and the red justice of judge lynch  the streets lie straight up and down the hills and straight across at right angles these in sun those in shadow a trenchant pattern of gloom and glare and what with the crisp illumination the seaair singing in your ears the chill and glitter the changing aspects both of things and people the fresh sights at every corner of your walksights of the bay of tamalpais of steep descending streets of the outspread citywhiffs of alien speech sailors singing on shipboard chinese coolies toiling on the shore crowds brawling all day in the street before the stock exchangeone brief impression follows and obliterates another and the city leaves upon the mind no general and stable picture but a profusion of airy and incongruous images of the sea and shore the east and west the summer and the winter  in the better parts of the most interesting city there is apt to be a touch of the commonplace it is in the slums and suburbs that the city dilettante finds his game and there is nothing more characteristic and original than the outlying quarters of san francisco the chinese district is the most famous but it is far from the only truffle in the pie there is many another dingy corner many a young antiquity many a terrain vague with that stamp of quaintness that the city lover seeks and dwells on and the indefinite prolongation of its streets up hill and down dale makes san francisco a place apart the same street in its career visits and unites so many different classes of society here echoing with drays there lying decorously silent between the mansions of bonanza millionaires to founder at last among the drifting sands beside lone mountain cemetery or die out among the sheds and lumber of the north thus you may be struck with a spot set it down for the most romantic of the city and glancing at the nameplate find it is in the same street that you yourself inhabit in another quarter of the town  the great net of straight thoroughfares lying at right angles east and west and north and south over the shoulders of nob hill the hill of palaces must certainly be counted the best part of san francisco it is there that the millionaires are gathered together vying with each other in display from thence looking down over the business wards of the city we can descry a building with a little belfry and that is the stock exchange the heart of san francisco a great pump we might call it continually pumping up the savings of the lower quarters into the pockets of the millionaires upon the hill but these same thoroughfares that enjoy for awhile so elegant a destiny have their lines prolonged into more unpleasant places some meet their fate in the sands some must take a cruise in the illfamed china quarters some run into the sea some perish unwept among pigsties and rubbishheaps  nob hill comes of right in the place of honour but the two other hills of san francisco are more entertaining to explore on both there are a world of old wooden houses snoozing together all forgotten some are of the quaintest design others only romantic by neglect and age some have been almost undermined by new thoroughfares and sit high up on the margin of the sandy cutting only to be reached by stairs some are curiously painted and i have seen one at least with ancient carvings panelled in its wall surely they are not of californian building but far voyagers from round the stormy horn like those who sent for them and dwelt in them at first brought to be the favourites of the wealthy they have sunk into these poor forgotten districts where like old town toasts they keep each other silently in countenance telegraph hill and rincon hill these are the two dozing quarters that i recommend to the city dilettante there stand these forgotten houses enjoying the unbroken sun and quiet there if there were such an author would the san francisco fortunÃ© de boisgobey pitch the first chapter of his mystery but the first is the quainter of the two and commands moreover a noble view as it stands at the turn of the bay its skirts are all waterside and round from north reach to the bay front you can follow doubtful paths from one quaint corner to another everywhere the same tumbledown decay and sloppy progress new things yet unmade old things tottering to their fall everywhere the same outatelbows manynationed loungers at dim irregular grogshops everywhere the same seaair and isleted seaprospect and for a last and more romantic note you have on the one hand tamalpais standing high in the blue air and on the other the tail of that long alignment of threemasted fullrigged deepsea ships that make a forest of spars along the eastern front of san francisco in no other port is such a navy congregated for the coast trade is so trifling and the ocean trade from round the horn so large that the smaller ships are swallowed up and can do nothing to confuse the majestic order of these merchant princes in an age when the shipoftheline is already a thing of the past and we can never again hope to go coasting in a cockboat between the wooden walls of a squadron at anchor there is perhaps no place on earth where the power and beauty of sea architecture can be so perfectly enjoyed as in this bay                             the silverado squatters                        vixerunt nonnulli in agris delectati re sua                         familiari his idem

      the silverado squatters   the scene of this little book is on a high mountain there are indeed many higher there are many of a nobler outline it is no place of pilgrimage for the summary globe trotter but to one who lives upon its sides mount saint helena soon becomes a centre of interest it is the mont blanc of one section of the californian coast range none of its near neighbours rising to onehalf its altitude it looks down on much green intricate country it feeds in the springtime many splashing brooks from its summit you must have an excellent lesson of geography seeing to the south san francisco bay with tamalpais on the one hand and monte diablo on the other to the west and thirty miles away the open ocean eastward across the cornlands and thick tule swamps of sacramento valley to where the central pacific railroad begins to climb the sides of the sierras and northward for what i know the white head of shasta looking down on oregon three counties napa county lake county and sonoma county march across its cliffy shoulders its naked peak stands nearly four thousand five hundred feet above the sea its sides are fringed with forest and the soil where it is bare glows warm with cinnabar  life in its shadow goes rustically forward bucks and bears and rattlesnakes and former mining operations are the staple of mens talk agriculture has only begun to mount above the valley and though in a few years from now the whole district may be smiling with farms passing trains shaking the mountain to the heart manywindowed hotels lighting up the night like factories and a prosperous city occupying the site of sleepy calistoga yet in the meantime around the foot of that mountain the silence of nature reigns in a great measure unbroken and the people of hill and valley go sauntering about their business as in the days before the flood  to reach mount saint helena from san francisco the traveller has twice to cross the bay once by the busy oakland ferry and again after an hour or so of the railway from vallejo junction to vallejo thence he takes rail once more to mount the long green strath of napa valley  in all the contractions and expansions of that inland sea the bay of san francisco there can be few drearier scenes than the vallejo ferry bald shores and a low bald islet enclose the sea through the narrows the tide bubbles muddy like a river when we made the passage bound although yet we knew it not for silverado the steamer jumped and the black buoys were dancing in the jabble the ocean breeze blew killing chill and although the upper sky was still unflecked with vapour the seafogs were pouring in from seaward over the hilltops of marin county in one great shapeless silver cloud  south vallejo is typical of many californian towns it was a blunder the site has proved untenable and although it is still such a young place by the scale of europe it has already begun to be deserted for its neighbour and namesake north vallejo a long pier a number of drinkingsaloons a hotel of a great size marshy pools where the frogs keep up their croaking and even at high noon the entire absence of any human face or voicethese are the marks of south vallejo yet there was a tall building beside the pier labelled the star flour mills and seagoing fullrigged ships lay close alongshore waiting for their cargo soon these would be plunging round the horn soon the flour from the star flour mills would be landed on the wharves of liverpool for that too is one of englands outposts thither to this gaunt mill across the atlantic and pacific deeps and round about the icy horn this crowd of great threemasted deepsea ships come bringing nothing and return with bread  the frisby house for that was the name of the hotel was a place of fallen fortunes like the town it was now given up to labourers and partly ruinous at dinner there was the ordinary display of what is called in the west a twobit house the tablecloth checked red and white the plague of flies the wire hencoops over the dishes the great variety and invariable vileness of the food and the rough coatless men devouring it in silence in our bedroom the stove would not burn though it would smoke and while one window would not open the other would not shut there was a view on a bit of empty road a few dark houses a donkey wandering with its shadow on a slope and a blink of sea with a tall ship lying anchored in the moonlight all about that dreary inn frogs sang their ungainly chorus  early the next morning we mounted the hill along a wooden footway bridging one marish spot after another here and there as we ascended we passed a house embowered in white roses more of the bay became apparent and soon the blue peak of tamalpais rose above the green level of the island opposite it told us we were still but a little way from the city of the golden gates already at that hour beginning to awake among the sandhills it called to us over the waters as with the voice of a bird its stately head blue as a sapphire on the paler azure of the sky spoke to us of wider outlooks and the bright pacific for tamalpais stands sentry like a lighthouse over the golden gates between the bay and the open ocean and looks down indifferently on both even as we saw and hailed it from vallejo seamen far out at sea were scanning it with shaded eyes and as if to answer to the thought one of the great ships below began silently to clothe herself with white sails homeward bound for england  for some way beyond vallejo the railway led us through bald green pastures on the west the rough highlands of marin shut off the ocean in the midst in long straggling gleaming arms the bay died out among the grass there were few trees and few enclosures the sun shone wide over open uplands the displumed hills stood clear against the sky but byandby these hills began to draw nearer on either hand and first thicket and then wood began to clothe their sides and soon we were away from all signs of the seas neighbourhood mounting an inland irrigated valley a great variety of oaks stood now severally now in a becoming grove among the fields and vineyards the towns were compact in about equal proportions of bright new wooden houses and great and growing forest trees and the chapel bell on the engine sounded most festally that sunny sunday as we drew up at one green town after another with the townsfolk trooping in their sundays best to see the strangers with the sun sparkling on the clean houses and great domes of foliage humming overhead in the breeze  this pleasant napa valley is at its north end blockaded by our mountain there at calistoga the railroad ceases and the traveller who intends faring farther to the geysers or to the springs in lake county must cross the spurs of the mountain by stage thus mount saint helena is not only a summit but a frontier and up to the time of writing it has stayed the progress of the iron horse                                   in the valley                                         i                                  calistoga   it is difficult for a european to imagine calistoga the whole place is so new and of such an occidental pattern the very name i hear was invented at a supperparty by the man who found the springs  the railroad and the highway come up the valley about parallel to one another the street of calistoga joins them perpendicular to botha wide street with bright clean low houses here and there a veranda over the sidewalk here and there a horsepost here and there lounging townsfolk other streets are marked out and most likely named for these towns in the new world begin with a firm resolve to grow larger washington and broadway and then first and second and so forth being boldly plotted out as soon as the community indulges in a plan but in the meanwhile all the life and most of the houses of calistoga are concentrated upon that street between the railway station and the road i never heard it called by any name but i will hazard a guess that it is either washington or broadway here are the blacksmiths the chemists the general merchants and kong sam kee the chinese laundrymans here probably is the office of the local paper for the place has a paperthey all have papers and here certainly is one of the hotels cheeseboroughs whence the daring foss a man dear to legend starts his horses for the geysers  it must be remembered that we are here in a land of stagedrivers and highwaymen a land in that sense like england a hundred years ago the highway robberroadagent he is quaintly calledis still busy in these parts the fame of vasquez is still young only a few years ago the lakeport stage was robbed a mile or two from calistoga in 1879 the dentist of mendocino city fifty miles away upon the coast suddenly threw off the garments of his trade like grindoff in the miller and his men and flamed forth in his second dress as a captain of banditti a great robbery was followed by a long chase a chase of days if not of weeks among the intricate hillcountry and the chase was followed by much desultory fighting in which severaland the dentist i believe amongst the numberbit the dust the grass was springing for the first time nourished upon their blood when i arrived in calistoga i am reminded of another highwayman of that same year he had been unwell so ran his humorous defence and the doctor told him to take something so he took the express box  the cultus of the stagecoachman always flourishes highest where there are thieves on the road and where the guard travels armed and the stage is not only a link between country and city and the vehicle of news but has a faint warfaring aroma like a man who should be brother to a soldier california boasts her famous stagedrivers and among the famous foss is not forgotten along the unfenced abominable mountain roads he launches his team with small regard to human life or the doctrine of probabilities flinching travellers who behold themselves coasting eternity at every corner look with natural admiration at their drivers huge impassive fleshy countenance he has the very face for the driver in sam wellers anecdote who upset the election party at the required point wonderful tales are current of his readiness and skill one in particular of how one of his horses fell at a ticklish passage of the road and how foss let slip the reins and driving over the fallen animal arrived at the next stage with only three this i relate as i heard it without guarantee  i only saw foss once though strange as it may sound i have twice talked with him he lives out of calistoga at a ranche called fossville one evening after he was long gone home i dropped into cheeseboroughs and was asked if i should like to speak with mr foss supposing that the interview was impossible and that i was merely called upon to subscribe the general sentiment i boldly answered yes next moment i had one instrument at my ear another at my mouth and found myself with nothing in the world to say conversing with a man several miles off among desolate hills foss rapidly and somewhat plaintively brought the conversation to an end and he returned to his nights grog at fossville while i strolled forth again on calistoga high street but it was an odd thing that here on what we are accustomed to consider the very skirts of civilisation i should have used the telephone for the first time in my civilised career so it goes in these young countries telephones and telegraphs and newspapers and advertisements running far ahead among the indians and the grizzly bears  alone on the other side of the railway stands the springs hotel with its attendant cottages the floor of the valley is extremely level to the very roots of the hills only here and there a hillock crowned with pines rises like the barrow of some chieftain famed in war and right against one of these hillocks is the springs hotelis or was for since i was there the place has been destroyed by fire and has risen again from its ashes a lawn runs about the house and the lawn is in its turn surrounded by a system of little fiveroomed cottages each with a veranda and a weedy palm before the door some of the cottages are let to residents and these are wreathed in flowers the rest are occupied by ordinary visitors to the hotel and a very pleasant way this is by which you have a little country cottage of your own without domestic burthens and by the day or week  the whole neighbourhood of mount saint helena is full of sulphur and of boiling springs the geysers are famous they were the great health resort of the indians before the coming of the whites lake county is dotted with spas hot springs and white sulphur springs are the names of two stations on the napa valley railroad and calistoga itself seems to repose on a mere film above a boiling subterranean lake at one end of the hotel enclosure are the springs from which it takes its name hot enough to scald a child seriously while i was there at the other end the tenant of a cottage sank a well and there also the water came up boiling it keeps this end of the valley as warm as a toast i have gone across to the hotel a little after five in the morning when a seafog from the pacific was hanging thick and grey and dark and dirty overhead and found the thermometer had been up before me and had already climbed among the nineties and in the stress of the day it was sometimes too hot to move about  but in spite of this heat from above and below doing one on both sides calistoga was a pleasant place to dwell in beautifully green for it was then that favoured moment in the californian year when the rains are over and the dusty summer has not yet set in often visited by fresh airs now from the mountain now across sonoma from the sea very quiet very idle very silent but for the breezes and the cattle bells afield and there was something satisfactory in the sight of that great mountain that enclosed us to the north whether it stood robed in sunshine quaking to its topmost pinnacle with the heat and brightness of the day or whether it set itself to weaving vapours wisp after wisp growing trembling fleeting and fading in the blue  the tangled woody and almost trackless foothills that enclose the valley shutting it off from sonoma on the west and from yolo on the eastrough as they were in outline dug out by winter streams crowned by cliffy bluffs and nodding pinetreeswere dwarfed into satellites by the bulk and bearing of mount saint helena she overtowered them by twothirds of her own stature she excelled them by the boldness of her profile her great bald summit clear of trees and pasture a cairn of quartz and cinnabar rejected kinship with the dark and shaggy wilderness of lesser hilltops                                        ii                           the petrified forest   we drove off from the springs hotel about three in the afternoon the sun warmed me to the heart a broad cool wind streamed pauselessly down the valley laden with perfume up at the top stood mount saint helena a bulk of mountain bare atop with treefringed spurs and radiating warmth once we saw it framed in a grove of tall and exquisitely graceful white oaks in line and colour a finished composition we passed a cow stretched by the roadside her bell slowly beating time to the movement of her ruminating jaws her big red face crawled over by half a dozen flies a monument of content  a little farther and we struck to the left up a mountain road and for two hours threaded one valley after another green tangled full of noble timber giving us every now and again a sight of mount saint helena and the blue hilly distance and crossed by many streams through which we splashed to the carriagestep to the right or the left there was scarce any trace of man but the road we followed i think we passed but one rancheros house in the whole distance and that was closed and smokeless but we had the society of these bright streamsdazzlingly clear as is their wont splashing from the wheels in diamonds and striking a lively coolness through the sunshine and what with the innumerable variety of greens the masses of foliage tossing in the breeze the glimpses of distance the descents into seemingly impenetrable thickets the continual dodging of the road which made haste to plunge again into the covert we had a fine sense of woods and springtime and the open air  our driver gave me a lecture by the way on californian treesa thing i was much in need of having fallen among painters who know the name of nothing and mexicans who know the name of nothing in english he taught me the madrona the manzanita the buckeye the maple he showed me the crested mountain quail he showed me where some young redwoods were already spiring heavenwards from the ruins of the old for in this district all had already perished redwoods and redskins the two noblest indigenous living things alike condemned  at length in a lonely dell we came on a huge wooden gate with a sign upon it like an inn the petrified forest proprietor c evans ran the legend within on a knoll of sward was the house of the proprietor and another smaller house hard by to serve as a museum where photographs and petrifactions were retailed it was a pure little isle of touristry among these solitary hills  the proprietor was a brave old whitefaced swede he had wandered this way heaven knows how and taken up his acresi forget how many years agoall alone bent double with sciatica and with six bits in his pocket and an axe upon his shoulder long useless years of seafaring had thus discharged him at the end penniless and sick without doubt he had tried his luck at the diggings and got no good from that without doubt he had loved the bottle and lived the life of jack ashore but at the end of these adventures here he came and the place hitting his fancy down he sat to make a new life of it far from crimps and the salt sea and the very sight of his ranche had done him good it was the handsomest spot in the californy mountains isnt it handsome now he said every penny he makes goes into that ranche to make it handsomer then the climate with the seabreeze every afternoon in the hottest summer weather had gradually cured the sciatica and his sister and niece were now domesticated with him for companyor rather the niece came only once in the two days teaching music the meanwhile in the valley and then for a last piece of luck the handsomest spot in the californy mountains had produced a petrified forest which mr evans now shows at the modest figure of half a dollar a head or twothirds of his capital when he first came there with an axe and a sciatica  this tardy favourite of fortunehobbling a little i think as if in memory of the sciatica but with not a trace that i can remember of the seathoroughly ruralised from head to foot proceeded to escort us up the hill behind his house  who first found the forest asked my wife  the first i was that man said he i was cleaning up the pasture for my beasts when i found thiskicking a great redwood seven feet in diameter that lay there on its side hollow heart clinging lumps of bark all changed into grey stone with veins of quartz between what had been the layers of the wood  were you surprised  surprised no what would i be surprised about what did i know about petrifactionsfollowing the sea petrifaction there was no such word in my language i knew about putrefaction though i thought it was a stone so would you if you was cleaning up pasture  and now he had a theory of his own which i did not quite grasp except that the trees had not grewed there but he mentioned with evident pride that he differed from all the scientific people who had visited the spot and he flung about such words as tufa and silica with careless freedom  when i mentioned i was from scotland my old country he said my old countrywith a smiling look and a tone of real affection in his voice i was mightily surprised for he was obviously scandinavian and begged him to explain it seemed he had learned his english and done nearly all his sailing in scottish ships out of glasgow said he or greenock but thats all the samethey all hail from glasgow and he was so pleased with me for being a scotsman and his adopted compatriot that he made me a present of a very beautiful piece of petrifactioni believe the most beautiful and portable he had  here was a man at least who was a swede a scot and an american acknowledging some kind allegiance to three lands mr wallaces scotocircassian will not fail to come before the reader i have myself met and spoken with a fifeshire german whose combination of abominable accents struck me dumb but indeed i think we all belong to many countries and perhaps this habit of much travel and the engendering of scattered friendships may prepare the euthanasia of ancient nations  and the forest itself well on a tangled briery hillsidefor the pasture would bear a little further cleaning up to my eyesthere lie scattered thickly various lengths of petrified trunk such as the one already mentioned it is very curious of course and ancient enough if that were all doubtless the heart of the geologist beats quicker at the sight but for my part i was mightily unmoved sightseeing is the art of disappointment                 theres nothing under heaven so blue                 thats fairly worth the travelling to  but fortunately heaven rewards us with many agreeable prospects and adventures by the way and sometimes when we go out to see a petrified forest prepares a far more delightful curiosity in the form of mr evans whom may all prosperity attend throughout a long and green old age                                       iii                                 napa wine   i was interested in californian wine indeed i am interested in all wines and have been all my life from the raisin wine that a schoolfellow kept secreted in his playbox up to my last discovery those notable valtellines that once shone upon the board of cÃ¦sar  some of us kind old pagans watch with dread the shadows falling on the age how the unconquerable worm invades the sunny terraces of france and bordeaux is no more and the rhone a mere arabia petrÃ¦a chÃ¢teau neuf is dead and i have never tasted it hermitagea hermitage indeed from all lifes sorrowslies expiring by the river and in the place of these imperial elixirs beautiful to every sense gemhued flowerscented dreamcompellersbehold upon the quays at cette the chemicals arrayed behold the analyst at marseilles raising hands in obsecration attesting god lyÃ¦us and the vats staved in and the dishonest wines poured forth among the sea it is not pan only bacchus too is dead  if wine is to withdraw its most poetic countenance the sun of the white dinnercloth a deity to be invoked by two or three all fervent hushing their talk degusting tenderly and storing reminiscencesfor a bottle of good wine like a good act shines ever in the retrospectif wine is to desert us go thy ways old jack now we begin to have compunctions and look back at the brave bottles squandered upon dinnerparties where the guests drank grossly discussing politics the while and even the schoolboy took his whack like liquorice water and at the same time we look timidly forward with a spark of hope to where the new lands already weary of producing gold begin to green with vineyards a nice point in human history falls to be decided by californian and australian wines  wine in california is still in the experimental stage and when you taste a vintage grave economical questions are involved the beginning of vineplanting is like the beginning of mining for the precious metals the winegrower also prospects one corner of land after another is tried with one kind of grape after another this is a failure that is better a third best so bit by bit they grope about for their clos vougeot and lafitte those lodes and pockets of earth more precious than the precious ores that yield inimitable fragrance and soft fire those virtuous bonanzas where the soil has sublimated under sun and stars to something finer and the wine is bottled poetry these still lie undiscovered chaparral conceals thicket embowers them the miner chips the rock and wanders farther and the grizzly muses undisturbed but there they bide their hour awaiting their columbus and nature nurses and prepares them the smack of californian earth shall linger on the palate of your grandson  meanwhile the wine is merely a good wine the best that i have tastedbetter than a beaujolais and not unlike but the trade is poor it lives from hand to mouth putting its all into experiments and forced to sell its vintages to find one properly matured and bearing its own name is to be fortunes favourite  bearing its own name i say and dwell upon the inuendo  you want to know why californian wine is not drunk in the states a san francisco wine merchant said to me after he had shown me through his premises well heres the reason  and opening a large cupboard fitted with many little drawers he proceeded to shower me all over with a great variety of gorgeously tinted labels blue red or yellow stamped with crown or coronet and hailing from such a profusion of clos and chÃ¢teaux that a single department could scarce have furnished forth the names but it was strange that all looked unfamiliar  chÃ¢teau x said i i never heard of that  i dare say not said he i had been reading one of xs novels  they were all castles in spain but that sure enough is the reason why california wine is not drunk in the states  napa valley has been long a seat of the winegrowing industry it did not here begin as it does too often in the low valley lands along the river but took at once to the rough foothills where alone it can expect to prosper a basking inclination and stones to be a reservoir of the days heat seem necessary to the soil for wine the grossness of the earth must be evaporated its marrow daily melted and refined for ages until at length these clods that break below our footing and to the eye appear but common earth are truly and to the perceiving mind a masterpiece of nature the dust of richebourg which the wind carries away what an apotheosis of the dust not man himself can seem a stranger child of that brown friable powder than the blood and sun in that old flask behind the fagots  a californian vineyard one of mans outposts in the wilderness has features of its own there is nothing here to remind you of the rhine or rhone of the low cÃ´te dor or the infamous and scabby deserts of champagne but all is green solitary covert we visited two of them mr schrams and mr meckrons sharing the same glen  some way down the valley below calistoga we turned sharply to the south and plunged into the thick of the wood a rude trail rapidly mounting a little stream tinkling by on the one hand big enough perhaps after the rains but already yielding up its life overhead and on all sides a bower of green and tangled thicket still fragrant and still flowerbespangled by the early season where thimbleberry played the part of our english hawthorn and the buckeyes were putting forth their twisted horns of blossom through all this we struggled toughly upwards canted to and fro by the roughness of the trail and continually switched across the face by sprays of leaf or blossom the last is no great inconvenience at home but here in california it is a matter of some moment for in all woods and by every wayside there prospers an abominable shrub or weed called poison oak whose very neighbourhood is venomous to some and whose actual touch is avoided by the most impervious  the two houses with their vineyards stood each in a green niche of its own in this steep and narrow forest dell though they were so near there was already a good difference in level and mr meckrons head must be a long way under the feet of mr schram no more had been cleared than was necessary for cultivation close around each oasis ran the tangled wood the glen enfolds them there they lie basking in sun and silence concealed from all but the clouds and the mountain birds  mr meckrons is a bachelor establishment a little bit of a wooden house a small cellar hard by in the hillside and a patch of vines planted and tended singlehanded by himself he had but recently begun his vines were young his business young also but i thought he had the look of a man who succeeds he hailed from greenock he remembered his father putting him inside mons meg and that touched me home and we exchanged a word or two of scotch which pleased me more than you would fancy  mr schrams on the other hand is the oldest vineyard in the valley eighteen years old i think yet he began a penniless barber and even after he had broken ground up here with his black malvoisies continued for long to tramp the valley with his razor now his place is the picture of prosperity stuffed birds in the veranda cellars far dug into the hillside and resting on pillars like a bandits caveall trimness varnish flowers and sunshine among the tangled wildwood stout smiling mrs schram who has been to europe and apparently all about the states for pleasure entertaining fanny in the veranda while i was tasting wines in the cellar to mr schram this was a solemn office his serious gusto warmed my heart prosperity had not yet wholly banished a certain neophite and girlish trepidation and he followed every sip and read my face with proud anxiety i tasted all i tasted every variety and shade of schramberger red and white schramberger burgundy schramberger schramberger hock schramberger golden chasselas the latter with a notable bouquet and i fear to think how many more much of it goes to londonmost i think and mr schram has a great notion of the english taste  in this wild spot i did not feel the sacredness of ancient cultivation it was still raw it was no marathon and no johannisberg yet the stirring sunlight and the growing vines and the vats and bottles in the cavern made a pleasant music for the mind here also earths cream was being skimmed and garnered and the london customers can taste such as it is the tang of the earth in this green valley so local so quintessential is a wine that it seems the very birds in the veranda might communicate a flavour and that romantic cellar influence the bottle next to be uncorked in pimlico and the smile of jolly mr schram might mantle in the glass  but these are but experiments all things in this new land are moving farther on the winevats and the miners blasting tools but picket for a night like bedouin pavilions and tomorrow to fresh woods this stir of change and these perpetual echoes of the moving footfall haunt the land men move eternally still chasing fortune and fortune found still wander as we drove back to calistoga the road lay empty of mere passengers but its green side was dotted with the camps of travelling families one cumbered with a great waggonful of household stuff settlers going to occupy a ranche they had taken up in mendocino or perhaps tehama county another a party in dustcoats men and women whom we found camped in a grove on the roadside all on pleasure bent with a chinaman to cook for them and who waved their hands to us as we drove by                                        iv                              the scot abroad   a few pages back i wrote that a man belonged in these days to a variety of countries but the old land is still the true love the others are but pleasant infidelities scotland is indefinable it has no unity except upon the map two languages many dialects innumerable forms of piety and countless local patriotisms and prejudices part us among ourselves more widely than the extreme east and west of that great continent of america when i am at home i feel a man from glasgow to be something like a rival a man from barra to be more than half a foreigner yet let us meet in some far country and whether we hail from the braes of manor or the braes of mar some readymade affection joins us on the instant it is not race look at us one is norse one celtic and another saxon it is not community of tongue we have it not among ourselves and we have it almost to perfection with english or irish or american it is no tie of faith for we detest each others errors and yet somewhere deep down in the heart of each one of us something yearns for the old land and the old kindly people  of all mysteries of the human heart this is perhaps the most inscrutable there is no special loveliness in that grey country with its rainy seabeat archipelago its fields of dark mountains its unsightly places black with coal its treeless sour unfriendlylooking cornlands its quaint grey castled city where the bells clash of a sunday and the wind squalls and the salt showers fly and beat i do not even know if i desire to live there but let me hear in some far land a kindred voice sing out oh why left i my hame and it seems at once as if no beauty under the kind heavens and no society of the wise and good can repay me for my absence from my country and though i think i would rather die elsewhere yet in my heart of hearts i long to be buried among good scots clods i will say it fairly it grows on me with every year there are no stars so lovely as edinburgh streetlamps when i forget thee auld reekie may my right hand forget its cunning  the happiest lot on earth is to be born a scotchman you must pay for it in many ways as for all other advantages on earth you have to learn the paraphrases and the shorter catechism you generally take to drink your youth as far as i can find out is a time of louder war against society of more outcry and tears and turmoil than if you had been born for instance in england but somehow life is warmer and closer the hearth burns more redly the lights of home shine softer on the rainy street the very names endeared in verse and music cling nearer round our hearts an englishman may meet an englishman tomorrow upon chimborazo and neither of them care but when the scotch winegrower told me of mons meg it was like magic         from the dim shieling on the misty island           mountains divide us and a world of seas         yet still our hearts are true our hearts are highland           and we in dreams behold the hebrides  and highland and lowland all our hearts are scottish  only a few days after i had seen meckron a message reached me in my cottage it was a scotchman who had come down a long way from the hills to market he had heard there was a countryman in calistoga and came round to the hotel to see him we said a few words to each other we had not much to sayshould never have seen each other had we stayed at home separated alike in space and in society and then we shook hands and he went his way again to his ranche among the hills and that was all  another scotchman there was a resident who for the mere love of the common country douce serious religious man drove me all about the valley and took as much interest in me as if i had been his son more perhaps for the son has faults too keenly felt while the abstract countryman is perfectlike a whiff of peats  and there was yet another upon him i came suddenly as he was calmly entering my cottage his mind quite evidently bent on plunder a man of about fifty filthy ragged roguish with a chimneypot hat and a tail coat and a pursing of his mouth that might have been envied by an elder of the kirk he had just such a face as i have seen a dozen times behind the plate  hullo sir i cried where are you going  he turned round without a quiver  you are a scotchman sir he said gravely so am i i come from aberdeen this is my card presenting me with a piece of pasteboard which he had raked out of some gutter in the period of the rains i was just examining this palm he continued indicating the misbegotten plant before our door which is the largest specimen i have yet observed in califoarnia  there were four or five larger within sight but where was the use of argument he produced a tapeline made me help him to measure the tree at the level of the ground and entered the figures in a large and filthy pocketbook all with the gravity of solomon he then thanked me profusely remarking that such little services were due between countrymen shook hands with me for auld lang syne as he said and took himself solemnly away radiating dirt and humbug as he went  a month or two after this encounter of mine there came a scot to sacramentoperhaps from aberdeen anyway there never was anyone more scottish in this wide world he could sing and dance and drink i presume and he played the pipes with vigour and success all the scotch in sacramento became infatuated with him and spent their spare time and money driving him about in an open cab between drinks while he blew himself scarlet at the pipes this is a very sad story after he had borrowed money from every one he and his pipes suddenly disappeared from sacramento and when i last heard the police were looking for him  i cannot say how this story amused me when i felt myself so thoroughly ripe on both sides to be duped in the same way  it is at least a curious thing to conclude that the races which wander widest jews and scots should be the most clannish in the world but perhaps these two are cause and effect for ye were strangers in the land of egypt                           with the children of israel                                        i                          to introduce mr kelmar   one thing in this new country very particularly strikes a stranger and that is the number of antiquities already there have been many cycles of population succeeding each other and passing away and leaving behind them relics these standing on into changed times strike the imagination as forcibly as any pyramid or feudal tower the towns like the vineyards are experimentally founded they grow great and prosper by passing occasions and when the lode comes to an end and the miners move elsewhere the town remains behind them like palmyra in the desert i suppose there are in no country in the world so many deserted towns as here in california  the whole neighbourhood of mount saint helena now so quiet and sylvan was once alive with mining camps and villages here there would be two thousand souls under canvas there one thousand or fifteen hundred ensconced as if for ever in a town of comfortable houses but the luck had failed the mines petered out and the army of miners had departed and left this quarter of the world to the rattlesnakes and deer and grizzlies and to the slower but steadier advance of husbandry  it was with an eye on one of these deserted places pine flat on the geysers road that we had come first to calistoga there is something singularly enticing in the idea of going rent free into a readymade house and to the british merchant sitting at home at ease it may appear that with such a roof over your head and a spring of clear water hard by the whole problem of the squatters existence would be solved food however has yet to be considered i will go as far as most people on tinned meats some of the brightest moments of my life were passed over tinned mulligatawny in the cabin of a sixteenton schooner stormstayed in portree bay but after suitable experiments i pronounce authoritatively that man cannot live by tins alone fresh meat must be had on an occasion it is true that the great foss driving by along the geysers road woodenfaced but glorified with legend might have been induced to bring us meat but the great foss could hardly bring us milk to take a cow would have involved taking a field of grass and a milkmaid after which it would have been hardly worth while to pause and we might have added to our colony a flock of sheep and an experienced butcher  it is really very disheartening how we depend on other people in this life mihi est propositum as you may see by the motto idem quod regibus and behold it cannot be carried out unless i find a neighbour rolling in cattle  now my principal adviser in this matter was one whom i will call kelmar that was not what he called himself but as soon as i set eyes on him i knew it was or ought to be his name i am sure it will be his name among the angels kelmar was the storekeeper a russian jew goodnatured in a very thriving way of business and on equal terms one of the most serviceable of men he also had something of the expression of a scottish country elder who by some peculiarity should chance to be a hebrew he had a projecting under lip with which he continually smiled or rather smirked mrs kelmar was a singularly kind woman and the oldest son had quite a dark and romantic bearing and might be heard on summer evenings playing sentimental airs on the violin  i had no idea at the time i made his acquaintance what an important person kelmar was but the jew storekeepers of california profiting at once by the needs and habits of the people have made themselves in too many cases the tyrants of the rural population credit is offered is pressed on the new customer and when once he is beyond his depth the tune changes and he is from thenceforth a white slave i believe even from the little i saw that kelmar if he chose to put on the screw could send half the settlers packing in a radius of seven or eight miles round calistoga these are continually paying him but are never suffered to get out of debt he palms dull goods upon them for they dare not refuse to buy he goes and dines with them when he is on an outing and no man is loudlier welcomed he is their family friend the director of their business and to a degree elsewhere unknown in modern days their king  for some reason kelmar always shook his head at the mention of pine flat and for some days i thought he disapproved of the whole scheme and was proportionately sad one fine morning however he met me wreathed in smiles he had found the very place for mesilverado another old mining town right up the mountain rufe hanson the hunter could take care of usfine people the hansons we should be close to the toll house where the lakeport stage called daily it was the best place for my health besides rufe had been consumptive and was now quite a strong man aint it in short the place and all its accompaniments seemed made for us on purpose  he took me to his back door whence as from every point of calistoga mount saint helena could be seen towering in the air there in the nick just where the eastern foothills joined the mountain and she herself began to rise above the zone of forestthere was silverado the name had already pleased me the high station pleased me still more i began to inquire with some eagerness it was but a little while ago that silverado was a great place the minea silver mine of coursehad promised great things there was quite a lively population with several hotels and boardinghouses and kelmar himself had opened a branch store and done extremely wellaint it he said appealing to his wife and she said yes extremely well now there was no one living in the town but rufe the hunter and once more i heard rufes praises by the yard and this time sung in chorus  i could not help perceiving at the time that there was something underneath that no unmixed desire to have us comfortably settled had inspired the kelmars with this flow of words but i was impatient to be gone to be about my kingly project and when we were offered seats in kelmars waggon i accepted on the spot the plan of their next sundays outing took them by good fortune over the border into lake county they would carry us so far drop us at the toll house present us to the hansons and call for us again on monday morning early                                        ii                       first impressions of silverado   we were to leave by six precisely that was solemnly pledged on both sides and a messenger came to us the last thing at night to remind us of the hour but it was eight before we got clear of calistoga kelmar mrs kelmar a friend of theirs whom we named abramina her little daughter my wife myself and stowed away behind us a cluster of ships coffeekettles these last were highly ornamental in the sheen of their bright tin but i could invent no reason for their presence our carriageful reckoned up as near as we could get at it some three hundred years to the six of us four of the six besides were hebrews but i never in all my life was conscious of so strong an atmosphere of holiday no word was spoken but of pleasure and even when we drove in silence nods and smiles went round the party like refreshments  the sun shone out of a cloudless sky close at the zenith rode the belated moon still clearly visible and along one margin even bright the wind blew a gale from the north the trees roared the corn and the deep grass in the valley fled in whitening surges the dust towered into the air along the road and dispersed like the smoke of battle it was clear in our teeth from the first and for all the windings of the road it managed to keep clear in our teeth until the end  for some two miles we rattled through the valley skirting the eastern foothills then we struck off to the right through haughland and presently crossing a dry watercourse entered the toll road or to be more local entered on the grade the road mounts the near shoulder of mount saint helena bound northward into lake county in one place it skirts along the edge of a narrow and deep caÃ±on filled with trees and i was glad indeed not to be driven at this point by the dashing foss kelmar with his unvarying smile jogging to the motion of the trap drove for all the world like a good plain country clergyman at home and i profess i blessed him unawares for his timidity  vineyards and deep meadows islanded and framed with thicket gave place more and more as we ascended to woods of oak and madrona dotted with enormous pines it was these pines as they shot above the lower wood that produced that pencilling of single trees i had so often remarked from the valley thence looking up and from however far each fir stands separate against the sky no bigger than an eyelash and all together lend a quaint fringed aspect to the hills the oak is no baby even the madrona upon these spurs of mount saint helena comes to a fine bulk and ranks with forest trees but the pines look down upon the rest for underwood as mount saint helena among her foothills so these dark giants outtop their fellowvegetables alas if they had left the redwoods the pines in turn would have been dwarfed but the redwoods fallen from their high estate are serving as family bedsteads or yet more humbly as field fences along all napa valley  a rough smack of resin was in the air and a crystal mountain purity it came pouring over these green slopes by the oceanful the woods sang aloud and gave largely of their healthful breath gladness seemed to inhabit these upper zones and we had left indifference behind us in the valley i to the hills will lift mine eyes there are days in a life when thus to climb out of the lowlands seems like scaling heaven  as we continued to ascend the wind fell upon us with increasing strength it was a wonder how the two stout horses managed to pull us up that steep incline and still face the athletic opposition of the wind or how their great eyes were able to endure the dust ten minutes after we went by a tree fell blocking the road and even before us leaves were thickly strewn and boughs had fallen large enough to make the passage difficult but now we were hard by the summit the road crosses the ridge just in the nick that kelmar showed me from below and then without pause plunges down a deep thickly wooded glen on the farther side at the highest point a trail strikes up the main hill to the leftward and that leads to silverado a hundred yards beyond and in a kind of elbow of the glen stands the toll house hotel we came up the one side were caught upon the summit by the whole weight of the wind as it poured over into napa valley and a minute after had drawn up in shelter but all buffeted and breathless at the toll house door  a watertank and stables and a grey house of two stories with gable ends and a veranda are jammed hard against the hillside just where a stream has cut for itself a narrow caÃ±on filled with pines the pines go right up overhead a little more and the stream might have played like a firehose on the toll house roof in front the ground drops as sharply as it rises behind there is just room for the road and a sort of promontory of croquet ground and then you can lean over the edge and look deep below you through the wood i said croquet ground not green for the surface was of brown beaten earth the tollbar itself was the only other note of originality a long beam turning on a post and kept slightly horizontal by a counterweight of stones regularly about sundown this rude barrier was swung like a derrick across the road and made fast i think to a tree upon the farther side  on our arrival there followed a gay scene in the bar i was presented to mr corwin the landlord to mr jennings the engineer who lives there for his health to mr hoddy a most pleasant little gentleman once a member of the ohio legislature again the editor of a local paper and now with undiminished dignity keeping the toll house bar i had a number of drinks and cigars bestowed on me and enjoyed a famous opportunity of seeing kelmar in his glory friendly radiant smiling steadily edging one of the ships kettles on the reluctant corwin corwin plainly aghast resisted gallantly and for that bout victory crowned his arms  at last we set forward for silverado on foot kelmar and his jolly jew girls were full of the sentiment of sunday outings breathed geniality and vagueness and suffered a little vile boy from the hotel to lead them here and there about the woods for three people all so old so bulky in body and belonging to a race so venerable they could not but surprise us by their extreme and almost imbecile youthfulness of spirit they were only going to stay ten minutes at the toll house had they not twenty long miles of road before them on the other side stay to dinner not they put up the horses never let us attach them to the veranda by a wisp of straw rope such as would not have held a persons hat on that blustering day and with all these protestations of hurry they proved irresponsible like children kelmar himself shrewd old russian jew with a smirk that seemed just to have concluded a bargain to its satisfaction intrusted himself and us devoutly to that boy yet the boy was patently fallacious and for that matter a most unsympathetic urchin raised apparently on gingerbread he was bent on his own pleasure nothing else and kelmar followed him to his ruin with the same shrewd smirk if the boy said there was a hole there in the hilla hole pure and simple neither more nor lesskelmar and his jew girls would follow him a hundred yards to look complacently down that hole for two hours we looked for houses and for two hours they followed us smelling trees picking flowers foisting false botany on the unwary had we taken five with that vile lad to head them off on idle divagations for five they would have smiled and stumbled through the woods  however we came forth at length and as by accident upon a lawn sparse planted like an orchard but with forest instead of fruit trees that was the site of silverado mining town a piece of ground was levelled up where kelmars store had been and facing that we saw rufe hansons house still bearing on its front the legend silverado hotel not another sign of habitation silverado town had all been carted from the scene one of the houses was now the schoolhouse far down the road one was gone here one there but all were gone away it was now a sylvan solitude and the silence was unbroken but by the great vague voice of the wind some days before our visit a grizzly bear had been sporting round the hansons chickenhouse  mrs hanson was at home alone we found rufe had been out after a bar had risen late and was now gone it did not clearly appear whither perhaps he had had wind of kelmars coming and was now ensconced among the underwood or watching us from the shoulder of the mountain we hearing there were no houses to be had were for immediately giving up all hopes of silverado but this somehow was not to kelmars fancy he first proposed that we should camp someveres around aint it waving his hand cheerily as though to weave a spell and when that was firmly rejected he decided that we must take up house with the hansons mrs hanson had been from the first flustered subdued and a little pale but from this proposition she recoiled with haggard indignation so did we who would have preferred in a manner of speaking death but kelmar was not to be put by he edged mrs hanson into a corner where for a long time he threatened her with his forefinger like a character in dickens and the poor woman driven to her entrenchments at last remembered with a shriek that there were still some houses at the tunnel  thither we went the jews who should already have been miles into lake county still cheerily accompanying us for about a furlong we followed a good road along the hillside through the forest until suddenly that road widened out and came abruptly to an end a caÃ±on woody below red rocky and naked overhead was here walled across by a dump of rolling stones dangerously steep and from twenty to thirty feet in height a rusty iron chute on wooden legs came flying like a monstrous gargoyle across the parapet it was down this that they poured the precious ore and below here the carts stood to wait their lading and carry it millward down the mountain  the whole caÃ±on was so entirely blocked as if by some rude guerilla fortification that we could only mount by lengths of wooden ladder fixed in the hillside these led us round the farther corner of the dump and when they were at an end we still persevered over loose rubble and wading deep in poison oak till we struck a triangular platform filling up the whole glen and shut in on either hand by bold projections of the mountain only in front the place was open like the proscenium of a theatre and we looked forth into a great realm of air and down upon treetops and hilltops and far and near on wild and varied country the place still stood as on the day it was deserted a line of iron rails with a bifurcation a truck in working order a world of lumber old wood old iron a blacksmiths forge on one side half buried in the leaves of dwarf madronas and on the other an old brown wooden house  fanny and i dashed at the house it consisted of three rooms and was so plastered against the hill that one room was right atop of another that the upper floor was more than twice as large as the lower and that all three apartments must be entered from a different side or level not a windowsash remained the door of the lower room was smashed and one panel hung in splinters we entered that and found a fair amount of rubbish sand and gravel that had been sifted in there by the mountain winds straws sticks and stones a table a barrel a platerack on the wall two homemade bootjacks signs of miners and their boots and a pair of papers pinned on the boarding headed respectively funnel no 1 and funnel no 2 but with the tails torn away the window sashless of course was choked with the green and sweetly smelling foliage of a bay and through a chink in the floor a spray of poison oak had shot up and was handsomely prospering in the interior it was my first care to cut away that poison oak fanny standing by at a respectful distance that was our first improvement by which we took possession  the room immediately above could only be entered by a plank propped against the threshold along which the intruder must foot it gingerly clutching for support to sprays of poison oak the proper product of the country herein was on either hand a triple tier of beds where miners had once lain and the other gable was pierced by a sashless window and a doorless doorway opening on the air of heaven five feet above the ground as for the third room which entered squarely from the ground level but higher up the hill and farther up the caÃ±on it contained only rubbish and the uprights for another triple tier of beds  the whole building was overhung by a bold lionlike red rock poison oak sweet bay trees calycanthus brush and chaparral grew freely but sparsely all about it in front in the strong sunshine the platform lay overstrewn with busy litter as though the labours of the mine might begin again tomorrow in the morning  following back into the caÃ±on among the mass of rotting plant and through the flowering bushes we came to a great crazy staging with a wry windlass on the top and clambering up we could look into an open shaft leading edgeways down into the bowels of the mountain trickling with water and lit by some stray sungleams whence i know not in that quiet place the still faraway tinkle of the waterdrops was loudly audible close by another shaft led edgeways up into the superincumbent shoulder of the hill it lay partly open and sixty or a hundred feet above our head we could see the strata propped apart by solid wooden wedges and a pine halfundermined precariously nodding on the verge here also a rugged horizontal tunnel ran straight into the unsunned bowels of the rock this secure angle in the mountains flank was even on this wild day as still as my ladys chamber but in the tunnel a cold wet draught tempestuously blew nor have i ever known that place otherwise than cold and windy  such was our first prospect of juan silverado i own i had looked for something different a clique of neighbourly houses on a village green we shall say all empty to be sure but swept and varnished a trout stream brawling by great elms or chestnuts humming with bees and nested in by songbirds and the mountains standing round about as at jerusalem here mountain and house and the old tools of industry were all alike rusty and downfalling the hill was here wedged up and there poured forth its bowels in a spout of broken mineral man with his picks and powder and nature with her own great blasting tools of sun and rain labouring together at the ruin of that proud mountain the view up the caÃ±on was a glimpse of devastation dry red minerals sliding together here and there a crag here and there dwarf thicket clinging in the general glissade and over all a broken outline trenching on the blue of heaven downwards indeed from our rock eyrie we beheld the greener side of nature and the bearing of the pine and the sweet smell of bays and nutmegs commended themselves gratefully to our senses one way and another now the die was cast silverado be it  after we had got back to the toll house the jews were not long of striking forward but i observed that one of the hanson lads came down before their departure and returned with a ships kettle happy hansons nor was it until after kelmar was gone if i remember rightly that rufe put in an appearance to arrange the details of our installation  the latter part of the day fanny and i sat in the veranda of the toll house utterly stunned by the uproar of the wind among the trees on the other side of the valley sometimes we would have it it was like a sea but it was not various enough for that and again we thought it like the roar of a cataract but it was too changeful for the cataract and then we would decide speaking in sleepy voices that it could be compared with nothing but itself my mind was entirely preoccupied by the noise i hearkened to it by the hour gapingly hearkened and let my cigarette go out sometimes the wind would make a sally nearer hand and send a shrill whistling crash among the foliage on our side of the glen and sometimes a backdraught would strike into the elbow where we sat and cast the gravel and torn leaves into our faces but for the most part this great streaming gale passed unweariedly by us into napa valley not two hundred yards away visible by the tossing boughs stunningly audible and yet not moving a hair upon our heads so it blew all night long while i was writing up my journal and after we were in bed under a cloudless starset heaven and so it was blowing still next morning when we rose  it was a laughable thought to us what had become of our cheerful wandering hebrews we could not suppose they had reached a destination the meanest boy could lead them miles out of their way to see a gopherhole boys we felt to be their special danger none others were of that exact pitch of cheerful irrelevancy to exercise a kindred sway upon their minds but before the attractions of a boy their most settled resolutions would be wax we thought we could follow in fancy these three aged hebrew truants wandering in and out on hilltop and in thicket a demon boy trotting far ahead their willothewisp conductor and at last about midnight the wind still roaring in the darkness we had a vision of all three on their knees upon a mountaintop around a glowworm                                       iii                                the return   next morning we were up by halfpast five according to agreement and it was ten by the clock before our jew boys returned to pick us up kelmar mrs kelmar and abramina all smiling from ear to ear and full of tales of the hospitality they had found on the other side it had not gone unrewarded for i observed with interest that the ships kettles all but one had been placed three lake county families at least endowed for life with a ships kettle come this was no misspent sunday the absence of the kettles told its own story our jews said nothing about them but on the other hand they said many kind and comely things about the people they had met the two women in particular had been charmed out of themselves by the sight of a young girl surrounded by her admirers all evening it appeared they had been triumphing together in the girls innocent successes and to this natural and unselfish joy they gave expression in language that was beautiful by its simplicity and truth  take them for all in all few people have done my heart more good they seem so thoroughly entitled to happiness and to enjoy it in so large a measure and so free from afterthought almost they persuaded me to be a jew there was indeed a chink of money in their talk they particularly commended people who were well to do he dont careaint it was their highest word of commendation to an individual fate and here i seem to grasp the root of their philosophyit was to be free from care to be free to make these sunday wanderings that they so eagerly pursued after wealth and all this carefulness was to be careless the fine goodhumour of all three seemed to declare they had attained their end yet there was the other side to it and the recipients of kettles perhaps cared greatly  no sooner had they returned than the scene of yesterday began again the horses were not even tied with a straw rope this timeit was not worth while and kelmar disappeared into the bar leaving them under a tree on the other side of the road i had to devote myself i stood under the shadow of that tree for i suppose hard upon an hour and had not the heart to be angry once some one remembered me and brought me out a half a tumblerful of the playful innocuous american cocktail i drank it and lo veins of living fire ran down my leg and then a focus of conflagration remained seated in my stomach not unpleasantly for a quarter of an hour i love these sweet fiery pangs but i will not court them the bulk of the time i spent in repeating as much french poetry as i could remember to the horses who seemed to enjoy it hugely and now it went                        o ma vieille fontgeorges                        oÃ¹ volent les rougesgorges  and again to a more trampling measure                        et tout tremble irun coÃ¯mbre                          santander almodovar                        sitÃ´t quon entend le timbre                          des cymbales de bivar  the redbreasts and the brooks of europe in that dry and songless land brave old names and wars strong cities cymbals and bright armour in that nook of the mountain sacred only to the indian and the bear this is still the strangest thing in all mans travelling that he should carry about with him incongruous memories there is no foreign land it is the traveller only that is foreign and now and again by a flash of recollection lights up the contrasts of the earth  but while i was thus wandering in my fancy great feats had been transacted in the bar corwin the bold had fallen kelmar was again crowned with laurels and the last of the ships kettles had changed hands if i had ever doubted the purity of kelmars motives if i had ever suspected him of a single eye to business in his eternal dallyings now at least when the last kettle was disposed of my suspicions must have been allayed i dare not guess how much more time was wasted nor how often we drove off merely to drive back again and renew interrupted conversations about nothing before the toll house was fairly left behind alas and not a mile down the grade there stands a ranche in a sunny vineyard and here we must all dismount again and enter  only the old lady was at home mrs guele a brown old swiss dame the picture of honesty and with her we drank a bottle of wine and had an agelong conversation which would have been highly delightful if fanny and i had not been faint with hunger the ladies each narrated the story of her marriage our two hebrews with the prettiest combination of sentiment and financial bathos abramina specially endeared herself with every word she was as simple natural and engaging as a kid that should have been brought up to the business of a moneychanger one touch was so resplendently hebraic that i cannot pass it over when her old man wrote home for her from america her old mans family would not entrust her with the money for the passage till she had bound herself by an oathon her knees i think she saidnot to employ it otherwise this had tickled abramina hugely but i think it tickled me fully more  mrs guele told of her homesickness up here in the long winters of her honest countrywoman troubles and alarms upon the journey how in the bank at frankfort she had feared lest the banker after having taken her cheque should deny all knowledge of ita fear i have myself every time i go to a bank and how crossing the lÃ¼neburger heath an old lady witnessing her trouble and finding whither she was bound had given her the blessing of a person eighty years old which would be sure to bring her safely to the states and the first thing i did added mrs guele was to fall downstairs  at length we got out of the house and some of us into the trap whenjudgment of heavenhere came mr guele from his vineyard so another quarter of an hour went by till at length at our earnest pleading we set forth again in earnest fanny and i whitefaced and silent but the jews still smiling the heart fails me there was yet another stoppage and we drove at last into calistoga past two in the afternoon fanny and i having breakfasted at six in the morning eight mortal hours before we were a pallid couple but still the jews were smiling  so ended our excursion with the village usurers and now that it was done we had no more idea of the nature of the business nor of the part we had been playing in it than the child unborn that all the people we had met were the slaves of kelmar though in various degrees of servitude that we ourselves had been sent up the mountain in the interests of none but kelmar that the money we laid out dollar by dollar cent by cent and through the hands of various intermediaries should all hop ultimately into kelmars till these were facts that we only grew to recognise in the course of time and by the accumulation of evidence at length all doubt was quieted when one of the kettleholders confessed stopping his trap in the moonlight a little way out of calistoga he told me in so many words that he dare not show face there with an empty pocket you see i dont mind if it was only five dollars mr stevens he said but i must give mr kelmar something  even now when the whole tyranny is plain to me i cannot find it in my heart to be as angry as perhaps i should be with the hebrew tyrant the whole game of business is beggar my neighbour and though perhaps that game looks uglier when played at such close quarters and on so small a scale it is none the more intrinsically inhumane for that the village usurer is not so sad a feature of humanity and human progress as the millionaire manufacturer fattening on the toil and loss of thousands and yet declaiming from the platform against the greed and dishonesty of landlords if it were fair for cobden to buy up land from owners whom he thought unconscious of its proper value it was fair enough for my russian jew to give credit to his farmers kelmar if he was unconscious of the beam in his own eye was at least silent in the matter of his brothers mote                              the act of squatting   there were four of us squattersmyself and my wife the king and queen of silverado lloyd the crown prince and chuchu the grand duke chuchu a setter crossed with spaniel was the most unsuited for a rough life he had been nurtured tenderly in the society of ladies his heart was large and soft he regarded the sofacushion as a bedrock necessary of existence though about the size of a sheep he loved to sit in ladies laps he never said a bad word in all his blameless days and if he had seen a flute i am sure he could have played upon it by nature it may seem hard to say it of a dog but chuchu was a tame cat  the king and queen the grand duke and a basket of cold provender for immediate use set forth from calistoga in a double buggy the crown prince on horseback led the way like an outrider bags and boxes and a secondhand stove were to follow close upon our heels by hansons team  it was a beautiful still day the sky was one field of azure not a leaf moved not a speck appeared in heaven only from the summit of the mountain one little snowy wisp of cloud after another kept detaching itself like smoke from a volcano and blowing southward in some high stream of air mount saint helena still at her interminable task making the weather like a lapland witch  by noon we had come in sight of the mill a great brown building halfway up the hill big as a factory two stories high and with tanks and ladders along the roof which as a pendicle of silverado mine we held to be an outlying province of our own thither then we went crossing the valley by a grassy trail and there lunched out of the basket sitting in a kind of portico and wondering while we ate at this great bulk of useless building through a chink we could look far down into the interior and see sunbeams floating in the dust and striking on tier after tier of silent rusty machinery it cost six thousand dollars twelve hundred english sovereigns and now here it stands deserted like the temple of a forgotten religion the busy millers toiling somewhere else all the time we were there mill and mill town showed no sign of life that part of the mountain side which is very open and green was tenanted by no living creature but ourselves and the insects and nothing stirred but the cloud manufactory upon the mountain summit it was odd to compare this with the former days when the engine was in full blast the mill palpitating to its strokes and the carts came rattling down from silverado charged with ore  by two we had been landed at the mine the buggy was gone again and we were left to our own reflections and the basket of cold provender until hanson should arrive hot as it was by the sun there was something chill in such a homecoming in that world of wreck and rust splinter and rolling gravel where for so many years no fire had smoked  silverado platform filled the whole width of the caÃ±on above as i have said this was a wild red stony gully in the mountains but below it was a wooded dingle and through this i was told there had gone a path between the mine and the toll houseour natural northwest passage to civilisation i found and followed it clearing my way as i went through fallen branches and dead trees it went straight down that steep caÃ±on till it brought you out abruptly over the roofs of the hotel there was nowhere any break in the descent it almost seemed as if were you to drop a stone down the old iron chute at our platform it would never rest until it hopped upon the toll house shingles signs were not wanting of the ancient greatness of silverado the footpath was well marked and had been well trodden in the old days by thirsty miners and far down buried in foliage deep out of sight of silverado i came on a last outpost of the minea mound of gravel some wreck of wooden aqueduct and the mouth of a tunnel like a treasure grotto in a fairy story a stream of water fed by the invisible leakage from our shaft and dyed red with cinnabar or iron ran trippingly forth out of the bowels of the cave and looking far under the arch i could see something like an iron lantern fastened on the rocky wall it was a promising spot for the imagination no boy could have left it unexplored  the stream thenceforward stole along the bottom of the dingle and made for that dry land a pleasant warbling in the leaves once i suppose it ran splashing down the whole length of the caÃ±on but now its head waters had been tapped by the shaft at silverado and for a great part of its course it wandered sunless among the joints of the mountain no wonder that it should better its pace when it sees far before it daylight whitening in the arch or that it should come trotting forth into the sunlight with a song  the two stages had gone by when i got down and the toll house stood dozing in sun and dust and silence like a place enchanted my mission was after hay for bedding and that i was readily promised but when i mentioned that we were waiting for rufe the people shook their heads rufe was not a regular man anyway it seemed and if he got playing pokerwell poker was too many for rufe i had not yet heard them bracketed together but it seemed a natural conjunction and commended itself swiftly to my fears and as soon as i returned to silverado and had told my story we practically gave hanson up and set ourselves to do what we could find doable in our desertisland state  the lower room had been the assayers office the floor was thick with dÃ©brispart human from the former occupants part natural sifted in by mountain winds in a sea of red dust there swam or floated sticks boards hay straw stones and paper ancient newspapers above allfor the newspaper especially when torn soon becomes an antiquityand bills of the silverado boardinghouse some dated silverado some calistoga mine here is one verbatim and if any one can calculate the scale of charges he has my envious admiration                                   calistoga mine may 3rd 1875        john stanley                 to s chapman cr       to board from april 1st to april 30              25 75                  may 1st to 3rd                       2 00                                                                                                                   27 75  where is john stanley mining now where is s chapman within whose hospitable walls we were to lodge the date was but five years old but in that time the world had changed for silverado like palmyra in the desert it had outlived its people and its purpose we camped like layard amid ruins and these names spoke to us of prehistoric time a bootjack a pair of boots a doghutch and these bills of mr chapmans were the only speaking relics that we disinterred from all that vast silverado rubbishheap but what would i not have given to unearth a letter a pocketbook a diary only a ledger or a roll of names to take me back in a more personal manner to the past it pleases me besides to fancy that stanley or chapman or one of their companions may light upon this chronicle and be struck by the name and read some news of their anterior home coming as it were out of a subsequent epoch of history in that quarter of the world  as we were tumbling the mingled rubbish on the floor kicking it with our feet and groping for these written evidences of the past lloyd with a somewhat whitened face produced a paper bag whats this said he it contained a granulated powder something the colour of gregorys mixture but rosier and as there were several of the bags and each more or less broken the powder was spread widely on the floor had any of us ever seen giant powder no nobody had and instantly there grew up in my mind a shadowy belief verging with every moment nearer to certitude that i had somewhere heard somebody describe it as just such a powder as the one around us i have learnt since that it is a substance not unlike tallow and is made up in rolls for all the world like tallow candles  fanny to add to our happiness told us a story of a gentleman who had camped one night like ourselves by a deserted mine he was a handy thrifty fellow and looked right and left for plunder but all he could lay his hands on was a can of oil after dark he had to see to the horses with a lantern and not to miss an opportunity filled up his lamp from the oil can thus equipped he set forth into the forest a little while after his friends heard a loud explosion the mountain echoes bellowed and then all was still on examination the can proved to contain oil with the trifling addition of nitroglycerine but no research disclosed a trace of either man or lantern  it was a pretty sight after this anecdote to see us sweeping out the giant powder it seemed never to be far enough away and after all it was only some rock pounded for assay  so much for the lower room we scraped some of the rougher dirt off the floor and left it that was our sittingroom and kitchen though there was nothing to sit upon but the table and no provision for a fire except a hole in the roof of the room above which had once contained the chimney of a stove  to that upper room we now proceeded there were the eighteen bunks in a double tier nine on either hand where from eighteen to thirtysix miners had once snored together all night long john stanley perhaps snoring loudest there was the roof with a hole in it through which the sun now shot an arrow there was the floor in much the same state as the one below though perhaps there was more hay and certainly there was the added ingredient of broken glass the man who stole the windowframes having apparently made a miscarriage with this one without a broom without hay or bedding we could but look about us with a beginning of despair the one bright arrow of day in that gaunt and shattered barrack made the rest look dirtier and darker and the sight drove us at last into the open  here also the handiwork of man lay ruined but the plants were all alive and thriving the view below was fresh with the colours of nature and we had exchanged a dim human garret for a corner even although it were untidy of the blue hall of heaven not a bird not a beast not a reptile there was no noise in that part of the world save when we passed beside the staging and heard the water musically falling in the shaft  we wandered to and fro we searched among that drift of lumberwood and iron nails and rails and sleepers and the wheels of trucks we gazed up the cleft into the bosom of the mountain we sat by the margin of the dump and saw far below us the green treetops standing still in the clear air beautiful perfumes breaths of bay resin and nutmeg came to us more often and grew sweeter and sharper as the afternoon declined but still there was no word of hanson  i set to with pick and shovel and deepened the pool behind the shaft till we were sure of sufficient water for the morning and by the time i had finished the sun had begun to go down behind the mountain shoulder the platform was plunged in quiet shadow and a chill descended from the sky night began early in our cleft before us over the margin of the dump we could see the sun still striking aslant into the wooded nick below and on the battlemented pinebescattered ridges on the farther side  there was no stove of course and no hearth in our lodging so we betook ourselves to the blacksmiths forge across the platform if the platform be taken as a stage and the outcurving margin of the dump to represent the line of the footlights then our house would be the first wing on the actors left and this blacksmiths forge although no match for it in size the foremost on the right it was a low brown cottage planted close against the hill and overhung by the foliage and peeling boughs of a madrona thicket within it was full of dead leaves and mountain dust and rubbish from the mine but we soon had a good fire brightly blazing and sat close about it on impromptu seats chuchu the slave of sofa cushions whimpered for a softer bed but the rest of us were greatly revived and comforted by that good creaturefire which gives us warmth and light and companionable sounds and colours up the emptiest building with better than frescoes for awhile it was even pleasant in the forge with the blaze in the midst and a look over our shoulders on the woods and mountains where the day was dying like a dolphin  it was between seven and eight before hanson arrived with a waggonful of our effects and two of his wifes relatives to lend him a hand the elder showed surprising strength he would pick up a huge packingcase full of books of all things swing it on his shoulder and away up the two crazy ladders and the breakneck spout of rolling mineral familiarly termed a path that led from the carttrack to our house even for a man unburthened the ascent was toilsome and precarious but irvine scaled it with a light foot carrying box after box as the hero whisks the stage child up the practicable footway beside the waterfall of the fifth act with so strong a helper the business was speedily transacted soon the assayers office was thronged with our belongings piled higgledypiggledy and upside down about the floor there were our boxes indeed but my wife had left her keys in calistoga there was the stove but alas our carriers had forgot the chimney and lost one of the plates along the road the silverado problem was scarce solved  rufe himself was grave and goodnatured over his share of blame he even if i remember right expressed regret but his crew to my astonishment and anger grinned from ear to ear and laughed aloud at our distress they thought it real funny about the stovepipe they had forgotten real funny that they should have lost a plate as for hay the whole party refused to bring us any till they should have supped see how late they were never had there been such a job as coming up that grade nor often i suspect such a game of poker as that before they started but about nine as a particular favour we should have some hay  so they took their departure leaving me still staring and we resigned ourselves to wait for their return the fire in the forge had been suffered to go out and we were one and all too weary to kindle another we dined or not to take that word in vain we ate after a fashion in the nightmare disorder of the assayers office perched among boxes a single candle lighted us it could scarce be called a housewarming for there was of course no fire and with the two open doors and the open window gaping on the night like breaches in a fortress it began to grow rapidly chill talk ceased nobody moved but the unhappy chuchu still in quest of sofacushions who tumbled complainingly among the trunks it required a certain happiness of disposition to look forward hopefully from so dismal a beginning across the brief hours of night to the warm shining of tomorrows sun  but the hay arrived at last and we turned with our last spark of courage to the bedroom we had improved the entrance but it was still a kind of ropewalking and it would have been droll to see us mounting one after another by candle light under the open stars  the western doorthat which looked up the caÃ±on and through which we entered by our bridge of flying plankwas still entire a handsome panelled door the most finished piece of carpentry in silverado and the two lowest bunks next to this we roughly filled with hay for that nights use through the opposite or easternlooking gable with its open door and window a faint diffused starshine came into the room like mist and when we were once in bed we lay awaiting sleep in a haunted incomplete obscurity at first the silence of the night was utter then a high wind began in the distance among the treetops and for hours continued to grow higher it seemed to me much such a wind as we had found on our visit yet here in our open chamber we were fanned only by gentle and refreshing draughts so deep was the caÃ±on so close our house was planted under the overhanging rock                              the hunters family   there is quite a large race or class of people in america for whom we scarcely seem to have a parallel in england of pure white blood they are unknown or unrecognisable in towns inhabit the fringe of settlements and the deep quiet places of the country rebellious to all labour and pettily thievish like the english gipsies rustically ignorant but with a touch of woodlore and the dexterity of the savage whence they came is a moot point at the time of the war they poured north in thousands to escape the conscription lived during summer on fruits wild animals and petty theft and at the approach of winter when these supplies failed built great fires in the forest and there died stoically by starvation they are widely scattered however and easily recognised loutish but not illlooking they will sit all day swinging their legs on a field fence the mind seemingly as devoid of all reflection as a suffolk peasants careless of politics for the most part incapable of reading but with a rebellious vanity and a strong sense of independence hunting is their most congenial business or if the occasion offers a little amateur detection in tracking a criminal following a particular horse along a beaten highway and drawing inductions from a hair or a footprint one of these somnolent grinning hodges will suddenly display activity of body and finesse of mind by their names ye may know them the women figuring as loveina larsenia serena leanna orreana the men answering to alvin alva or orion pronounced orrion with the accent on the first whether they are indeed a race or whether this is the form of degeneracy common to all backwoodsmen they are at least known by a generic byword as poor whites or lowdowners  i will not say that the hanson family was poor white because the name savours of offence but i may go as far as thisthey were in many points not unsimilar to the people usually so called rufe himself combined two of the qualifications for he was both a hunter and an amateur detective it was he who pursued russel and dollar the robbers of the lake port stage and captured them the very morning after the exploit while they were still sleeping in a hayfield russel a drunken scotch carpenter was even an acquaintance of his own and he expressed much grave commiseration for his fate in all that he said and did rufe was grave i never saw him hurried when he spoke he took out his pipe with ceremonial deliberation looked east and west and then in quiet tones and few words stated his business or told his story his gait was to match it would never have surprised you if at any step he had turned round and walked away again so warily and slowly and with so much seeming hesitation did he go about he lay long in bed in the morningrarely indeed rose before noon he loved all games from poker to clerical croquet and in the toll house croquet ground i have seen him toiling at the latter with the devotion of a curate he took an interest in education was an active member of the local schoolboard and when i was there he had recently lost the schoolhouse key his waggon was broken but it never seemed to occur to him to mend it like all truly idle people he had an artistic eye he chose the print stuff for his wifes dresses and counselled her in the making of a patchwork quilt always as she thought wrongly but to the more educated eye always with bizarre and admirable tastethe taste of an indian with all this he was a perfect unoffending gentleman in word and act take his clay pipe from him and he was fit for any society but that of fools quiet as he was there burned a deep permanent excitement in his dark blue eyes and when this grave man smiled it was like sunshine in a shady place  mrs hanson nÃ©e if you please lovelands was more commonplace than her lord she was a comely woman too plump faircoloured with wonderful white teeth and in her print dresses chosen by rufe and with a large sunbonnet shading her valued complexion made i assure you a very agreeable figure but she was on the surface what there was of her outspoken and loudspoken her noisy laughter had none of the charm of one of hansons rare slowspreading smiles there was no reticence no mystery no manner about the woman she was a firstclass dairymaid but her husband was an unknown quantity between the savage and the nobleman she was often in and out with us merry and healthy and fair he came far seldomeronly indeed when there was business or now and again to pay a visit of ceremony brushed up for the occasion with his wife on his arm and a clean clay pipe in his teeth these visits in our forest state had quite the air of an event and turned our red caÃ±on into a salon  such was the pair who ruled in the old silverado hotel among the windy trees on the mountain shoulder overlooking the whole length of napa valley as the man aloft looks down on the ships deck there they kept house with sundry horses and fowls and a family of sons daniel webster and i think george washington among the number nor did they want visitors an old gentleman of singular stolidity and called breedlovei think he had crossed the plains in the same caravan with rufehoused with them for awhile during our stay and they had besides a permanent lodger in the form of mrs hansons brother irvine lovelands i spell irvine by guess for i could get no information on the subject just as i could never find out in spite of many inquiries whether or not rufe was a contraction for rufus they were all cheerfully at sea about their names in that generation and this is surely the more notable where the names are all so strange and even the family names appear to have been coined at one time at least the ancestors of all these alvins and alvas loveinas lovelands and breedloves must have taken serious council and found a certain poetry in these denominations that must have been then their form of literature but still times change and their next descendants the george washingtons and daniel websters will at least be clear upon the point and anyway and however his name should be spelt this irvine lovelands was the most unmitigated caliban i ever knew  our very first morning at silverado when we were full of business patching up doors and windows making beds and seats and getting our rough lodging into shape irvine and his sister made their appearance together she for neighbourliness and general curiosity he because he was working for me to my sorrow cutting firewood at i forget how much a day the way that he set about cutting wood was characteristic we were at that moment patching up and unpacking in the kitchen down he sat on one side and down sat his sister on the other both were chewing pinetree gum and he to my annoyance accompanied that simple pleasure with profuse expectoration she rattled away talking up hill and down dale laughing tossing her head showing her brilliant teeth he looked on in silence now spitting heavily on the floor now putting his head back and uttering a loud discordant joyless laugh he had a tangle of shock hair the colour of wool his mouth was a grin although as strong as a horse he looked neither heavy nor yet adroit only leggy coltish and in the road but it was plain he was in high spirits thoroughly enjoying his visit and he laughed frankly whenever we failed to accomplish what we were about this was scarcely helpful it was even to amateur carpenters embarrassing but it lasted until we knocked off work and began to get dinner then mrs hanson remembered she should have been gone an hour ago and the pair retired and the ladys laughter died away among the nutmegs down the path that was irvines first days work in my employmentthe devil take him  the next morning he returned and as he was this time alone he bestowed his conversation upon us with great liberality he prided himself on his intelligence asked us if we knew the schoolmaam he didnt think much of her anyway he had tried her he had he had put a question to her if a tree a hundred feet high were to fall a foot a day how long would it take to fall right down she had not been able to solve the problem she dont know nothing he opined he told us how a friend of his kept a school with a revolver and chuckled mightily over that his friend could teach school he could all the time he kept chewing gum and spitting he would stand awhile looking down and then he would toss back his shock of hair and laugh hoarsely and spit and bring forward a new subject a man he told us who bore a grudge against him had poisoned his dog that was a low thing for a man to do now wasnt it it wasnt like a man that nohow but i got even with him i pisoned his dog his clumsy utterance his rude embarrassed manner set a fresh value on the stupidity of his remarks i do not think i ever appreciated the meaning of two words until i knew irvinethe verb loaf and the noun oaf between them they complete his portrait he could lounge and wriggle and rub himself against the wall and grin and be more in everybodys way than any other two people that i ever set my eyes on nothing that he did became him and yet you were conscious that he was one of your own race that his mind was cumbrously at work revolving the problem of existence like a quid of gum and in his own cloudy manner enjoying life and passing judgment on his fellows above all things he was delighted with himself you would not have thought it from his uneasy manners and troubled struggling utterance but he loved himself to the marrow and was happy and proud like a peacock on a rail  his selfesteem was indeed the one joint in his harness he could be got to work and even kept at work by flattery as long as my wife stood over him crying out how strong he was so long exactly he would stick to the matter in hand and the moment she turned her back or ceased to praise him he would stop his physical strength was wonderful and to have a woman stand by and admire his achievements warmed his heart like sunshine yet he was as cowardly as he was powerful and felt no shame in owning to the weakness something was once wanted from the crazy platform over the shaft and he at once refused to venture theredid not like as he said foolin round them kind o places and let my wife go instead of him looking on with a grin vanity where it rules is usually more heroic but irvine steadily approved himself and expected others to approve him rather looked down upon my wife and decidedly expected her to look up to him on the strength of his superior prudence  yet the strangest part of the whole matter was perhaps this that irvine was as beautiful as a statue his features were in themselves perfect it was only his cloudy uncouth and coarse expression that disfigured them so much strength residing in so spare a frame was proof sufficient of the accuracy of his shape he must have been built somewhat after the pattern of jack sheppard but the famous housebreaker we may be certain was no lout it was by the extraordinary powers of his mind no less than by the vigour of his body that he broke his strong prison with such imperfect implements turning the very obstacles to surface irvine in the same case would have sat down and spat and grumbled curses he had the soul of a fat sheep but regarded as an artists model the exterior of a greek god it was a cruel thought to persons less favoured in their birth that this creature endowedto use the language of theatreswith extraordinary means should so manage to misemploy them that he looked ugly and almost deformed it was only by an effort of abstraction and after many days that you discovered what he was  by playing on the oafs conceit and standing closely over him we got a path made round the corner of the dump to our door so that we could come and go with decent ease and he even enjoyed the work for in that there were boulders to be plucked up bodily bushes to be uprooted and other occasions for athletic display but cutting wood was a different matter anybody could cut wood and besides my wife was tired of supervising him and had other things to attend to and in short days went by and irvine came daily and talked and lounged and spat but the firewood remained intact as sleepers on the platform or growing trees upon the mountainside irvine as a woodcutter we could tolerate but irvine as a friend of the family at so much a day was too bald an imposition and at length on the afternoon of the fourth or fifth day of our connection i explained to him as clearly as i could the light in which i had grown to regard his presence i pointed out to him that i could not continue to give him a salary for spitting on the floor and this expression which came after a good many others at last penetrated his obdurate wits he rose at once and said if that was the way he was going to be spoke to he reckoned he would quit and no one interposing he departed  so far so good but we had no firewood the next afternoon i strolled down to rufes and consulted him on the subject it was a very droll interview in the large bare north room of the silverado hotel mrs hansons patchwork on a frame and rufe and his wife and i and the oaf himself all more or less embarrassed rufe announced there was nobody in the neighbourhood but irvine who could do a days work for anybody irvine thereupon refused to have any more to do with my service he wouldnt work no more for a man as had spoke to him s i had done i found myself on the point of the last humiliationdriven to beseech the creature whom i had just dismissed with insult but i took the high hand in despair said there must be no talk of irvine coming back unless matters were to be differently managed that i would rather chop firewood for myself than be fooled and in short the hansons being eager for the lads hire i so imposed upon them with merely affected resolution that they ended by begging me to reemploy him again on a solemn promise that he should be more industrious the promise i am bound to say was kept we soon had a fine pile of firewood at our door and if caliban gave me the cold shoulder and spared me his conversation i thought none the worse of him for that nor did i find my days much longer for the deprivation  the leading spirit of the family was i am inclined to fancy mrs hanson her social brilliancy somewhat dazzled the others and she had more of the small change of sense it was she who faced kelmar for instance and perhaps if she had been alone kelmar would have had no rule within her doors rufe to be sure had a fine sober openair attitude of mind seeing the world without exaggerationperhaps we may even say without enough for he lacked along with the others that commercial idealism which puts so high a value on time and money sanity itself is a kind of convention perhaps rufe was wrong but looking on life plainly he was unable to see that croquet or poker were in any way less important than for instance mending his waggon even his own profession hunting was dear to him mainly as a sort of play even that he would have neglected had it not appealed to his imagination his hunting suit for instance had cost i should be afraid to say how many bucksthe currency in which he paid his way it was all befringed after the indian fashion and it was dear to his heart the pictorial side of his daily business was never forgotten he was even anxious to stand for his picture in those buckskin hunting clothes and i remember how he once warmed almost into enthusiasm his dark blue eyes growing perceptibly larger as he planned the composition in which he should appear with the horns of some real big bucks and dogs and a camp on a crick creek stream  there was no trace in irvine of this woodland poetry he did not care for hunting nor yet for buckskin suits he had never observed scenery the world as it appeared to him was almost obliterated by his own great grinning figure in the foreground calibanmalvolio and it seems to me as if in the persons of these brothersinlaw we had the two sides of rusticity fairly well represented the hunter living really in nature the clodhopper living merely out of society the one bent up in every corporal agent to capacity in one pursuit doing at least one thing keenly and thoughtfully and thoroughly alive to all that touches it the other in the inert and bestial state walking in a faint dream and taking so dim an impression of the myriad sides of life that he is truly conscious of nothing but himself it is only in the fastnesses of nature forests mountains and the back of mans beyond that a creature endowed with five senses can grow up into the perfection of this crass and earthly vanity in towns or the busier country sides he is roughly reminded of other mens existence and if he learns no more he learns at least to fear contempt but irvine had come scathless through life conscious only of himself of his great strength and intelligence and in the silence of the universe to which he did not listen dwelling with delight on the sound of his own thoughts                                  the seafogs   a change in the colour of the light usually called me in the morning by a certain hour the long vertical chinks in our western gable where the boards had shrunk and separated flashed suddenly into my eyes as stripes of dazzling blue at once so dark and splendid that i used to marvel how the qualities could be combined at an earlier hour the heavens in that quarter were still quietly coloured but the shoulder of the mountain which shuts in the caÃ±on already glowed with sunlight in a wonderful compound of gold and rose and green and this too would kindle although more mildly and with rainbow tints the fissures of our crazy gable if i were sleeping heavily it was the bold blue that struck me awake if more lightly then i would come to myself in that earlier and fairer light  one sunday morning about five the first brightness called me i rose and turned to the east not for my devotions but for air the night had been very still the little private gale that blew every evening in our caÃ±on for ten minutes or perhaps a quarter of an hour had swiftly blown itself out in the hours that followed not a sigh of wind had shaken the treetops and our barracks for all its breaches was less fresh that morning than of wont but i had no sooner reached the window than i forgot all else in the sight that met my eyes and i made but two bounds into my clothes and down the crazy plank to the platform  the sun was still concealed below the opposite hilltops though it was shining already not twenty feet above my head on our own mountain slope but the scene beyond a few near features was entirely changed napa valley was gone gone were all the lower slopes and woody foothills of the range and in their place not a thousand feet below me rolled a great level ocean it was as though i had gone to bed the night before safe in a nook of inland mountains and had awakened in a bay upon the coast i had seen these inundations from below at calistoga i had risen and gone abroad in the early morning coughing and sneezing under fathoms on fathoms of grey seavapour like a cloudy skya dull sight for the artist and a painful experience for the invalid but to sit aloft ones self in the pure air and under the unclouded dome of heaven and thus look down on the submergence of the valley was strangely different and even delightful to the eyes far away were hilltops like little islands nearer a smoky surf beat about the foot of precipices and poured into all the coves of these rough mountains the colour of that fog ocean was a thing never to be forgotten for an instant among the hebrides and just about sundown i have seen something like it on the sea itself but the white was not so opaline nor was there what surprisingly increased the effect that breathless crystal stillness over all even in its gentlest moods the salt sea travails moaning among the weeds or lisping on the sand but that vast fog ocean lay in a trance of silence nor did the sweet air of the morning tremble with a sound  as i continued to sit upon the dump i began to observe that this sea was not so level as at first sight it appeared to be away in the extreme south a little hill of fog arose against the sky above the general surface and as it had already caught the sun it shone on the horizon like the topsails of some giant ship there were huge waves stationary as it seemed like waves in a frozen sea and yet as i looked again i was not sure but they were moving after all with a slow and august advance and while i was yet doubting a promontory of the hills some four or five miles away conspicuous by a bouquet of tall pines was in a single instant overtaken and swallowed up it appeared in a little with its pines but this time as an islet and only to be swallowed up once more and then for good this set me looking nearer and i saw that in every cove along the line of mountains the fog was being piled in higher and higher as though by some wind that was inaudible to me i could trace its progress one pinetree first growing hazy and then disappearing after another although sometimes there was none of this forerunning haze but the whole opaque white ocean gave a start and swallowed a piece of mountain at a gulp it was to flee these poisonous fogs that i had left the seaboard and climbed so high among the mountains and now behold here came the fog to besiege me in my chosen altitudes and yet came so beautifully that my first thought was of welcome  the sun had now gotten much higher and through all the gaps of the hills it cast long bars of gold across that white ocean an eagle or some other very great bird of the mountain came wheeling over the nearer pinetops and hung poised and something sideways as if to look abroad on that unwonted desolation spying perhaps with terror for the eyries of her comrades then with a long cry she disappeared again towards lake county and the clearer air at length it seemed to me as if the flood were beginning to subside the old landmarks by whose disappearance i had measured its advance here a crag there a brave pinetree now began in the inverse order to make their reappearance into daylight i judged all danger of the fog was over this was not noahs flood it was but a morning spring and would now drift out seaward whence it came so mightily relieved and a good deal exhilarated by the sight i went into the house to light the fire  i suppose it was nearly seven when i once more mounted the platform to look abroad the fog ocean had swelled up enormously since last i saw it and a few hundred feet below me in the deep gap where the toll house stands and the road runs through into lake county it had already topped the slope and was pouring over and down the other side like driving smoke the wind had climbed along with it and though i was still in calm air i could see the trees tossing below me and their long strident sighing mounted to me where i stood  half an hour later the fog had surmounted all the ridge on the opposite side of the gap though a shoulder of the mountain still warded it out of our caÃ±on napa valley and its bounding hills were now utterly blotted out the fog sunny white in the sunshine was pouring over into lake county in a huge ragged cataract tossing treetops appearing and disappearing in the spray the air struck with a little chill and set me coughing it smelt strong of the fog like the smell of a washinghouse but with a shrewd tang of the sea salt  had it not been for two thingsthe sheltering spur which answered as a dyke and the great valley on the other side which rapidly engulfed whatever mountedour own little platform in the caÃ±on must have been already buried a hundred feet in salt and poisonous air as it was the interest of the scene entirely occupied our minds we were set just out of the wind and but just above the fog we could listen to the voice of the one as to music on the stage we could plunge our eyes down into the other as into some flowing stream from over the parapet of a bridge thus we looked on upon a strange impetuous silent shifting exhibition of the powers of nature and saw the familiar landscape changing from moment to moment like figures in a dream  the imagination loves to trifle with what is not had this been indeed the deluge i should have felt more strongly but the emotion would have been similar in kind i played with the idea as the child flees in delighted terror from the creations of his fancy the look of the thing helped me and when at last i began to flee up the mountain it was indeed partly to escape from the raw air that kept me coughing but it was also part in play  as i ascended the mountainside i came once more to overlook the upper surface of the fog but it wore a different appearance from what i had beheld at daybreak for first the sun now fell on it from high overhead and its surface shone and undulated like a great norland moor country sheeted with untrodden morning snow and next the new level must have been a thousand or fifteen hundred feet higher than the old so that only five or six points of all the broken country below me still stood out napa valley was now one with sonoma on the west on the hither side only a thin scattered fringe of bluffs was unsubmerged and through all the gaps the fog was pouring over like an ocean into the blue clear sunny country on the east there it was soon lost for it fell instantly into the bottom of the valleys following the watershed and the hilltops in that quarter were still clear cut upon the eastern sky  through the toll house gap and over the near ridges on the other side the deluge was immense a spray of thin vapour was thrown high above it rising and falling and blown into fantastic shapes the speed of its course was like a mountain torrent here and there a few treetops were discovered and then whelmed again and for one second the bough of a dead pine beckoned out of the spray like the arm of a drowning man but still the imagination was dissatisfied still the ear waited for something more had this indeed been water as it seemed so to the eye with what a plunge of reverberating thunder would it have rolled upon its course disembowelling mountains and deracinating pines and yet water it was and seawater at thattrue pacific billows only somewhat rarefied rolling in midair among the hilltops  i climbed still higher among the red rattling gravel and dwarf underwood of mount saint helena until i could look right down upon silverado and admire the favoured nook in which it lay the sunny plain of fog was several hundred feet higher behind the protecting spur a gigantic accumulation of cottony vapour threatened with every second to blow over and submerge our homestead but the vortex setting past the toll house was too strong and there lay our little platform in the arms of the deluge but still enjoying its unbroken sunshine about eleven however thin spray came flying over the friendly buttress and i began to think the fog had hunted out its jonah after all but it was the last effort the wind veered while we were at dinner and began to blow squally from the mountain summit and by halfpast one all that world of seafogs was utterly routed and flying here and there into the south in little rags of cloud and instead of a lone seabeach we found ourselves once more inhabiting a high mountainside with the clear green country far below us and the light smoke of calistoga blowing in the air  this was the great russian campaign for that season now and then in the early morning a little white lakelet of fog would be seen far down in napa valley but the heights were not again assailed nor was the surrounding world again shut off from silverado                                 the toll house   the toll house standing alone by the wayside under nodding pines with its streamlet and watertank its backwoods tollbar and welltrodden croquet ground the ostler standing by the stable door chewing a straw a glimpse of the chinese cook in the back parts and mr hoddy in the bar gravely alert and serviceable and equally anxious to lend or borrow booksdozed all day in the dusty sunshine more than half asleep there were no neighbours except the hansons up the hill the traffic on the road was infinitesimal only at rare intervals a couple in a waggon or a dusty farmer on a springboard toiling over the grade to that metropolitan hamlet calistoga and at the fixed hours the passage of the stages  the nearest building was the schoolhouse down the road and the schoolmaam boarded at the toll house walking thence in the morning to the little brown shanty where she taught the young ones of the district and returning thither pretty weary in the afternoon she had chosen this outlying situation i understood for her health mr corwin was consumptive so was rufe so was mr jennings the engineer in short the place was a kind of small davos consumptive folk consorting on a hilltop in the most unbroken idleness jennings never did anything that i could see except now and then to fish and generally to sit about in the bar and the veranda waiting for something to happen corwin and rufe did as little as possible and if the schoolmaam poor lady had to work pretty hard all morning she subsided when it was over into much the same dazed beatitude as all the rest  her special corner was the parloura very genteel room with bible prints a crayon portrait of mrs corwin in the height of fashion a few years ago another of her son mr corwin was not represented a mirror and a selection of dried grasses a large book was laid religiously on the tablefrom palace to hovel i believe its namefull of the raciest experiences in england the author had mingled freely with all classes the nobility particularly meeting him with open arms and i must say that traveller had ill requited his reception his book in short was a capital instance of the penny messalina school of literature and there arose from it in that cool parlour in that silent wayside mountain inn a rank atmosphere of gold and blood and jenkins and the mysteries of london and sickening inverted snobbery fit to knock you down the mention of this book reminds me of another and far racier picture of our island life the latter parts of rocambole are surely too sparingly consulted in the country which they celebrate no mans education can be said to be complete nor can he pronounce the world yet emptied of enjoyment till he has made the acquaintance of the reverend patterson director of the evangelical society to follow the evolutions of that reverend gentleman who goes through scenes in which even mr duffield would hesitate to place a bishop is to rise to new ideas but alas there was no patterson about the toll house only alongside of from palace to hovel a sixpenny ouida figured so literature you see was not unrepresented  the schoolmaam had friends to stay with her other schoolmaams enjoying their holidays quite a bevy of damsels they seemed never to go out or not beyond the veranda but sat close in the little parlour quietly talking or listening to the wind among the trees sleep dwelt in the toll house like a fixture summer sleep shallow soft and dreamless a cuckoo clock a great rarity in such a place hooted at intervals about the echoing house and mr jennings would open his eyes for a moment in the bar and turn the leaf of a newspaper and the resting schoolmaams in the parlour would be recalled to the consciousness of their inaction busy mrs corwin and her busy chinaman might be heard indeed in the penetralia pounding dough or rattling dishes or perhaps rufe had called up some of the sleepers for a game of croquet and the hollow strokes of the mallet sounded far away among the woods but with these exceptions it was sleep and sunshine and dust and the wind in the pinetrees all day long  a little before stage time that castle of indolence awoke the ostler threw his straw away and set to his preparations mr jennings rubbed his eyes happy mr jennings the something he had been waiting for all day about to happen at last the boarders gathered in the veranda silently giving ear and gazing down the road with shaded eyes and as yet there was no sign for the senses not a sound not a tremor of the mountain road the birds to whom the secret of the hooting cuckoo is unknown must have set down to instinct this premonitory bustle  and then the first of the two stages swooped upon the toll house with a roar and in a cloud of dust and the shock had not yet time to subside before the second was abreast of it huge concerns they were well horsed and loaded the men in their shirtsleeves the women swathed in veils the long whip cracking like a pistol and as they charged upon that slumbering hostelry each shepherding a dust storm the dead place blossomed into life and talk and clatter this the toll housewith its city throng its jostling shoulders its infinity of instant business in the bar the mind would not receive it the heartfelt bustle of that hour is hardly credible the thrill of the great shower of letters from the postbag the childish hope and interest with which one gazed in all these strangers eyes they paused there but to pass the blueclad chinaboy the san francisco magnate the mystery in the dust coat the secret memoirs in tweed the ogling wellshod lady with her troop of girls they did but flash and go they were hulldown for us behind lifes ocean and we but hailed their topsails on the line yet out of our great solitude of four and twenty mountain hours we thrilled to their momentary presence gauged and divined them loved and hated and stood lightheaded in that storm of human electricity yes like piccadilly circus this is also one of lifes crossingplaces here i beheld one man already famous or infamous a centre of pistolshots and another who if not yet known to rumour will fill a column of the sunday paper when he comes to hanga burly thickset powerful chinese desperado six long bristles upon either lip redolent of whisky playingcards and pistols swaggering in the bar with the lowest assumption of the lowest european manners rapping out blackguard english oaths in his canorous oriental voice and combining in one person the depravities of two races and two civilisations for all his lust and vigour he seemed to look cold upon me from the valley of the shadow of the gallows he imagined a vain thing and while he drained his cocktail holbeins death was at his elbow once too i fell in talk with another of these flitting strangerslike the rest in his shirtsleeves and all begrimed with dustand the next minute we were discussing paris and london theatres and wines to him journeying from one human place to another this was a trifle but to me no mr lillie i have not forgotten it  and presently the citytide was at its flood and began to ebb life runs in piccadilly circus say from nine to one and then there also ebbs into the small hours of the echoing policeman and the lamps and stars but the toll house is far up stream and near its rural springs the bubble of the tide but touches it before you had yet grasped your pleasure the horses were put to the loud whips volleyed and the tide was gone north and south had the two stages vanished the towering dust subsided in the woods but there was still an interval before the flush had fallen on your cheeks before the ear became once more contented with the silence or the seven sleepers of the toll house dozed back to their accustomed corners yet a little and the ostler would swing round the great barrier across the road and in the golden evening that dreamy inn begin to trim its lamps and spread the board for supper  as i recall the placethe green dell below the spires of pine the sunwarm scented air that grey gabled inn with its faint stirrings of life amid the slumber of the mountainsi slowly awake to a sense of admiration gratitude and almost love a fine place after all for a wasted life to doze away inthe cuckoo clock hooting of its far home country the croquet mallets eloquent of english lawns the stages daily bringing news of the turbulent world away below there and perhaps once in the summer a salt fog pouring overhead with its tale of the pacific                                 a starry drive   in our rule at silverado there was a melancholy interregnum the queen and the crown prince with one accord fell sick and as i was sick to begin with our lone position on mount saint helena was no longer tenable and we had to hurry back to calistoga and a cottage on the green by that time we had begun to realise the difficulties of our position we had found what an amount of labour it cost to support life in our red caÃ±on and it was the dearest desire of our hearts to get a chinaboy to go along with us when we returned we could have given him a whole house to himself selfcontained as they say in the advertisements and on the money question we were prepared to go far kong sam kee the calistoga washerman was entrusted with the affair and from day to day it languished on with protestations on our part and mellifluous excuses on the part of kong sam kee  at length about halfpast eight of our last evening with the waggon ready harnessed to convey us up the grade the washerman with a somewhat sneering air produced the boy he was a handsome gentlemanly lad attired in rich dark blue and shod with snowy white but alas he had heard rumours of silverado he knew it for a lone place on the mountainside with no friendly washhouse near by where he might smoke a pipe of opium o nights with other chinaboys and lose his little earnings at the game of tan and he first backed out for more money and then when that demand was satisfied refused to come point blank he was wedded to his washhouses he had no taste for the rural life and we must go to our mountain servantless it must have been near half an hour before we reached that conclusion standing in the midst of calistoga high street under the stars and the chinaboy and kong sam kee singing their pigeon english in the sweetest voices and with the most musical inflections  we were not however to return alone we brought with us a painter guest who proved to be a most goodnatured comrade and a capital hand at an omelette i do not know in which capacity he was most valuedas a cook or a companion and he did excellently well in both  the kong sam kee negotiation had delayed us unduly it must have been halfpast nine before we left calistoga and night came fully ere we struck the bottom of the grade i have never seen such a night it seemed to throw calumny in the teeth of all the painters that ever dabbled in starlight the sky itself was of a ruddy powerful nameless changing colour dark and glossy like a serpents back the stars by innumerable millions stuck boldly forth like lamps the milky way was bright like a moonlit cloud half heaven seemed milky way the greater luminaries shone each more clearly than a winters moon their light was dyed in every sort of colourred like fire blue like steel green like the tracks of sunset and so sharply did each stand forth in its own lustre that there was no appearance of that flat starspangled arch we know so well in pictures but all the hollow of heaven was one chaos of contesting luminariesa hurlyburly of stars against this the hills and rugged treetops stood out redly dark  as we continued to advance the lesser lights and milky ways first grew pale and then vanished the countless hosts of heaven dwindled in number by successive millions those that still shone had tempered their exceeding brightness and fallen back into their customary wistful distance and the sky declined from its first bewildering splendour into the appearance of a common night slowly this change proceeded and still there was no sign of any cause then a whiteness like mist was thrown over the spurs of the mountain yet awhile and as we turned a corner a great leap of silver light and net of forest shadows fell across the road and upon our wondering waggonful and swimming low among the trees we beheld a strange misshapen waning moon half tilted on her back  where are ye when the moon appears so the old poet sang half taunting to the stars bent upon a courtly purpose     as the sunlight round the dim earths midnight tower of                shadow pours     streaming past the dim wide portals     viewless to the eyes of mortals     till it floods the moons pale islet or the mornings                golden shores  so sings mr trowbridge with a noble inspiration and so had the sunlight flooded that pale islet of the moon and her lit face put out one after another that galaxy of stars the wonder of the drive was over but by some nice conjunction of clearness in the air and fit shadow in the valley where we travelled we had seen for a little while that brave display of the midnight heavens it was gone but it had been nor shall i ever again behold the stars with the same mind he who has seen the sea commoved with a great hurricane thinks of it very differently from him who has seen it only in a calm and the difference between a calm and a hurricane is not greatly more striking than that between the ordinary face of night and the splendour that shone upon us in that drive two in our waggon knew night as she shines upon the tropics but even that bore no comparison the nameless colour of the sky the hues of the star fire and the incredible projection of the stars themselves starting from their orbits so that the eye seemed to distinguish their positions in the hollow of spacethese were things that we had never seen before and shall never see again  meanwhile in this altered night we proceeded on our way among the scents and silence of the forest reached the top of the grade wound up by hansons and came at last to a stand under the flying gargoyle of the chute lloyd who had been lying back fast asleep with the moon on his face got down with the remark that it was pleasant to be home the waggon turned and drove away the noise gently dying in the woods and we clambered up the rough path calibans great feat of engineering and came home to silverado  the moon shone in at the eastern doors and windows and over the lumber on the platform the one tall pine beside the ledge was steeped in silver away up the caÃ±on a wild cat welcomed us with three discordant squalls but once we had lit a candle and began to review our improvements homely in either sense and count our stores it was wonderful what a feeling of possession and permanence grew up in the hearts of the lords of silverado a bed had still to be made up for our guest and the mornings water to be fetched with clinking pail and as we set about these household duties and showed off our wealth and conveniences before the stranger and had a glass of wine i think in honour of our return and trooped at length one after another up the flying bridge of plank and laid down to sleep in our shattered moonpierced barrack we were among the happiest sovereigns in the world and certainly ruled over the most contented people yet in our absence the palace had been sacked wild cats so the hansons said had broken in and carried off a side of bacon a hatchet and two knives                         episodes in the story of a mine   no one could live at silverado and not be curious about the story of the mine we were surrounded by so many evidences of expense and toil we lived so entirely in the wreck of that great enterprise like mites in the ruins of a cheese that the idea of the old din and bustle haunted our repose our own house the forge the dump the chutes the rails the windlass the mass of broken plant the two tunnels one far below in the green dell the other on the platform where we kept our wine the deep shaft with the sunglints and the waterdrops above all the ledge that great gaping slice out of the mountain shoulder propped apart by wooden wedges on whose immediate margin high above our heads the one tall pine precariously noddedthese stood for its greatness while the doghutch bootjacks old boots old tavern bills and the very beds that we inherited from bygone miners put in human touches and realised for us the story of the past  i have sat on an old sleeper under the thick madronas near the forge with just a look over the dump on the green world below and seen the sun lying broad among the wreck and heard the silence broken only by the tinkling water in the shaft or a stir of the royal family about the battered palace and my mind has gone back to the epoch of the stanleys and the chapmans with a grand tutti of pick and drill hammer and anvil echoing about the caÃ±on the assayer hard at it in our diningroom the carts below on the road and their cargo of red mineral bounding and thundering down the iron chute and now all goneall fallen away into this sunny silence and desertion a family of squatters dining in the assayers office making their beds in the big sleeping room erstwhile so crowded keeping their wine in the tunnel that once rang with picks  but silverado itself although now fallen in its turn into decay was once but a mushroom and had succeeded to other mines and other flitting cities twenty years ago away down the glen on the lake county side there was a place jonestown by name with two thousand inhabitants dwelling under canvas and one roofed house for the sale of whisky round on the western side of mount saint helena there was at the same date a second large encampment its name if it ever had one lost for me both of these have perished leaving not a stick and scarce a memory behind them tide after tide of hopeful miners have thus flowed and ebbed about the mountain coming and going now by lone prospectors now with a rush last in order of time came silverado reared the big mill in the valley founded the town which is now represented monumentally by hansons pierced all these slaps and shafts and tunnels and in turn declined and died away              our noisy years seem moments in the being              of the eternal silence  as to the success of silverado in its time of being two reports were current according to the first six hundred thousand dollars were taken out of that great upright seam that still hung open above us on crazy wedges then the ledge pinched out and there followed in quest of the remainder a great drifting and tunnelling in all directions and a great consequent effusion of dollars until all parties being sick of the expense the mine was deserted and the town decamped according to the second version told me with much secrecy of manner the whole affair mine mill and town were parts of one majestic swindle there had never come any silver out of any portion of the mine there was no silver to come at midnight trains of packhorses might have been observed winding by devious tracks about the shoulder of the mountain they came from far away from amador or placer laden with silver in old cigarboxes they discharged their load at silverado in the hour of sleep and before the morning they were gone again with their mysterious drivers to their unknown source in this way twenty thousand pounds worth of silver was smuggled in under cover of night in these old cigarboxes mixed with silverado mineral carted down to the mill crushed amalgamated and refined and despatched to the city as the proper product of the mine stockjobbing if it can cover such expenses must be a profitable business in san francisco  i give these two versions as i got them but i place little reliance on either my belief in history having been greatly shaken for it chanced that i had come to dwell in silverado at a critical hour great events in its history were about to happendid happen as i am led to believe nay and it will be seen that i played a part in that revolution myself and yet from first to last i never had a glimmer of an idea what was going on and even now after full reflection profess myself at sea that there was some obscure intrigue of the cigarbox order and that i in the character of a wooden puppet set pen to paper in the interest of somebody so much and no more is certain  silverado then under my immediate sway belonged to one whom i will call a mr ronalds i only knew him through the extraordinarily distorting medium of local gossip now as a momentous jobber now as a dupe to point an adage and again and much more probably as an ordinary christian gentleman like you or me who had opened a mine and worked it for awhile with better and worse fortune so through a defective windowpane you may see the passerby shoot up into a hunchbacked giant or dwindle into a potbellied dwarf  to ronalds at least the mine belonged but the notice by which he held it would run out upon the 30th of juneor rather as i suppose it had run out already and the month of grace would expire upon that day after which any american citizen might post a notice of his own and make silverado his this with a sort of quiet slyness rufe told me at an early period of our acquaintance there was no silver of course the mine wasnt worth nothing mr stevens but there was a deal of old iron and wood around and to gain possession of this old wood and iron and get a right to the water rufe proposed if i had no objections to jump the claim  of course i had no objection but i was filled with wonder if all he wanted was the wood and iron what in the name of fortune was to prevent him taking them his right there was none to dispute he might lay hands on all tomorrow as the wild cats had laid hands upon our knives and hatchet besides was this mass of heavy mining plant worth transportation if it was why had not the rightful owners carted it away if it was would they not preserve their title to these movables even after they had lost their title to the mine and if it were not what the better was rufe nothing would grow at silverado there was even no wood to cut beyond a sense of property there was nothing to be gained lastly was it at all credible that ronalds would forget what rufe remembered the days of grace were not yet over any fine morning he might appear paper in hand and enter for another year on his inheritance however it was none of my business all seemed legal rufe or ronalds all was one to me  on the morning of the 27th mrs hanson appeared with the milk as usual in her sunbonnet the time would be out on tuesday she reminded us and bade me be in readiness to play my part though i had no idea what it was to be and suppose ronalds came we asked she received the idea with derision laughing aloud with all her fine teeth he could not find the mine to save his life it appeared without rufe to guide him last year when he came they heard him up and down the road ahollerin and araisin cain and at last he had to come to the hansons in despair and bid rufe jump into your pants and shoes and show me where this old mine is anyway seeing that ronalds had laid out so much money in the spot and that a beaten road led right up to the bottom of the dump i thought this a remarkable example the sense of locality must be singularly in abeyance in the case of ronalds  that same evening supper comfortably over our guest busy at work on a drawing of the dump and the opposite hills we were all out on the platform together sitting there under the tented heavens with the same sense of privacy as if we had been cabined in a parlour when the sound of brisk footsteps came mounting up the path we pricked our ears at this for the tread seemed lighter and firmer than was usual with our country neighbours and presently sure enough two town gentlemen with cigars and kid gloves came debouching past the house they looked in that place like a blasphemy  goodevening they said for none of us had stirred we all sat stiff with wonder  goodevening i returned and then to put them at their ease a stiff climb i added  yes replied the leader but we have to thank you for this path  i did not like the mans tone none of us liked it he did not seem embarrassed by the meeting but threw us his remarks like favours and strode magisterially by us towards the shaft and tunnel  presently we heard his voice raised to his companion we drifted every sort of way but couldnt strike the ledge then again it pinched out here and once more every miner that ever worked upon it says theres bound to be a ledge somewhere  these were the snatches of his talk that reached us and they had a damning significance we the lords of silverado had come face to face with our superior it is the worst of all quaint and of all cheap ways of life that they bring us at last to the pinch of some humiliation i liked well enough to be a squatter when there was none but hanson by before ronalds i will own i somewhat quailed i hastened to do him fealty said i gathered he was the squattee and apologised he threatened me with ejection in a manner grimly pleasantmore pleasant to him i fancy than to me and then he passed off into praises of the former state of silverado it was the busiest little mining town you ever saw a population of between a thousand and fifteen hundred souls the engine in full blast the mill newly erected nothing going but champagne and hope the order of the day ninety thousand dollars came out a hundred and forty thousand were put in making a net loss of fifty thousand the last days i gathered the days of john stanley were not so bright the champagne had ceased to flow the population was already moving elsewhere and silverado had begun to wither in the branch before it was cut to the root the last shot that was fired knocked over the stove chimney and made that hole in the roof of our barrack through which the sun was wont to visit slugabeds towards afternoon a noisy last shot to inaugurate the days of silence  throughout this interview my conscience was a good deal exercised and i was moved to throw myself on my knees and own the intended treachery but then i had hanson to consider i was in much the same position as old rowley that royal humourist whom the rogue had taken into his confidence and again here was ronalds on the spot he must know the day of the month as well as hanson and i if a broad hint were necessary he had the broadest in the world for a large board had been nailed by the crown prince on the very front of our house between the door and window painted in cinnabarthe pigment of the countrywith doggrel rhymes and contumelious pictures and announcing in terms unnecessarily figurative that the trick was already played the claim already jumped and the author of the placard the legitimate successor of mr ronalds but no nothing could save that man quem deus vult perdere prius dementat as he came so he went and left his rights depending  late at night by silverado reckoning and after we were all abed mrs hanson returned to give us the newest of her news it was like a scene in a ships steerage all of us abed in our different tiers the single candle struggling with the darkness and this plump handsome woman seated on an upturned valise beside the bunks talking and showing her fine teeth and laughing till the rafters rang any ship to be sure with a hundredth part as many holes in it as our barrack must long ago have gone to her last port up to that time i had always imagined mrs hansons loquacity to be mere incontinence that she said what was uppermost for the pleasure of speaking and laughed and laughed again as a kind of musical accompaniment but i now found there was an art in it i found it less communicative than silence itself i wished to know why ronalds had come how he had found his way without rufe and why being on the spot he had not refreshed his title she talked interminably on but her replies were never answers she fled under a cloud of words and when i had made sure that she was purposely eluding me i dropped the subject in my turn and let her rattle where she would  she had come to tell us that instead of waiting for tuesday the claim was to be jumped on the morrow how if the time were not out it was impossible why if ronalds had come and gone and done nothing there was the less cause for hurry but again i could reach no satisfaction the claim was to be jumped next morning that was all that she would condescend upon  and yet it was not jumped the next morning nor yet the next and a whole week had come and gone before we heard more of this exploit that day week however a day of great heat hanson with a little roll of paper in his hand and the eternal pipe alight breedlove his large dull friend to act i suppose as witness mrs hanson in her sunday best and all the children from the eldest to the youngestarrived in a procession tailing one behind another up the path caliban was absent but he had been chary of his friendly visits since the row and with that exception the whole family was gathered together as for a marriage or a christening strong was sitting at work in the shade of the dwarf madronas near the forge and they planted themselves about him in a circle one on a stone another on the waggon rails a third on a piece of plank gradually the children stole away up the caÃ±on to where there was another chute somewhat smaller than the one across the dump and down this chute for the rest of the afternoon they poured one avalanche of stones after another waking the echoes of the glen meanwhile we elders sat together on the platform hanson and his friend smoking in silence like indian sachems mrs hanson rattling on as usual with an adroit volubility saying nothing but keeping the party at their ease like a courtly hostess  not a word occurred about the business of the day once twice and thrice i tried to slide the subject in but was discouraged by the stoic apathy of rufe and beaten down before the pouring verbiage of his wife there is nothing of the indian brave about me and i began to grill with impatience at last like a highway robber i cornered hanson and bade him stand and deliver his business thereupon he gravely rose as though to hint that this was not a proper place nor the subject one suitable for squaws and i following his example led him up the plank into our barrack there he bestowed himself on a box and unrolled his papers with fastidious deliberation there were two sheets of notepaper and an old mining notice dated may 30th 1879 part print part manuscript and the latter much obliterated by the rains it was by this identical piece of paper that the mine had been held last year for thirteen months it had endured the weather and the change of seasons on a cairn behind the shoulder of the caÃ±on and it was now my business spreading it before me on the table and sitting on a valise to copy its terms with some necessary changes twice over on the two sheets of notepaper one was then to be placed on the same cairna mound of rocks the notice put it and the other to be lodged for registration  rufe watched me silently smoking till i came to the place for the locators name at the end of the first copy and when i proposed that he should sign i thought i saw a scare in his eye i dont think thatll be necessary he said slowly just you write it down perhaps this mighty hunter who was the most active member of the local school board could not write there would be nothing strange in that the constable of calistoga is and has been for years a bedridden man and if i remember rightly blind he had more need of the emoluments than another it was explained and it was easy for him to depytise with a strong accent on the last so friendly and so free are popular institutions  when i had done my scrivening hanson strolled out and addressed breedlove will you step up here a bit and after they had disappeared a little while into the chaparral and madrona thicket they came back again minus a notice and the deed was done the claim was jumped a tract of mountain side fifteen hundred feet long by six hundred wide with all the earths precious bowels had passed from ronalds to hanson and in the passage changed its name from the mammoth to the calistoga i had tried to get rufe to call it after his wife after himself and after garfield the republican presidential candidate of the hoursince then elected and alas deadbut all was in vain the claim had once been called the calistoga before and he seemed to feel safety in returning to that  and so the history of that mine became once more plunged in darkness lit only by some monster pyrotechnical displays of gossip and perhaps the most curious feature of the whole matter is this that we should have dwelt in this quiet corner of the mountains with not a dozen neighbours and yet struggled all the while like desperate swimmers in this sea of falsities and contradictions wherever a man is there will be a lie                               toils and pleasures   i must try to convey some notion of our life of how the days passed and what pleasure we took in them of what there was to do and how we set about doing it in our mountain hermitage the house after we had repaired the worst of the damages and filled in some of the doors and windows with white cotton cloth became a healthy and a pleasant dwellingplace always airy and dry and haunted by the outdoor perfumes of the glen within it had the look of habitation the human look you had only to go into the third room which we did not use and see its stones its shifting earth its tumbled litter and then return to our lodging with the beds made the plates on the rack the pail of bright water behind the door the stove crackling in a corner and perhaps the table roughly laid against a mealand mans order the little clean spots that he creates to dwell in were at once contrasted with the rich passivity of nature and yet our house was everywhere so wrecked and shattered the air came and went so freely the sun found so many portholes the golden outdoor glow shone in so many open chinks that we enjoyed at the same time some of the comforts of a roof and much of the gaiety and brightness of al fresco life a single shower of rain to be sure and we should have been drowned out like mice but ours was a californian summer and an earthquake was a far likelier accident than a shower of rain  trustful in this fine weather we kept the house for kitchen and bedroom and used the platform as our summer parlour the sense of privacy as i have said already was complete we could look over the dump on miles of forest and rough hilltop our eyes commanded some of napa valley where the train ran and the little country townships sat so close together along the line of the rail but here there was no man to intrude none but the hansons were our visitors even they came but at long intervals or twice daily at a stated hour with milk so our days as they were never interrupted drew out to the greater length hour melted insensibly into hour the household duties though they were many and some of them laborious dwindled into mere islets of business in a sea of sunny daytime and it appears to me looking back as though the far greater part of our life at silverado had been passed propped upon an elbow or seated on a plank listening to the silence that there is among the hills  my work it is true was over early in the morning i rose before any one else lit the stove put on the water to boil and strolled forth upon the platform to wait till it was ready silverado would then be still in shadow the sun shining on the mountain higher up a clean smell of trees a smell of the earth at morning hung in the air regularly every day there was a single bird not singing but awkwardly chirruping among the green madronas and the sound was cheerful natural and stirring it did not hold the attention nor interrupt the thread of meditation like a blackbird or a nightingale it was mere woodland prattle of which the mind was conscious like a perfume the freshness of these morning seasons remained with me far on into the day  as soon as the kettle boiled i made porridge and coffee and that beyond the literal drawing of water and the preparation of kindling which it would be hyperbolical to call the hewing of wood ended my domestic duties for the day thenceforth my wife laboured singlehanded in the palace and i lay or wandered on the platform at my own sweet will the little corner near the forge where we found a refuge under the madronas from the unsparing early sun is indeed connected in my mind with some nightmare encounters over euclid and the latin grammar these were known as crown princes lessons he was supposed to be the victim and the sufferer but here there must have been some misconception for whereas i generally retired to bed after one of these engagements he was no sooner set free than he dashed up to the chinamans house where he had installed a printingpress that great element of civilisation and the sound of his labours would be faintly audible about the caÃ±on half the day  to walk at all was a laborious business the foot sank and slid the boots were cut to pieces among sharp uneven rolling stones when we crossed the platform in any direction it was usual to lay a course following as much as possible the line of waggon rails thus if water were to be drawn the watercarrier left the house along some tilting planks that we had laid down and not laid down very well these carried him to that great highroad the railway and the railway served him as far as to the head of the shaft but from thence to the spring and back again he made the best of his unaided way staggering among the stones and wading in low growth of the calcanthus where the rattlesnakes lay hissing at his passage yet i liked to draw water it was pleasant to dip the grey metal pail into the clean colourless cool water pleasant to carry it back with the water lipping at the edge and a broken sunbeam quivering in the midst  but the extreme roughness of the walking confined us in common practice to the platform and indeed to those parts of it that were most easily accessible along the line of rails the rails came straight forward from the shaft here and there overgrown with little green bushes but still entire and still carrying a truck which it was lloyds delight to trundle to and fro by the hour with various ladings about midway down the platform the railroad trended to the right leaving our house and coasting along the far side within a few yards of the madronas and the forge and not far off the latter ended in a sort of platform on the edge of the dump there in old days the trucks were tipped and their load sent thundering down the chute there besides was the only spot where we could approach the margin of the dump anywhere else you took your life in your right hand when you came within a yard and a half to peer over for at any moment the dump might begin to slide and carry you down and bury you below its ruins indeed the neighbourhood of an old mine is a place beset with dangers for as still as silverado was at any moment the report of rotten wood might tell us that the platform had fallen into the shaft the dump might begin to pour into the road below or a wedge slip in the great upright seam and hundreds of tons of mountain bury the scene of our encampment  i have already compared the dump to a rampart built certainly by some rude people and for prehistoric wars it was likewise a frontier all below was green and woodland the tall pines soaring one above another each with a firm outline and full spread of bough all above was arid rocky and bald the great spout of broken mineral that had dammed the caÃ±on up was a creature of mans handiwork its material dug out with a pick and powder and spread by the service of the trucks but nature herself in that upper district seemed to have had an eye to nothing besides mining and even the natural hillside was all sliding gravel and precarious boulder close at the margin of the well leaves would decay to skeletons and mummies which at length some stronger gust would carry clear of the caÃ±on and scatter in the subjacent woods even moisture and decaying vegetable matter could not with all natures alchemy concoct enough soil to nourish a few poor grasses it is the same they say in the neighbourhood of all silver mines the nature of that precious rock being stubborn with quartz and poisonous with cinnabar both were plenty in our silverado the stones sparkled white in the sunshine with quartz they were all stained red with cinnabar here doubtless came the indians of yore to paint their faces for the warpath and cinnabar if i remember rightly was one of the few articles of indian commerce now the crown prince had it in his undisturbed possession to pound down and slake and paint his rude designs with but to me it had always a fine flavour of poetry compounded out of indian story and hawthorndens allusion               desire alas i desire a zeuxis new               from indies borrowing gold from eastern skies               most bright cinoper     yet this is but half the picture our silverado platform has another side to it though there was no soil and scarce a blade of grass yet out of these tumbled gravelheaps and broken boulders a flower garden bloomed as at home in a conservatory calcanthus crept like a hardy weed all over our rough parlour choking the railway and pushing forth its rusty aromatic cones from between two blocks of shattered mineral azaleas made a big snowbed just above the well the shoulder of the hill waved white with mediterranean heath in the crannies of the ledge and about the spurs of the tall pine a red flowering stoneplant hung in clusters even the low thorny chaparral was thick with pealike blossom close at the foot of our path nutmegs prospered delightful to the sight and smell at sunrise and again late at night the scent of the sweet baytrees filled the caÃ±on and the downblowing night wind must have borne it hundreds of feet into the outer air  all this vegetation to be sure was stunted the madrona was here no bigger than the manzanita the bay was but a stripling shrub the very pines with four or five exceptions in all our upper caÃ±on were not so tall as myself or but a little taller and the most of them came lower than my waist for a prosperous forest tree we must look below where the glen was crowded with green spires but for flowers and ravishing perfume we had none to envy our heap of roadmetal was thick with bloom like a hawthorn in the front of june our red baking angle in the mountain a laboratory of poignant scents it was an endless wonder to my mind as i dreamed about the platform following the progress of the shadows where the madrona with its leaves the azalea and calcanthus with their blossoms could find moisture to support such thick wet waxy growths or the baytree collect the ingredients of its perfume but there they all grew together healthy happy and happymaking as though rooted in a fathom of black soil  nor was it only vegetable life that prospered we had indeed few birds and none that had much of a voice or anything worthy to be called a song my morning comrade had a thin chirp unmusical and monotonous but friendly and pleasant to hear he had but one rival a fellow with an ostentatious cry of near an octave descending not one note of which properly followed another this is the only bird i ever knew with a wrong ear but there was something enthralling about his performance you listened and listened thinking each time he must surely get it right but no it was always wrong and always wrong the same way yet he seemed proud of his song delivered it with execution and a manner of his own and was charming to his mate a very incorrect incessant human whistler had thus a chance of knowing how his own music pleased the world two great birdseagles we thoughtdwelt at the top of the caÃ±on among the crags that were printed on the sky now and again but very rarely they wheeled high over our heads in silence or with a distant dying scream and then with a fresh impulse winged fleetly forward dipped over a hilltop and were gone they seemed solemn and ancient things sailing the blue air perhaps coeval with the mountain where they haunted perhaps emigrants from rome where the glad legions may have shouted to behold them on the morn of battle  but if birds were rare the place abounded with rattlesnakesthe rattlesnakes nest it might have been named wherever we brushed among the bushes our passage woke their angry buzz one dwelt habitually in the woodpile and sometimes when we came for firewood thrust up his small head between two logs and hissed at the intrusion the rattle has a legendary credit it is said to be aweinspiring and once heard to stamp itself for ever in the memory but the sound is not at all alarming the hum of many insects and the buzz of the wasp convince the ear of danger quite as readily as a matter of fact we lived for weeks in silverado coming and going with rattles sprung on every side and it never occurred to us to be afraid i used to take sunbaths and do calisthenics in a certain pleasant nook among azalea and calcanthus the rattles whizzing on every side like spinningwheels and the combined hiss or buzz rising louder and angrier at any sudden movement but i was never in the least impressed nor ever attacked it was only towards the end of our stay that a man down at calistoga who was expatiating on the terrifying nature of the sound gave me at last a very good imitation and it burst on me at once that we dwelt in the very metropolis of deadly snakes and that the rattle was simply the commonest noise in silverado immediately on our return we attacked the hansons on the subject they had formerly assured us that our caÃ±on was favoured like ireland with an entire immunity from poisonous reptiles but with the perfect inconsequence of the natural man they were no sooner found out than they went off at score in the contrary direction and we were told that in no part of the world did rattlesnakes attain to such a monstrous bigness as among the warm flowerdotted rocks of silverado this is a contribution rather to the natural history of the hansons than to that of snakes  one person however better served by his instinct had known the rattle from the first and that was chuchu the dog no rational creature has ever led an existence more poisoned by terror than that dogs at silverado every whiz of the rattle made him bound his eyes rolled he trembled he would be often wet with sweat one of our great mysteries was his terror of the mountain a little away above our nook the azaleas and almost all the vegetation ceased dwarf pines not big enough to be christmas trees grew thinly among loose stones and gravel scaurs here and there a big boulder sat quiescent on a knoll having paused there till the next rain in his long slide down the mountain there was here no ambuscade for the snakes you could see clearly where you trod and yet the higher i went the more abject and appealing became chuchus terror he was an excellent master of that composite language in which dogs communicate with men and he would assure me on his honour that there was some peril on the mountain appeal to me by all that i held holy to turn back and at length finding all was in vain and that i still persisted ignorantly foolhardy he would suddenly whip round and make a beeline down the slope for silverado the gravel showering after him what was he afraid of there were admittedly brown bears and californian lions on the mountain and a grizzly visited rufes poultry yard not long before to the unspeakable alarm of caliban who dashed out to chastise the intruder and found himself by moonlight face to face with such a tartar something at least there must have been some hairy dangerous brute lodged permanently among the rocks a little to the northwest of silverado spending his summer thereabout with wife and family  and there was or there had been another animal once under the broad daylight on that open stony hillside where the baby pines were growing scarcely tall enough to be a badge for a macgregors bonnet i came suddenly upon his innocent body lying mummified by the dry air and sun a pigmy kangaroo i am ingloriously ignorant of these subjects had never heard of such a beast thought myself face to face with some incomparable sport of nature and began to cherish hopes of immortality in science rarely have i been conscious of a stranger thrill than when i raised that singular creature from the stones dry as a board his innocent heart long quiet and all warm with sunshine his long hind legs were stiff his tiny forepaws clutched upon his breast as if to leap his poor life cut short upon that mountain by some unknown accident but the kangaroo rat it proved was no such unknown animal and my discovery was nothing  crickets were not wanting i thought i could make out exactly four of them each with a corner of his own who used to make night musical at silverado in the matter of voice they far excelled the birds and their ringing whistle sounded from rock to rock calling and replying the same thing as in a meaningless opera thus children in full health and spirits shout together to the dismay of neighbours and their idle happy deafening vociferations rise and fall like the song of the crickets i used to sit at night on the platform and wonder why these creatures were so happy and what was wrong with man that he also did not wind up his days with an hour or two of shouting but i suspect that all longlived animals are solemn the dogs alone are hardly used by nature and it seems a manifest injustice for poor chuchu to die in his teens after a life so shadowed and troubled continually shaken with alarm and the tear of elegant sentiment permanently in his eye  there was another neighbour of ours at silverado small but very active a destructive fellow this was a black ugly flya bore the hansons called himwho lived by hundreds in the boarding of our house he entered by a round hole more neatly pierced than a man could do it with a gimlet and he seems to have spent his life in cutting out the interior of the plank but whether as a dwelling or a storehouse i could never find when i used to lie in bed in the morning for a restwe had no easychairs in silveradoi would hear hour after hour the sharp cutting sound of his labours and from time to time a dainty shower of sawdust would fall upon the blankets there lives no more industrious creature than a bore  and now that i have named to the reader all our animals and insects without exceptiononly i find i have forgotten the flieshe will be able to appreciate the singular privacy and silence of our days it was not only man who was excluded animals the song of birds the lowing of cattle the bleating of sheep clouds even and the variations of the weather were here also wanting and as day after day the sky was one dome of blue and the pines below us stood motionless in the still air so the hours themselves were marked out from each other only by the series of our own affairs and the suns great period as he ranged westward through the heavens the two birds cackled awhile in the early morning all day the water tinkled in the shaft the bores ground sawdust in the planking of our crazy palaceinfinitesimal sounds and it was only with the return of night that any change would fall on our surroundings or the four crickets begin to flute together in the dark  indeed it would be hard to exaggerate the pleasure that we took in the approach of evening our day was not very long but it was very tiring to trip along unsteady planks or wade among shifting stones to go to and fro for water to clamber down the glen to the toll house after meat and letters to cook to make fires and beds were all exhausting to the body life out of doors besides under the fierce eye of day draws largely on the animal spirits there are certain hours in the afternoon when a man unless he is in strong health or enjoys a vacant mind would rather creep into a cool corner of a house and sit upon the chairs of civilisation about that time the sharp stones the planks the upturned boxes of silverado began to grow irksome to my body i set out on that hopeless neverending quest for a more comfortable posture i would be fevered and weary of the staring sun and just then he would begin courteously to withdraw his countenance the shadows lengthened the aromatic airs awoke and an indescribable but happy change announced the coming of the night  the hours of evening when we were once curtained in the friendly dark sped lightly even as with the crickets night brought to us a certain spirit of rejoicing it was good to taste the air good to mark the dawning of the stars as they increased their glittering company good too to gather stones and send them crashing down the chute a wave of light it seemed in some way the reward and the fulfilment of the day so it is when men dwell in the open air it is one of the simple pleasures that we lose by living cribbed and covered in a house that though the coming of the day is still the most inspiriting yet days departure also and the return of night refresh renew and quiet us and in the pastures of the dusk we stand like cattle exulting in the absence of the load  our nights were never cold and they were always still but for one remarkable exception regularly about nine oclock a warm wind sprang up and blew for ten minutes or maybe a quarter of an hour right down the caÃ±on fanning it well out airing it as a mother airs the night nursery before the children sleep as far as i could judge in the clear darkness of the night this wind was purely local perhaps dependent on the configuration of the glen at least it was very welcome to the hot and weary squatters and if we were not abed already the springing up of this lilliputian valleywind would often be our signal to retire  i was the last to go to bed as i was still the first to rise many a night i have strolled about the platform taking a bath of darkness before i slept the rest would be in bed and even from the forge i could hear them talking together from bunk to bunk a single candle in the neck of a pint bottle was their only illumination and yet the old cracked house seemed literally bursting with the light it shone keen as a knife through all the vertical chinks it struck upward through the broken shingles and through the eastern door and window it fell in a great splash upon the thicket and the overhanging rock you would have said a conflagration or at the least a roaring forge and behold it was but a candle or perhaps it was yet more strange to see the procession moving bedwards round the corner of the house and up the plank that brought us to the bedroom door under the immense spread of the starry heavens down in a crevice of the giant mountain these few human shapes with their unshielded taper made so disproportionate a figure in the eye and mind but the more he is alone with nature the greater man and his doings bulk in the consideration of his fellowmen miles and miles away upon the opposite hilltops if there were any hunter belated or any traveller who had lost his way he must have stood and watched and wondered from the time the candle issued from the door of the assayers office till it had mounted the plank and disappeared again into the miners dormitory                             virginibus puerisque                            and other papers                                 dedication   my dear william ernest henley  we are all busy in this world building towers of babel and the child of our imaginations is always a changeling when it comes from nurse this is not only true in the greatest as of wars and folios but in the least also like the trifling volume in your hand thus i began to write these papers with a definite end i was to be the advocatus not i hope diaboli but juventutis i was to state temperately the beliefs of youth as opposed to the contentions of age to go over all the field where the two differ and produce at last a little volume of special pleadings which i might call without misnomer life at twentyfive but times kept changing and i shared in the change i clung hard to that entrancing age but with the best will no man can be twentyfive for ever the old ruddy convictions deserted me and along with them the style that fits their presentation and defence i saw and indeed my friends informed me that the game was up a good part of the volume would answer to the longprojected title but the shadows of the prisonhouse are on the rest  it is good to have been young in youth and as years go on to grow older many are already old before they are through their teens but to travel deliberately through ones ages is to get the heart out of a liberal education times change opinions vary to their opposite and still this world appears a brave gymnasium full of seabathing and horseexercise and bracing manly virtues and what can be more encouraging than to find the friend who was welcome at one age still welcome at another our affections and beliefs are wiser than we the best that is in us is better than we can understand for it is grounded beyond experience and guides us blindfold but safe from one age on to another  these papers are like milestones on the wayside of my life and as i look back in memory there is hardly a stage of that distance but i see you present with advice reproof or praise meanwhile many things have changed you and i among the rest but i hope that our sympathy founded on the love of our art and nourished by mutual assistance shall survive these little revolutions undiminished and with gods help unite us to the end                                                            r l s    davos platz 1881                                         i                            virginibus puerisque                                       i  with the single exception of falstaff all shakespeares characters are what we call marrying men mercutio as he was own cousin to benedick and biron would have come to the same end in the long run even iago had a wife and what is far stranger he was jealous people like jacques and the fool in lear although we can hardly imagine they would ever marry keep single out of a cynical humour or for a broken heart and not as we do nowadays from a spirit of incredulity and preference for the single state for that matter if you turn to george sands french version of as you like it and i think i can promise you will like it but little you will find jacques marries celia just as orlando marries rosalind  at least there seems to have been much less hesitation over marriage in shakespeares days and what hesitation there was was of a laughing sort and not much more serious one way or the other than that of panurge in modern comedies the heroes are mostly of benedicks way of thinking but twice as much in earnest and not one quarter so confident and i take this diffidence as a proof of how sincere their terror is they know they are only human after all they know what gins and pitfalls lie about their feet and how the shadow of matrimony waits resolute and awful at the crossroads they would wish to keep their liberty but if that may not be why gods will be done what are you afraid of marriage asks cÃ©cile in maÃ®tre guerin oh mon dieu non replies arthur i should take chloroform they look forward to marriage much in the same way as they prepare themselves for death each seems inevitable each is a great perhaps and a leap into the dark for which when a man is in the blue devils he has specially to harden his heart that splendid scoundrel maxime de trailles took the news of marriages much as an old man hears the deaths of his contemporaries cest dÃ©sespÃ©rant he cried throwing himself down in the armchair at madame schontzs cest dÃ©sespÃ©rant nous nous marions tous every marriage was like another grey hair on his head and the jolly churchbells seemed to taunt him with his fifty years and fair round belly  the fact is we are much more afraid of life than our ancestors and cannot find it in our hearts either to marry or not to marry marriage is terrifying but so is a cold and forlorn old age the friendships of men are vastly agreeable but they are insecure you know all the time that one friend will marry and put you to the door a second accept a situation in china and become no more to you than a name a reminiscence and an occasional crossed letter very laborious to read a third will take up with some religious crotchet and treat you to sour looks thenceforward so in one way or another life forces men apart and breaks up the goodly fellowships for ever the very flexibility and ease which make mens friendships so agreeable while they endure make them the easier to destroy and forget and a man who has a few friends or one who has a dozen if there be any one so wealthy on this earth cannot forget on how precarious a base his happiness reposes and how by a stroke or two of fatea death a few light words a piece of stamped paper a womans bright eyeshe may be left in a month destitute of all marriage is certainly a perilous remedy instead of on two or three you stake your happiness on one life only but still as the bargain is more explicit and complete on your part it is more so on the other and you have not to fear so many contingencies it is not every wind that can blow you from your anchorage and so long as death withholds his sickle you will always have a friend at home people who share a cell in the bastile or are thrown together on an uninhabited isle if they do not immediately fall to fisticuffs will find some possible ground of compromise they will learn each others ways and humours so as to know where they must go warily and where they may lean their whole weight the discretion of the first years becomes the settled habit of the last and so with wisdom and patience two lives may grow indissolubly into one  but marriage if comfortable is not at all heroic it certainly narrows and damps the spirits of generous men in marriage a man becomes slack and selfish and undergoes a fatty degeneration of his moral being it is not only when lydgate misallies himself with rosamond vincy but when ladislaw marries above him with dorothea that this may be exemplified the air of the fireside withers out all the fine wildings of the husbands heart he is so comfortable and happy that he begins to prefer comfort and happiness to everything else on earth his wife included yesterday he would have shared his last shilling today his first duty is to his family and is fulfilled in large measure by laying down vintages and husbanding the health of an invaluable parent twenty years ago this man was equally capable of crime or heroism now he is fit for neither his soul is asleep and you may speak without constraint you will not wake him it is not for nothing that don quixote was a bachelor and marcus aurelius married ill for women there is less of this danger marriage is of so much use to a woman opens out to her so much more of life and puts her in the way of so much more freedom and usefulness that whether she marry ill or well she can hardly miss some benefit it is true however that some of the merriest and most genuine of women are old maids and that those old maids and wives who are unhappily married have often most of the true motherly touch and this would seem to show even for women some narrowing influence in comfortable married life but the rule is none the less certain if you wish the pick of men and women take a good bachelor and a good wife  i am often filled with wonder that so many marriages are passably successful and so few come to open failure the more so as i fail to understand the principle on which people regulate their choice i see women marrying indiscriminately with staring burgesses and ferretfaced whiteeyed boys and men dwell in contentment with noisy scullions or taking into their lives acidulous vestals it is a common answer to say the good people marry because they fall in love and of course you may use and misuse a word as much as you please if you have the world along with you but love is at least a somewhat hyperbolical expression for such lukewarm preference it is not here anyway that love employs his golden shafts he cannot be said with any fitness of language to reign here and revel indeed if this be love at all it is plain the poets have been fooling with mankind since the foundation of the world and you have only to look these happy couples in the face to see they have never been in love or in hate or in any other high passion all their days when you see a dish of fruit at dessert you sometimes set your affections upon one particular peach or nectarine watch it with some anxiety as it comes round the table and feel quite a sensible disappointment when it is taken by some one else i have used the phrase high passion well i should say this was about as high a passion as generally leads to marriage one husband hears after marriage that some poor fellow is dying of his wifes love what a pity he exclaims you know i could so easily have got another and yet that is a very happy union or again a young man was telling me the sweet story of his loves i like it well enough as long as her sisters are there said this amorous swain but i dont know what to do when were alone once more a married lady was debating the subject with another lady you know dear said the first after ten years of marriage if he is nothing else your husband is always an old friend i have many old friends returned the other but i prefer them to be nothing more oh perhaps i might prefer that also there is a common note in these three illustrations of the modern idyll and it must be owned the god goes among us with a limping gait and blear eyes you wonder whether it was so always whether desire was always equally dull and spiritless and possession equally cold i cannot help fancying most people make ere they marry some such table of recommendations as hannah godwin wrote to her brother william anent her friend miss gay it is so charmingly comical and so pat to the occasion that i must quote a few phrases the young lady is in every sense formed to make one of your disposition really happy she has a pleasing voice with which she accompanies her musical instrument with judgment she has an easy politeness in her manners neither free nor reserved she is a good housekeeper and a good economist and yet of a generous disposition as to her internal accomplishments i have reason to speak still more highly of them good sense without vanity a penetrating judgment without a disposition to satire with about as much religion as my william likes struck me with a wish that she was my williams wife that is about the tune pleasing voice moderate good looks unimpeachable internal accomplishments after the style of the copybook with about as much religion as my william likes and then with all speed to church  to deal plainly if they only married when they fell in love most people would die unwed and among the others there would be not a few tumultuous households the lion is the king of beasts but he is scarcely suitable for a domestic pet in the same way i suspect love is rather too violent a passion to make in all cases a good domestic sentiment like other violent excitements it throws up not only what is best but what is worst and smallest in mens characters just as some people are malicious in drink or brawling and virulent under the influence of religious feeling some are moody jealous and exacting when they are in love who are honest downright goodhearted fellows enough in the everyday affairs and humours of the world  how then seeing we are driven to the hypothesis that people choose in comparatively cold blood how is it they choose so well one is almost tempted to hint that it does not much matter whom you marry that in fact marriage is a subjective affection and if you have made up your mind to it and once talked yourself fairly over you could pull it through with anybody but even if we take matrimony at its lowest even if we regard it as no more than a sort of friendship recognised by the police there must be degrees in the freedom and sympathy realised and some principle to guide simple folk in their selection now what should this principle be are there no more definite rules than are to be found in the prayerbook law and religion forbid the banns on the ground of propinquity or consanguinity society steps in to separate classes and in all this most critical matter has common sense has wisdom never a word to say in the absence of more magisterial teaching let us talk it over between friends even a few guesses may be of interest to youths and maidens  in all that concerns eating and drinking company climate and ways of life community of taste is to be sought for it would be trying for instance to keep bed and board with an early riser or a vegetarian in matters of art and intellect i believe it is of no consequence certainly it is of none in the companionships of men who will dine more readily with one who has a good heart a good cellar and a humorous tongue than with another who shares all their favourite hobbies and is melancholy withal if your wife likes tupper that is no reason why you should hang your head she thinks with the majority and has the courage of her opinions i have always suspected public taste to be a mongrel product out of affectation by dogmatism and felt sure if you could only find an honest man of no special literary bent he would tell you he thought much of shakespeare bombastic and most absurd and all of him written in very obscure english and wearisome to read and not long ago i was able to lay by my lantern in content for i found the honest man he was a fellow of parts quick humorous a clever painter and with an eye for certain poetical effects of sea and ships i am not much of a judge of that kind of thing but a sketch of his comes before me sometimes at night how strong supple and living the ship seems upon the billows with what a dip and rake she shears the flying sea i cannot fancy the man who saw this effect and took it on the wing with so much force and spirit was what you call commonplace in the last recesses of the heart and yet he thought and was not ashamed to have it known of him that ouida was better in every way than william shakespeare if there were more people of his honesty this would be about the staple of lay criticism it is not taste that is plentiful but courage that is rare and what have we in place how many who think no otherwise than the young painter have we not heard disbursing secondhand hyperboles have you never turned sick at heart o best of critics when some of your own sweet adjectives were returned on you before a gaping audience enthusiasm about art is become a function of the average female being which she performs with precision and a sort of haunting sprightliness like an ingenious and wellregulated machine sometimes alas the calmest man is carried away in the torrent bandies adjectives with the best and outherods herod for some shameful moments when you remember that you will be tempted to put things strongly and say you will marry no one who is not like george the second and cannot state openly a distaste for poetry and painting  the word facts is in some ways crucial i have spoken with jesuits and plymouth brethren mathematicians and poets dogmatic republicans and dear old gentlemen in birdseye neckcloths and each understood the word facts in an occult sense of his own try as i might i could get no nearer the principle of their division what was essential to them seemed to me trivial or untrue we could come to no compromise as to what was or what was not important in the life of man turn as we pleased we all stood back to back in a big ring and saw another quarter of the heavens with different mountaintops along the skyline and different constellations overhead we had each of us some whimsy in the brain which we believed more than anything else and which discoloured all experience to its own shade how would you have people agree when one is deaf and the other blind now this is where there should be community between man and wife they should be agreed on their catchword in facts of religion or facts of science or society my dear for without such an agreement all intercourse is a painful strain upon the mind about as much religion as my william likes in short that is what is necessary to make a happy couple of any william and his spouse for there are differences which no habit nor affection can reconcile and the bohemian must not intermarry with the pharisee imagine consuelo as mrs samuel budget the wife of the successful merchant the best of men and the best of women may sometimes live together all their lives and for want of some consent on fundamental questions hold each other lost spirits to the end  a certain sort of talent is almost indispensable for people who would spend years together and not bore themselves to death but the talent like the agreement must be for and about life to dwell happily together they should be versed in the niceties of the heart and born with a faculty for willing compromise the woman must be talented as a woman and it will not much matter although she is talented in nothing else she must know her mÃ©tier de femme and have a fine touch for the affections and it is more important that a person should be a good gossip and talk pleasantly and smartly of common friends and the thousand and one nothings of the day and hour than that she should speak with the tongues of men and angels for a while together by the fire happens more frequently in marriage than the presence of a distinguished foreigner to dinner that people should laugh over the same sort of jests and have many a story of grouse in the gunroom many an old joke between them which time cannot wither nor custom stale is a better preparation for life by your leave than many other things higher and better sounding in the worlds ears you could read kant by yourself if you wanted but you must share a joke with some one else you can forgive people who do not follow you through a philosophical disquisition but to find your wife laughing when you had tears in your eyes or staring when you were in a fit of laughter would go some way towards a dissolution of the marriage  i know a woman who from some distaste or disability could never so much as understand the meaning of the word politics and has given up trying to distinguish whigs from tories but take her on her own politics ask her about other men or women and the chicanery of everyday existencethe rubs the tricks the vanities on which life turnsand you will not find many more shrewd trenchant and humorous nay to make plainer what i have in mind this same woman has a share of the higher and more poetical understanding frank interest in things for their own sake and enduring astonishment at the most common she is not to be deceived by custom or made to think a mystery solved when it is repeated i have heard her say she could wonder herself crazy over the human eyebrow now in a world where most of us walk very contentedly in the little lit circle of their own reason and have to be reminded of what lies without by specious and clamant exceptionsearthquakes eruptions of vesuvius banjos floating in midair at a sÃ©ance and the likea mind so fresh and unsophisticated is no despicable gift i will own i think it a better sort of mind than goes necessarily with the clearest views on public business it will wash it will find something to say at an odd moment it has in it the spring of pleasant and quaint fancies whereas i can imagine myself yawning all night long until my jaws ached and the tears came into my eyes although my companion on the other side of the hearth held the most enlightened opinions on the franchise or the ballot  the question of professions in as far as they regard marriage was only interesting to women until of late days but it touches all of us now certainly if i could help it i would never marry a wife who wrote the practice of letters is miserably harassing to the mind and after an hour or twos work all the more human portion of the author is extinct he will bully backbite and speak daggers music i hear is not much better but painting on the contrary is often highly sedative because so much of the labour after your picture is once begun is almost entirely manual and of that skilled sort of manual labour which offers a continual series of successes and so tickles a man through his vanity into good humour alas in letters there is nothing of this sort you may write as beautiful a hand as you will you have always something else to think of and cannot pause to notice your loops and flourishes they are beside the mark and the first law stationer could put you to the blush rousseau indeed made some account of penmanship even made it a source of livelihood when he copied out the hÃ©loÃ¯se for dilettante ladies and therein showed that strange eccentric prudence which guided him among so many thousand follies and insanities it would be well for all of the genus irritabile thus to add something of skilled labour to intangible brainwork to find the right word is so doubtful a success and lies so near to failure that there is no satisfaction in a year of it but we all know when we have formed a letter perfectly and a stupid artist right or wrong is almost equally certain he has found a right tone or a right colour or made a dexterous stroke with his brush and again painters may work out of doors and the fresh air the deliberate seasons and the tranquillising influence of the green earth counterbalance the fever of thought and keep them cool placable and prosaic  a ship captain is a good man to marry if it is a marriage of love for absences are a good influence in love and keep it bright and delicate but he is just the worst man if the feeling is more pedestrian as habit is too frequently torn open and the solder has never time to set men who fish botanise work with the turninglathe or gather seaweeds will make admirable husbands and a little amateur painting in watercolour shows the innocent and quiet mind those who have a few intimates are to be avoided while those who swim loose who have their hat in their hand all along the street who can number an infinity of acquaintances and are not chargeable with any one friend promise an easy disposition and no rival to the wifes influence i will not say they are the best of men but they are the stuff out of which adroit and capable women manufacture the best of husbands it is to be noticed that those who have loved once or twice already are so much the better educated to a womans hand the bright boy of fiction is an odd and most uncomfortable mixture of shyness and coarseness and needs a deal of civilising lastly and this is perhaps the golden rule no woman should marry a teetotaller or a man who does not smoke it is not for nothing that this ignoble tabagie as michelet calls it spreads over all the world michelet rails against it because it renders you happy apart from thought or work to provident women this will seem no evil influence in married life whatever keeps a man in the front garden whatever checks wandering fancy and all inordinate ambition whatever makes for lounging and contentment makes just so surely for domestic happiness  these notes if they amuse the reader at all will probably amuse him more when he differs than when he agrees with them at least they will do no harm for nobody will follow my advice but the last word is of more concern marriage is a step so grave and decisive that it attracts lightheaded variable men by its very awfulness they have been so tried among the inconstant squalls and currents so often sailed for islands in the air or lain becalmed with burning heart that they will risk all for solid ground below their feet desperate pilots they run their seasick weary barque upon the dashing rocks it seems as if marriage were the royal road through life and realised on the instant what we have all dreamed on summer sundays when the bells ring or at night when we cannot sleep for the desire of living they think it will sober and change them like those who join a brotherhood they fancy it needs but an act to be out of the coil and clamour for ever but this is a wile of the devils to the end spring winds will sow disquietude passing faces leave a regret behind them and the whole world keep calling and calling in their ears for marriage is like life in thisthat it is a field of battle and not a bed of roses                                      ii  hope they say deserts us at no period of our existence from first to last and in the face of smarting disillusions we continue to expect good fortune better health and better conduct and that so confidently that we judge it needless to deserve them i think it improbable that i shall ever write like shakespeare conduct an army like hannibal or distinguish myself like marcus aurelius in the paths of virtue and yet i have my bydays hope prompting when i am very ready to believe that i shall combine all these various excellences in my own person and go marching down to posterity with divine honours there is nothing so monstrous but we can believe it of ourselves about ourselves about our aspirations and delinquencies we have dwelt by choice in a delicious vagueness from our boyhood up no one will have forgotten tom sawyers aspiration ah if he could only die temporarily or perhaps better still the inward resolution of the two pirates that so long as they remained in that business their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing here we recognise the thoughts of our boyhood and our boyhood ceasedwell whennot i think at twenty nor perhaps altogether at twentyfive nor yet at thirty and possibly to be quite frank we are still in the thick of that arcadian period for as the race of man after centuries of civilisation still keeps some traits of their barbarian fathers so man the individual is not altogether quit of youth when he is already old and honoured and lord chancellor of england we advance in years somewhat in the manner of an invading army in a barren land the age that we have reached as the phrase goes we but hold with an outpost and still keep open our communications with the extreme rear and first beginnings of the march there is our true base that is not only the beginning but the perennial spring of our faculties and grandfather william can retire upon occasion into the green enchanted forest of his boyhood  the unfading boyishness of hope and its vigorous irrationality are nowhere better displayed than in questions of conduct there is a character in the pilgrims progress one mr lingerafterlust with whom i fancy we are all on speaking terms one famous among the famous for ingenuity of hope up to and beyond the moment of defeat one who after eighty years of contrary experience will believe it possible to continue in the business of piracy and yet avoid the guilt of theft every sin is our last every 1st of january a remarkable turningpoint in our career any overt act above all is felt to be alchemic in its power to change a drunkard takes the pledge it will be strange if that does not help him for how many years did mr pepys continue to make and break his little vows and yet i have not heard that he was discouraged in the end by such steps we think to fix a momentary resolution as a timid fellow hies him to the dentists while the tooth is stinging  but alas by planting a stake at the top of flood you can neither prevent nor delay the inevitable ebb there is no hocuspocus in morality and even the sanctimonious ceremony of marriage leaves the man unchanged this is a hard saying and has an air of paradox for there is something in marriage so natural and inviting that the step has an air of great simplicity and ease it offers to bury for ever many aching preoccupations it is to afford us unfailing and familiar company through life it opens up a smiling prospect of the blest and passive kind of love rather than the blessing and active it is approached not only through the delights of courtship but by a public performance and repeated legal signatures a man naturally thinks it will go hard with him if he cannot be good and fortunate and happy within such august circumvallations  and yet there is probably no other act in a mans life so hotheaded and foolhardy as this one of marriage for years let us suppose you have been making the most indifferent business of your career your experience has not we may dare to say been more encouraging than pauls or horaces like them you have seen and desired the good that you were not able to accomplish like them you have done the evil that you loathed you have walked at night in a hot or a cold sweat according to your habit of body remembering with dismal surprise your own unpardonable acts and sayings you have been sometimes tempted to withdraw entirely from this game of life as a man who makes nothing but misses withdraws from that less dangerous one of billiards you have fallen back upon the thought that you yourself most sharply smarted for your misdemeanours or in the old plaintive phrase that you were nobodys enemy but your own and then you have been made aware of what was beautiful and amiable wise and kind in the other part of your behaviour and it seemed as if nothing could reconcile the contradiction as indeed nothing can if you are a man you have shut your mouth hard and said nothing and if you are only a man in the making you have recognised that yours was quite a special case and you yourself not guilty of your own pestiferous career  granted and with all my heart let us accept these apologies let us agree that you are nobodys enemy but your own let us agree that you are a sort of moral cripple impotent for good and let us regard you with the unmingled pity due to such a fate but there is one thing to which on these terms we can never agreewe can never agree to have you marry what you have had one life to manage and have failed so strangely and now can see nothing wiser than to conjoin with it the management of some one elses because you have been unfaithful in a very little you propose yourself to be a ruler over ten cities you strip yourself by such a step of all remaining consolations and excuses you are no longer content to be your own enemy you must be your wifes also you have been hitherto in a mere subaltern attitude dealing cruel blows about you in life yet only half responsible since you came there by no choice or movement of your own now it appears you must take things on your own authority god made you but you marry yourself and for all that your wife suffers no one is responsible but you a man must be very certain of his knowledge ere he undertake to guide a ticketofleave man through a dangerous pass you have eternally missed your way in life with consequences that you still deplore and yet you masterfully seize your wifes hand and blindfold drag her after you to ruin and it is your wife you observe whom you select her whose happiness you most desire you choose to be your victim you would earnestly warn her from a tottering bridge or bad investment if she were to marry some one else how you would tremble for her fate if she were only your sister and you thought half as much of her how doubtfully would you entrust her future to a man no better than yourself  times are changed with him who marries there are no more bypath meadows where you may innocently linger but the road lies long and straight and dusty to the grave idleness which is often becoming and even wise in the bachelor begins to wear a different aspect when you have a wife to support suppose after you are married one of those little slips were to befall you what happened last november might surely happen february next they may have annoyed you at the time because they were not what you had meant but how will they annoy you in the future and how will they shake the fabric of your wifes confidence and peace a thousand things unpleasing went on in the chiaroscuro of a life that you shrank from too particularly realising you did not care in those days to make a fetish of your conscience you would recognise your failures with a nod and so good day but the time for these reserves is over you have wilfully introduced a witness into your life the scene of these defeats and can no longer close the minds eye upon uncomely passages but must stand up straight and put a name upon your actions and your witness is not only the judge but the victim of your sins not only can she condemn you to the sharpest penalties but she must herself share feelingly in their endurance and observe once more with what temerity you have chosen precisely her to be your spy whose esteem you value highest and whom you have already taught to think you better than you are you may think you had a conscience and believed in god but what is a conscience to a wife wise men of yore erected statues of their deities and consciously performed their part in life before those marble eyes a god watched them at the board and stood by their bedside in the morning when they woke and all about their ancient cities where they bought and sold or where they piped and wrestled there would stand some symbol of the things that are outside of man these were lessons delivered in the quiet dialect of art which told their story faithfully but gently it is the same lesson if you willbut how harrowingly taughtwhen the woman you respect shall weep from your unkindness or blush with shame at your misconduct poor girls in italy turn their painted madonnas to the wall you cannot set aside your wife to marry is to domesticate the recording angel once you are married there is nothing left for you not even suicide but to be good  and goodness in marriage is a more intricate problem than mere single virtue for in marriage there are two ideals to be realised a girl it is true has always lived in a glass house among reproving relatives whose word was law she has been bred up to sacrifice her judgments and take the key submissively from dear papa and it is wonderful how swiftly she can change her tune into the husbands her morality has been too often an affair of precept and conformity but in the case of a bachelor who has enjoyed some measure both of privacy and freedom his moral judgments have been passed in some accordance with his nature his sins were always sins in his own sight he could then only sin when he did some act against his clear conviction the light that he walked by was obscure but it was single now when two people of any grit and spirit put their fortunes into one there succeeds to this comparative certainty a huge welter of competing jurisdictions it no longer matters so much how life appears to one one must consult another one who may be strong must not offend the other who is weak the only weak brother i am willing to consider is to make a bull for once my wife for her and for her only i must waive my righteous judgments and go crookedly about my life how then in such an atmosphere of compromise to keep honour bright and abstain from base capitulations how are you to put aside loves pleadings how are you the apostle of laxity to turn suddenly about into the rabbi of precision and after these years of ragged practice pose for a hero to the lackey who has found you out in this temptation to mutual indulgence lies the particular peril to morality in married life daily they drop a little lower from the first ideal and for a while continue to accept these changelings with a gross complacency at last love awakes and looks about him find his hero sunk into a stout old brute intent on brandy pawnee finds his heroine divested of her angel brightness and in the flash of that first disenchantment flees for ever  again the husband in these unions is usually a man and the wife commonly enough a woman and when this is the case although it makes the firmer marriage a thick additional veil of misconception hangs above the doubtful business women i believe are somewhat rarer than men but then if i were a woman myself i daresay i should hold the reverse and at least we all enter more or less wholly into one or other of these camps a man who delights women by his feminine perceptions will often scatter his admirers by a chance explosion of the under side of man and the most masculine and direct of women will some day to your dire surprise draw out like a telescope into successive lengths of personation alas for the man knowing her to be at heart more candid than himself who shall flounder panting through these mazes in the quest for truth the proper qualities of each sex are indeed eternally surprising to the other between the latin and the teuton races there are similar divergencies not to be bridged by the most liberal sympathy and in the good plain cutanddry explanations of this life which pass current among us as the wisdom of the elders this difficulty has been turned with the aid of pious lies thus when a young lady has angelic features eats nothing to speak of plays all day long on the piano and sings ravishingly in church it requires a rough infidelity falsely called cynicism to believe that she may be a little devil after all yet so it is she may be a talebearer a liar and a thief she may have a taste for brandy and no heart my compliments to george eliot for her rosamond vincy the ugly work of satire she has transmuted to the ends of art by the companion figure of lydgate and the satire was much wanted for the education of young men that doctrine of the excellence of women however chivalrous is cowardly as well as false it is better to face the fact and know when you marry that you take into your life a creature of equal if of unlike frailties whose weak human heart beats no more tunefully than yours  but it is the object of a liberal education not only to obscure the knowledge of one sex by another but to magnify the natural differences between the two man is a creature who lives not upon bread alone but principally by catchwords and the little rift between the sexes is astonishingly widened by simply teaching one set of catchwords to the girls and another to the boys to the first there is shown but a very small field of experience and taught a very trenchant principle for judgment and action to the other the world of life is more largely displayed and their rule of conduct is proportionally widened they are taught to follow different virtues to hate different vices to place their ideal even for each other in different achievements what should be the result of such a course when a horse has run away and the two flustered people in the gig have each possessed themselves of a rein we know the end of that conveyance will be in the ditch so when i see a raw youth and a green girl fluted and fiddled in a dancing measure into that most serious contract and setting out upon lifes journey with ideas so monstrously divergent i am not surprised that some make shipwreck but that any come to port what the boy does almost proudly as a manly peccadillo the girl will shudder at as a debasing vice what is to her the mere common sense of tactics he will spit out of his mouth as shameful through such a sea of contrarieties must this green couple steer their way and contrive to love each other and to respect forsooth and be ready when the time arrives to educate the little men and women who shall succeed to their places and perplexities  and yet when all has been said the man who should hold back from marriage is in the same case with him who runs away from battle to avoid an occasion for our virtues is a worse degree of failure than to push forward pluckily and make a fall it is lawful to pray god that we be not led into temptation but not lawful to skulk from those that come to us the noblest passage in one of the noblest books of this century is where the old pope glories in the trial nay in the partial fall and but imperfect triumph of the younger hero3 without some such manly note it were perhaps better to have no conscience at all but there is a vast difference between teaching flight and showing points of peril that a man may march the more warily and the true conclusion of this paper is to turn our back on apprehensions and embrace that shining and courageous virtue faith hope is the boy a blind headlong pleasant fellow good to chase swallows with the salt faith is the grave experienced yet smiling man hope lives on ignorance openeyed faith is built upon a knowledge of our life of the tyranny of circumstance and the frailty of human resolution hope looks for unqualified success but faith counts certainly on failure and takes honourable defeat to be a form of victory hope is a kind old pagan but faith grew up in christian days and early learnt humility in the one temper a man is indignant that he cannot spring up in a clap to heights of elegance and virtue in the other out of a sense of his infirmities he is filled with confidence because a year has come and gone and he has still preserved some rags of honour in the first he expects an angel for a wife in the last he knows that she is like himselferring thoughtless and untrue but like himself also filled with a struggling radiancy of better things and adorned with ineffective qualities you may safely go to school with hope but ere you marry should have learned the mingled lesson of the world that dolls are stuffed with sawdust and yet are excellent playthings that hope and love address themselves to a perfection never realised and yet firmly held become the salt and staff of life that you yourself are compacted of infirmities perfect you might say in imperfection and yet you have a something in you lovable and worth preserving and that while the mass of mankind lies under this scurvy condemnation you will scarce find one but by some generous reading will become to you a lesson a model and a noble spouse through life so thinking you will constantly support your own unworthiness and easily forgive the failings of your friend nay you will be wisely glad that you retain the sense of blemishes for the faults of married people continually spur up each of them hour by hour to do better and to meet and love upon a higher ground and ever between the failures there will come glimpses of kind virtues to encourage and console   footnote    3 brownings the ring and the book                                     iii                            on falling in love                   lord what fools these mortals be  there is only one event in life which really astonishes a man and startles him out of his prepared opinions everything else befalls him very much as he expected event succeeds to event with an agreeable variety indeed but with little that is either startling or intense they form together no more than a sort of background or running accompaniment to the mans own reflections and he falls naturally into a cool curious and smiling habit of mind and builds himself up in a conception of life which expects tomorrow to be after the pattern of today and yesterday he may be accustomed to the vagaries of his friends and acquaintances under the influence of love he may sometimes look forward to it for himself with an incomprehensible expectation but it is a subject which neither intuition nor the behaviour of others will help the philosopher to the truth there is probably nothing rightly thought or rightly written on this matter of love that is not a piece of the persons experience i remember an anecdote of a wellknown french theorist who was debating a point eagerly in his cÃ©nacle it was objected against him that he had never experienced love whereupon he arose left the society and made it a point not to return to it until he considered that he had supplied the defect now he remarked on entering now i am in a position to continue the discussion perhaps he had not penetrated very deeply into the subject after all but the story indicates right thinking and may serve as an apologue to readers of this essay  when at last the scales fall from his eyes it is not without something of the nature of dismay that the man finds himself in such changed conditions he has to deal with commanding emotions instead of the easy dislikes and preferences in which he has hitherto passed his days and he recognises capabilities for pain and pleasure of which he had not yet suspected the existence falling in love is the one illogical adventure the one thing of which we are tempted to think as supernatural in our trite and reasonable world the effect is out of all proportion with the cause two persons neither of them it may be very amiable or very beautiful meet speak a little and look a little into each others eyes that has been done a dozen or so of times in the experience of either with no great result but on this occasion all is different they fall at once into that state in which another person becomes to us the very gist and centrepoint of gods creation and demolishes our laborious theories with a smile in which our ideas are so bound up with the one masterthought that even the trivial cares of our own person become so many acts of devotion and the love of life itself is translated into a wish to remain in the same world with so precious and desirable a fellowcreature and all the while their acquaintances look on in stupor and ask each other with almost passionate emphasis what soandso can see in that woman or suchanone in that man i am sure gentlemen i cannot tell you for my part i cannot think what the women mean it might be very well if the apollo belvedere should suddenly glow all over into life and step forward from the pedestal with that godlike air of his but of the misbegotten changelings who call themselves men and prate intolerably over dinnertables i never saw one who seemed worthy to inspire loveno nor read of any except leonardo da vinci and perhaps goethe in his youth about women i entertain a somewhat different opinion but there i have the misfortune to be a man  there are many matters in which you may waylay destiny and bid him stand and deliver hard work high thinking adventurous excitement and a great deal more that forms a part of this or the other persons spiritual bill of fare are within the reach of almost any one who can dare a little and be patient but it is by no means in the way of every one to fall in love you know the difficulty shakespeare was put into when queen elizabeth asked him to show falstaff in love i do not believe that henry fielding was ever in love scott if it were not for a passage or two in rob roy would give me very much the same effect these are great names and what is more to the purpose strong healthy highstrung and generous natures of whom the reverse might have been expected as for the innumerable army of anÃ¦mic and tailorish persons who occupy the face of this planet with so much propriety it is palpably absurd to imagine them in any such situation as a loveaffair a wet rag goes safely by the fire and if a man is blind he cannot expect to be much impressed by romantic scenery apart from all this many lovable people miss each other in the world or meet under some unfavourable star there is the nice and critical moment of declaration to be got over from timidity or lack of opportunity a good half of possible love cases never get so far and at least another quarter do there cease and determine a very adroit person to be sure manages to prepare the way and out with his declaration in the nick of time and then there is a fine solid sort of man who goes on from snub to snub and if he has to declare forty times will continue imperturbably declaring amid the astonished consideration of men and angels until he has a favourable answer i daresay if one were a woman one would like to marry a man who was capable of doing this but not quite one who had done so it is just a little bit abject and somehow just a little bit gross and marriages in which one of the parties has been thus battered into consent scarcely form agreeable subjects for meditation love should run out to meet love with open arms indeed the ideal story is that of two people who go into love step for step with a fluttered consciousness like a pair of children venturing together into a dark room from the first moment when they see each other with a pang of curiosity through stage after stage of growing pleasure and embarrassment they can read the expression of their own trouble in each others eyes there is here no declaration properly so called the feeling is so plainly shared that as soon as the man knows what it is in his own heart he is sure of what it is in the womans  this simple accident of falling in love is as beneficial as it is astonishing it arrests the petrifying influence of years disproves coldblooded and cynical conclusions and awakens dormant sensibilities hitherto the man had found it a good policy to disbelieve the existence of any enjoyment which was out of his reach and thus he turned his back upon the strong sunny parts of nature and accustomed himself to look exclusively on what was common and dull he accepted a prose ideal let himself go blind of many sympathies by disuse and if he were young and witty or beautiful wilfully forwent these advantages he joined himself to the following of what in the old mythology of love was prettily called nonchaloir and in an odd mixture of feelings a fling of selfrespect a preference for selfish liberty and a great dash of that fear with which honest people regard serious interests kept himself back from the straightforward course of life among certain selected activities and now all of a sudden he is unhorsed like st paul from his infidel affectation his heart which has been ticking accurate seconds for the last year gives a bound and begins to beat high and irregularly in his breast it seems as if he had never heard or felt or seen until that moment and by the report of his memory he must have lived his past life between sleep and waking or with the preoccupied attention of a brown study he is practically incommoded by the generosity of his feelings smiles much when he is alone and develops a habit of looking rather blankly upon the moon and stars but it is not at all within the province of a prose essayist to give a picture of this hyperbolical frame of mind and the thing has been done already and that to admiration in adelaÃ¯de in tennysons maud and in some of heines songs you get the absolute expression of this midsummer spirit romeo and juliet were very much in love although they tell me some german critics are of a different opinion probably the same who would have us think mercutio a dull fellow poor antony was in love and no mistake that lay figure marius in les misÃ©rables is also a genuine case in his own way and worth observation a good many of george sands people are thoroughly in love and so are a good many of george merediths altogether there is plenty to read on the subject if the root of the matter be in him and if he has the requisite chords to set in vibration a young man may occasionally enter with the key of art into that land of beulah which is upon the borders of heaven and within sight of the city of love there let him sit awhile to hatch delightful hopes and perilous illusions  one thing that accompanies the passion in its first blush is certainly difficult to explain it comes i do not quite see how that from having a very supreme sense of pleasure in all parts of lifein lying down to sleep in waking in motion in breathing in continuing to bethe lover begins to regard his happiness as beneficial for the rest of the world and highly meritorious in himself our race has never been able contentedly to suppose that the noise of its wars conducted by a few young gentlemen in a corner of an inconsiderable star does not reecho among the courts of heaven with quite a formidable effect in much the same taste when people find a great todo in their own breasts they imagine it must have some influence in their neighbourhood the presence of the two lovers is so enchanting to each other that it seems as if it must be the best thing possible for everybody else they are half inclined to fancy it is because of them and their love that the sky is blue and the sun shines and certainly the weather is usually fine while people are courting in point of fact although the happy man feels very kindly towards others of his own sex there is apt to be something too much of the magnifico in his demeanour if people grow presuming and selfimportant over such matters as a dukedom or the holy see they will scarcely support the dizziest elevation in life without some suspicion of a strut and the dizziest elevation is to love and be loved in return consequently accepted lovers are a trifle condescending in their address to other men an overweening sense of the passion and importance of life hardly conduces to simplicity of manner to women they feel very nobly very purely and very generously as if they were so many joanofarcs but this does not come out in their behaviour and they treat them to grandisonian airs marked with a suspicion of fatuity i am not quite certain that women do not like this sort of thing but really after having bemused myself over daniel deronda i have given up trying to understand what they like  if it did nothing else this sublime and ridiculous superstition that the pleasure of the pair is somehow blessed to others and everybody is made happier in their happiness would serve at least to keep love generous and greathearted nor is it quite a baseless superstition after all other lovers are hugely interested they strike the nicest balance between pity and approval when they see people aping the greatness of their own sentiments it is an understood thing in the play that while the young gentlefolk are courting on the terrace a rough flirtation is being carried on and a light trivial sort of love is growing up between the footman and the singing chambermaid as people are generally cast for the leading parts in their own imaginations the reader can apply the parallel to real life without much chance of going wrong in short they are quite sure this other loveaffair is not so deepseated as their own but they like dearly to see it going forward and love considered as a spectacle must have attractions for many who are not of the confraternity the sentimental old maid is a commonplace of the novelists and he must be rather a poor sort of human being to be sure who can look on at this pretty madness without indulgence and sympathy for nature commends itself to people with a most insinuating art the busiest is now and again arrested by a great sunset and you may be as pacific or as coldblooded as you will but you cannot help some emotion when you read of welldisputed battles or meet a pair of lovers in the lane  certainly whatever it may be with regard to the world at large this idea of beneficent pleasure is true as between the sweethearts to do good and communicate is the lovers grand intention it is the happiness of the other that makes his own most intense gratification it is not possible to disentangle the different emotions the pride humility pity and passion which are excited by a look of happy love or an unexpected caress to make ones self beautiful to dress the hair to excel in talk to do anything and all things that puff out the character and attributes and make them imposing in the eyes of others is not only to magnify oneself but to offer the most delicate homage at the same time and it is in this latter intention that they are done by lovers for the essence of love is kindness and indeed it may be best defined as passionate kindness kindness so to speak run mad and become importunate and violent vanity in a merely personal sense exists no longer the lover takes a perilous pleasure in privately displaying his weak points and having them one after another accepted and condoned he wishes to be assured that he is not loved for this or that good quality but for himself or something as like himself as he can contrive to set forward for although it may have been a very difficult thing to paint the marriage of cana or write the fourth act of antony and cleopatra there is a more difficult piece of art before every one in this world who cares to set about explaining his own character to others words and acts are easily wrenched from their true significance and they are all the language we have to come and go upon a pitiful job we make of it as a rule for better or worse people mistake our meaning and take our emotions at a wrong valuation and generally we rest pretty content with our failures we are content to be misapprehended by crackling flirts but when once a man is moonstruck with this affection of love he makes it a point of honour to clear such dubieties away he cannot have the best of her sex misled upon a point of this importance and his pride revolts at being loved in a mistake  he discovers a great reluctance to return on former periods of his life to all that has not been shared with her rights and duties bygone fortunes and dispositions he can look back only by a difficult and repugnant effort of the will that he should have wasted some years in ignorance of what alone was really important that he may have entertained the thought of other women with any show of complacency is a burthen almost too heavy for his selfrespect but it is the thought of another past that rankles in his spirit like a poisoned wound that he himself made a fashion of being alive in the bald beggarly days before a certain meeting is deplorable enough in all good conscience but that she should have permitted herself the same liberty seems inconsistent with a divine providence  a great many people run down jealousy on the score that it is an artificial feeling as well as practically inconvenient this is scarcely fair for the feeling on which it merely attends like an illhumoured courtier is itself artificial in exactly the same sense and to the same degree i suppose what is meant by that objection is that jealousy has not always been a character of man formed no part of that very modest kit of sentiments with which he is supposed to have begun the world but waited to make its appearance in better days and among richer natures and this is equally true of love and friendship and love of country and delight in what they call the beauties of nature and most other things worth having love in particular will not endure any historical scrutiny to all who have fallen across it it is one of the most incontestable facts in the world but if you begin to ask what it was in other periods and countries in greece for instance the strangest doubts begin to spring up and everything seems so vague and changing that a dream is logical in comparison jealousy at any rate is one of the consequences of love you may like it or not at pleasure but there it is  it is not exactly jealousy however that we feel when we reflect on the past of those we love a bundle of letters found after years of happy union creates no sense of insecurity in the present and yet it will pain a man sharply the two people entertain no vulgar doubt of each other but this preexistence of both occurs to the mind as something indelicate to be altogether right they should have had twin birth together at the same moment with the feeling that unites them then indeed it would be simple and perfect and without reserve or afterthought then they would understand each other with a fulness impossible otherwise there would be no barrier between them of associations that cannot be imparted they would be led into none of those comparisons that send the blood back to the heart and they would know that there had been no time lost and they had been together as much as was possible for besides terror for the separation that must follow some time or other in the future men feel anger and something like remorse when they think of that other separation which endured until they met some one has written that love makes people believe in immortality because there seems not to be room enough in life for so great a tenderness and it is inconceivable that the most masterful of our emotions should have no more than the spare moments of a few years indeed it seems strange but if we call to mind analogies we can hardly regard it as impossible  the blind bowboy who smiles upon us from the end of terraces in old dutch gardens laughingly hails his birdbolts among a fleeting generation but for as fast as ever he shoots the game dissolves and disappears into eternity from under his falling arrows this one is gone ere he is struck the other has but time to make one gesture and give one passionate cry and they are all the things of a moment when the generation is gone when the play is over when the thirty years panorama has been withdrawn in tatters from the stage of the world we may ask what has become of these great weighty and undying loves and the sweethearts who despised mortal conditions in a fine credulity and they can only show us a few songs in a bygone taste a few actions worth remembering and a few children who have retained some happy stamp from the disposition of their parents                                      iv                            truth of intercourse  among sayings that have a currency in spite of being wholly false upon the face of them for the sake of a halftruth upon another subject which is accidentally combined with the error one of the grossest and broadest conveys the monstrous proposition that it is easy to tell the truth and hard to tell a lie i wish heartily it were but the truth is one it has first to be discovered then justly and exactly uttered even with instruments specially contrived for such a purposewith a footrule a level or a theodoliteit is not easy to be exact it is easier alas to be inexact from those who mark the divisions on a scale to those who measure the boundaries of empires or the distance of the heavenly stars it is by careful method and minute unwearying attention that men rise even to material exactness or to sure knowledge even of external and constant things but it is easier to draw the outline of a mountain than the changing appearance of a face and truth in human relations is of this more intangible and dubious order hard to seize harder to communicate veracity to facts in a loose colloquial sensenot to say that i have been in malabar when as a matter of fact i was never out of england not to say that i have read cervantes in the original when as a matter of fact i know not one syllable of spanishthis indeed is easy and to the same degree unimportant in itself lies of this sort according to circumstances may or may not be important in a certain sense even they may or may not be false the habitual liar may be a very honest fellow and live truly with his wife and friends while another man who never told a formal falsehood in his life may yet be himself one lieheart and face from top to bottom this is the kind of lie which poisons intimacy and vice versÃ¢ veracity to sentiment truth in a relation truth to your own heart and your friends never to feign or falsify emotionthat is the truth which makes love possible and mankind happy  lart de bien dire is but a drawingroom accomplishment unless it be pressed into the service of the truth the difficulty of literature is not to write but to write what you mean not to affect your reader but to affect him precisely as you wish this is commonly understood in the case of books or set orations even in making your will or writing an explicit letter some difficulty is admitted by the world but one thing you can never make philistine natures understand one thing which yet lies on the surface remains as unseizable to their wits as a high flight of metaphysicsnamely that the business of life is mainly carried on by means of this difficult art of literature and according to a mans proficiency in that art shall be the freedom and the fulness of his intercourse with other men anybody it is supposed can say what he means and in spite of their notorious experience to the contrary people so continue to suppose now i simply open the last book i have been readingmr lelands captivating english gipsies it is said i find on p 7 that those who can converse with irish peasants in their native tongue form far higher opinions of their appreciation of the beautiful and of the elements of humour and pathos in their hearts than do those who know their thoughts only through the medium of english i know from my own observations that this is quite the case with the indians of north america and it is unquestionably so with the gipsy in short where a man has not a full possession of the language the most important because the most amiable qualities of his nature have to lie buried and fallow for the pleasure of comradeship and the intellectual part of love rest upon these very elements of humour and pathos here is a man opulent in both and for lack of a medium he can put none of it out to interest in the market of affection but what is thus made plain to our apprehensions in the case of a foreign language is partially true even with the tongue we learned in childhood indeed we all speak different dialects one shall be copious and exact another loose and meagre but the speech of the ideal talker shall correspond and fit upon the truth of factnot clumsily obscuring lineaments like a mantle but cleanly adhering like an athletes skin and what is the result that the one can open himself more clearly to his friends and can enjoy more of what makes life truly valuableintimacy with those he loves an orator makes a false step he employs some trivial some absurd some vulgar phrase in the turn of a sentence he insults by a side wind those whom he is labouring to charm in speaking to one sentiment he unconsciously ruffles another in parenthesis and you are not surprised for you know his task to be delicate and filled with perils o frivolous mind of man light ignorance as if yourself when you seek to explain some misunderstanding or excuse some apparent fault speaking swiftly and addressing a mind still recently incensed were not harnessing for a more perilous adventure as if yourself required less tact and eloquence as if an angry friend or a suspicious lover were not more easy to offend than a meeting of indifferent politicians nay and the orator treads in a beaten round the matters he discusses have been discussed a thousand times before language is readyshaped to his purpose he speaks out of a cutanddry vocabulary but youmay it not be that your defence reposes on some subtlety of feeling not so much as touched upon in shakespeare to express which like a pioneer you must venture forth into zones of thought still unsurveyed and become yourself a literary innovator for even in love there are unlovely humours ambiguous acts unpardonable words may yet have sprung from a kind sentiment if the injured one could read your heart you may be sure that he would understand and pardon but alas the heart cannot be shownit has to be demonstrated in words do you think it is a hard thing to write poetry why that is to write poetry and of a high if not the highest order  i should even more admire the lifelong and heroic literary labours of my fellowmen patiently clearing up in words their loves and their contentions and speaking their autobiography daily to their wives were it not for a circumstance which lessens their difficulty and my admiration by equal parts for life though largely is not entirely carried on by literature we are subject to physical passions and contortions the voice breaks and changes and speaks by unconscious and winning inflections we have legible countenances like an open book things that cannot be said look eloquently through the eyes and the soul not locked into the body as a dungeon dwells ever on the threshold with appealing signals groans and tears looks and gestures a flush or a paleness are often the most clear reporters of the heart and speak more directly to the hearts of others the message flies by these interpreters in the least space of time and the misunderstanding is averted in the moment of its birth to explain in words takes time and a just and patient hearing and in the critical epochs of a close relation patience and justice are not qualities on which we can rely but the look or the gesture explains things in a breath they tell their message without ambiguity unlike speech they cannot stumble by the way on a reproach or an allusion that should steel your friend against the truth and then they have a higher authority for they are the direct expression of the heart not yet transmitted through the unfaithful and sophisticating brain not long ago i wrote a letter to a friend which came near involving us in quarrel but we met and in personal talk i repeated the worst of what i had written and added worse to that and with the commentary of the body it seemed not unfriendly either to hear or say indeed letters are in vain for the purposes of intimacy an absence is a dead break in the relation yet two who know each other fully and are bent on perpetuity in love may so preserve the attitude of their affections that they may meet on the same terms as they had parted  pitiful is the case of the blind who cannot read the face pitiful that of the deaf who cannot follow the changes of the voice and there are others also to be pitied for there are some of an inert uneloquent nature who have been denied all the symbols of communication who have neither a lively play of facial expression nor speaking gestures nor a responsive voice nor yet the gift of frank explanatory speech people truly made of clay people tied for life into a bag which no one can undo they are poorer than the gipsy for their heart can speak no language under heaven such people we must learn slowly by the tenor of their acts or through yea and nay communications or we take them on trust on the strength of a general air and now and again when we see the spirit breaking through in a flash correct or change our estimate but these will be uphill intimacies without charm or freedom to the end and freedom is the chief ingredient in confidence some minds romantically dull despise physical endowments that is a doctrine for a misanthrope to those who like their fellow creatures it must always be meaningless and for my part i can see few things more desirable after the possession of such radical qualities as honour and humour and pathos than to have a lively and not a stolid countenance to have looks to correspond with every feeling to be elegant and delightful in person so that we shall please even in the intervals of active pleasing and may never discredit speech with uncouth manners or become unconsciously our own burlesques but of all unfortunates there is one creature for i will not call him man conspicuous in misfortune this is he who has forfeited his birthright of expression who has cultivated artful intonations who has taught his face tricks like a pet monkey and on every side perverted or cut off his means of communication with his fellowmen the body is a house of many windows there we all sit showing ourselves and crying on the passersby to come and love us but this fellow has filled his windows with opaque glass elegantly coloured his house may be admired for its design the crowd may pause before the stained windows but meanwhile the poor proprietor must lie languishing within uncomforted unchangeably alone  truth of intercourse is something more difficult than to refrain from open lies it is possible to avoid falsehood and yet not tell the truth it is not enough to answer formal questions to reach the truth by yea and nay communications implies a questioner with a share of inspiration such as is often found in mutual love yea and nay mean nothing the meaning must have been related in the question many words are often necessary to convey a very simple statement for in this sort of exercise we never hit the gold the most that we can hope is by many arrows more or less far off on different sides to indicate in the course of time for what target we are aiming and after an hours talk back and forward to convey the purport of a single principle or a single thought and yet while the curt pithy speaker misses the point entirely a wordy prolegomenous babbler will often add three new offences in the process of excusing one it is really a most delicate affair the world was made before the english language and seemingly upon a different design suppose we held our converse not in words but in music those who have a bad ear would find themselves cut off from all near commerce and no better than foreigners in this big world but we do not consider how many have a bad ear for words nor how often the most eloquent find nothing to reply i hate questioners and questions there are so few that can be spoken to without a lie do you forgive me madam and sweetheart so far as i have gone in life i have never yet been able to discover what forgiveness means is it still the same between us why how can it be it is eternally different and yet you are still the friend of my heart do you understand me god knows i should think it highly improbable  the cruellest lies are often told in silence a man may have sat in a room for hours and not opened his teeth and yet come out of that room a disloyal friend or a vile calumniator and how many loves have perished because from pride or spite or diffidence or that unmanly shame which withholds a man from daring to betray emotion a lover at the critical point of the relation has but hung his head and held his tongue and again a lie may be told by a truth or a truth conveyed through a lie truth to facts is not always truth to sentiment and part of the truth as often happens in answer to a question may be the foulest calumny a fact may be an exception but the feeling is the law and it is that which you must neither garble nor belie the whole tenor of a conversation is a part of the meaning of each separate statement the beginning and the end define and travesty the intermediate conversation you never speak to god you address a fellowman full of his own tempers and to tell truth rightly understood is not to state the true facts but to convey a true impression truth in spirit not truth to letter is the true veracity to reconcile averted friends a jesuitical discretion is often needful not so much to gain a kind hearing as to communicate sober truth women have an ill name in this connection yet they live in as true relations the lie of a good woman is the true index of her heart  it takes says thoreau in the noblest and most useful passage i remember to have read in any modern author4 two to speak truthone to speak and another to hear he must be very little experienced or have no great zeal for truth who does not recognise the fact a grain of anger or a grain of suspicion produces strange acoustical effects and makes the ear greedy to remark offence hence we find those who have once quarrelled carry themselves distantly and are ever ready to break the truce to speak truth there must be moral equality or else no respect and hence between parent and child intercourse is apt to degenerate into a verbal fencing bout and misapprehensions to become ingrained and there is another side to this for the parent begins with an imperfect notion of the childs character formed in early years or during the equinoctial gales of youth to this he adheres noting only the facts which suit with his preconception and wherever a person fancies himself unjustly judged he at once and finally gives up the effort to speak truth with our chosen friends on the other hand and still more between lovers for mutual understanding is loves essence the truth is easily indicated by the one and aptly comprehended by the other a hint taken a look understood conveys the gist of long and delicate explanations and where the life is known even yea and nay become luminous in the closest of all relationsthat of a love well founded and equally sharedspeech is half discarded like a roundabout infantile process or a ceremony of formal etiquette and the two communicate directly by their presences and with few looks and fewer words contrive to share their good and evil and uphold each others hearts in joy for love rests upon a physical basis it is a familiarity of natures making and apart from voluntary choice understanding has in some sort outrun knowledge for the affection perhaps began with the acquaintance and as it was not made like other relations so it is not like them to be perturbed or clouded each knows more than can be uttered each lives by faith and believes by a natural compulsion and between man and wife the language of the body is largely developed and grown strangely eloquent the thought that prompted and was conveyed in a caress would only lose to be set down in wordsay although shakespeare himself should be the scribe  yet it is in these dear intimacies beyond all others that we must strive and do battle for the truth let but a doubt arise and alas all the previous intimacy and confidence is but another charge against the person doubted what a monstrous dishonesty is this if i have been deceived so long and so completely let but that thought gain entrance and you plead before a deaf tribunal appeal to the past why that is your crime make all clear convince the reason alas speciousness is but a proof against you if you can abuse me now the more likely that you have abused me from the first  for a strong affection such moments are worth supporting and they will end well for your advocate is in your lovers heart and speaks her own language it is not you but she herself who can defend and clear you of the charge but in slighter intimacies and for a less stringent union indeed is it worth while we are all incompris only more or less concerned for the mischance all trying wrongly to do right all fawning at each others feet like dumb neglected lapdogs sometimes we catch an eyethis is our opportunity in the agesand we wag our tail with a poor smile is that all all if you only knew but how can they know they do not love us the more fools we to squander life on the indifferent  but the morality of the thing you will be glad to hear is excellent for it is only by trying to understand others that we can get our own hearts understood and in matters of human feeling the clement judge is the most successful pleader   footnote    4 a week on the concord and merrimack rivers wednesday p 283

and prudential proverbs the sentiments of a man while he is full of ardour and hope are to be received it is supposed with some qualification but when the same person has ignominiously failed and begins to eat up his words he should be listened to like an oracle most of our pocket wisdom is conceived for the use of mediocre people to discourage them from ambitious attempts and generally console them in their mediocrity and since mediocre people constitute the bulk of humanity this is no doubt very properly so but it does not follow that the one sort of proposition is any less true than the other or that icarus is not to be more praised and perhaps more envied than mr samuel budgett the successful merchant the one is dead to be sure while the other is still in his countinghouse counting out his money and doubtless this is a consideration but we have on the other hand some bold and magnanimous sayings common to high races and natures which set forth the advantage of the losing side and proclaim it better to be a dead lion than a living dog it is difficult to fancy how the mediocrities reconcile such sayings with their proverbs according to the latter every lad who goes to sea is an egregious ass never to forget your umbrella through a long life would seem a higher and wiser flight of achievement than to go smiling to the stake and so long as you are a bit of a coward and inflexible in money matters you fulfil the whole duty of man  it is a still more difficult consideration for our average men that while all their teachers from solomon down to benjamin franklin and the ungodly binney have inculcated the same ideal of manners caution and respectability those characters in history who have most notoriously flown in the face of such precepts are spoken of in hyperbolical terms of praise and honoured with public monuments in the streets of our commercial centres this is very bewildering to the moral sense you have joan of arc who left a humble but honest and reputable livelihood under the eyes of her parents to go acolonelling in the company of rowdy soldiers against the enemies of france surely a melancholy example for ones daughters and then you have columbus who may have pioneered america but when all is said was a most imprudent navigator his life is not the kind of thing one would like to put into the hands of young people rather one would do ones utmost to keep it from their knowledge as a red flag of adventure and disintegrating influence in life the time would fail me if i were to recite all the big names in history whose exploits are perfectly irrational and even shocking to the business mind the incongruity is speaking and i imagine it must engender among the mediocrities a very peculiar attitude towards the nobler and showier sides of national life they will read of the charge of balaclava in much the same spirit as they assist at a performance of the lyons mail persons of substance take in the times and sit composedly in pit or boxes according to the degree of their prosperity in business as for the generals who go galloping up and down among bombshells in absurd cocked hatsas for the actors who raddle their faces and demean themselves for hire upon the stagethey must belong thank god to a different order of beings whom we watch as we watch the clouds careering in the windy bottomless inane or read about like characters in ancient and rather fabulous annals our offspring would no more think of copying their behaviour let us hope than of doffing their clothes and painting themselves blue in consequence of certain admissions in the first chapter of their school history of england  discredited as they are in practice the cowardly proverbs hold their own in theory and it is another instance of the same spirit that the opinions of old men about life have been accepted as final all sorts of allowances are made for the illusions of youth and none or almost none for the disenchantments of age it is held to be a good taunt and somehow or other to clinch the question logically when an old gentleman waggles his head and says ah so i thought when i was your age it is not thought an answer at all if the young man retorts my venerable sir so i shall most probably think when i am yours and yet the one is as good as the other pass for pass tit for tat a roland for an oliver  opinion in good men says milton is but knowledge in the making all opinions properly so called are stages on the road to truth it does not follow that a man will travel any further but if he has really considered the world and drawn a conclusion he has travelled as far this does not apply to formulÃ¦ got by rote which are stages on the road to nowhere but second childhood and the grave to have a catchword in your mouth is not the same thing as to hold an opinion still less is it the same thing as to have made one for yourself there are too many of these catchwords in the world for people to rap out upon you like an oath and by way of an argument they have a currency as intellectual counters and many respectable persons pay their way with nothing else they seem to stand for vague bodies of theory in the background the imputed virtue of folios full of knockdown arguments is supposed to reside in them just as some of the majesty of the british empire dwells in the constables truncheon they are used in pure superstition as old clodhoppers spoil latin by way of an exorcism and yet they are vastly serviceable for checking unprofitable discussion and stopping the mouths of babes and sucklings and when a young man comes to a certain stage of intellectual growth the examination of these counters forms a gymnastic at once amusing and fortifying to the mind  because i have reached paris i am not ashamed of having passed through newhaven and dieppe they were very good places to pass through and i am none the less at my destination all my old opinions were only stages on the way to the one i now hold as itself is only a stage on the way to something else i am no more abashed at having been a redhot socialist with a panacea of my own than at having been a sucking infant doubtless the world is quite right in a million ways but you have to be kicked about a little to convince you of the fact and in the meanwhile you must do something be something believe something it is not possible to keep the mind in a state of accurate balance and blank and even if you could do so instead of coming ultimately to the right conclusion you would be very apt to remain in a state of balance and blank to perpetuity even in quite intermediate stages a dash of enthusiasm is not a thing to be ashamed of in the retrospect if st paul had not been a very zealous pharisee he would have been a colder christian for my part i look back to the time when i was a socialist with something like regret i have convinced myself for the moment that we had better leave these great changes to what we call great blind forces their blindness being so much more perspicacious than the little peering partial eyesight of men i seem to see that my own scheme would not answer and all the other schemes i ever heard propounded would depress some elements of goodness just as much as they encouraged others now i know that in thus turning conservative with years i am going through the normal cycle of change and travelling in the common orbit of mens opinions i submit to this as i would submit to gout or grey hair as a concomitant of growing age or else of failing animal heat but i do not acknowledge that it is necessarily a change for the betteri daresay it is deplorably for the worse i have no choice in the business and can no more resist this tendency of my mind than i could prevent my body from beginning to totter and decay if i am spared as the phrase runs i shall doubtless outlive some troublesome desires but i am in no hurry about that nor when the time comes shall i plume myself on the immunity just in the same way i do not greatly pride myself on having outlived my belief in the fairy tales of socialism old people have faults of their own they tend to become cowardly niggardly and suspicious whether from the growth of experience or the decline of animal heat i see that age leads to these and certain other faults and it follows of course that while in one sense i hope i am journeying towards the truth in another i am indubitably posting towards these forms and sources of error  as we go catching and catching at this or that corner of knowledge now getting a foresight of generous possibilities now chilled with a glimpse of prudence we may compare the headlong course of our years to a swift torrent in which a man is carried away now he is dashed against a boulder now he grapples for a moment to a trailing spray at the end he is hurled out and overwhelmed in a dark and bottomless ocean we have no more than glimpses and touches we are torn away from our theories we are spun round and round and shown this or the other view of life until only fools or knaves can hold to their opinions we take a sight at a condition in life and say we have studied it our most elaborate view is no more than an impression if we had breathing space we should take the occasion to modify and adjust but at this breakneck hurry we are no sooner boys than we are adult no sooner in love than married or jilted no sooner one age than we begin to be another and no sooner in the fulness of our manhood than we begin to decline towards the grave it is in vain to seek for consistency or expect clear and stable views in a medium so perturbed and fleeting this is no cabinet science in which things are tested to a scruple we theorise with a pistol to our head we are confronted with a new set of conditions on which we have not only to pass a judgment but to take action before the hour is at an end and we cannot even regard ourselves as a constant in this flux of things our identity itself seems in a perpetual variation and not infrequently we find our own disguise the strangest in the masquerade in the course of time we grow to love things we hated and hate things we loved milton is not so dull as he once was nor perhaps ainsworth so amusing it is decidedly harder to climb trees and not nearly so hard to sit still there is no use pretending even the thrice royal game of hide and seek has somehow lost in zest all our attributes are modified or changed and it will be a poor account of us if our views do not modify and change in a proportion to hold the same views at forty as we held at twenty is to have been stupefied for a score of years and take rank not as a prophet but as an unteachable brat well birched and none the wiser it is as if a ship captain should sail to india from the port of london and having brought a chart of the thames on deck at his first setting out should obstinately use no other for the whole voyage  and mark you it would be no less foolish to begin at gravesend with a chart of the red sea si jeunesse savait si vieillesse pouvait is a very pretty sentiment but not necessarily right in five cases out of ten it is not so much that the young people do not know as that they do not choose there is something irreverent in the speculation but perhaps the want of power has more to do with the wise resolutions of age than we are always willing to admit it would be an instructive experiment to make an old man young again and leave him all his savoir i scarcely think he would put his money in the savings bank after all i doubt if he would be such an admirable son as we are led to expect and as for his conduct in love i believe firmly he would outherod herod and put the whole of his new compeers to the blush prudence is a wooden juggernaut before whom benjamin franklin walks with the portly air of a highpriest and after whom dances many a successful merchant in the character of atys but it is not a deity to cultivate in youth if a man lives to any considerable age it cannot be denied that he laments his imprudences but i notice he often laments his youth a deal more bitterly and with a more genuine intonation  it is customary to say that age should be considered because it comes last it seems just as much to the point that youth comes first and the scale fairly kicks the beam if you go on to add that age in a majority of cases never comes at all disease and accident make short work of even the most prosperous persons death costs nothing and the expense of a headstone is an inconsiderable trifle to the happy heir to be suddenly snuffed out in the middle of ambitious schemes is tragical enough at best but when a man has been grudging himself his own life in the meanwhile and saving up everything for the festival that was never to be it becomes that hysterically moving sort of tragedy which lies on the confines of farce the victim is deadand he has cunningly overreached himself a combination of calamities none the less absurd for being grim to husband a favourite claret until the batch turns sour is not at all an artful stroke of policy and how much more with a whole cellara whole bodily existence people may lay down their lives with cheerfulness in the sure expectation of a blessed immortality but that is a different affair from giving up youth with all its admirable pleasures in the hope of a better quality of gruel in a more than problematical nay more than improbable old age we should not compliment a hungry man who should refuse a whole dinner and reserve all his appetite for the dessert before he knew whether there was to be any dessert or not if there be such a thing as imprudence in the world we surely have it here we sail in leaky bottoms and on great and perilous waters and to take a cue from the dolorous old naval ballad we have heard the mermaids singing and know that we shall never see dry land any more old and young we are all on our last cruise if there is a fill of tobacco among the crew for gods sake pass it round and let us have a pipe before we go  indeed by the report of our elders this nervous preparation for old age is only trouble thrown away we fall on guard and after all it is a friend who comes to meet us after the sun is down and the west faded the heavens begin to fill with shining stars so as we grow old a sort of equable jogtrot of feeling is substituted for the violent ups and downs of passion and disgust the same influence that restrains our hopes quiets our apprehensions if the pleasures are less intense the troubles are milder and more tolerable and in a word this period for which we are asked to hoard up everything as for a time of famine is in its own right the richest easiest and happiest of life nay by managing its own work and following its own happy inspiration youth is doing the best it can to endow the leisure of age a full busy youth is your only prelude to a selfcontained and independent age and the muff inevitably develops into the bore there are not many doctor johnsons to set forth upon their first romantic voyage at sixtyfour if we wish to scale mont blanc or visit a thieves kitchen in the east end to go down in a divingdress or up in a balloon we must be about it while we are still young it will not do to delay until we are clogged with prudence and limping with rheumatism and people begin to ask us what does gravity out of bed youth is the time to go flashing from one end of the world to the other both in mind and body to try the manners of different nations to hear the chimes at midnight to see sunrise in town and country to be converted at a revival to circumnavigate the metaphysics write halting verses run a mile to see a fire and wait all day long in the theatre to applaud hernani there is some meaning in the old theory about wild oats and a man who has not had his greensickness and got done with it for good is as little to be depended on as an unvaccinated infant it is extraordinary says lord beaconsfield one of the brightest and best preserved of youths up to the date of his last novel5 it is extraordinary how hourly and how violently change the feelings of an unexperienced young man and this mobility is a special talent entrusted to his care a sort of indestructible virginity a magic armour with which he can pass unhurt through great dangers and come unbedaubed out of the miriest passages let him voyage speculate see all that he can do all that he may his soul has as many lives as a cat he will live in all weathers and never be a halfpenny the worse those who go to the devil in youth with anything like a fair chance were probably little worth saving from the first they must have been feeble fellowscreatures made of putty and packthread without steel or fire anger or true joyfulness in their composition we may sympathise with their parents but there is not much cause to go into mourning for themselves for to be quite honest the weak brother is the worst of mankind  when the old man waggles his head and says ah so i thought when i was your age he has proved the youths case doubtless whether from growth of experience or decline of animal heat he thinks so no longer but he thought so while he was young and all men have thought so while they were young since there was dew in the morning or hawthorn in may and here is another young man adding his vote to those of previous generations and rivetting another link to the chain of testimony it is as natural and as right for a young man to be imprudent and exaggerated to live in swoops and circles and beat about his cage like any other wild thing newly captured as it is for old men to turn grey or mothers to love their offspring or heroes to die for something worthier than their lives  by way of an apologue for the aged when they feel more than usually tempted to offer their advice let me recommend the following little tale a child who had been remarkably fond of toys and in particular of lead soldiers found himself growing to the level of acknowledged boyhood without any abatement of this childish taste he was thirteen already he had been taunted for dallying overlong about the playbox he had to blush if he was found among his lead soldiers the shades of the prisonhouse were closing about him with a vengeance there is nothing more difficult than to put the thoughts of children into the language of their elders but this is the effect of his meditations at this juncture plainly he said i must give up my playthings in the meanwhile since i am not in a position to secure myself against idle jeers at the same time i am sure that playthings are the very pick of life all people give them up out of the same pusillanimous respect for those who are a little older and if they do not return to them as soon as they can it is only because they grow stupid and forget i shall be wiser i shall conform for a little to the ways of their foolish world but so soon as i have made enough money i shall retire and shut myself up among my playthings until the day i die nay as he was passing in the train along the esterel mountains between cannes and frÃ©jus he remarked a pretty house in an orange garden at the angle of a bay and decided that this should be his happy valley astrea redux childhood was to come again the idea has an air of simple nobility to me not unworthy of cincinnatus and yet as the reader has probably anticipated it is never likely to be carried into effect there was a worm i the bud a fatal error in the premises childhood must pass away and then youth as surely as age approaches the true wisdom is to be always seasonable and to change with a good grace in changing circumstances to love playthings well as a child to lead an adventurous and honourable youth and to settle when the time arrives into a green and smiling age is to be a good artist in life and deserve well of yourself and your neighbour  you need repent none of your youthful vagaries they may have been over the score on one side just as those of age are probably over the score on the other but they had a point they not only befitted your age and expressed its attitude and passions but they had a relation to what was outside of you and implied criticisms on the existing state of things which you need not allow to have been undeserved because you now see that they were partial all error not merely verbal is a strong way of stating that the current truth is incomplete the follies of youth have a basis in sound reason just as much as the embarrassing questions put by babes and sucklings their most antisocial acts indicate the defects of our society when the torrent sweeps the man against a boulder you must expect him to scream and you need not be surprised if the scream is sometimes a theory shelley chafing at the church of england discovered the cure of all evils in universal atheism generous lads irritated at the injustices of society see nothing for it but the abolishment of everything and kingdom come of anarchy shelley was a young fool so are these cocksparrow revolutionaries but it is better to be a fool than to be dead it is better to emit a scream in the shape of a theory than to be entirely insensible to the jars and incongruities of life and take everything as it comes in a forlorn stupidity some people swallow the universe like a pill they travel on through the world like smiling images pushed from behind for gods sake give me the young man who has brains enough to make a fool of himself as for the others the irony of facts shall take it out of their hands and make fools of them in downright earnest ere the farce be over there shall be such a mopping and a mowing at the last day and such blushing and confusion of countenance for all those who have been wise in their own esteem and have not learnt the rough lessons that youth hands on to age if we are indeed here to perfect and complete our own natures and grow larger stronger and more sympathetic against some nobler career in the future we had all best bestir ourselves to the utmost while we have the time to equip a dull respectable person with wings would be but to make a parody of an angel  in short if youth is not quite right in its opinions there is a strong probability that age is not much more so undying hope is coruler of the human bosom with infallible credulity a man finds he has been wrong at every preceding stage of his career only to deduce the astonishing conclusion that he is at last entirely right mankind after centuries of failure are still upon the eve of a thoroughly constitutional millennium since we have explored the maze so long without result it follows for poor human reason that we cannot have to explore much longer close by must be the centre with a champagne luncheon and a piece of ornamental water how if there were no centre at all but just one alley after another and the whole world a labyrinth without end or issue  i overheard the other day a scrap of conversation which i take the liberty to reproduce what i advance is true said one but not the whole truth answered the other sir returned the first and it seemed to me there was a smack of dr johnson in the speech sir there is no such thing as the whole truth indeed there is nothing so evident in life as that there are two sides to a question history is one long illustration the forces of nature are engaged day by day in cudgelling it into our backward intelligences we never pause for a moments consideration but we admit it as an axiom an enthusiast sways humanity exactly by disregarding this great truth and dinning it into our ears that this or that question has only one possible solution and your enthusiast is a fine florid fellow dominates things for a while and shakes the world out of a doze but when once he is gone an army of quiet and uninfluential people set to work to remind us of the other side and demolish the generous imposture while calvin is putting everybody exactly right in his institutes and hotheaded knox is thundering in the pulpit montaigne is already looking at the other side in his library in pÃ©rigord and predicting that they will find as much to quarrel about in the bible as they had found already in the church age may have one side but assuredly youth has the other there is nothing more certain than that both are right except perhaps that both are wrong let them agree to differ for who knows but what agreeing to differ may not be a form of agreement rather than a form of difference  i suppose it is written that any one who sets up for a bit of a philosopher must contradict himself to his very face for here have i fairly talked myself into thinking that we have the whole thing before us at last that there is no answer to the mystery except that there are as many as you please that there is no centre to the maze because like the famous sphere its centre is everywhere and that agreeing to differ with every ceremony of politeness is the only one undisturbed song of pure concent to which we are ever likely to lend our musical voices   footnote    5 lothair                                        iii                            an apology for idlers     boswell we grow weary when idle     johnson that is sir because others being busy we want company    but if we were idle there would be no growing weary we should all    entertain one another   just now when every one is bound under pain of a decree in absence convicting them of lÃ¨serespectability to enter on some lucrative profession and labour therein with something not far short of enthusiasm a cry from the opposite party who are content when they have enough and like to look on and enjoy in the meanwhile savours a little of bravado and gasconade and yet this should not be idleness so called which does not consist in doing nothing but in doing a great deal not recognised in the dogmatic formularies of the ruling class has as good a right to state its position as industry itself it is admitted that the presence of people who refuse to enter in the great handicap race for sixpenny pieces is at once an insult and a disenchantment for those who do a fine fellow as we see so many takes his determination votes for the sixpences and in the emphatic americanism goes for them and while such an one is ploughing distressfully up the road it is not hard to understand his resentment when he perceives cool persons in the meadows by the wayside lying with a handkerchief over their ears and a glass at their elbow alexander is touched in a very delicate place by the disregard of diogenes where was the glory of having taken rome for those tumultuous barbarians who poured into the senate house and found the fathers sitting silent and unmoved by their success it is a sore thing to have laboured along and scaled the arduous hilltops and when all is done find humanity indifferent to your achievement hence physicists condemn the unphysical financiers have only a superficial toleration for those who know little of stocks literary persons despise the unlettered and people of all pursuits combine to disparage those who have none  but though this is one difficulty of the subject it is not the greatest you could not be put in prison for speaking against industry but you can be sent to coventry for speaking like a fool the greatest difficulty with most subjects is to do them well therefore please to remember this is an apology it is certain that much may be judiciously argued in favour of diligence only there is something to be said against it and that is what on the present occasion i have to say to state one argument is not necessarily to be deaf to all others and that a man has written a book of travels in montenegro is no reason why he should never have been to richmond  it is surely beyond a doubt that people should be a good deal idle in youth for though here and there a lord macaulay may escape from school honours with all his wits about him most boys pay so dear for their medals that they never afterwards have a shot in their locker and begin the world bankrupt and the same holds true during all the time a lad is educating himself or suffering others to educate him it must have been a very foolish old gentleman who addressed johnson at oxford in these words young man ply your book diligently now and acquire a stock of knowledge for when years come upon you you will find that poring upon books will be but an irksome task the old gentleman seems to have been unaware that many other things besides reading grow irksome and not a few become impossible by the time a man has to use spectacles and cannot walk without a stick books are good enough in their own way but they are a mighty bloodless substitute for life it seems a pity to sit like the lady of shalott peering into a mirror with your back turned on all the bustle and glamour of reality and if a man reads very hard as the old anecdote reminds us he will have little time for thought  if you look back on your own education i am sure it will not be the full vivid instructive hours of truantry that you regret you would rather cancel some lacklustre periods between sleep and waking in the class for my own part i have attended a good many lectures in my time i still remember that the spinning of a top is a case of kinetic stability i still remember that emphyteusis is not a disease nor stillicide a crime but though i would not willingly part with such scraps of science i do not set the same store by them as by certain other odds and ends that i came by in the open street while i was playing truant this is not the moment to dilate on that mighty place of education which was the favourite school of dickens and of balzac and turns out yearly many inglorious masters in the science of the aspects of life suffice it to say this if a lad does not learn in the streets it is because he has no faculty of learning nor is the truant always in the streets for if he prefers he may go out by the gardened suburbs into the country he may pitch on some tuft of lilacs over a burn and smoke innumerable pipes to the tune of the water on the stones a bird will sing in the thicket and there he may fall into a vein of kindly thought and see things in a new perspective why if this be not education what is we may conceive mr worldly wiseman accosting such an one and the conversation that should thereupon ensue  how now young fellow what dost thou here  truly sir i take mine ease  is not this the hour of the class and shouldst thou not be plying thy book with diligence to the end thou mayest obtain knowledge  nay but thus also i follow after learning by your leave  learning quotha after what fashion i pray thee is it mathematics  no to be sure  is it metaphysics  nor that  is it some language  nay it is no language  is it a trade  nor a trade neither  why then what ist  indeed sir as a time may soon come for me to go upon pilgrimage i am desirous to note what is commonly done by persons in my case and where are the ugliest sloughs and thickets on the road as also what manner of staff is of the best service moreover i lie here by this water to learn by rootofheart a lesson which my master teaches me to call peace or contentment  hereupon mr worldly wiseman was much commoved with passion and shaking his cane with a very threatful countenance broke forth upon this wise learning quotha said he i would have all such rogues scourged by the hangman  and so he would go on his way ruffling out his cravat with a crackle of starch like a turkey when it spreads its feathers  now this of mr wisemans is the common opinion a fact is not called a fact but a piece of gossip if it does not fall into one of your scholastic categories an inquiry must be in some acknowledged direction with a name to go by or else you are not inquiring at all only lounging and the workhouse is too good for you it is supposed that all knowledge is at the bottom of a well or the far end of a telescope saintebeuve as he grew older came to regard all experience as a single great book in which to study for a few years ere we go hence and it seemed all one to him whether you should read in chapter xx which is the differential calculus or in chapter xxxix which is hearing the band play in the gardens as a matter of fact an intelligent person looking out of his eyes and hearkening in his ears with a smile on his face all the time will get more true education than many another in a life of heroic vigils there is certainly some chill and arid knowledge to be found upon the summits of formal and laborious science but it is all round about you and for the trouble of looking that you will acquire the warm and palpitating facts of life while others are filling their memory with a lumber of words onehalf of which they will forget before the week be out your truant may learn some really useful art to play the fiddle to know a good cigar or to speak with ease and opportunity to all varieties of men many who have plied their book diligently and know all about some one branch or another of accepted lore come out of the study with an ancient and owllike demeanour and prove dry stockish and dyspeptic in all the better and brighter parts of life many make a large fortune who remain underbred and pathetically stupid to the last and meantime there goes the idler who began life along with themby your leave a different picture he has had time to take care of his health and his spirits he has been a great deal in the open air which is the most salutary of all things for both body and mind and if he has never read the great book in very recondite places he has dipped into it and skimmed it over to excellent purpose might not the student afford some hebrew roots and the business mansome of his halfcrowns for a share of the idlers knowledge of life at large and art of living nay and the idler has another and more important quality than these i mean his wisdom he who has much looked on at the childish satisfaction of other people in their hobbles will regard his own with only a very ironical indulgence he will not be heard among the dogmatists he will have a great and cool allowance for all sorts of people and opinions if he finds no outoftheway truths he will identify himself with no very burning falsehood his way takes him along a byroad not much frequented but very even and pleasant which is called commonplace lane and leads to the belvedere of commonsense thence he shall command an agreeable if no very noble prospect and while others behold the east and west the devil and the sunrise he will be contentedly aware of a sort of morning hour upon all sublunary things with an army of shadows running speedily and in many different directions into the great daylight of eternity the shadows and the generations the shrill doctors and the plangent wars go by into ultimate silence and emptiness but underneath all this a man may see out of the belvedere windows much green and peaceful landscape many firelit parlours good people laughing drinking and making love as they did before the flood or the french revolution and the old shepherd telling his tale under the hawthorn  extreme busyness whether at school or college kirk or market is a symptom of deficient vitality and a faculty for idleness implies a catholic appetite and a strong sense of personal identity there is a sort of deadalive hackneyed people about who are scarcely conscious of living except in the exercise of some conventional occupation bring these fellows into the country or set them aboard ship and you will see how they pine for their desk or their study they have no curiosity they cannot give themselves over to random provocations they do not take pleasure in the exercise of their faculties for its own sake and unless necessity lays about them with a stick they will even stand still it is no good speaking to such folk they cannot be idle their nature is not generous enough and they pass those hours in a sort of coma which are not dedicated to furious moiling in the goldmill when they do not require to go to the office when they are not hungry and have no mind to drink the whole breathing world is a blank to them if they have to wait an hour or so for a train they fall into a stupid trance with their eyes open to see them you would suppose there was nothing to look at and no one to speak with you would imagine they were paralysed or alienated and yet very possibly they are hard workers in their own way and have good eyesight for a flaw in a deed or a turn of the market they have been to school and college but all the time they had their eye on the medal they have gone about in the world and mixed with clever people but all the time they were thinking of their own affairs as if a mans soul were not too small to begin with they have dwarfed and narrowed theirs by a life of all work and no play until here they are at forty with a listless attention a mind vacant of all material of amusement and not one thought to rub against another while they wait for the train before he was breeched he might have clambered on the boxes when he was twenty he would have stared at the girls but now the pipe is smoked out the snuffbox empty and my gentleman sits bolt upright upon a bench with lamentable eyes this does not appeal to me as being success in life  but it is not only the person himself who suffers from his busy habits but his wife and children his friends and relations and down to the very people he sits with in a railwaycarriage or an omnibus perpetual devotion to what a man calls his business is only to be sustained by perpetual neglect of many other things and it is not by any means certain that a mans business is the most important thing he has to do to an impartial estimate it will seem clear that many of the wisest most virtuous and most beneficent parts that are to be played upon the theatre of life are filled by gratuitous performers and pass among the world at large as phases of idleness for in that theatre not only the walking gentlemen singing chambermaids and diligent fiddlers in the orchestra but those who look on and clap their hands from the benches do really play a part and fulfil important offices towards the general result you are no doubt very dependent on the care of your lawyer and stockbroker of the guards and signalmen who convey you rapidly from place to place and the policemen who walk the streets for your protection but is there not a thought of gratitude in your heart for certain other benefactors who set you smiling when they fall in your way or season your dinner with good company colonel newcome helped to lose his friends money fred bayham had an ugly trick of borrowing shirts and yet they were better people to fall among than mr barnes and though falstaff was neither sober nor very honest i think i could name one or two longlaced barabbases whom the world could better have done without hazlitt mentions that he was more sensible of obligation to northcote who had never done him anything he could call a service than to his whole circle of ostentatious friends for he thought a good companion emphatically the greatest benefactor i know there are people in the world who cannot feel grateful unless the favour has been done them at the cost of pain and difficulty but this is a churlish disposition a man may send you six sheets of letterpaper covered with the most entertaining gossip or you may pass halfanhour pleasantly perhaps profitably over an article of his do you think the service would be greater if he had made the manuscript in his hearts blood like a compact with the devil do you really fancy you should be more beholden to your correspondent if he had been damning you all the while for your importunity pleasures are more beneficial than duties because like the quality of mercy they are not strained and they are twice blest there must always be two to a kiss and there may be a score in a jest but wherever there is an element of sacrifice the favour is conferred with pain and among generous people received with confusion there is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being happy by being happy we sow anonymous benefits upon the world which remain unknown even to ourselves or when they are disclosed surprise nobody so much as the benefactor the other day a ragged barefoot boy ran down the street after a marble with so jolly an air that he set every one he passed into a good humour one of these persons who had been delivered from more than usually black thoughts stopped the little fellow and gave him some money with this remark you see what sometimes comes of looking pleased if he had looked pleased before he had now to look both pleased and mystified for my part i justify this encouragement of smiling rather than tearful children i do not wish to pay for tears anywhere but upon the stage but i am prepared to deal largely in the opposite commodity a happy man or woman is a better thing to find than a fivepound note he or she is a radiating focus of goodwill and their entrance into a room is as though another candle had been lighted we need not care whether they could prove the fortyseventh proposition they do a better thing than that they practically demonstrate the great theorem of the liveableness of life consequently if a person cannot be happy without remaining idle idle he should remain it is a revolutionary precept but thanks to hunger and the workhouse one not easily to be abused and within practical limits it is one of the most incontestable truths in the whole body of morality look at one of your industrious fellows for a moment i beseech you he sows hurry and reaps indigestion he puts a vast deal of activity out to interest and receives a large measure of nervous derangement in return either he absents himself entirely from all fellowship and lives a recluse in a garret with carpet slippers and a leaden inkpot or he comes among people swiftly and bitterly in a contraction of his whole nervous system to discharge some temper before he returns to work i do not care how much or how well he works this fellow is an evil feature in other peoples lives they would be happier if he were dead they could easier do without his services in the circumlocution office than they can tolerate his fractious spirits he poisons life at the wellhead it is better to be beggared out of hand by a scapegrace nephew than daily hagridden by a peevish uncle  and what in gods name is all this pother about for what cause do they embitter their own and other peoples lives that a man should publish three or thirty articles a year that he should finish or not finish his great allegorical picture are questions of little interest to the world the ranks of life are full and although a thousand fall there are always some to go into the breach when they told joan of arc she should be at home minding womens work she answered there were plenty to spin and wash and so even with your own rare gifts when nature is so careless of the single life why should we coddle ourselves into the fancy that our own is of exceptional importance suppose shakespeare had been knocked on the head some dark night in sir thomas lucys preserves the world would have wagged on better or worse the pitcher gone to the well the scythe to the corn and the student to his book and no one been any the wiser of the loss there are not many works extant if you look the alternative all over which are worth the price of a pound of tobacco to a man of limited means this is a sobering reflection for the proudest of our earthly vanities even a tobacconist may upon consideration find no great cause for personal vainglory in the phrase for although tobacco is an admirable sedative the qualities necessary for retailing it are neither rare nor precious in themselves alas and alas you may take it how you will but the services of no single individual are indispensable atlas was just a gentleman with a protracted nightmare and yet you see merchants who go and labour themselves into a great fortune and thence into the bankruptcy court scribblers who keep scribbling at little articles until their temper is a cross to all who come about them as though pharaoh should set the israelites to make a pin instead of a pyramid and fine young men who work themselves into a decline and are driven off in a hearse with white plumes upon it would you not suppose these persons had been whispered by the master of the ceremonies the promise of some momentous destiny and that this lukewarm bullet on which they play their farces was the bullseye and centrepoint of all the universe and yet it is not so the ends for which they give away their priceless youth for all they know may be chimerical or hurtful the glory and riches they expect may never come or may find them indifferent and they and the world they inhabit are so inconsiderable that the mind freezes at the thought                                        iv                               ordered south   by a curious irony of fate the places to which we are sent when health deserts us are often singularly beautiful often too they are places we have visited in former years or seen briefly in passing by and kept ever afterwards in pious memory and we please ourselves with the fancy that we shall repeat many vivid and pleasurable sensations and take up again the thread of our enjoyment in the same spirit as we let it fall we shall now have an opportunity of finishing many pleasant excursions interrupted of yore before our curiosity was fully satisfied it may be that we have kept in mind during all these years the recollection of some valley into which we have just looked down for a moment before we lost sight of it in the disorder of the hills it may be that we have lain awake at night and agreeably tantalised ourselves with the thought of corners we had never turned or summits we had all but climbed we shall now be able as we tell ourselves to complete all these unfinished pleasures and pass beyond the barriers that confined our recollections  the promise is so great and we are all so easily led away when hope and memory are both in one story that i daresay the sick man is not very inconsolable when he receives sentence of banishment and is inclined to regard his illhealth as not the least fortunate accident of his life nor is he immediately undeceived the stir and speed of the journey and the restlessness that goes to bed with him as he tries to sleep between two days of noisy progress fever him and stimulate his dull nerves into something of their old quickness and sensibility and so he can enjoy the faint autumnal splendour of the landscape as he sees hill and plain vineyard and forest clad in one wonderful glory of fairy gold which the first great winds of winter will transmute as in the fable into withered leaves and so too he can enjoy the admirable brevity and simplicity of such little glimpses of country and country ways as flash upon him through the windows of the train little glimpses that have a character all their own sights seen as a travelling swallow might see them from the wing or iris as she went abroad over the land on some olympian errand here and there indeed a few children huzzah and wave their hands to the express but for the most part it is an interruption too brief and isolated to attract much notice the sheep do not cease from browsing a girl sits balanced on the projecting tiller of a canal boat so precariously that it seems as if a fly or the splash of a leaping fish would be enough to overthrow the dainty equilibrium and yet all these hundreds of tons of coal and wood and iron have been precipitated roaring past her very ear and there is not a start not a tremor not a turn of the averted head to indicate that she has been even conscious of its passage herein i think lies the chief attraction of railway travel the speed is so easy and the train disturbs so little the scenes through which it takes us that our heart becomes full of the placidity and stillness of the country and while the body is borne forward in the flying chain of carriages the thoughts alight as the humour moves them at unfrequented stations they make haste up the poplar alley that leads towards the town they are left behind with the signalman as shading his eyes with his hand he watches the long train sweep away into the golden distance  moreover there is still before the invalid the shock of wonder and delight with which he will learn that he has passed the indefinable line that separates south from north and this is an uncertain moment for sometimes the consciousness is forced upon him early on the occasion of some slight association a colour a flower or a scent and sometimes not until one fine morning he wakes up with the southern sunshine peeping through the persiennes and the southern patois confusedly audible below the windows whether it come early or late however this pleasure will not end with the anticipation as do so many others of the same family it will leave him wider awake than it found him and give a new significance to all he may see for many days to come there is something in the mere name of the south that carries enthusiasm along with it at the sound of the word he pricks up his ears he becomes as anxious to seek out beauties and to get by heart the permanent lines and character of the landscape as if he had been told that it was all his ownan estate out of which he had been kept unjustly and which he was now to receive in free and full possession even those who have never been there before feel as if they had been and everybody goes comparing and seeking for the familiar and finding it with such ecstasies of recognition that one would think they were coming home after a weary absence instead of travelling hourly farther abroad  it is only after he is fairly arrived and settled down in his chosen corner that the invalid begins to understand the change that has befallen him everything about him is as he had remembered or as he had anticipated here at his feet under his eyes are the olive gardens and the blue sea nothing can change the eternal magnificence of form of the naked alps behind mentone nothing not even the crude curves of the railway can utterly deform the suavity of contour of one bay after another along the whole reach of the riviera and of all this he has only a cold headknowledge that is divorced from enjoyment he recognises with his intelligence that this thing and that thing is beautiful while in his heart of hearts he has to confess that it is not beautiful for him it is in vain that he spurs his discouraged spirit in vain that he chooses out points of view and stands there looking with all his eyes and waiting for some return of the pleasure that he remembers in other days as the sick folk may have awaited the coming of the angel at the pool of bethesda he is like an enthusiast leading about with him a stolid indifferent tourist there is some one by who is out of sympathy with the scene and is not moved up to the measure of the occasion and that some one is himself the world is disenchanted for him he seems to himself to touch things with muffled hands and to see them through a veil his life becomes a palsied fumbling after notes that are silent when he has found and struck them he cannot recognise that this phlegmatic and unimpressionable body with which he now goes burthened is the same that he knew heretofore so quick and delicate and alive  he is tempted to lay the blame on the very softness and amenity of the climate and to fancy that in the rigours of the winter at home these dead emotions would revive and flourish a longing for the brightness and silence of fallen snow seizes him at such times he is homesick for the hale rough weather for the tracery of the frost upon his windowpanes at morning the reluctant descent of the first flakes and the white roofs relieved against the sombre sky and yet the stuff of which these yearnings are made is one of the flimsiest if but the thermometer fall a little below its ordinary mediterranean level or a wind come down from the snowclad alps behind the spirit of his fancies changes upon the instant and many a doleful vignette of the grim wintry streets at home returns to him and begins to haunt his memory the hopeless huddled attitude of tramps in doorways the flinching gait of barefoot children on the icy pavement the sheen of the rainy streets towards afternoon the meagre anatomy of the poor defined by the clinging of wet garments the high canorous note of the northeaster on days when the very houses seem to stiffen with cold these and such as these crowd back upon him and mockingly substitute themselves for the fanciful winter scenes with which he had pleased himself a while before he cannot be glad enough that he is where he is if only the others could be there also if only those tramps could lie down for a little in the sunshine and those children warm their feet this once upon a kindlier earth if only there were no cold anywhere and no nakedness and no hunger if only it were as well with all men as it is with him  for it is not altogether ill with the invalid after all if it is only rarely that anything penetrates vividly into his numbed spirit yet when anything does it brings with it a joy that is all the more poignant for its very rarity there is something pathetic in these occasional returns of a glad activity of heart in his lowest hours he will be stirred and awakened by many such and they will spring perhaps from very trivial sources as a friend once said to me the spirit of delight comes often on small wings for the pleasure that we take in beautiful nature is essentially capricious it comes sometimes when we least look for it and sometimes when we expect it most certainly it leaves us to gape joyously for days together in the very homeland of the beautiful we may have passed a place a thousand times and one and on the thousand and second it will be transfigured and stand forth in a certain splendour of reality from the dull circle of surroundings so that we see it with a childs first pleasure as wordsworth saw the daffodils by the lakeside and if this falls out capriciously with the healthy how much more so with the invalid some day he will find his first violet and be lost in pleasant wonder by what alchemy the cold earth of the clods and the vapid air and rain can be transmuted into colour so rich and odour so touchingly sweet or perhaps he may see a group of washerwomen relieved on a spit of shingle against the blue sea or a meeting of flowergatherers in the tempered daylight of an olivegarden and something significant or monumental in the grouping something in the harmony of faint colour that is always characteristic of the dress of these southern women will come home to him unexpectedly and awaken in him that satisfaction with which we tell ourselves that we are the richer by one more beautiful experience or it may be something even slighter as when the opulence of the sunshine which somehow gets lost and fails to produce its effect on the large scale is suddenly revealed to him by the chance isolationas he changes the position of his sunshadeof a yard or two of roadway with its stones and weeds and then there is no end to the infinite variety of the oliveyards themselves even the colour is indeterminate and continually shifting now you would say it was green now grey now blue now tree stands above tree like cloud on cloud massed into filmy indistinctness and now at the winds will the whole sea of foliage is shaken and broken up with little momentary silverings and shadows but every one sees the world in his own way to some the glad moment may have arrived on other provocations and their recollection may be most vivid of the stately gait of women carrying burthens on their heads of tropical effects with canes and naked rock and sunlight of the relief of cypresses of the troubled busylooking groups of seapines that seem always as if they were being wielded and swept together by a whirlwind of the air coming laden with virginal perfumes over the myrtles and the scented underwood of the empurpled hills standing up solemn and sharp out of the greengold air of the east at evening  there go many elements without doubt to the making of one such moment of intense perception and it is on the happy agreement of these many elements on the harmonious vibration of many nerves that the whole delight of the moment must depend who can forget how when he has chanced upon some attitude of complete restfulness after long uneasy rolling to and fro on grass or heather the whole fashion of the landscape has been changed for him as though the sun had just broken forth or a great artist had only then completed by some cunning touch the composition of the picture and not only a change of posturea snatch of perfume the sudden singing of a bird the freshness of some pulse of air from an invisible sea the light shadow of a travelling cloud the merest nothing that sends a little shiver along the most infinitesimal nerve of a mans bodynot one of the least of these but has a hand somehow in the general effect and brings some refinement of its own into the character of the pleasure we feel  and if the external conditions are thus varied and subtle even more so are those within our own bodies no man can find out the world says solomon from beginning to end because the world is in his heart and so it is impossible for any of us to understand from beginning to end that agreement of harmonious circumstances that creates in us the highest pleasure of admiration precisely because some of these circumstances are hidden from us for ever in the constitution of our own bodies after we have reckoned up all that we can see or hear or feel there still remains to be taken into account some sensibility more delicate than usual in the nerves affected or some exquisite refinement in the architecture of the brain which is indeed to the sense of the beautiful as the eye or the ear to the sense of hearing or sight we admire splendid views and great pictures and yet what is truly admirable is rather the mind within us that gathers together these scattered details for its delight and makes out of certain colours certain distributions of graduated light and darkness that intelligible whole which alone we call a picture or a view hazlitt relating in one of his essays how he went on foot from one great mans house to anothers in search of works of art begins suddenly to triumph over these noble and wealthy owners because he was more capable of enjoying their costly possessions than they were because they had paid the money and he had received the pleasure and the occasion is a fair one for selfcomplacency while the one man was working to be able to buy the picture the other was working to be able to enjoy the picture an inherited aptitude will have been diligently improved in either case only the one man has made for himself a fortune and the other has made for himself a living spirit it is a fair occasion for selfcomplacency i repeat when the event shows a man to have chosen the better part and laid out his life more wisely in the long run than those who have credit for most wisdom and yet even this is not a good unmixed and like all other possessions although in a less degree the possession of a brain that has been thus improved and cultivated and made into the prime organ of a mans enjoyment brings with it certain inevitable cares and disappointments the happiness of such an one comes to depend greatly upon those fine shades of sensation that heighten and harmonise the coarser elements of beauty and thus a degree of nervous prostration that to other men would be hardly disagreeable is enough to overthrow for him the whole fabric of his life to take except at rare moments the edge off his pleasures and to meet him wherever he goes with failure and the sense of want and disenchantment of the world and life  it is not in such numbness of spirit only that the life of the invalid resembles a premature old age those excursions that he had promised himself to finish prove too long or too arduous for his feeble body and the barrierhills are as impassable as ever many a white town that sits far out on the promontory many a comely fold of wood on the mountainside beckons and allures his imagination day after day and is yet as inaccessible to his feet as the clefts and gorges of the clouds the sense of distance grows upon him wonderfully and after some feverish efforts and the fretful uneasiness of the first few days he falls contentedly in with the restrictions of his weakness his narrow round becomes pleasant and familiar to him as the cell to a contented prisoner just as he has fallen already out of the mid race of active life he now falls out of the little eddy that circulates in the shallow waters of the sanatorium he sees the country people come and go about their everyday affairs the foreigners stream out in goodly pleasure parties the stir of mans activity is all about him as he suns himself inertly in some sheltered corner and he looks on with a patriarchal impersonality of interest such as a man may feel when he pictures to himself the fortunes of his remote descendants or the robust old age of the oak he has planted overnight  in this falling aside in this quietude and desertion of other men there is no inharmonious prelude to the last quietude and desertion of the grave in this dulness of the senses there is a gentle preparation for the final insensibility of death and to him the idea of mortality comes in a shape less violent and harsh than is its wont less as an abrupt catastrophe than as a thing of infinitesimal gradation and the last step on a long decline of way as we turn to and fro in bed and every moment the movements grow feebler and smaller and the attitude more restful and easy until sleep overtakes us at a stride and we move no more so desire after desire leaves him day by day his strength decreases and the circle of his activity grows ever narrower and he feels if he is to be thus tenderly weaned from the passion of life thus gradually inducted into the slumber of death that when at last the end comes it will come quietly and fitly if anything is to reconcile poor spirits to the coming of the last enemy surely it should be such a mild approach as this not to hale us forth with violence but to persuade us from a place we have no further pleasure in it is not so much indeed death that approaches as life that withdraws and withers up from round about him he has outlived his own usefulness and almost his own enjoyment and if there is to be no recovery if never again will he be young and strong and passionate if the actual present shall be to him always like a thing read in a book or remembered out of the faraway past if in fact this be veritably nightfall he will not wish greatly for the continuance of a twilight that only strains and disappoints the eyes but steadfastly await the perfect darkness he will pray for medea when she comes let her either rejuvenate or slay  and yet the ties that still attach him to the world are many and kindly the sight of children has a significance for him such as it may have for the aged also but not for others if he has been used to feel humanely and to look upon life somewhat more widely than from the narrow loophole of personal pleasure and advancement it is strange how small a portion of his thoughts will be changed or embittered by this proximity of death he knows that already in english counties the sower follows the ploughman up the face of the field and the rooks follow the sower and he knows also that he may not live to go home again and see the corn spring and ripen and be cut down at last and brought home with gladness and yet the future of this harvest the continuance of drought or the coming of rain unseasonably touch him as sensibly as ever for he has long been used to wait with interest the issue of events in which his own concern was nothing and to be joyful in a plenty and sorrowful for a famine that did not increase or diminish by one half loaf the equable sufficiency of his own supply thus there remain unaltered all the disinterested hopes for mankind and a better future which have been the solace and inspiration of his life these he has set beyond the reach of any fate that only menaces himself and it makes small difference whether he die five thousand years or five thousand and fifty years before the good epoch for which he faithfully labours he has not deceived himself he has known from the beginning that he followed the pillar of fire and cloud only to perish himself in the wilderness and that it was reserved for others to enter joyfully into possession of the land and so as everything grows greyer and quieter about him and slopes towards extinction these unfaded visions accompany his sad decline and follow him with friendly voices and hopeful words into the very vestibule of death the desire of love or of fame scarcely moved him in his days of health more strongly than these generous aspirations move him now and so life is carried forward beyond life and a vista kept open for the eyes of hope even when his hands grope already on the face of the impassable  lastly he is bound tenderly to life by the thought of his friends or shall we not say rather that by their thought for him by their unchangeable solicitude and love he remains woven into the very stuff of life beyond the power of bodily dissolution to undo in a thousand ways will he survive and be perpetuated much of etienne de la boÃ©tie survived during all the years in which montaigne continued to converse with him on the pages of the everdelightful essays much of what was truly goethe was dead already when he revisited places that knew him no more and found no better consolation than the promise of his own verses that soon he too would be at rest indeed when we think of what it is that we most seek and cherish and find most pride and pleasure in calling ours it will sometimes seem to us as if our friends at our decease would suffer loss more truly than ourselves as a monarch who should care more for the outlying colonies he knows on the map or through the report of his vicegerents than for the trunk of his empire under his eyes at home are we not more concerned about the shadowy life that we have in the hearts of others and that portion in their thoughts and fancies which in a certain faraway sense belongs to us than about the real knot of our identitythat central metropolis of self of which alone we are immediately awareor the diligent service of arteries and veins and infinitesimal activity of ganglia which we know as we know a proposition in euclid to be the source and substance of the whole at the death of every one whom we love some fair and honourable portion of our existence falls away and we are dislodged from one of these dear provinces and they are not perhaps the most fortunate who survive a long series of such impoverishments till their life and influence narrow gradually into the meagre limit of their own spirits and death when he comes at last can destroy them at one blow     noteto this essay i must in honesty append a word or two of    qualification for this is one of the points on which a slightly    greater age teaches us a slightly different wisdom     a youth delights in generalities and keeps loose from particular    obligations he jogs on the footpath way himself pursuing    butterflies but courteously lending his applause to the advance of    the human species and the coming of the kingdom of justice and love    as he grows older he begins to think more narrowly of mans action    in the general and perhaps more arrogantly of his own in the    particular he has not that same unspeakable trust in what he would    have done had he been spared seeing finally that that would have    been little but he has a far higher notion of the blank that he will    make by dying a young man feels himself one too many in the world    his is a painful situation he has no calling no obvious utility no    ties but to his parents and these he is sure to disregard i do not    think that a proper allowance has been made for this true cause of    suffering in youth but by the mere fact of a prolonged existence we    outgrow either the fact or else the feeling either we become so    callously accustomed to our own useless figure in the world or    elseand this thank god in the majority of caseswe so collect    about us the interest or the love of our fellows so multiply our    effective part in the affairs of life that we need to entertain no    longer the question of our right to be     and so in the majority of cases a man who fancies himself dying will    get cold comfort from the very youthful view expressed in this essay    he as a living man has some to help some to love some to correct    it may be some to punish these duties cling not upon humanity but    upon the man himself it is he not another who is one womans son    and a second womans husband and a third womans father that life    which began so small has now grown with a myriad filaments into    the lives of others it is not indispensable another will take the    place and shoulder the discharged responsibility but the better the    man and the nobler his purposes the more will he be tempted to    regret the extinction of his powers and the deletion of his    personality to have lived a generation is not only to have grown at    home in that perplexing medium but to have assumed innumerable    duties to die at such an age has for all but the entirely base    something of the air of a betrayal a man does not only reflect upon    what he might have done in a future that is never to be his but    beholding himself so early a deserter from the fight he eats his    heart for the good he might have done already to have been so    useless and now to lose all hope of being useful any morethere it    is that death and memory assail him and even if mankind shall go on    founding heroic cities practising heroic virtues rising steadily    from strength to strength even if his work shall be fulfilled his    friends consoled his wife remarried by a better than he how shall    this alter in one jot his estimation of a career which was his only    business in this world which was so fitfully pursued and which is    now so ineffectively to end                                        v                                Ã†s triplex   the changes wrought by death are in themselves so sharp and final and so terrible and melancholy in their consequences that the thing stands alone in mans experience and has no parallel upon earth it outdoes all other accidents because it is the last of them sometimes it leaps suddenly upon its victims like a thug sometimes it lays a regular siege and creeps upon their citadel during a score of years and when the business is done there is sore havoc made in other peoples lives and a pin knocked out by which many subsidiary friendships hung together there are empty chairs solitary walks and single beds at night again in taking away our friends death does not take them away utterly but leaves behind a mocking tragical and soon intolerable residue which must be hurriedly concealed hence a whole chapter of sights and customs striking to the mind from the pyramids of egypt to the gibbets and dule trees of mediÃ¦val europe the poorest persons have a bit of pageant going towards the tomb memorial stones are set up over the least memorable and in order to preserve some show of respect for what remains of our old loves and friendships we must accompany it with much grimly ludicrous ceremonial and the hired undertaker parades before the door all this and much more of the same sort accompanied by the eloquence of poets has gone a great way to put humanity in error nay in many philosophies the error has been embodied and laid down with every circumstance of logic although in real life the bustle and swiftness in leaving people little time to think have not left them time enough to go dangerously wrong in practice  as a matter of fact although few things are spoken of with more fearful whisperings than this prospect of death few have less influence on conduct under healthy circumstances we have all heard of cities in south america built upon the side of fiery mountains and how even in this tremendous neighbourhood the inhabitants are not a jot more impressed by the solemnity of mortal conditions than if they were delving gardens in the greenest corner of england there are serenades and suppers and much gallantry among the myrtles overhead and meanwhile the foundation shudders under foot the bowels of the mountain growl and at any moment living ruin may leap skyhigh into the moonlight and tumble man and his merrymaking in the dust in the eyes of very young people and very dull old ones there is something indescribably reckless and desperate in such a picture it seems not credible that respectable married people with umbrellas should find appetite for a bit of supper within quite a long distance of a fiery mountain ordinary life begins to smell of highhanded debauch when it is carried on so close to a catastrophe and even cheese and salad it seems could hardly be relished in such circumstances without something like a defiance of the creator it should be a place for nobody but hermits dwelling in prayer and maceration or mere borndevils drowning care in a perpetual carouse  and yet when one comes to think upon it calmly the situation of these south american citizens forms only a very pale figure for the state of ordinary mankind this world itself travelling blindly and swiftly in overcrowded space among a million other worlds travelling blindly and swiftly in contrary directions may very well come by a knock that would set it into explosion like a penny squib and what pathologically looked at is the human body with all its organs but a mere bagful of petards the least of these is as dangerous to the whole economy as the ships powdermagazine to the ship and with every breath we breathe and every meal we eat we are putting one or more of them in peril if we clung as devotedly as some philosophers pretend we do to the abstract idea of life or were half as frightened as they make out we are for the subversive accident that ends it all the trumpets might sound by the hour and no one would follow them into battlethe bluepeter might fly at the truck but who would climb into a seagoing ship think if these philosophers were right with what a preparation of spirit we should affront the daily peril of the dinnertable a deadlier spot than any battlefield in history where the far greater proportion of our ancestors have miserably left their bones what woman would ever be lured into marriage so much more dangerous than the wildest sea and what would it be to grow old for after a certain distance every step we take in life we find the ice growing thinner below our feet and all around us and behind us we see our contemporaries going through by the time a man gets well into the seventies his continued existence is a mere miracle and when he lays his old bones in bed for the night there is an overwhelming probability that he will never see the day do the old men mind it as a matter of fact why no they were never merrier they have their grog at night and tell the raciest stories they hear of the death of people about their own age or even younger not as if it was a grisly warning but with a simple childlike pleasure at having outlived some one else and when a draught might puff them out like a guttering candle or a bit of a stumble shatter them like so much glass their old hearts keep sound and unaffrighted and they go on bubbling with laughter through years of mans age compared to which the valley at balaclava was as safe and peaceful as a village cricketgreen on sunday it may fairly be questioned if we look to the peril only whether it was a much more daring feat for curtius to plunge into the gulf than for any old gentleman of ninety to doff his clothes and clamber into bed  indeed it is a memorable subject for consideration with what unconcern and gaiety mankind pricks on along the valley of the shadow of death the whole way is one wilderness of snares and the end of it for those who fear the last pinch is irrevocable ruin and yet we go spinning through it all like a party for the derby perhaps the reader remembers one of the humorous devices of the deified caligula how he encouraged a vast concourse of holidaymakers on to his bridge over baiÃ¦ bay and when they were in the height of their enjoyment turned loose the prÃ¦torian guards among the company and had them tossed into the sea this is no bad miniature of the dealings of nature with the transitory race of man only what a chequered picnic we have of it even while it lasts and into what great waters not to be crossed by any swimmer gods pale prÃ¦torian throws us over in the end  we live the time that a match flickers we pop the cork of a gingerbeer bottle and the earthquake swallows us on the instant is it not odd is it not incongruous is it not in the highest sense of human speech incredible that we should think so highly of the gingerbeer and regard so little the devouring earthquake the love of life and the fear of death are two famous phrases that grow harder to understand the more we think about them it is a wellknown fact that an immense proportion of boat accidents would never happen if people held the sheet in their hands instead of making it fast and yet unless it be some martinet of a professional mariner or some landsman with shattered nerves every one of gods creatures makes it fast a strange instance of mans unconcern and brazen boldness in the face of death  we confound ourselves with metaphysical phrases which we import into daily talk with noble inappropriateness we have no idea of what death is apart from its circumstances and some of its consequences to others and although we have some experience of living there is not a man on earth who has flown so high into abstraction as to have any practical guess at the meaning of the word life all literature from job and omar khayam to thomas carlyle or walt whitman is but an attempt to look upon the human state with such largeness of view as shall enable us to rise from the consideration of living to the definition of life and our sages give us about the best satisfaction in their power when they say that it is a vapour or a show or made out of the same stuff with dreams philosophy in its more rigid sense has been at the same work for ages and after a myriad bald heads have wagged over the problem and piles of words have been heaped one upon another into dry and cloudy volumes without end philosophy has the honour of laying before us with modest pride her contribution towards the subject that life is a permanent possibility of sensation truly a fine result a man may very well love beef or hunting or a woman but surely surely not a permanent possibility of sensation he may be afraid of a precipice or a dentist or a large enemy with a club or even an undertakers man but not certainly of abstract death we may trick with the word life in its dozen senses until we are weary of tricking we may argue in terms of all the philosophies on earth but one fact remains true throughoutthat we do not love life in the sense that we are greatly preoccupied about its conservation that we do not properly speaking love life at all but living into the views of the least careful there will enter some degree of providence no mans eyes are fixed entirely on the passing hour but although we have some anticipation of good health good weather wine active employment love and selfapproval the sum of these anticipations does not amount to anything like a general view of lifes possibilities and issues nor are those who cherish them most vividly at all the most scrupulous of their personal safety to be deeply interested in the accidents of our existence to enjoy keenly the mixed tenure of human experience rather leads a man to disregard precautions and risk his neck against a straw for surely the love of living is stronger in an alpine climber roping over a peril or a hunter riding merrily at a stiff fence than in a creature who lives upon a diet and walks a measured distance in the interest of his constitution  there is a great deal of very vile nonsense talked upon both sides of the matter tearing divines reducing life to the dimensions of a mere funeral procession so short as to be hardly decent and melancholy unbelievers yearning for the tomb as if it were a world too far away both sides must feel a little ashamed of their performances now and again when they draw in their chairs to dinner indeed a good meal and a bottle of wine is an answer to most standard works upon the question when a mans heart warms to his viands he forgets a great deal of sophistry and soars into a rosy zone of contemplation death may be knocking at the door like the commanders statue we have something else in hand thank god and let him knock passingbells are ringing all the world over all the world over and every hour some one is parting company with all his aches and ecstasies for us also the trap is laid but we are so fond of life that we have no leisure to entertain the terror of death it is a honeymoon with us all through and none of the longest small blame to us if we give our whole hearts to this glowing bride of ours to the appetites to honour to the hungry curiosity of the mind to the pleasure of the eyes in nature and the pride of our own nimble bodies  we all of us appreciate the sensations but as for caring about the permanence of the possibility a mans head is generally very bald and his senses very dull before he comes to that whether we regard life as a lane leading to a dead walla mere bags end as the french sayor whether we think of it as a vestibule or gymnasium where we wait our turn and prepare our faculties for some more noble destiny whether we thunder in a pulpit or pule in little atheistic poetrybooks about its vanity and brevity whether we look justly for years of health and vigour or are about to mount into a bathchair as a step towards the hearse in each and all of these views and situations there is but one conclusion possible that a man should stop his ears against paralysing terror and run the race that is set before him with a single mind no one surely could have recoiled with more heartache and terror from the thought of death than our respected lexicographer and yet we know how little it affected his conduct how wisely and boldly he walked and in what a fresh and lively vein he spoke of life already an old man he ventured on his highland tour and his heart bound with triple brass did not recoil before twentyseven individual cups of tea as courage and intelligence are the two qualities best worth a good mans cultivation so it is the first part of intelligence to recognise our precarious estate in life and the first part of courage to be not at all abashed before the fact a frank and somewhat headlong carriage not looking too anxiously before not dallying in maudlin regret over the past stamps the man who is well armoured for this world  and not only well armoured for himself but a good friend and a good citizen to boot we do not go to cowards for tender dealing there is nothing so cruel as panic the man who has least fear for his own carcase has most time to consider others that eminent chemist who took his walks abroad in tin shoes and subsisted wholly upon tepid milk had all his work cut out for him in considerate dealings with his own digestion so soon as prudence has begun to grow up in the brain like a dismal fungus it finds its first expression in a paralysis of generous acts the victim begins to shrink spiritually he develops a fancy for parlours with a regulated temperature and takes his morality on the principle of tin shoes and tepid milk the care of one important body or soul becomes so engrossing that all the noises of the outer world begin to come thin and faint into the parlour with the regulated temperature and the tin shoes go equably forward over blood and rain to be overwise is to ossify and the scruplemonger ends by standing stockstill now the man who has his heart on his sleeve and a good whirling weathercock of a brain who reckons his life as a thing to be dashingly used and cheerfully hazarded makes a very different acquaintance of the world keeps all his pulses going true and fast and gathers impetus as he runs until if he be running towards anything better than wildfire he may shoot up and become a constellation in the end lord look after his health lord have a care of his soul says he and he has at the key of the position and swashes through incongruity and peril towards his aim death is on all sides of him with pointed batteries as he is on all sides of all of us unfortunate surprises gird him round mimmouthed friends and relations hold up their hands in quite a little elegiacal synod about his path and what cares he for all this being a true lover of living a fellow with something pushing and spontaneous in his inside he must like any other soldier in any other stirring deadly warfare push on at his best pace until he touch the goal a peerage or westminster abbey cried nelson in his bright boyish heroic manner these are great incentives not for any of these but for the plain satisfaction of living of being about their business in some sort or other do the brave serviceable men of every nation tread down the nettle danger and pass flyingly over all the stumblingblocks of prudence think of the heroism of johnson think of that superb indifference to mortal limitation that set him upon his dictionary and carried him through triumphantly until the end who if he were wisely considerate of things at large would ever embark upon any work much more considerable than a halfpenny postcard who would project a serial novel after thackeray and dickens had each fallen in midcourse who would find heart enough to begin to live if he dallied with the consideration of death  and after all what sorry and pitiful quibbling all this is to forego all the issues of living in a parlour with a regulated temperatureas if that were not to die a hundred times over and for ten years at a stretch as if it were not to die in ones own lifetime and without even the sad immunities of death as if it were not to die and yet be the patient spectators of our own pitiable change the permanent possibility is preserved but the sensations carefully held at arms length as if one kept a photographic plate in a dark chamber it is better to lose health like a spendthrift than to waste it like a miser it is better to live and be done with it than to die daily in the sickroom by all means begin your folio even if the doctor does not give you a year even if he hesitates about a month make one brave push and see what can be accomplished in a week it is not only in finished undertakings that we ought to honour useful labour a spirit goes out of the man who means execution which outlives the most untimely ending all who have meant good work with their whole hearts have done good work although they may die before they have the time to sign it every heart that has beat strong and cheerfully has left a hopeful impulse behind it in the world and bettered the tradition of mankind and even if death catch people like an open pitfall and in midcareer laying out vast projects and planning monstrous foundations flushed with hope and their mouths full of boastful language they should be at once tripped up and silenced is there not something brave and spirited in such a termination and does not life go down with a better grace foaming in full body over a precipice than miserably straggling to an end in sandy deltas when the greeks made their fine saying that those whom the gods love die young i cannot help believing they had this sort of death also in their eye for surely at whatever age it overtake the man this is to die young death has not been suffered to take so much as an illusion from his heart in the hotfit of life atiptoe on the highest point of being he passes at a bound on to the other side the noise of the mallet and chisel is scarcely quenched the trumpets are hardly done blowing when trailing with him clouds of glory this happystarred fullblooded spirit shoots into the spiritual land                                        vi                                 el dorado   it seems as if a great deal were attainable in a world where there are so many marriages and decisive battles and where we all at certain hours of the day and with great gusto and despatch stow a portion of victuals finally and irretrievably into the bag which contains us and it would seem also on a hasty view that the attainment of as much as possible was the one goal of mans contentious life and yet as regards the spirit this is but a semblance we live in an ascending scale when we live happily one thing leading to another in an endless series there is always a new horizon for onwardlooking men and although we dwell on a small planet immersed in petty business and not enduring beyond a brief period of years we are so constituted that our hopes are inaccessible like stars and the term of hoping is prolonged until the term of life to be truly happy is a question of how we begin and not of how we end of what we want and not of what we have an aspiration is a joy for ever a possession as solid as a landed estate a fortune which we can never exhaust and which gives us year by year a revenue of pleasurable activity to have many of these is to be spiritually rich life is only a very dull and illdirected theatre unless we have some interests in the piece and to those who have neither art nor science the world is a mere arrangement of colours or a rough footway where they may very well break their shins it is in virtue of his own desires and curiosities that any man continues to exist with even patience that he is charmed by the look of things and people and that he wakens every morning with a renewed appetite for work and pleasure desire and curiosity are the two eyes through which he sees the world in the most enchanted colours it is they that make women beautiful or fossils interesting and the man may squander his estate and come to beggary but if he keeps these two amulets he is still rich in the possibilities of pleasure suppose he could take one meal so compact and comprehensive that he should never hunger any more suppose him at a glance to take in all the features of the world and allay the desire for knowledge suppose him to do the like in any province of experiencewould not that man be in a poor way for amusement ever after  one who goes touring on foot with a single volume in his knapsack reads with circumspection pausing often to reflect and often laying the book down to contemplate the landscape or the prints in the inn parlour for he fears to come to an end of his entertainment and be left companionless on the last stages of his journey a young fellow recently finished the works of thomas carlyle winding up if we remember aright with the ten notebooks upon frederick the great what cried the young fellow in consternation is there no more carlyle am i left to the daily papers a more celebrated instance is that of alexander who wept bitterly because he had no more worlds to subdue and when gibbon had finished the decline and fall he had only a few moments of joy and it was with a sober melancholy that he parted from his labours  happily we all shoot at the moon with ineffectual arrows our hopes are set on inaccessible el dorado we come to an end of nothing here below interests are only plucked up to sow themselves again like mustard you would think when the child was born there would be an end to trouble and yet it is only the beginning of fresh anxieties and when you have seen it through its teething and its education and at last its marriage alas it is only to have new fears new quivering sensibilities with every day and the health of your childrens children grows as touching a concern as that of your own again when you have married your wife you would think you were got upon a hilltop and might begin to go downward by an easy slope but you have only ended courting to begin marriage falling in love and winning love are often difficult tasks to overbearing and rebellious spirits but to keep in love is also a business of some importance to which both man and wife must bring kindness and goodwill the true love story commences at the altar when there lies before the married pair a most beautiful contest of wisdom and generosity and a lifelong struggle towards an unattainable ideal unattainable ay surely unattainable from the very fact that they are two instead of one  of making books there is no end complained the preacher and did not perceive how highly he was praising letters as an occupation there is no end indeed to making books or experiments or to travel or to gathering wealth problem gives rise to problem we may study for ever and we are never as learned as we would we have never made a statue worthy of our dreams and when we have discovered a continent or crossed a chain of mountains it is only to find another ocean or another plain upon the farther side in the infinite universe there is room for our swiftest diligence and to spare it is not like the works of carlyle which can be read to an end even in a corner of it in a private park or in the neighbourhood of a single hamlet the weather and the seasons keep so deftly changing that although we walk there for a lifetime there will be always something new to startle and delight us  there is only one wish realisable on the earth only one thing that can be perfectly attained death and from a variety of circumstances we have no one to tell us whether it be worth attaining  a strange picture we make on our way to our chimÃ¦ras ceaselessly marching grudging ourselves the time for rest indefatigable adventurous pioneers it is true that we shall never reach the goal it is even more than probable that there is no such place and if we live for centuries and were endowed with the powers of a god we should find ourselves not much nearer what we wanted at the end o toiling hands of mortals o unwearied feet travelling ye know not whither soon soon it seems to you you must come forth on some conspicuous hilltop and but a little way farther against the setting sun descry the spires of el dorado little do ye know your own blessedness for to travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive and the true success is to labour                                       vii                           the english admirals     whether it be wise in men to do such actions or no i am sure it is    so in states to honour themsir william temple   there is one story of the wars of rome which i have always very much envied for england germanicus was going down at the head of the legions into a dangerous riveron the opposite bank the woods were full of germanswhen there flew out seven great eagles which seemed to marshal the romans on their way they did not pause or waver but disappeared into the forest where the enemy lay concealed forward cried germanicus with a fine rhetorical inspiration forward and follow the roman birds it would be a very heavy spirit that did not give a leap at such a signal and a very timorous one that continued to have any doubt of success to appropriate the eagles as fellowcountrymen was to make imaginary allies of the forces of nature the roman empire and its military fortunes and along with these the prospects of those individual roman legionaries now fording a river in germany looked altogether greater and more hopeful it is a kind of illusion easy to produce a particular shape of cloud the appearance of a particular star the holiday of some particular saintanything in short to remind the combatants of patriotic legends or old successesmay be enough to change the issue of a pitched battle for it gives to the one party a feeling that right and the larger interests are with them  if an englishman wishes to have such a feeling it must be about the sea the lion is nothing to us he has not been taken to the hearts of the people and naturalised as an english emblem we know right well that a lion would fall foul of us as grimly as he would of a frenchman or a moldavian jew and we do not carry him before us in the smoke of battle but the sea is our approach and bulwark it has been the scene of our greatest triumphs and dangers and we are accustomed in lyrical strains to claim it as our own the prostrating experiences of foreigners between calais and dover have always an agreeable side to english prepossessions a man from bedfordshire who does not know one end of the ship from the other until she begins to move swaggers among such persons with a sense of hereditary nautical experience to suppose yourself endowed with natural parts for the sea because you are the countryman of blake and mighty nelson is perhaps just as unwarrantable as to imagine scotch extraction a sufficient guarantee that you will look well in a kilt but the feeling is there and seated beyond the reach of argument we should consider ourselves unworthy of our descent if we did not share the arrogance of our progenitors and please ourselves with the pretension that the sea is english even where it is looked upon by the guns and battlements of another nation we regard it as a kind of english cemetery where the bones of our seafaring fathers take their rest until the last trumpet for i suppose no other nation has lost as many ships or sent as many brave fellows to the bottom  there is nowhere such a background for heroism as the noble terrifying and picturesque conditions of some of our seafights hawkes battle in the tempest and aboukir at the moment when the french admiral blew up reach the limit of what is imposing to the imagination and our naval annals owe some of their interest to the fantastic and beautiful appearance of old warships and the romance that invests the sea and everything seagoing in the eyes of english lads on a halfholiday at the coast nay and what we know of the misery betweendecks enhances the bravery of what was done by giving it something for contrast we like to know that these bold and honest fellows contrived to live and to keep bold and honest among absurd and vile surroundings no reader can forget the description of the thunder in roderick random the disorderly tyranny the cruelty and dirt of officers and men deck after deck each with some new object of offence the hospital where the hammocks were huddled together with but fourteen inches space for each the cockpit far under water where in an intolerable stench the spectacled steward kept the accounts of the different messes and the canvas enclosure six feet square in which morgan made flip and salmagundi smoked his pipe sang his welsh songs and swore his queer welsh imprecations there are portions of this business on board the thunder over which the reader passes lightly and hurriedly like a traveller in a malarious country it is easy enough to understand the opinion of dr johnson why sir he said no man will be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get himself into a jail you would fancy anyones spirit would die out under such an accumulation of darkness noisomeness and injustice above all when he had not come there of his own free will but under the cutlasses and bludgeons of the pressgang but perhaps a watch on deck in the sharp sea air put a man on his mettle again a battle must have been a capital relief and prizemoney bloodily earned and grossly squandered opened the doors of the prison for a twinkling somehow or other at least this worst of possible lives could not overlie the spirit and gaiety of our sailors they did their duty as though they had some interest in the fortune of that country which so cruelly oppressed them they served their guns merrily when it came to fighting and they had the readiest ear for a bold honourable sentiment of any class of men the world ever produced  most men of high destinies have highsounding names pym and habakkuk may do pretty well but they must not think to cope with the cromwells and isaiahs and you could not find a better case in point than that of the english admirals drake and rooke and hawke are picked names for men of execution frobisher rodney boscawen foulweather jack byron are all good to catch the eye in a page of a naval history cloudesley shovel is a mouthful of quaint and sounding syllables benbow has a bulldog quality that suits the mans character and it takes us back to those english archers who were his true comrades for plainness tenacity and pluck raleigh is spirited and martial and signifies an act of bold conduct in the field it is impossible to judge of blake or nelson no names current among men being worthy of such heroes but still it is odd enough and very appropriate in this connection that the latter was greatly taken with his sicilian title the signification perhaps pleased him says southey duke of thunder was what in dahomey would have been called a strong name it was to a sailors taste and certainly to no man could it be more applicable admiral in itself is one of the most satisfactory of distinctions it has a noble sound and a very proud history and columbus thought so highly of it that he enjoined his heirs to sign themselves by that title as long as the house should last  but it is the spirit of the men and not their names that i wish to speak about in this paper that spirit is truly english they and not tennysons cottonspinners or mr darcy thompsons abstract bagman are the true and typical englishmen there may be more head of bagmen in the country but human beings are reckoned by number only in political constitutions and the admirals are typical in the full force of the word they are splendid examples of virtue indeed but of a virtue in which most englishmen can claim a moderate share and what we admire in their lives is a sort of apotheosis of ourselves almost everybody in our land except humanitarians and a few persons whose youth has been depressed by exceptionally Ã¦sthetic surroundings can understand and sympathise with an admiral or a prizefighter i do not wish to bracket benbow and tom cribb but depend upon it they are practically bracketed for admiration in the minds of many frequenters of alehouses if you told them about germanicus and the eagles or regulus going back to carthage they would very likely fall asleep but tell them about harry pearce and jem belcher or about nelson and the nile and they put down their pipes to listen i have by me a copy of boxiana on the flyleaves of which a youthful member of the fancy kept a chronicle of remarkable events and an obituary of great men here we find piously chronicled the demise of jockeys watermen and pugilistsjohnny moore of the liverpool prize ring tom spring aged fiftysix pierce egan senior writer of boxiana and other sporting worksand among all these the duke of wellington if benbow had lived in the time of this annalist do you suppose his name would not have been added to the glorious roll in short we do not all feel warmly towards wesley or laud we cannot all take pleasure in paradise lost but there are certain common sentiments and touches of nature by which the whole nation is made to feel kinship a little while ago everybody from hazlitt and john wilson down to the imbecile creature who scribbled his register on the flyleaves of boxiana felt a more or less shamefaced satisfaction in the exploits of prizefighters and the exploits of the admirals are popular to the same degree and tell in all ranks of society their sayings and doings stir english blood like the sound of a trumpet and if the indian empire the trade of london and all the outward and visible ensigns of our greatness should pass away we should still leave behind us a durable monument of what we were in these sayings and doings of the english admirals  duncan lying off the texel with his own flagship the venerable and only one other vessel heard that the whole dutch fleet was putting to sea he told captain hotham to anchor alongside of him in the narrowest part of the channel and fight his vessel till she sank i have taken the depth of the water added he and when the venerable goes down my flag will still fly and you observe this is no naked viking in a prehistoric period but a scottish member of parliament with a smattering of the classics a telescope a cocked hat of great size and flannel underclothing in the same spirit nelson went into aboukir with six colours flying so that even if five were shot away it should not be imagined he had struck he too must needs wear his four stars outside his admirals frock to be a butt for sharpshooters in honour i gained them he said to objectors adding with sublime illogicality in honour i will die with them captain douglas of the royal oak when the dutch fired his vessel in the thames sent his men ashore but was burned along with her himself rather than desert his post without orders just then perhaps the merry monarch was chasing a moth round the suppertable with the ladies of his court when raleigh sailed into cadiz and all the forts and ships opened fire on him at once he scorned to shoot a gun and made answer with a flourish of insulting trumpets i like this bravado better than the wisest dispositions to ensure victory it comes from the heart and goes to it god has made nobler heroes but he never made a finer gentleman than walter raleigh and as our admirals were full of heroic superstitions and had a strutting and vainglorious style of fight so they discovered a startling eagerness for battle and courted war like a mistress when the news came to essex before cadiz that the attack had been decided he threw his hat into the sea it is in this way that a schoolboy hears of a halfholiday but this was a bearded man of great possessions who had just been allowed to risk his life benbow could not lie still in his bunk after he had lost his leg he must be on deck in a basket to direct and animate the fight i said they loved war like a mistress yet i think there are not many mistresses we should continue to woo under similar circumstances trowbridge went ashore with the culloden and was able to take no part in the battle of the nile the merits of that ship and her gallant captain wrote nelson to the admiralty are too well known to benefit by anything i could say her misfortune was great in getting aground while her more fortunate companions were in the full tide of happiness this is a notable expression and depicts the whole greathearted bigspoken stock of the english admirals to a hair it was to be in the full tide of happiness for nelson to destroy five thousand five hundred and twentyfive of his fellowcreatures and have his own scalp torn open by a piece of langridge shot hear him again at copenhagen a shot through the mainmast knocked the splinters about and he observed to one of his officers with a smile it is warm work and this may be the last to any of us at any moment and then stopping short at the gangway added with emotion but mark youi would not be elsewhere for thousands  i must tell one more story which has lately been made familiar to us all and that in one of the noblest ballads of the english language i had written my tame prose abstract i shall beg the reader to believe when i had no notion that the sacred bard designed an immortality for greenville sir richard greenville was viceadmiral to lord thomas howard and lay off the azores with the english squadron in 1591 he was a noted tyrant to his crew a dark bullying fellow apparently and it is related of him that he would chew and swallow wineglasses by way of convivial levity till the blood ran out of his mouth when the spanish fleet of fifty sail came within sight of the english his ship the revenge was the last to weigh anchor and was so far circumvented by the spaniards that there were but two courses openeither to turn her back upon the enemy or sail through one of his squadrons the first alternative greenville dismissed as dishonourable to himself his country and her majestys ship accordingly he chose the latter and steered into the spanish armament several vessels he forced to luff and fall under his lee until about three oclock of the afternoon a great ship of three decks of ordnance took the wind out of his sails and immediately boarded thenceforward and all night long the revenge held her own singlehanded against the spaniards as one ship was beaten off another took its place she endured according to raleighs computation eight hundred shot of great artillery besides many assaults and entries by morning the powder was spent the pikes all broken not a stick was standing nothing left overhead either for flight or defence six feet of water in the hold almost all the men hurt and greenville himself in a dying condition to bring them to this pass a fleet of fifty sail had been mauling them for fifteen hours the admiral of the hulks and the ascension of seville had both gone down alongside and two other vessels had taken refuge on shore in a sinking state in hawkes words they had taken a great deal of drubbing the captain and crew thought they had done about enough but greenville was not of this opinion he gave orders to the mastergunner whom he knew to be a fellow after his own stamp to scuttle the revenge where she lay the others who were not mortally wounded like the admiral interfered with some decision locked the mastergunner in his cabin after having deprived him of his sword for he manifested an intention to kill himself if he were not to sink the ship and sent to the spaniards to demand terms these were granted the second or third day after greenville died of his wounds aboard the spanish flagship leaving his contempt upon the traitors and dogs who had not chosen to do as he did and engage fifty vessels well found and fully manned with six inferior craft ravaged by sickness and short of stores he at least he said had done his duty as he was bound to do and looked for everlasting fame  some one said to me the other day that they considered this story to be of a pestilent example i am not inclined to imagine we shall ever be put into any practical difficulty from a superfluity of greenvilles and besides i demur to the opinion the worth of such actions is not a thing to be decided in a quaver of sensibility or a flush of righteous commonsense the man who wished to make the ballads of his country coveted a small matter compared to what richard greenville accomplished i wonder how many people have been inspired by this mad story and how many battles have been actually won for england in the spirit thus engendered it is only with a measure of habitual foolhardiness that you can be sure in the common run of men of courage on a reasonable occasion an army or a fleet if it is not led by quixotic fancies will not be led far by terror of the provostmarshal even german warfare in addition to maps and telegraphs is not above employing the wacht am rhein nor is it only in the profession of arms that such stories may do good to a man in this desperate and gleeful fighting whether it is greenville or benbow hawke or nelson who flies his colours in the ship we see men brought to the test and giving proof of what we call heroic feeling prosperous humanitarians tell me in my club smokingroom that they are a prey to prodigious heroic feelings and that it costs them more nobility of soul to do nothing in particular than would carry on all the wars by sea or land of bellicose humanity it may very well be so and yet not touch the point in question for what i desire is to see some of this nobility brought face to face with me in an inspiriting achievement a man may talk smoothly over a cigar in my club smokingroom from now to the day of judgment without adding anything to mankinds treasury of illustrious and encouraging examples it is not over the virtues of a curateandteaparty novel that people are abashed into high resolutions it may be because their hearts are crass but to stir them properly they must have men entering into glory with some pomp and circumstance and that is why these stories of our seacaptains printed so to speak in capitals and full of bracing moral influence are more valuable to england than any material benefit in all the books of political economy between westminster and birmingham greenville chewing wineglasses at table makes no very pleasant figure any more than a thousand other artists when they are viewed in the body or met in private life but his work of art his finished tragedy is an eloquent performance and i contend it ought not only to enliven men of the sword as they go into battle but send back merchantclerks with more heart and spirit to their bookkeeping by double entry  there is another question which seems bound up in this and that is temples problem whether it was wise of douglas to burn with the royal oak and by implication what it was that made him do so many will tell you it was the desire of fame  to what do cÃ¦sar and alexander owe the infinite grandeur of their renown but to fortune how many men has she extinguished in the beginning of their progress of whom we have no knowledge who brought as much courage to the work as they if their adverse hap had not cut them off in the first sally of their arms amongst so many and so great dangers i do not remember to have anywhere read that cÃ¦sar was ever wounded a thousand have fallen in less dangers than the least of those he went through a great many brave actions must be expected to be performed without witness for one that comes to some notice a man is not always at the top of a breach or at the head of an army in the sight of his general as upon a platform he is often surprised between the hedge and the ditch he must run the hazard of his life against a henroost he must dislodge four rascally musketeers out of a barn he must pick out single from his party as necessity arises and meet adventures alone  thus far montaigne in a characteristic essay on glory where death is certain as in the cases of douglas or greenville it seems all one from a personal point of view the man who lost his life against a henroost is in the same pickle with him who lost his life against a fortified place of the first order whether he has missed a peerage or only the corporals stripes it is all one if he has missed them and is quietly in the grave it was by a hazard that we learned the conduct of the four marines of the wager there was no room for these brave fellows in the boat and they were left behind upon the island to a certain death they were soldiers they said and knew well enough it was their business to die and as their comrades pulled away they stood upon the beach gave three cheers and cried god bless the king now one or two of those who were in the boat escaped against all likelihood to tell the story that was a great thing for us but surely it cannot by any possible twisting of human speech be construed into anything great for the marines you may suppose if you like that they died hoping their behaviour would not be forgotten or you may suppose they thought nothing on the subject which is much more likely what can be the signification of the word fame to a private of marines who cannot read and knows nothing of past history beyond the reminiscences of his grandmother but whichever supposition you make the fact is unchanged they died while the question still hung in the balance and i suppose their bones were already white before the winds and the waves and the humour of indian chiefs and spanish governors had decided whether they were to be unknown and useless martyrs or honoured heroes indeed i believe this is the lesson if it is for fame that men do brave actions they are only silly fellows after all  it is at best but a pettifogging pickthank business to decompose actions into little personal motives and explain heroism away the abstract bagman will grow like an admiral at heart not by ungrateful carping but in a heat of admiration but there is another theory of the personal motive in these fine sayings and doings which i believe to be true and wholesome people usually do things and suffer martyrdoms because they have an inclination that way the best artist is not the man who fixes his eye on posterity but the one who loves the practice of his art and instead of having a taste for being successful merchants and retiring at thirty some people have a taste for high and what we call heroic forms of excitement if the admirals courted war like a mistress if as the drum beat to quarters the sailors came gaily out of the forecastleit is because a fight is a period of multiplied and intense experiences and by nelsons computation worth thousands to any one who has a heart under his jacket if the marines of the wager gave three cheers and cried god bless the king it was because they liked to do things nobly for their own satisfaction they were giving their lives there was no help for that and they made it a point of selfrespect to give them handsomely and there were never four happier marines in gods world than these four at that moment if it was worth thousands to be at the baltic i wish a benthamite arithmetician would calculate how much it was worth to be one of these four marines or how much their story is worth to each of us who read it and mark you undemonstrative men would have spoiled the situation the finest action is the better for a piece of purple if the soldiers of the birkenhead had not gone down in line or these marines of the wager had walked away simply into the island like plenty of other brave fellows in the like circumstances my benthamite arithmetician would assign a far lower value to the two stories we have to desire a grand air in our heroes and such a knowledge of the human stage as shall make them put the dots on their own is and leave us in no suspense as to when they mean to be heroic and hence we should congratulate ourselves upon the fact that our admirals were not only greathearted but bigspoken  the heroes themselves say as often as not that fame is their object but i do not think that is much to the purpose people generally say what they have been taught to say that was the catchword they were given in youth to express the aims of their way of life and men who are gaining great battles are not likely to take much trouble in reviewing their sentiments and the words in which they were told to express them almost every person if you will believe himself holds a quite different theory of life from the one on which he is patently acting and the fact is fame may be a forethought and an afterthought but it is too abstract an idea to move people greatly in moments of swift and momentous decision it is from something more immediate some determination of blood to the head some trick of the fancy that the breach is stormed or the bold word spoken i am sure a fellow shooting an ugly weir in a canoe has exactly as much thought about fame as most commanders going into battle and yet the action fall out how it will is not one of those the muse delights to celebrate indeed it is difficult to see why the fellow does a thing so nameless and yet so formidable to look at unless on the theory that he likes it i suspect that is why and i suspect it is at least ten per cent of why lord beaconsfield and mr gladstone have debated so much in the house of commons and why burnaby rode to khiva the other day and why the admirals courted war like a mistress                                       viii                         some portraits by raeburn   through the initiative of a prominent citizen edinburgh has been in possession for some autumn weeks of a gallery of paintings of singular merit and interest they were exposed in the apartments of the scottish academy and filled those who are accustomed to visit the annual spring exhibition with astonishment and a sense of incongruity instead of the too common purple sunsets and peagreen fields and distances executed in putty and hogs lard he beheld looking down upon him from the walls of room after room a whole army of wise grave humorous capable or beautiful countenances painted simply and strongly by a man of genuine instinct it was a complete act of the human drawingroom comedy lords and ladies soldiers and doctors hanging judges and heretical divines a whole generation of good society was resuscitated and the scotsman of today walked about among the scotsman of two generations ago the moment was well chosen neither too late nor too early the people who sat for these pictures are not yet ancestors they are still relations they are not yet altogether a part of the dusty past but occupy a middle distance within cry of our affections the little child who looks wonderingly on his grandfathers watch in the picture is now the veteran sheriff emeritus of perth and i hear a story of a lady who returned the other day to edinburgh after an absence of sixty years i could see none of my old friends she said until i went into the raeburn gallery and found them all there  it would be difficult to say whether the collection was more interesting on the score of unity or diversity where the portraits were all of the same period almost all of the same race and all from the same brush there could not fail to be many points of similarity and yet the similarity of the handling seems to throw into more vigorous relief those personal distinctions which raeburn was so quick to seize he was a born painter of portraits he looked people shrewdly between the eyes surprised their manners in their face and had possessed himself of what was essential in their character before they had been many minutes in his studio what he was so swift to perceive he conveyed to the canvas almost in the moment of conception he had never any difficulty he said about either hands or faces about draperies or light or composition he might see room for hesitation or afterthought but a face or a hand was something plain and legible there were no two ways about it any more than about the persons name and so each of his portraits is not only in doctor johnsons phrase aptly quoted on the catalogue a piece of history but a piece of biography into the bargain it is devoutly to be wished that all biography were equally amusing and carried its own credentials equally upon its face these portraits are racier than many anecdotes and more complete than many a volume of sententious memoirs you can see whether you get a stronger and clearer idea of robertson the historian from raeburns palette or dugald stewarts woolly and evasive periods and then the portraits are both signed and countersigned for you have first the authority of the artist whom you recognise as no mean critic of the looks and manners of men and next you have the tacit acquiescence of the subject who sits looking out upon you with inimitable innocence and apparently under the impression that he is in a room by himself for raeburn could plunge at once through all the constraint and embarrassment of the sitter and present the face clear open and intelligent as at the most disengaged moments this is best seen in portraits where the sitter is represented in some appropriate action neil gow with his fiddle doctor spens shooting an arrow or lord bannatyne hearing a cause above all from this point of view the portrait of lieutenantcolonel lyon is notable a strange enough young man pink fat about the lower part of the face with a lean forehead a narrow nose and a fine nostril sits with a drawing board upon his knees he has just paused to render himself account of some difficulty to disentangle some complication of line or compare neighbouring values and there without any perceptible wrinkling you have rendered for you exactly the fixed look in the eyes and the unconscious compression of the mouth that befit and signify an effort of the kind the whole pose the whole expression is absolutely direct and simple you are ready to take your oath to it that colonel lyon had no idea he was sitting for his picture and thought of nothing in the world besides his own occupation of the moment  although the collection did not embrace i understand nearly the whole of raeburns works it was too large not to contain some that were indifferent whether as works of art or as portraits certainly the standard was remarkably high and was wonderfully maintained but there were one or two pictures that might have been almost as well awayone or two that seemed wanting in salt and some that you can only hope were not successful likenesses neither of the portraits of sir walter scott for instance was very agreeable to look upon you do not care to think that scott looked quite so rustic and puffy and where is that peaked forehead which according to all written accounts and many portraits was the distinguishing characteristic of his face again in spite of his own satisfaction and in spite of dr john brown i cannot consider that raeburn was very happy in hands without doubt he could paint one if he had taken the trouble to study it but it was by no means always that he gave himself the trouble looking round one of these rooms hung about with his portraits you were struck with the array of expressive faces as compared with what you may have seen in looking round a room full of living people but it was not so with the hands the portraits differed from each other in face perhaps ten times as much as they differed by the hand whereas with living people the two go pretty much together and where one is remarkable the other will almost certainly not be commonplace  one interesting portrait was that of duncan of camperdown he stands in uniform beside a table his feet slightly straddled with the balance of an old sailor his hand poised upon a chart by the fingertips the mouth is pursed the nostril spread and drawn up the eyebrows very highly arched the cheeks lie along the jaw in folds of iron and have the redness that comes from much exposure to salt sea winds from the whole figure attitude and countenance there breathes something precise and decisive something alert wiry and strong you can understand from the look of him that sense not so much of humour as of what is grimmest and driest in pleasantry which inspired his address before the fight at camperdown he had just overtaken the dutch fleet under admiral de winter gentlemen says he you see a severe winter approaching i have only to advise you to keep up a good fire somewhat of this same spirit of adamantine drollery must have supported him in the days of the mutiny at the nore when he lay off the texel with his own flagship the venerable and only one other vessel and kept up active signals as though he had a powerful fleet in the offing to intimidate the dutch  another portrait which irresistibly attracted the eye was the halflength of robert mqueen of braxfield lord justiceclerk if i know gusto in painting when i see it this canvas was painted with rare enjoyment the tart rosy humorous look of the man his nose like a cudgel his face resting squarely on the jowl has been caught and perpetuated with something that looks like brotherly love a peculiarly subtle expression haunts the lower part sensual and incredulous like that of a man tasting good bordeaux with half a fancy it has been somewhat too long uncorked from under the pendulous eyelids of old age the eyes look out with a halfyouthful halffrosty twinkle hands with no pretence to distinction are folded on the judges stomach so sympathetically is the character conceived by the portraitpainter that it is hardly possible to avoid some movement of sympathy on the part of the spectator and sympathy is a thing to be encouraged apart from humane considerations because it supplies us with the materials for wisdom it is probably more instructive to entertain a sneaking kindness for any unpopular person and among the rest for lord braxfield than to give way to perfect raptures of moral indignation against his abstract vices he was the last judge on the scots bench to employ the pure scots idiom his opinions thus given in doric and conceived in a lively rugged conversational style were full of point and authority out of the bar or off the bench he was a convivial man a lover of wine and one who shone perculiarly at tavern meetings he has left behind him an unrivalled reputation for rough and cruel speech and to this day his name smacks of the gallows it was he who presided at the trials of muir and skirving in 1793 and 1794 and his appearance on these occasions was scarcely cut to the pattern of today his summing up on muir began thusthe reader must supply for himself the growling blacksmiths voice and the broad scots accent now this is the question for considerationis the panel guilty of sedition or is he not now before this can be answered two things must be attended to that require no proof first that the british constitution is the best that ever was since the creation of the world and it is not possible to make it better its a pretty fair start is it not for a political trial a little later he has occasion to refer to the relations of muir with those wretches the french i never liked the french all my days said his lordship but now i hate them and yet a little further on a government in any country should be like a corporation and in this country it is made up of the landed interest which alone has a right to be represented as for the rabble who have nothing but personal property what hold has the nation of them they may pack up their property on their backs and leave the country in the twinkling of an eye after having made profession of sentiments so cynically antipopular as these when the trials were at an end which was generally about midnight braxfield would walk home to his house in george square with no better escort than an easy conscience i think i see him getting his cloak about his shoulders and with perhaps a lantern in one hand steering his way along the streets in the mirk january night it might have been that very day that skirving had defied him in these words it is altogether unavailing for your lordship to menace me for i have long learned to fear not the face of man and i can fancy as braxfield reflected on the number of what he called grumbletonians in edinburgh and of how many of them must bear special malice against so upright and inflexible a judge nay and might at that very moment be lurking in the mouth of a dark close with hostile intenti can fancy that he indulged in a sour smile as he reflected that he also was not especially afraid of mens faces or mens fists and had hitherto found no occasion to embody this insensibility in heroic words for if he was an inhumane old gentleman and i am afraid it is a fact that he was inhumane he was also perfectly intrepid you may look into the queer face of that portrait for as long as you will but you will not see any hole or corner for timidity to enter in  indeed there would be no end to this paper if i were even to name half of the portraits that were remarkable for their execution or interesting by association there was one picture of mr wardrop of torbane hill which you might palm off upon most laymen as a rembrandt and close by you saw the white head of john clerk of eldin that country gentleman who playing with pieces of cork on his own diningtable invented modern naval warfare there was that portrait of neil gow to sit for which the old fiddler walked daily through the streets of edinburgh arm in arm with the duke of athole there was good harry erskine with his satirical nose and upper lip and his mouth just open for a witticism to pop out hutton the geologist in quakerish raiment and looking altogether trim and narrow and as if he cared more about fossils than young ladies fullblown john robison in hyperbolical red dressinggown and every inch of him a fine old man of the world constable the publisher upright beside a table and bearing a corporation with commercial dignity lord bannatyne hearing a cause if ever anybody heard a cause since the world began lord newton just awakened from clandestine slumber on the bench and the second president dundas with every feature so fat that he reminds you in his wig of some droll old court officer in an illustrated nursery storybook and yet all these fat features instinct with meaning the fat lips curved and compressed the nose combining somehow the dignity of a beak with the goodnature of a bottle and the very double chin with an air of intelligence and insight and all these portraits are so pat and telling and look at you so spiritedly from the walls that compared with the sort of living people one sees about the streets they are as bright new sovereigns to fishy and obliterated sixpences some disparaging thoughts upon our own generation could hardly fail to present themselves but it is perhaps only the sacer vates who is wanting and we also painted by such a man as carolus duran may look in holiday immortality upon our children and grandchildren  raeburns young women to be frank are by no means of the same order of merit no one of course could be insensible to the presence of miss janet suttie or mrs campbell of possil when things are as pretty as that criticism is out of season but on the whole it is only with women of a certain age that he can be said to have succeeded in at all the same sense as we say he succeeded with men the younger women do not seem to be made of good flesh and blood they are not painted in rich and unctuous touches they are dry and diaphanous and although young ladies in great britain are all that can be desired of them i would fain hope they are not quite so much of that as raeburn would have us believe in all these pretty faces you miss character you miss fire you miss that spice of the devil which is worth all the prettiness in the world and what is worst of all you miss sex his young ladies are not womanly to nearly the same degree as his men are masculine they are so in a negative sense in short they are the typical young ladies of the male novelist  to say truth either raeburn was timid with young and pretty sitters or he had stupefied himself with sentimentalities or else and here is about the truth of it raeburn and the rest of us labour under an obstinate blindness in one direction and know very little more about women after all these centuries than adam when he first saw eve this is all the more likely because we are by no means so unintelligent in the matter of old women there are some capital old women it seems to me in books written by men and raeburn has some such as mrs colin campbell of park or the anonymous old lady with a large cap which are done in the same frank perspicacious spirit as the very best of his men he could look into their eyes without trouble and he was not withheld by any bashful sentimentalism from recognising what he saw there and unsparingly putting it down upon the canvas but where people cannot meet without some confusion and a good deal of involuntary humbug and are occupied for as long as they are together with a very different vein of thought there cannot be much room for intelligent study nor much result in the shape of genuine comprehension even women who understand men so well for practical purposes do not know them well enough for the purposes of art take even the very best of their male creations take tito melema for instance and you will find he has an equivocal air and every now and again remembers he has a comb at the back of his head of course no woman will believe this and many men will be so very polite as to humour their incredulity                                        ix                                childs play   the regret we have for our childhood is not wholly justifiable so much a man may lay down without fear of public ribaldry for although we shake our heads over the change we are not unconscious of the manifold advantages of our new state what we lose in generous impulse we more than gain in the habit of generously watching others and the capacity to enjoy shakespeare may balance a lost aptitude for playing at soldiers terror is gone out of our lives moreover we no longer see the devil in the bedcurtains nor lie awake to listen to the wind we go to school no more and if we have only exchanged one drudgery for another which is by no means sure we are set free for ever from the daily fear of chastisement and yet a great change has overtaken us and although we do not enjoy ourselves less at least we take our pleasure differently we need pickles nowadays to make wednesdays cold mutton please our fridays appetite and i can remember the time when to call it red venison and tell myself a hunters story would have made it more palatable than the best of sauces to the grown person cold mutton is cold mutton all the world over not all the mythology ever invented by man will make it better or worse to him the broad fact the clamant reality of the mutton carries away before it such seductive figments but for the child it is still possible to weave an enchantment over eatables and if he has but read of a dish in a storybook it will be heavenly manna to him for a week  if a grown man does not like eating and drinking and exercise if he is not something positive in his tastes it means he has a feeble body and should have some medicine but children may be pure spirits if they will and take their enjoyment in a world of moonshine sensation does not count for so much in our first years as afterwards something of the swaddling numbness of infancy clings about us we see and touch and hear through a sort of golden mist children for instance are able enough to see but they have no great faculty for looking they do not use their eyes for the pleasure of using them but for byends of their own and the things i call to mind seeing most vividly were not beautiful in themselves but merely interesting or enviable to me as i thought they might be turned to practical account in play nor is the sense of touch so clean and poignant in children as it is in a man if you will turn over your old memories i think the sensations of this sort you remember will be somewhat vague and come to not much more than a blunt general sense of heat on summer days or a blunt general sense of wellbeing in bed and here of course you will understand pleasurable sensations for overmastering painthe most deadly and tragical element in life and the true commander of mans soul and bodyalas pain has its own way with all of us it breaks in a rude visitant upon the fairy garden where the child wanders in a dream no less surely than it rules upon the field of battle or sends the immortal wargod whimpering to his father and innocence no more than philosophy can protect us from this sting as for taste when we bear in mind the excesses of unmitigated sugar which delight a youthful palate it is surely no very cynical asperity to think taste a character of the maturer growth smell and hearing are perhaps more developed i remember many scents many voices and a great deal of spring singing in the woods but hearing is capable of vast improvement as a means of pleasure and there is all the world between gaping wonderment at the jargon of birds and the emotion with which a man listens to articulate music  at the same time and step by step with this increase in the definition and intensity of what we feel which accompanies our growing age another change takes place in the sphere of intellect by which all things are transformed and seen through theories and associations as through coloured windows we make to ourselves day by day out of history and gossip and economical speculations and god knows what a medium in which we walk and through which we look abroad we study shop windows with other eyes than in our childhood never to wonder not always to admire but to make and modify our little incongruous theories about life it is no longer the uniform of a soldier that arrests our attention but perhaps the flowing carriage of a woman or perhaps a countenance that has been vividly stamped with passion and carries an adventurous story written in its lines the pleasure of surprise is passed away sugar loaves and watercarts seem mighty tame to encounter and we walk the streets to make romances and to sociologise nor must we deny that a good many of us walk them solely for the purposes of transit or in the interest of a livelier digestion these indeed may look back with mingled thoughts upon their childhood but the rest are in a better case they know more than when they were children they understand better their desires and sympathies answer more nimbly to the provocation of the senses and their minds are brimming with interest as they go about the world  according to my contention this is a flight to which children cannot rise they are wheeled in perambulators or dragged about by nurses in a pleasing stupor a vague faint abiding wonderment possesses them here and there some specially remarkable circumstance such as a watercart or a guardsman fairly penetrates into the seat of thought and calls them for half a moment out of themselves and you may see them still towed forward sideways by the inexorable nurse as by a sort of destiny but still staring at the bright object in their wake it may be some minutes before another such moving spectacle reawakens them to the world in which they dwell for other children they almost invariably show some intelligent sympathy there is a fine fellow making mud pies they seem to say that i can understand there is some sense in mud pies but the doings of their elders unless where they are speakingly picturesque or recommend themselves by the quality of being easily imitable they let them go over their heads as we say without the least regard if it were not for this perpetual imitation we should be tempted to fancy they despised us outright or only considered us in the light of creatures brutally strong and brutally silly among whom they condescended to dwell in obedience like a philosopher at a barbarous court at times indeed they display an arrogance of disregard that is truly staggering once when i was groaning aloud with physical pain a young gentleman came into the room and nonchalantly inquired if i had seen his bow and arrow he made no account of my groans which he accepted as he had to accept so much else as a piece of the inexplicable conduct of his elders and like a wise young gentleman he would waste no wonder on the subject those elders who care so little for rational enjoyment and are even the enemies of rational enjoyment for others he had accepted without understanding and without complaint as the rest of us accept the scheme of the universe  we grown people can tell ourselves a story give and take strokes until the bucklers ring ride far and fast marry fall and die all the while sitting quietly by the fire or lying prone in bed this is exactly what a child cannot do or does not do at least when he can find anything else he works all with lay figures and stage properties when his story comes to the fighting he must rise get something by way of a sword and have a setto with a piece of furniture until he is out of breath when he comes to ride with the kings pardon he must bestride a chair which he will so hurry and belabour and on which he will so furiously demean himself that the messenger will arrive if not bloody with spurring at least fiery red with haste if his romance involves an accident upon a cliff he must clamber in person about the chest of drawers and fall bodily upon the carpet before his imagination is satisfied lead soldiers dolls all toys in short are in the same category and answer the same end nothing can stagger a childs faith he accepts the clumsiest substitutes and can swallow the most staring incongruities the chair he has just been besieging as a castle or valiantly cutting to the ground as a dragon is taken away for the accommodation of a morning visitor and he is nothing abashed he can skirmish by the hour with a stationary coalscuttle in the midst of the enchanted pleasance he can see without sensible shock the gardener soberly digging potatoes for the days dinner he can make abstraction of whatever does not fit into his fable and he puts his eyes into his pocket just as we hold our noses in an unsavoury lane and so it is that although the ways of children cross with those of their elders in a hundred places daily they never go in the same direction nor so much as lie in the same element so may the telegraph wires intersect the line of the highroad or so might a landscape painter and a bagman visit the same country and yet move in different worlds  people struck with these spectacles cry aloud about the power of imagination in the young indeed there may be two words to that it is in some ways but a pedestrian fancy that the child exhibits it is the grown people who make the nursery stories all the children do is jealously to preserve the text one out of a dozen reasons why robinson crusoe should be so popular with youth is that it hits their level in this matter to a nicety crusoe was always at makeshifts and had in so many words to play at a great variety of professions and then the book is all about tools and there is nothing that delights a child so much hammers and saws belong to a province of life that positively calls for imitation the juvenile lyrical drama surely of the most ancient thespian model wherein the trades of mankind are successively simulated to the running burthen on a cold and frosty morning gives a good instance of the artistic taste in children and this need for overt action and lay figures testifies to a defect in the childs imagination which prevents him from carrying out his novels in the privacy of his own heart he does not yet know enough of the world and men his experience is incomplete that stagewardrobe and sceneroom that we call the memory is so illprovided that he can overtake few combinations and body out few stories to his own content without some external aid he is at the experimental stage he is not sure how one would feel in certain circumstances to make sure he must come as near trying it as his means permit and so here is young heroism with a wooden sword and mothers practise their kind vocation over a bit of jointed stick it may be laughable enough just now but it is these same people and these same thoughts that not long hence when they are on the theatre of life will make you weep and tremble for children think very much the same thoughts and dream the same dreams as bearded men and marriageable women no one is more romantic fame and honour the love of young men and the love of mothers the business mans pleasure in method all these and others they anticipate and rehearse in their play hours upon us who are further advanced and fairly dealing with the threads of destiny they only glance from time to time to glean a hint for their own mimetic reproduction two children playing at soldiers are far more interesting to each other than one of the scarlet beings whom both are busy imitating this is perhaps the greatest oddity of all art for art is their motto and the doings of grown folk are only interesting as the raw material for play not thÃ©ophile gautier not flaubert can look more callously upon life or rate the reproduction more highly over the reality and they will parody an execution a deathbed or the funeral of the young man of nain with all the cheerfulness in the world  the true parallel for play is not to be found of course in conscious art which though it be derived from play is itself an abstract impersonal thing and depends largely upon philosophical interests beyond the scope of childhood it is when we make castles in the air and personate the leading character in our own romances that we return to the spirit of our first years only there are several reasons why the spirit is no longer so agreeable to indulge nowadays when we admit this personal element into our divagations we are apt to stir up uncomfortable and sorrowful memories and remind ourselves sharply of old wounds our daydreams can no longer lie all in the air like a story in the arabian nights they read to us rather like the history of a period in which we ourselves had taken part where we come across many unfortunate passages and find our own conduct smartly reprimanded and then the child mind you acts his parts he does not merely repeat them to himself he leaps he runs and sets the blood agog over all his body and so his play breathes him and he no sooner assumes a passion than he gives it vent alas when we betake ourselves to our intellectual form of play sitting quietly by the fire or lying prone in bed we rouse many hot feelings for which we can find no outlet substitutes are not acceptable to the mature mind which desires the thing itself and even to rehearse a triumphant dialogue with ones enemy although it is perhaps the most satisfactory piece of play still left within our reach is not entirely satisfying and is even apt to lead to a visit and an interview which may be the reverse of triumphant after all  in the childs world of dim sensation play is all in all making believe is the gist of his whole life and he cannot so much as take a walk except in character i could not learn my alphabet without some suitable miseenscÃ¨ne and had to act a business man in an office before i could sit down to my book will you kindly question your memory and find out how much you did work or pleasure in good faith and soberness and for how much you had to cheat yourself with some invention i remember as though it were yesterday the expansion of spirit the dignity and selfreliance that came with a pair of mustachios in burnt cork even when there was none to see children are even content to forego what we call the realities and prefer the shadow to the substance when they might be speaking intelligibly together they chatter senseless gibberish by the hour and are quite happy because they are making believe to speak french i have said already how even the imperious appetite of hunger suffers itself to be gulled and led by the nose with the fag end of an old song and it goes deeper than this when children are together even a meal is felt as an interruption in the business of life and they must find some imaginative sanction and tell themselves some sort of story to account for to colour to render entertaining the simple processes of eating and drinking what wonderful fancies i have heard evolved out of the pattern upon teacupsfrom which there followed a code of rules and a whole world of excitement until teadrinking began to take rank as a game when my cousin and i took our porridge of a morning we had a device to enliven the course of the meal he ate his with sugar and explained it to be a country continually buried under snow i took mine with milk and explained it to be a country suffering gradual inundation you can imagine us exchanging bulletins how here was an island still unsubmerged here a valley not yet covered with snow what inventions were made how his population lived in cabins on perches and travelled on stilts and how mine was always in boats how the interest grew furious as the last corner of safe ground was cut off on all sides and grew smaller every moment and how in fine the food was of altogether secondary importance and might even have been nauseous so long as we seasoned it with these dreams but perhaps the most exciting moments i ever had over a meal were in the case of calvesfeet jelly it was hardly possible not to believeand you may be sure so far from trying i did all i could to favour the illusionthat some part of it was hollow and that sooner or later my spoon would lay open the secret tabernacle of the golden rock there might some miniature red beard await his hour there might one find the treasures of the forty thieves and bewildered cassim beating about the walls and so i quarried on slowly with bated breath savouring the interest believe me i had little palate left for the jelly and though i preferred the taste when i took cream with it i used often to go without because the cream dimmed the transparent fractures  even with games this spirit is authoritative with rightminded children it is thus that hideandseek has so preeminent a sovereignty for it is the wellspring of romance and the actions and the excitement to which it gives rise lend themselves to almost any sort of fable and thus cricket which is a mere matter of dexterity palpably about nothing and for no end often fails to satisfy infantile craving it is a game if you like but not a game of play you cannot tell yourself a story about cricket and the activity it calls forth can be justified on no rational theory even football although it admirably simulates the tug and the ebb and flow of battle has presented difficulties to the mind of young sticklers after verisimilitude and i knew at least one little boy who was mightily exercised about the presence of the ball and had to spirit himself up whenever he came to play with an elaborate story of enchantment and take the missile as a sort of talisman bandied about in conflict between two arabian nations  to think of such a frame of mind is to become disquieted about the bringing up of children surely they dwell in a mythological epoch and are not the contemporaries of their parents what can they think of them what can they make of these bearded or petticoated giants who look down upon their games who move upon a cloudy olympus following unknown designs apart from rational enjoyment who profess the tenderest solicitude for children and yet every now and again reach down out of their altitude and terribly vindicate the prerogatives of age off goes the child corporally smarting but morally rebellious were there ever such unthinkable deities as parents i would give a great deal to know what in nine cases out of ten is the childs unvarnished feeling a sense of past cajolery a sense of personal attraction at best very feeble above all i should imagine a sense of terror for the untried residue of mankind go to make up the attraction that he feels no wonder poor little heart with such a weltering world in front of him if he clings to the hand he knows the dread irrationality of the whole affair as it seems to children is a thing we are all too ready to forget oh why i remember passionately wondering why can we not all be happy and devote ourselves to play and when children do philosophise i believe it is usually to very much the same purpose  one thing at least comes very clearly out of these considerations that whatever we are to expect at the hands of children it should not be any peddling exactitude about matters of fact they walk in a vain show and among mists and rainbows they are passionate after dreams and unconcerned about realities speech is a difficult art not wholly learned and there is nothing in their own tastes or purposes to teach them what we mean by abstract truthfulness when a bad writer is inexact even if he can look back on half a century of years we charge him with incompetence and not with dishonesty and why not extend the same allowance to imperfect speakers let a stockbroker be dead stupid about poetry or a poet inexact in the details of business and we excuse them heartily from blame but show us a miserable unbreeched human entity whose whole profession it is to take a tub for a fortified town and a shavingbrush for the deadly stiletto and who passes threefourths of his time in a dream and the rest in open selfdeception and we expect him to be as nice upon a matter of fact as a scientific expert bearing evidence upon my heart i think it less than decent you do not consider how little the child sees or how swift he is to weave what he has seen into bewildering fiction and that he cares no more for what you call truth than you for a gingerbread dragoon  i am reminded as i write that the child is very inquiring as to the precise truth of stories but indeed this is a very different matter and one bound up with the subject of play and the precise amount of playfulness or playability to be looked for in the world many such burning questions must arise in the course of nursery education among the fauna of this planet which already embraces the pretty soldier and the terrifying irish beggarman is or is not the child to expect a bluebeard or a cormoran is he or is he not to look out for magicians kindly and potent may he or may he not reasonably hope to be cast away upon a desert island or turned to such diminutive proportions that he can live on equal terms with his lead soldiery and go a cruise in his own toyschooner surely all these are practical questions to a neophyte entering upon life with a view to play precision upon such a point the child can understand but if you merely ask him of his past behaviour as to who threw such a stone for instance or struck such and such a match or whether he had looked into a parcel or gone by a forbidden pathwhy he can see no moment in the inquiry and it is ten to one he has already half forgotten and half bemused himself with subsequent imaginings  it would be easy to leave them in their native cloudland where they figure so prettilypretty like flowers and innocent like dogs they will come out of their gardens soon enough and have to go into offices and the witnessbox spare them yet a while o conscientious parent let them doze among their playthings yet a little for who knows what a rough warfaring existence lies before them in the future                                         x                                walking tours   it must not be imagined that a walking tour as some would have us fancy is merely a better or worse way of seeing the country there are many ways of seeing landscape quite as good and none more vivid in spite of canting dilettantes than from a railway train but landscape on a walking tour is quite accessory he who is indeed of the brotherhood does not voyage in quest of the picturesque but of certain jolly humoursof the hope and spirit with which the march begins at morning and the peace and spiritual repletion of the evenings rest he cannot tell whether he puts his knapsack on or takes it off with more delight the excitement of the departure puts him in key for that of the arrival whatever he does is not only a reward in itself but will be further rewarded in the sequel and so pleasure leads on to pleasure in an endless chain it is this that so few can understand they will either be always lounging or always at five miles an hour they do not play off the one against the other prepare all day for the evening and all evening for the next day and above all it is here that your overwalker fails of comprehension his heart rises against those who drink their curaÃ§oa in liqueurglasses when he himself can swill it in a brown john he will not believe that the flavour is more delicate in the smaller dose he will not believe that to walk this unconscionable distance is merely to stupefy and brutalise himself and come to his inn at night with a sort of frost on his five wits and a starless night of darkness in his spirit not for him the mild luminous evening of the temperate walker he has nothing left of man but a physical need for bedtime and a double nightcap and even his pipe if he be a smoker will be savourless and disenchanted it is the fate of such an one to take twice as much trouble as is needed to obtain happiness and miss the happiness in the end he is the man of the proverb in short who goes farther and fares worse  now to be properly enjoyed a walking tour should be gone upon alone if you go in a company or even in pairs it is no longer a walking tour in anything but name it is something else and more in the nature of a picnic a walking tour should be gone upon alone because freedom is of the essence because you should be able to stop and go on and follow this way or that as the freak takes you and because you must have your own pace and neither trot alongside a champion walker nor mince in time with a girl and then you must be open to all impressions and let your thoughts take colour from what you see you should be as a pipe for any wind to play upon i cannot see the wit says hazlitt of walking and talking at the same time when i am in the country i wish to vegetate like the countrywhich is the gist of all that can be said upon the matter there should be no cackle of voices at your elbow to jar on the meditative silence of the morning and so long as a man is reasoning he cannot surrender himself to that fine intoxication that comes of much motion in the open air that begins in a sort of a dazzle and sluggishness of the brain and ends in a peace that passes comprehension  during the first day or so of any tour there are moments of bitterness when the traveller feels more than coldly towards his knapsack when he is half in a mind to throw it bodily over the hedge and like christian on a similar occasion give three leaps and go on singing and yet it soon acquires a property of easiness it becomes magnetic the spirit of the journey enters into it and no sooner have you passed the straps over your shoulder than the lees of sleep are cleared from you you pull yourself together with a shake and fall at once into your stride and surely of all possible moods this in which a man takes the road is the best of course if he will keep thinking of his anxieties if he will open the merchant abudahs chest and walk arminarm with the hagwhy wherever he is and whether he walk fast or slow the chances are that he will not be happy and so much the more shame to himself there are perhaps thirty men setting forth at that same hour and i would lay a large wager there is not another dull face among the thirty it would be a fine thing to follow in a coat of darkness one after another of these wayfarers some summer morning for the first few miles upon the road this one who walks fast with a keen look in his eyes is all concentrated in his own mind he is up at his loom weaving and weaving to set the landscape to words this one peers about as he goes among the grasses he waits by the canal to watch the dragonflies he leans on the gate of the pasture and cannot look enough upon the complacent kine and here comes another talking laughing and gesticulating to himself his face changes from time to time as indignation flashes from his eyes or anger clouds his forehead he is composing articles delivering orations and conducting the most impassioned interviews by the way a little farther on and it is as like as not he will begin to sing and well for him supposing him to be no great master in that art if he stumble across no stolid peasant at a corner for on such an occasion i scarcely know which is the more troubled or whether it is worse to suffer the confusion of your troubadour or the unfeigned alarm of your clown a sedentary population accustomed besides to the strange mechanical bearing of the common tramp can in no wise explain to itself the gaiety of these passersby i knew one man who was arrested as a runaway lunatic because although a fullgrown person with a red beard he skipped as he went like a child and you would be astonished if i were to tell you all the grave and learned heads who have confessed to me that when on walking tours they sangand sang very illand had a pair of red ears when as described above the inauspicious peasant plumped into their arms from round a corner and here lest you should think i am exaggerating is hazlitts own confession from his essay on going a journey which is so good that there should be a tax levied on all who have not read it  give me the clear blue sky over my head says he and the green turf beneath my feet a winding road before me and a three hours march to dinnerand then to thinking it is hard if i cannot start some game on these lone heaths i laugh i run i leap i sing for joy  bravo after that adventure of my friend with the policeman you would not have cared would you to publish that in the first person but we have no bravery nowadays and even in books must all pretend to be as dull and foolish as our neighbours it was not so with hazlitt and notice how learned he is as indeed throughout the essay in the theory of walking tours he is none of your athletic men in purple stockings who walk their fifty miles a day three hours march is his ideal and then he must have a winding road the epicure  yet there is one thing i object to in these words of his one thing in the great masters practice that seems to me not wholly wise i do not approve of that leaping and running both of these hurry the respiration they both shake up the brain out of its glorious openair confusion and they both break the pace uneven walking is not so agreeable to the body and it distracts and irritates the mind whereas when once you have fallen into an equable stride it requires no conscious thought from you to keep it up and yet it prevents you from thinking earnestly of anything else like knitting like the work of a copying clerk it gradually neutralises and sets to sleep the serious activity of the mind we can think of this or that lightly and laughingly as a child thinks or as we think in a morning doze we can make puns or puzzle out acrostics and trifle in a thousand ways with words and rhymes but when it comes to honest work when we come to gather ourselves together for an effort we may sound the trumpet as loud and long as we please the great barons of the mind will not rally to the standard but sit each one at home warming his hands over his own fire and brooding on his own private thought  in the course of a days walk you see there is much variance in the mood from the exhilaration of the start to the happy phlegm of the arrival the change is certainly great as the day goes on the traveller moves from the one extreme end towards the other he becomes more and more incorporated with the material landscape and the openair drunkenness grows upon him with great strides until he posts along the road and sees everything about him as in a cheerful dream the first is certainly brighter but the second stage is the more peaceful a man does not make so many articles towards the end nor does he laugh aloud but the purely animal pleasures the sense of physical wellbeing the delight of every inhalation of every time the muscles tighten down the thigh console him for the absence of the others and bring him to his destination still content  nor must i forget to say a word on bivouacs you come to a milestone on a hill or some place where deep ways meet under trees and off goes the knapsack and down you sit to smoke a pipe in the shade you sink into yourself and the birds come round and look at you and your smoke dissipates upon the afternoon under the blue dome of heaven and the sun lies warm upon your feet and the cool air visits your neck and turns aside your open shirt if you are not happy you must have an evil conscience you may dally as long as you like by the roadside it is almost as if the millennium were arrived when we shall throw our clocks and watches over the housetop and remember time and seasons no more not to keep hours for a lifetime is i was going to say to live for ever you have no idea unless you have tried it how endlessly long is a summers day that you measure out only by hunger and bring to an end only when you are drowsy i know a village where there are hardly any clocks where no one knows more of the days of the week than by a sort of instinct for the fÃªte on sundays and where only one person can tell you the day of the month and she is generally wrong and if people were aware how slow time journeyed in that village and what armfuls of spare hours he gives over and above the bargain to its wise inhabitants i believe there would be a stampede out of london liverpool paris and a variety of large towns where the clocks lose their heads and shake the hours out each one faster than the other as though they were all in a wager and all these foolish pilgrims would each bring his own misery along with him in a watchpocket it is to be noticed there were no clocks and watches in the muchvaunted days before the flood it follows of course there were no appointments and punctuality was not yet thought upon though ye take from a covetous man all his treasure says milton he has yet one jewel left ye cannot deprive him of his covetousness and so i would say of a modern man of business you may do what you will for him put him in eden give him the elixir of lifehe has still a flaw at heart he still has his business habits now there is no time when business habits are more mitigated than on a walking tour and so during these halts as i say you will feel almost free  but it is at night and after dinner that the best hour comes there are no such pipes to be smoked as those that follow a good days march the flavour of the tobacco is a thing to be remembered it is so dry and aromatic so full and so fine if you wind up the evening with grog you will own there was never such grog at every sip a jocund tranquillity spreads about your limbs and sits easily in your heart if you read a bookand you will never do so save by fits and startsyou find the language strangely racy and harmonious words take a new meaning single sentences possess the ear for halfanhour together and the writer endears himself to you at every page by the nicest coincidence of sentiment it seems as if it were a book you had written yourself in a dream to all we have read on such occasions we look back with special favour it was on the 10th of april 1798 says hazlitt with amorous precision that i sat down to a volume of the new hÃ©loÃ¯se at the inn at llangollen over a bottle of sherry and a cold chicken i should wish to quote more for though we are mighty fine fellows nowadays we cannot write like hazlitt and talking of that a volume of hazlitts essays would be a capital pocketbook on such a journey so would a volume of heines songs and for tristram shandy i can pledge a fair experience  if the evening be fine and warm there is nothing better in life than to lounge before the inn door in the sunset or lean over the parapet of the bridge to watch the weeds and the quick fishes it is then if ever that you taste joviality to the full significance of that audacious word your muscles are so agreeably slack you feel so clean and so strong and so idle that whether you move or sit still whatever you do is done with pride and a kingly sort of pleasure you fall in talk with any one wise or foolish drunk or sober and it seems as if a hot walk purged you more than of anything else of all narrowness and pride and left curiosity to play its part freely as in a child or a man of science you lay aside all your own hobbies to watch provincial humours develop themselves before you now as a laughable farce and now grave and beautiful like an old tale  or perhaps you are left to your own company for the night and surly weather imprisons you by the fire you may remember how burns numbering past pleasures dwells upon the hours when he has been happy thinking it is a phrase that may well perplex a poor modern girt about on every side by clocks and chimes and haunted even at night by flaming dialplates for we are all so busy and have so many faroff projects to realise and castles in the fire to turn into solid habitable mansions on a gravel soil that we can find no time for pleasure trips into the land of thought and among the hills of vanity changed times indeed when we must sit all night beside the fire with folded hands and a changed world for most of us when we find we can pass the hours without discontent and be happy thinking we are in such haste to be doing to be writing to be gathering gear to make our voice audible a moment in the derisive silence of eternity that we forget that one thing of which these are but the partsnamely to live we fall in love we drink hard we run to and fro upon the earth like frightened sheep and now you are to ask yourself if when all is done you would not have been better to sit by the fire at home and be happy thinking to sit still and contemplateto remember the faces of women without desire to be pleased by the great deeds of men without envy to be everything and everywhere in sympathy and yet content to remain where and what you areis not this to know both wisdom and virtue and to dwell with happiness after all it is not they who carry flags but they who look upon it from a private chamber who have the fun of the procession and once you are at that you are in the very humour of all social heresy it is no time for shuffling or for big empty words if you ask yourself what you mean by fame riches or learning the answer is far to seek and you go back into that kingdom of light imaginations which seem so vain in the eyes of philistines perspiring after wealth and so momentous to those who are stricken with the disproportions of the world and in the face of the gigantic stars cannot stop to split differences between two degrees of the infinitesimally small such as a tobaccopipe or the roman empire a million of money or a fiddlesticks end  you lean from the window your last pipe reeking whitely into the darkness your body full of delicious pains your mind enthroned in the seventh circle of content when suddenly the mood changes the weathercock goes about and you ask yourself one question more whether for the interval you have been the wisest philosopher or the most egregious of donkeys human experience is not yet able to reply but at least you have had a fine moment and looked down upon all the kingdoms of the earth and whether it was wise or foolish tomorrows travel will carry you body and mind into some different parish of the infinite                                        xi                                pans pipes   the world in which we live has been variously said and sung by the most ingenious poets and philosophers these reducing it to formulÃ¦ and chemical ingredients those striking the lyre in highsounding measures for the handiwork of god what experience supplies is of a mingled tissue and the choosing mind has much to regret before it can get together the materials of a theory dew and thunder destroying attila and the spring lambkins belong to an order of contrasts which no repetition can assimilate there is an uncouth outlandish strain throughout the web of the world as from a vexatious planet in the house of life things are not congruous and wear strange disguises the consummate flower is fostered out of dung and after nourishing itself awhile with heavens delicate distillations decays again into indistinguishable soil and with cÃ¦sars ashes hamlet tells us the urchins make dirt pies and filthily besmear their countenance nay the kindly shine of summer when tracked home with the scientific spyglass is found to issue from the most portentous nightmare of the universethe great conflagrant sun a world of hells squibs tumultuary roaring aloud inimical to life the sun itself is enough to disgust a human being of the scene which he inhabits and you would not fancy there was a green or habitable spot in a universe thus awfully lighted up and yet it is by the blaze of such a conflagration to which the fire of rome was but a spark that we do all our fiddling and hold domestic teaparties at the arbour door  the greeks figured pan the god of nature now terribly stamping his foot so that armies were dispersed now by the woodside on a summer noon trolling on his pipe until he charmed the hearts of upland ploughmen and the greeks in so figuring uttered the last word of human experience to certain smokedried spirits matter and motion and elastic Ã¦thers and the hypothesis of this or that other spectacled professor tell a speaking story but for youth and all ductile and congenial minds pan is not dead but of all the classic hierarchy alone survives in triumph goatfooted with a gleeful and an angry look the type of the shaggy world and in every wood if you go with a spirit properly prepared you shall hear the note of his pipe  for it is a shaggy world and yet studded with gardens where the salt and tumbling sea receives clear rivers running from among reeds and lilies fruitful and austere a rustic world sunshiny lewd and cruel what is it the birds sing among the trees in pairing time what means the sound of the rain falling far and wide upon the leafy forest to what tune does the fisherman whistle as he hauls in his net at morning and the bright fish are heaped inside the boat these are all airs upon pans pipe he it was who gave them breath in the exultation of his heart and gleefully modulated their outflow with his lips and fingers the coarse mirth of herdsmen shaking the dells with laughter and striking out high echoes from the rock the tune of moving feet in the lamplit city or on the smooth ballroom floor the hooves of many horses beating the wide pastures in alarm the song of hurrying rivers the colour of clear skies and smiles and the live touch of hands and the voice of things and their significant look and the renovating influence they breathe forththese are his joyful measures to which the whole earth treads in choral harmony to this music the young lambs bound as to a tabor and the london shopgirl skips rudely in the dance for it puts a spirit of gladness in all hearts and to look on the happy side of nature is common in their hours to all created things some are vocal under a good influence are pleasing whenever they are pleased and hand on their happiness to others as a child who looking upon lovely things looks lovely some leap to the strains with unapt foot and make a halting figure in the universal dance and some like sour spectators at the play receive the music into their hearts with an unmoved countenance and walk like strangers through the general rejoicing but let him feign never so carefully there is not a man but has his pulses shaken when pan trolls out a stave of ecstasy and sets the world asinging  alas if that were all but oftentimes the air is changed and in the screech of the night wind chasing navies subverting the tall ships and the rooted cedar of the hills in the random deadly levin or the fury of headlong floods we recognise the dread foundation of life and the anger in pans heart earth wages open war against her children and under her softest touch hides treacherous claws the cool waters invite us in to drown the domestic hearth burns up in the hour of sleep and makes an end of all everything is good or bad helpful or deadly not in itself but by its circumstances for a few bright days in england the hurricane must break forth and the north sea pay a toll of populous ships and when the universal music has led lovers into the path of dalliance confident of natures sympathy suddenly the air shifts into a minor and death makes a clutch from his ambuscade below the bed of marriage for death is given in a kiss the dearest kindnesses are fatal and into this life where one thing preys upon another the child too often makes its entrance from the mothers corpse it is no wonder with so traitorous a scheme of things if the wise people who created for us the idea of pan thought that of all fears the fear of him was the most terrible since it embraces all and still we preserve the phrase a panic terror to reckon dangers too curiously to hearken too intently for the threat that runs through all the winning music of the world to hold back the hand from the rose because of the thorn and from life because of death this it is to be afraid of pan highly respectable citizens who flee lifes pleasures and responsibilities and keep with upright hat upon the midway of custom avoiding the right hand and the left the ecstasies and the agonies how surprised they would be if they could hear their attitude mythologically expressed and knew themselves as toothchattering ones who flee from nature because they fear the hand of natures god shrilly sound pans pipes and behold the banker instantly concealed in the bank parlour for to distrust ones impulses is to be recreant to pan  there are moments when the mind refuses to be satisfied with evolution and demands a ruddier presentation of the sum of mans experience sometimes the mood is brought about by laughter at the humorous side of life as when abstracting ourselves from earth we imagine people plodding on foot or seated in ships and speedy trains with the planet all the while whirling in the opposite direction so that for all their hurry they travel backforemost through the universe of space sometimes it comes by the spirit of delight and sometimes by the spirit of terror at least there will always be hours when we refuse to be put off by the feint of explanation nicknamed science and demand instead some palpitating image of our estate that shall represent the troubled and uncertain element in which we dwell and satisfy reason by the means of art science writes of the world as if with the cold finger of a starfish it is all true but what is it when compared to the reality of which it discourses where hearts beat high in april and death strikes and hills totter in the earthquake and there is a glamour over all the objects of sight and a thrill in all noises for the ear and romance herself has made her dwelling among men so we come back to the old myth and hear the goatfooted piper making the music which is itself the charm and terror of things and when a glen invites our visiting footsteps fancy that pan leads us thither with a gracious tremolo or when our hearts quail at the thunder of the cataract tell ourselves that he has stamped his hoof in the nigh thicket                                        xii                            a

concealed the nightfaring inhabitant had to fall backwe speak on the authority of old printsupon stable lanthorns two storeys in height many holes drilled in the conical turretroof of this vagabond pharos let up spouts of dazzlement into the bearers eyes and as he paced forth in the ghostly darkness carrying his own sun by a ring about his finger day and night swung to and fro and up and down about his footsteps blackness haunted his path he was beleaguered by goblins as he went and curfew being struck he found no light but that he travelled in throughout the township  closely following on this epoch of migratory lanthorns in a world of extinction came the era of oillights hard to kindle easy to extinguish pale and wavering in the hour of their endurance rudely puffed the winds of heaven roguishly clomb up the alldestructive urchin and lo in a moment night reestablished her void empire and the cit groped along the wall suppered but bedless occult from guidance and sorrily wading in the kennels as if gamesome winds and gamesome youths were not sufficient it was the habit to swing these feeble luminaries from house to house above the fairway there on invisible cordage let them swing and suppose some cranenecked general to go speeding by on a tall charger spurring the destiny of nations redhot in expedition there would indubitably be some effusion of military blood and oaths and a certain crash of glass and while the chieftain rode forward with a purple coxcomb the street would be left to original darkness unpiloted unvoyageable a province of the desert night  the conservative looking before and after draws from each contemplation the matter for content out of the age of gas lamps he glances back slightingly at the mirk and glimmer in which his ancestors wandered his heart waxes jocund at the contrast nor do his lips refrain from a stave in the highest style of poetry lauding progress and the golden mean when gas first spread along a city mapping it forth about evenfall for the eye of observant birds a new age had begun for sociality and corporate pleasureseeking and begun with proper circumstance becoming its own birthright the work of prometheus had advanced by another stride mankind and its supperparties were no longer at the mercy of a few miles of seafog sundown no longer emptied the promenade and the day was lengthened out to every mans fancy the cityfolk had stars of their own biddable domesticated stars  it is true that these were not so steady nor yet so clear as their originals nor indeed was their lustre so elegant as that of the best wax candles but then the gas stars being nearer at hand were more practically efficacious than jupiter himself it is true again that they did not unfold their rays with the appropriate spontaneity of the planets coming out along the firmament one after another as the need arises but the lamplighters took to their heels every evening and ran with a good heart it was pretty to see man thus emulating the punctuality of heavens orbs and though perfection was not absolutely reached and now and then an individual may have been knocked on the head by the ladder of the flying functionary yet people commended his zeal in a proverb and taught their children to say god bless the lamplighter and since his passage was a piece of the days programme the children were well pleased to repeat the benediction not of course in so many words which would have been improper but in some chaste circumlocution suitable for infant lips  god bless him indeed for the term of his twilight diligence is near at hand and for not much longer shall we watch him speeding up the street and at measured intervals knocking another luminous hole into the dusk the greeks would have made a noble myth of such an one how he distributed starlight and as soon as the need was over recollected it and the little bulls eye which was his instrument and held enough fire to kindle a whole parish would have been fitly commemorated in the legend now like all heroic tasks his labours draw towards apotheosis and in the light of victory he himself shall disappear for another advance has been effected our tame stars are to come out in future not one by one but all in a body and at once a sedate electrician somewhere in a back office touches a springand behold from one end to another of the city from east to west from the alexandra to the crystal palace there is light fiat lux says the sedate electrician what a spectacle on some clear dark nightfall from the edge of hampstead hill when in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the design of the monstrous city flashes into visiona glittering hieroglyph many square miles in extent and when to borrow and debase an image all the evening streetlamps burst together into song such is the spectacle of the future preluded the other day by the experiment in pall mall starrise by electricity the most romantic flight of civilisation the compensatory benefit for an innumerable array of factories and bankers clerks to the artistic spirit exercised about thirlmere here is a crumb of consolation consolatory at least to such of them as look out upon the world through seeing eyes and contentedly accept beauty where it comes  but the conservative while lauding progress is ever timid of innovation his is the hand upheld to counsel pause his is the signal advising slow advance the word electricity now sounds the note of danger in paris at the mouth of the passage des princes in the place before the opera portico and in the rue drouot at the figaro office a new sort of urban star now shines out nightly horrible unearthly obnoxious to the human eye a lamp for a nightmare such a light as this should shine only on murders and public crime or along the corridors of lunatic asylums a horror to heighten horror to look at it only once is to fall in love with gas which gives a warm domestic radiance fit to eat by mankind you would have thought might have remained content with what prometheus stole for them and not gone fishing the profound heaven with kites to catch and domesticate the wildfire of the storm yet here we have the levin brand at our doors and it is proposed that we should henceforward take our walks abroad in the glare of permanent lightning a man need not be very superstitious if he scruple to follow his pleasures by the light of the terror that flieth nor very epicurean if he prefer to see the face of beauty more becomingly displayed that ugly blinding glare may not improperly advertise the home of slanderous figaro which is a backshop to the infernal regions but where soft joys prevail where people are convoked to pleasure and the philosopher looks on smiling and silent where love and laughter and deifying wine abound there at least let the old mild lustre shine upon the ways of man                                 end of vol ii                                 printed by
