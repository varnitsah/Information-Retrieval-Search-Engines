41646840	fast in the ice adventures in the polar regions by rm ballantyne   this little book describes a visit up to the arctic regions that was supposed to have taken place long before the book was written in other words in the early part of the nineteenth century  the purpose of the journey was to get near to the north pole which was considered to be surrounded by a large area of icefree water the vessel in which they sailed became beset by ice and could not be moved  they met with esquimaux and saw how they survived how they killed walrus how they caught birds and how they lived in their icehouses or igloos  they also had several encounters with polar bears and muskox  eventually they have been in the ice for a couple of years and some of the men are suffering from scurvy  europeans get scurvy from lack of fruit and vegetables but this condition doesnt seem to affect the esquimaux whose meat and fat diet does not cause them to have heart disorders either  the crew eventually abandon the vessel which has been crushed suddenly and totally by a stream of icefloes and are obliged to walk out of where they had spent so much time  luckily when at their last gasp they find an esquimaux village where they learn that there is a danish settlement not too far away and that from it they can take ship for europe and eventually make their way back to britain   fast in the ice adventures in the polar regions by rm ballantyne    chapter one  one day many years ago a brig cast off from her moorings and sailed from a british port for the polar seas  that brig never came back  many a hearty cheer was given many a kind wish was uttered many a handkerchief was waved and many a tearful eye gazed that day as the vessel left old england and steered her course into the unknown regions of the far north  but no cheer ever greeted her return no bright eyes ever watched her homewardbound sails rising on the faroff horizon  battered by the storms of the arctic seas her sails and cordage stiffened by the frosts and her hull rasped and shattered by the ice of those regions she was forced on a shore where the green grass has little chance to grow where winter reigns nearly all the year round where man never sends his merchandise and never drives his plough there the brig was frozen in there for two long years she lay unable to move and her starving crew forsook her there year after year she lay unknown unvisited by civilised man and unless the wild eskimos see note 1 have torn her to pieces and made spears of her timbers or the ice has swept her out to sea and whirled her to destruction there she lies stillhard and fast in the ice  the vessel was lost but her crew were saved and most of them returned to tell their kinsfolk of the wonders and the dangers of the frozen regions where god has created some of the most beautiful and some of the most awful objects that were ever looked on by the eye of man  what was told by the fireside long ago is now recounted in this book  imagine a tall strong man of about fiveandforty with short curly black hair just beginning to turn grey stern black eyes that look as if they could pierce into your secret thoughts a firm mouth with lines of goodwill and kindness lurking about it a deeplybrowned skin and a short thick beard and moustache  that is a portrait of the commander of the brig  his name was harvey  he stood on the deck close by the wheel looking wistfully over the stern  as the vessel bent before the breeze and cut swiftly through the water a female hand was raised among the gazers on the pier and a white scarf waved in the breeze  in the forefront of the throng and lower down another hand was raised it was a little one but very vigorous it whirled a cap round a small head of curly black hair and a shrill hurrah came floating out to sea  the captain kissed his hand and waved his hat in reply then wheeling suddenly round he shouted in a voice of thunder  mind your helm there let her away a point  take a pull on these foretopsail halyards look alive lads  aye aye sir replied the men  there was no occasion whatever for these orders  the captain knew that well enough but he had his own reasons for giving them  the men knew that too and they understood his reasons when they observed the increased sternness of his eyes and the compression of his lips  inclination and duty  what wars go on in the hearts of menhigh and low rich and poorbetween these two  what varied fortune follows man according as the one or the other carries the day  please sir said a gruff broadshouldered and extremely short man with little or no forehead a hard vacant face and a pair of enormous red whispers please sir sam bakers took very bad i think it would be as well if you could give him a little physic sir a tumbler of epsom or somethink of that sort  why mr dicey there cant be anything very far wrong with baker said the captain looking down at his second mate he seems to me one of the healthiest men in the ship  whats the matter with him  well i cant say sir replied mr dicey but he looks orrible bad all yellow and green about the gills and fearful red round the eyes but what frightens me most is that i heard him groanin very heavy about a quarter of an hour ago and then i saw him suddenly fling himself into his ammock and begin blubberin like a child  now sir i say when a growdup man gives way like that there must be somethink far wrong with his inside  and its a serious thing sir to take a sick man on such a voyage as this  does he not say whats wrong with him asked the captain  no sir he dont  he says its nothin and hell be all right if hes only let alone  i did hear him once or twice muttering somethink about his wife and child you know sir hes got a young wife and she had a baby about two months fore we came away but i cant think thats got much to do with it for ive got a wife myself sir and six children two of em bein babies and that dont upset me and bakers a much stronger man  you are right mr dicey he is a much stronger man than you replied the captain and i doubt not that his strength will enable him to get over this without the aid of physic  very well sir said mr dicey  the second mate was a man whose countenance never showed any signs of emotion no matter what he felt  he seldom laughed or if he did his mouth remained almost motionless and the sounds that came out were anything but cheerful  he had light grey eyes which always wore an expression of astonishment but the expression was accidental it indicated no feeling  he would have said very well sir if the captain had refused to give poor baker food instead of physic  and harkee mr dicey said the captain dont let him be disturbed till he feels inclined to move  very well sir replied the second mate touching his cap as he turned away  so murmured the captain as he gazed earnestly at the now distant shore im not the only one who carries a heavy heart to sea this day and leaves sorrowing hearts behind him    note 1  this word is here spelled as pronounced  it is usually spelled esquimaux    chapter two  at seathe first storm  it is now hundreds of years since the north polar regions began to attract general attention  men have long felt very inquisitive about that part of the earth and many good ships many noble lives have been lost in trying to force a passage through the ice that encumbers the arctic seas summer and winter  britain has done more than other nations in the cause of discovery within the arctic circle  the last and greatest of her arctic heroes perished therethe famous sir john franklin  were i writing a history of those regions i would have much to say of other countries as well as of our own  but such is not my object in this book  i mean simply to follow in the wake of one of britains adventurous discoverers and thus give the reader an idea of the fortunes of those gallant men who risk life and limb for the sake of obtaining knowledge of distant lands  there have always been restless spirits in this country  there have ever been men who when boys were full of mischief and who could settle to nothing when they grew up  lucky for us lucky for the world that such is the case  many of our restless spirits as we call them have turned out to be our heroes our discoverers our greatest men  no doubt many of them have become our drones our sharpers our blacklegs  but that is just saying that some men are good while others are badno blame is due to what is called the restlessness of spirit  our restless men if good find rest in action in bold energetic toil if bad they find rest alas in untimely graves  captain harvey was one of our restless spirits  he had a deeply learned friend who said to him one day that he felt sure there was a sea of open water round the north pole  hundreds of ships had tried to reach that pole without success because they always found a barrier of thick ice raised against them  this friend said that if a ship could only cut or force its way through the ice to a certain latitude north open water would be found  captain harvey was much interested in this  he could not rest until he had proved it  he had plenty of money so had his friend  they resolved to buy a vessel and send it to the seas lying within the arctic circle  other rich friends helped them a brig was bought it was named the hope and as we have seen in the last chapter it finally set sail under command of captain harvey  many days and nights passed and the hope kept her course steadily toward the coast of north america  greenland was the first land they hoped to see  baffins bay was the strait through which they hoped to reach the open polar sea  the hope left england as a whaler with all the boats lances harpoons lines and other apparatus used in the whale fishery  it was intended that she should do a little business in that way if captain harvey thought it advisable but the discovery of new lands and seas was their chief end and aim  at first the weather was fine the wind fair and the voyage prosperous but one night there came a deep calm  not a breath of air moved over the sea which was as clear and polished as a lookingglass  the captain walked the deck with the surgeon of the ship a nephew of his own named gregory  tom gregory was a youth of about nineteen who had not passed through the whole course of a doctors education but who was a clever fellow and better able to cut and carve and physic poor suffering humanity than many an older man who wrote md after his name  he was a fine handsome strapping fellow with a determined manner and a kind heart he was able to pull an oar with the best man aboard and could even steer the brig in fine weather if need be  he was hearty and romantic and a great favourite with the men  he too was a restless spirit  he had grown tired of college life and had made up his mind to take a years run into the polar regions by way of improving his knowledge of the outlandish parts of the world  i dont like the look of the sky today tom said the captain glancing at the horizon and then at the sails  indeed said tom in surprise  it seems to me the most beautiful afternoon we have had since the voyage began  but i suppose you seamen are learned in signs which we landsmen do not understand  perhaps we are replied the captain but it does not require much knowledge of the weather to say that such a dead calm as this and such unusual heat is not likely to end in a gentle breeze  you dont object to a stiff breeze uncle said the youth  no tom but i dont like a storm because it does us no good and may do us harm  storms do you no good uncle cried tom how can you say so  why what is it that makes our sailors such trumps  the british tar would not be able to face danger as he does if there were no storms  true tom but the british tar would not require to face danger at all if there were no storms  what says the barometer mr mansell said the captain looking down the skylight into the cabin where the first matea middlesized man of thirtyfive or thereaboutswas seated at the table writing up the ships logbook  the glass has gone down an inch sir and is still falling answered the mate  reef the topsail mr dicey cried the captain on hearing this  why such haste inquired gregory  because such a sudden fall in the barometer is a sure sign of approaching bad weather answered the captain  the first man on the shrouds and out upon the maintopsail yard was sam baker whose active movements and hearty manner showed that he had quite recovered his health without the use of physic  he was quickly followed by some of his shipmates all of whom were picked menable in body and ready for anything  in a few minutes sail was reduced  soon after that clouds began to rise on the horizon and spread over the sky  before half an hour had passed the breeze camecame far stronger than had been expectedand the order to take in sail had to be repeated  baker was first again  he was closely followed by joe davis and jim croft both of them sturdy fellowsgood specimens of the british seaman  davy butts who came next was not so good a specimen  he was nearly six feet high very thin and loosely put together like a piece of bad furniture  but his bones were big and he was stronger than he looked  he would not have formed one of such a crew had he not been a good man  the rest of the crew of whom there were eighteen not including the officers were of all shapes sizes and complexions  the sails had scarcely been taken in when the storm burst on the brig in all its fury  the waves rose like mountains and followed after her as if they were eager to swallow her up  the sky grew dark overhead as the night closed in the wind shrieked through the rigging and the rag of canvas that they ventured to hoist seemed about to burst away from the yard  it was an awful night  such a night as causes even reckless men to feel how helpless they arehow dependent on the arm of god  the gale steadily increased until near midnight when it blew a perfect hurricane  its a dirty night observed the captain to the second mate as the latter came on deck to relieve the watch  it is sir replied mr dicey as coolly as if he were about to sit down to a good dinner on shore  mr dicey was a remarkably matteroffact man  he looked upon a storm as he looked upon a fit of the toothachea thing that had to be endured and was not worth making a fuss about  it wont last long said the captain  no sir it wont answered mr dicey  as mr dicey did not seem inclined to say more the captain went below and flung himself on a locker having given orders that he should be called if any change for the worse took place in the weather  soon afterward a tremendous sea rose high over the stern and part of it fell on the deck with a terrible crash washing mr dicey into the leescuppers and almost sweeping him overboard  on regaining his feet and his position beside the wheel the second mate shook himself and considered whether he ought to call the captain  having meditated some time he concluded that the weather was no worse although it had treated him very roughly so he did not disturb the captains repose  thus the storm raged all that night  it tossed the hope about like a cork it wellnigh blew the sails off the masts and almost blew mr diceys head off his shoulders then it stopped as it had begun suddenly    chapter three  in the icedangers of arctic voyaging  next morning the hope was becalmed in the midst of a scene more beautiful than the tongue or the pen of man can describe  when the sun rose that day it shone upon what appeared to be a field of glass and a city of crystal  every trace of the recent storm was gone except a long swell which caused the brig to roll considerably but which did not break the surface of the sea  ice was to be seen all round as far as the eye could reach  ice in every form and size imaginable  and the wonderful thing about it was that many of the masses resembled the buildings of a city  there were houses and churches and monuments and spires and ruins  there were also islands and mountains  some of the pieces were low and flat no bigger than a boat others were tall with jagged tops some of the fields as they are called were a mile and more in extent and there were a number of bergs or icemountains higher than the brigs topmasts  these last were almost white but they had in many places a greenishblue colour that was soft and beautiful  the whole scene shone and sparkled so brilliantly in the morning sun that one could almost fancy it was one of the regions of fairyland  when young gregory came on the quarterdeck no one was there except jim croft a short thickset man with the legs of a dwarf and the shoulders of a giant  he stood at the helm and although no steering was required as there was no wind he kept his hands on the spokes of the wheel and glanced occasionally at the compass  the first mate who had the watch on deck was up at the masthead observing the state of the ice  how glorious exclaimed the youth as he swept his sparkling eye round the horizon  ah croft is not this splendid  so it is sir said the seaman turning the large quid of tobacco that bulged out his left cheek  its very beautiful no doubt but its comin rather thick for my taste  how so inquired gregory  there seems to me plenty of open water to enable us to steer clear of these masses  besides as we have no wind it matters little i should think whether we have room to sail or not  youve not seed much o the ice yet thats plain said croft else youd know that the floes are closin round us an well soon be fast in the pack if a breeze dont spring up to help us  as the reader may not perhaps understand the terms used by arctic voyagers in regard to the ice in its various forms it may be as well here to explain the meaning of those most commonly used  when ice is seen floating in small detached pieces and scattered masses it is called floe ice and men speak of getting among the floes  when these floes close up so that the whole sea seems to be covered with them and little water can be seen it is called pack ice  when the pack is squeezed together so that lumps of it are forced up in the form of rugged mounds these mounds are called hummocks  a large mass of flat ice varying from one mile to many miles in extent is called a field and a mountain of ice is called a berg  all the ice here spoken of except the berg is seaice formed by the freezing of the ocean in winter  the berg is formed in a very different manner  of this more shall be said in a future chapter  well my lad said gregory in reply to jim crofts last observation i have not seen much of the ice yet as you truly remark so i hope that the wind will not come to help us out of it for some time  you dont think it dangerous to get into the pack do you  well not exactly dangerous sir replied croft but i must say that it aint safe specially when theres a swell on like this  but thatll go down soon  dye know what a nip is dr gregory  i think i do at least i have read of such a thing  but i should be very glad to hear what you have to say about it  no doubt you have felt one  felt one cried jim screwing up his face and drawing his limbs together as if he were suffering horrible pain no ive never felt one  the man what feels a nip aint likely to live to tell what his feelins was  but ive seed one  youve seen one have you  that must have been interesting  where was it  not very far from the greenland coast said croft giving his quid another turn  this was the way of it  you must know that there was two ships of us in company at the time  whalers we was  we got into the heart of the pack somehow and we thought wed never get out of it again  there was nothin but ice all round us as far as the eye could see  the name of our ship was the nancy  our comrade was the bullfinch  one mornin early we heard a loud noise of ice rubbin agin the sides o the ship so we all jumped up an on deck as fast as we could for theres short time given to save ourselves in them seas sometimes  the whole pack we found was in motion and a wide lead of water opened up before us for all the world like a smooth river or canal windin through the pack  into this we warped the ship and hoistin sail steered away cheerily  we passed close to the bullfinch which was still hard and fast in the pack and we saw that her crew were sawin and cuttin away at the ice tryin to get into the lead that wed got into  so we hailed them and said we would wait for em outside the pack if we got through  but the words were no sooner spoken when the wind it died away and we were becalmed about half a mile from the bullfinch  youd better go down to breakfast boys says our captain says he the breeze wont be long o comin again  so down the men went and soon after that the steward comes on deck and says he to the captain breakfast sir  very good says the captain and down he went too leavin me at the wheel and the mate in charge of the deck  hed not been gone three minutes when i noticed that the great field of ice on our right was closin in on the field on our left and the channel we was floatin in was closin up  the mate noticed it too but he wouldnt call the captain cause the ice came so slowly and quietly on that for a few minutes we could hardly believe it was movin and everything around us looked so calm and peaceful like that it was difficult to believe our danger was so great  but this was only a momentary feelin dye see  a minute after that the mate he cries down to the captain  ice closin up sir  and the captain he runs on deck  by this time there was no mistake about it the ice was close upon us  it was clear that we were to have a nip  so the captain roars down the hatchway tumble up there tumble up every man alive for your lives  and sure enough they did tumble up as i never seed em do it beforetwo or three of em was sick they came up with their clothes in their hands  the ice was now almost touchin our sides and i tell you sir i never did feel so queerish in all my life before as when i looked over the side at the edge of that great field of ice which rose three foot out o the water and was i suppose six foot more below the surface  it came on so slow that we could hardly see the motion  inch by inch the water narrowed between it and our sides  at last it touched on the left side and that shoved us quicker on to the field on our right  every eye was fixed on itevery man held his breath  you might have heard a pin fall on the deck  it touched gently at first then there was a low grindin and crunchin sound  the ship trembled as if it had been a livin creetur and the beams began to crack  now you must know sir that when a nip o this sort takes a ship the ice usually eases off after giving her a good squeeze or when the pressure is too much for her the ice slips under her bottom and lifts her right out o the water  but our nancy was what we call wallsided  she was never fit to sail in them seas  the consequence was that the ice crushed her sides in  the moment the captain heard the beams begin to go he knew it was all up with the ship so he roared to take to the ice for our lives  you may be sure we took his advice  over the side we went every man jack of us and got on the ice  we did not take time to save an article belongin to us and it was as well we did not for the ice closed up with a crash and we heard the beams and timbers rending like a fire of musketry in the hold  her bottom must have been cut clean away for she stood on the ice just as she had floated on the sea  then the noise stopped the ice eased off and the ship began to settle  the lead of water opened up again in ten minutes after that the nancy went to the bottom and left us standing there on the ice  it was the mercy of god that let it happen so near the bullfinch  we might have been out o sight o that ship at the time and then every man of us would have bin lost  as it was we had a hard scramble over a good deal of loose ice jumpin from lump to lump and some of us fallin into the water several times before we got aboard  now that was a bad nip sir warnt it  it certainly was replied gregory and although i delight in being among the ice i sincerely hope that our tight little brig may not be tried in the same way  but she is better able to stand it i should think  that she is sir replied croft with much confidence  i seed her in dock sir when they was aputtin of extra timbers on the bow and i do believe she would stand twice as much bad usage as the nancy got though she is only half the size  jim crofts opinion on this point was well founded for the hope had indeed been strengthened and prepared for her ice battles with the greatest care by men of experience and ability  as some readers may be interested in this subject i shall give a brief account of the additions that were made to her hull  the vessel was nearly two hundred tons burden  she had originally been built very strongly and might even have ventured on a voyage to the polar seas just as she was  but captain harvey resolved to take every precaution to insure the success of his voyage and the safety and comfort of his men  he therefore had the whole of the ships bottom sheathed with thick hardwood planking which was carried up above her waterline as high as the ordinary floeice would be likely to reach the hull inside was strengthened with stout crossbeams as well as with beams running along the length of the vessel and in every part that was likely to be subjected to pressure iron stanchions were fastened  but the bow of the vessel was the point where the utmost strength was aimed at  inside just behind the cutwater the whole space was so traversed by crossbeams of oak that it almost became a solid mass and outside the sharp stem was cased in iron so as to resemble a giants chisel the false keel was taken off the whole vessel in short was rendered as strong outside and in as wood and iron and skill could make her it need scarcely be said that all the other arrangements about her were made with the greatest care and without regard to expense for although the owners of the brig did not wish to waste their money they set too high a value on human life to risk it for the sake of saving a few pounds  she was provisioned for a cruise of two years and a half  but this was in case of accidents for captain harvey did not intend to be absent much longer than one year  but to return to our story  jim crofts fear that they would be set fast was realised sooner than he expected  the floes began to close in from no cause that could be seen for the wind was quite still and in a short time the loose ice pressed against the hope on all sides  it seemed to young gregory as if the story that the seaman had just related was about to be enacted over again and being a stranger to ice he could not help feeling a little uneasy for some time  but there was in reality little or no danger for the pressure was light and the brig had got into a small bay in the edge of an icefield which lay in the midst of the smaller masses  seeing that there was little prospect of the pack opening up just then the captain ordered the iceanchors to be got out and fixed  the appearance of the sea from the brigs deck was now extremely wintry but very bright and cheerful  not a spot of blue water was to be seen in any direction  the whole ocean appeared as if it had been frozen over  it was now past noon and the suns rays were warm although the quantity of ice around rendered the air cold  as the men were returning from fixing the anchors the captain looked over the side and said  its not likely that we shall move out of this for some hours  what say you lads to a game of football  the proposal was received with a loud cheer  the ball had been prepared by the sailmaker in expectation of some such opportunity as this  it was at once tossed over the side those men who were not already on the field scrambled out of the brig and the entire crew went leaping and yelling over the ice with the wild delight of schoolboys let loose for an unexpected holiday  they were in the middle of the game when a loud shout came from the brig and the captains voice was heard singing out  all hands ahoy come aboard  look alive  instantly the men turned and there was a general race toward the brig which lay nearly a quarter of a mile distant from them  in summer changes in the motions of the ice take place in the most unexpected manner  currents in the ocean are no doubt the chief cause of these the action of winds has also something to do with them  one of these changes was now taking place  almost before the men got on board the ice had separated and long canals of water were seen opening up here and there  soon after that a light breeze sprang up the iceanchors were taken aboard the sails trimmed and soon the hope was again making her way slowly but steadily to the north    chapter four  difficulties troubles and dangers  for some hours the brig proceeded onward with a freshening breeze winding and turning in order to avoid the lumps of ice  many of the smaller pieces were not worth turning out of the way of the mere weight of the vessel being sufficient to push them aside  up to this time they had succeeded in steering clear of everything without getting a thump but they got one at last which astonished those among the crew who had not been in the ice before  the captain gregory and dicey were seated in the cabin at the time taking tea  ned dawkins the steward an active little man was bringing in a teapot with a second supply of tea  in his left hand he carried a tray of biscuit  the captain sat at the head of the table dicey at the foot and the doctor at the side  suddenly a tremendous shock was felt  the captains cup of tea leaped away from him and flooded the centre of the table  the doctors cup was empty he seized the table with both hands and remained steady but diceys cup happened to be at his lips at the moment and was quite full  the effect on him was unfortunate  he was thrown violently on his back and the tea poured over his face and drenched his hair as he lay sprawling on the floor  the steward saved himself by dropping the breadtray and grasping the handle of the cabin door  so violent was the shock that the ships bell was set aringing  beg pardon gentlemen cried the first mate looking down the skylight  i forgot to warn you  the ice is getting rather thick around us and i had to charge a lump of it  its all very well to beg pardon said the captain but that wont mend my crockery  or dry my head growled mr dicey its as bad as if id been dipped overboard it is  before mr diceys grumbling remarks were finished all three of them had reached the deck  the wind had freshened considerably and the brig was rushing in a somewhat alarming manner among the floes  it required the most careful attention to prevent her striking heavily  if it goes on like this we shall have to reduce sail observed the captain  see there is a neck of ice ahead that will stop us  this seemed to be probable for the lane of water along which they were steering was just ahead of them stopped by a neck of ice that connected two floepieces  the water beyond was pretty free from ice but this neck or mass seemed so thick that it became a question whether they should venture to charge it or shorten sail  stand by the fore and maintopsail braces shouted the captain  aye aye sir  now mr mansell said he with a smile we have come to our first real difficulty  what do you advise shall we back the topsails or try what our little hope is made of and charge the enemy  charge answered the mate  just so said the captain hastening to the bow to direct the steersman  port your helm  steady  the brig was now about fifty yards from the neck of ice tearing through the water like a racehorse  in another moment she was up to it and struck it fair in the middle  the stout little vessel quivered to her keel under the shock but she did not recoil  she split the mass into fragments and bearing down all before her sailed like a conqueror into the clear water beyond  well done the hope said the captain as he walked aft while a cheer burst from the men  i think she ought to be called the good hope ever after this said tom gregory  if she cuts her way through everything as easily as she has cut through that neck of ice we shall reach the north pole itself before winter  if we reach the north pole at all observed mr dicey ill climb up to the top of it and stand on my head i will  the second mate evidently had no expectation of reaching that mysterious pole which men have so long and so often tried to find in vain  heavy ice ahead sir shouted mr mansell who was at the masthead with a telescope  where away  on the weather bow sir the pack seems open enough to push through but the large bergs are numerous  the hope was now indeed getting into the heart of those icy regions where ships are in constant danger from the floating masses that come down with the oceancurrents from the far north  in sailing along she was often obliged to run with great violence against lumps so large that they caused her whole frame to tremble stout though it was  shall we smash the lump or will it stave in our bows was a question that frequently ran in the captains mind  sometimes ice closed round her and squeezed the sides so that her beams cracked  at other times when a large field was holding her fast the smaller pieces would grind and rasp against her as they went past until the crew fancied the whole of the outer sheathing of planks had been scraped off  often she had to press close to icebergs of great size and more than once a lump as large as a goodsized house fell off the icefields and plunged into the sea close to her side causing her to rock violently on the waves that were raised by it  indeed the bergs are dangerous neighbours not only from this cause but also on account of their turning upside down at times and even falling to pieces so that captain harvey always kept well out of their way when he could but this was not always possible  the little brig had a narrow escape one day from the falling of a berg  it was a short time after that day on which they had the game of football  they passed in safety through the floes and bergs that had been seen that evening and got into open water beyond where they made made good progress before falling in with ice but at last they came to a part of baffins bay where a great deal of ice is always found  here the pack surrounded them and compelled them to pass close to a berg which was the largest they had fallen in with up to that time  it was jagged in form and high rather than broad  great peaks rose up from it like the mountain tops of some wild highland region  it was several hundred yards off the weatherbeam when the brig passed but it towered so high over the masts that it seemed to be much nearer than it was there was no apparent motion in this berg and the waves beat and rolled upon its base just as they do on the shore of an island  in fact it was as like an island as possible or rather like a mountain planted in the sea only it was white instead of green  there were cracks and rents and caverns in it just as there are on a rugged mountain side all of which were of a beautiful blue colour  there were also slopes and crags and precipices down which the water of the melted ice constantly flowed in wild torrents  many of these were equal to small rivulets and some of the waterfalls were beautiful  the berg could not have measured less than a mile round the base and it was probably two hundred feet high  it is well known that floating ice sinks deep and that there is about eight or ten times as much of it below as there is above water  the reader may therefore form some idea of what an enormous mass of ice this berg was  the crew of the hope observed in passing that lumps were continually falling from the cliffs into the sea  the berg was evidently in a very rotten and dangerous state and the captain ran the brig as close to the pack on the other side as possible in order to keep out of its way just as this was done some great rents occurred and suddenly a mass of ice larger than the brig fell from the top of a cliff into the sea  no danger flowed from this but the mass thus thrown off was so large as to destroy the balance of the berg and to the horror of the sailors the huge mountain began to roll over  fortunately it fell in a direction away from the brig  had it rolled toward her no human power could have saved our voyagers  the mighty mass went over with a wild hollow roar and new peaks and cliffs rose out of the sea as the old ones disappeared with great cataracts of uplifted brine pouring furiously down their sides  apart from its danger this was an awful sight  those who witnessed it could only gaze in solemn silence  even the most careless among them must have been forced to recognise the might and majesty of god in the event as well as his mercy in having led them to the right side of the berg at such a dangerous moment  but the scene had not yet closed  for some time the ice mountain rocked grandly to and fro raising a considerable swell on the sea which all round was covered with the foam caused by this tremendous commotion in a few minutes several rents took place sounding like the reports of great guns  rotten as it was the berg could not stand the shock of its change of position for it had turned fairly upside down  crack after crack took place with deafening reports  lumps of all sizes fell from its sides  then there was a roar long continued like thunder a moment after the whole berg sank down in ruins and with a mighty crash fell flat upon the sea  the hope was beyond the reach of danger but she rose and sank on the swell caused by the ruin of this berg for some time after  it was on the afternoon of the same day that the brig received her first really severe nip from the ice  she had got deep into the pack and was surrounded on all sides by large bergs some of these being high like the one that has just been described others low and flat but of great extent  one not far off was two miles long and its glittering walls rose about fifteen feet above the sea  the sky was brighter than usual at the time  this was owing to one of those strange appearances which one sees more of in the arctic regions than in any other part of the world  the sun shone with unclouded splendour and around it there were three mock suns almost as bright as the sun itself one on each side and one directly above it learned men call these bright spots parhelia  sailors call them sundogs  they were connected together with a ring of light which entirely encircled the sun but the lower edge of it was partly lost on the horizon  although this was the first time that these mock suns had been seen by gregory and some others of the crew of the hope little attention was paid to them at the time because of the dangerous position into which the brig had been forced  the pack had again closed all around her obliging her to take shelter in the lee of a small berg which from its shape did not seem likely to be a dangerous protector  there was a small bay in the berg  into this the brig was warped and for some time she lay safely here  it was just large enough to hold her and a long tongue of ice projecting from the foot of it kept off the pressure of the seaice  nevertheless a look of anxiety rested on the captains face after the iceanchors had been made fast  you dont seem to like our position captain said young gregory who had been watching the doings of the men and now and then lent them a hand  i dont tom  the pack is closing tight up and this berg may prove an enemy instead of a friend if it forces into our harbour here  let us hear what our mate thinks of it  what say you mr mansell shall we hold on here or warp out and take our chance in the pack  better hold on sir answered the mate gravely  the pack is beginning to grind we should get a tight embrace i fear if we went out  here we may do well enough but everything depends on that tongue  he looked as he spoke toward the point of ice which extended in front of the brigs stern and guarded the harbour from the outer ice in that direction  the tongue was not a large one and it was doubtful whether it could stand the pressure that was increasing every minute  the pack was indeed beginning to grind as the mate had said for while they were looking at it the edges of two floes came together with a crash about fifty yards from the berg  they ground together for a moment with a harsh growling sound and then the two edges were suddenly forced up to a height of about fifteen or twenty feet  next moment they fell on the closedup ice and lay there in a mound or hummock of broken masses  thats how a ummuck is formed dr gregory said mr dicey looking uncommonly wise  youll see more things here in five minutes by means of your own eyes than ye could learn from books in a year  theres nothin like seein  seein is believin you know  i wouldnt give an ounce of experience for a ton of hearsay  come mr dicey dont run down booklearning said gregory  if a man only knew about things that he had seen he would know very little  before the second mate could reply the captain shouted to the men to bear a hand with the icepoles  the whole crew answered to the call and each man seizing a long pole stood ready for action  the tongue to which i have referred more than once had broken off and the ice was rushing in  the bay was full in a minute and although the men used their icepoles actively and worked with a will they could not shove the pieces past them  the hope was driven bow on to the berg  then there was a strain a terrible creaking and groaning of the timbers as if the good little vessel were complaining of the pressure all at once there was a loud crack the bow of the brig lifted a little and she was forced violently up the sloping side of the berg  twice this happened and then she remained stationaryhigh and dry out of the water    chapter five  a galenarrow escapessigns of winterset fast  during the rest of that day and the whole of that night did the brig remain fixed on the berg  early next morning the ice began to move  it eased off and the vessel slid gently down the slope on which she had been forced and was relaunched safely into the water  the satisfaction of the crew on being thus delivered from a position of much danger was very great but they had no sooner escaped from one peril than they were overtaken by another  a sharp breeze sprang up from the eastward and drove them out into the pack which began to heave about in a terrible manner under the influence of the wind  soon this increased to a gale and the ice was driven along at great speed by a strong northerly current  while this was going on land was discovered bearing to the northeast here was new danger for although it was not a leeshore still there was some risk of the vessel being caught among grounded icebergsof which a few were seen  the gale increased to such a degree before night that captain harvey began to think of taking shelter under the lee of one of these bergs he therefore stood toward one but before reaching it the vessel received one or two severe shocks from passing floes  a large berg lay within half a mile of them  they reached it in safety and getting under its lee lowered a boat and fixed their iceanchors  just after they were fixed a mass of ice the size of a ships longboat and many tons in weight came suddenly up out of the sea with great violence the top of it rising above the bulwarks  one corner of it struck the hull just behind the mainmast and nearly stove in the bottom of the brig  this lump was what arctic voyagers term a calf  when masses of ice break off from the bergs far below the surface of the water they rise with extreme violence and ships run great risk of being destroyed by these calves when they anchor too near to the bergs  had this calf struck the hope a fair blow she must certainly have gone down with all on board  they were not yet freed from their troubles however  in half an hour the wind shifted a few points but the stream of the loose ice did not change  the brig was therefore blown right in among the rushing masses  the three cables that held her were snapped as if they had been pieces of packthread and she was whirled out into the pack where she drove helplessly exposed to the fury of the howling storm and the dangers of the grinding ice  captain harvey now felt that he could do nothing to save his vessel  he believed that if god did not mercifully put forth his hand to deliver them by a miracle he and his companions would certainly perish  in this the captain was wrong  nothing is impossible to the almighty  he can always accomplish his purposes without the aid of a miracle  there did indeed seem no way of escape for the driving masses of ice were grinding each other to powder in nearly every direction and the brig only escaped instant destruction by being wedged between two pieces that held together from some unknown cause  presently they were carried down toward a large berg that seemed to be aground for the loose ice was passing it swiftly  this was not the case however  an undercurrent far down in the depths of the sea was acting on this berg and preventing it from travelling with the ice that floated with the stream at the surface  in its passing the mass of ice that held them struck one of the projecting tongues beneath the surface and was split in two  the brig was at once set free  as they passed they might almost have leaped upon the berg  captain harvey saw and seized his opportunity  stand by to heave an anchor he shouted  sam baker being the strongest man in the ship sprang to one of the small iceanchors that lay on the deck with a line attached to it and lifting it with both hands stood ready  the brig passed close to the end of the berg where the leeside formed a long tail of sheltered water  she was almost thrust into this by the piece of ice from which she had just escaped  she grazed the edge of the berg as she drove past  heave shouted the captain  sam baker swung the anchor round his head as if it had been a feather and hurled it far upon the ice  for a few yards it rattled over the slippery surface then it caught a lump but the first strain broke it off  just after that it fell into a crack and held on  the brig was checked and swung round into the smooth water but they had to ease off the line lest it should snap  at last she was brought up and lay safely under the shelter of that berg until the storm was over  some weeks flew by after this without anything occurring worthy of particular notice  during this time the hope made good progress into the polar regions without again suffering severely either from ice or storm although much retarded by the thick fogs that prevail in the arctic regions  she was indeed almost always surrounded by ice but it was sufficiently open to allow of a free passage through it  many whales and seals had been seen also one or two bears but not in circumstances in which they could be attacked without occasioning much delay  the brief summer had now passed away and the days began to shorten as winter approached  still captain harvey hoped to get farther north before being obliged to search for winter quarters  one morning early in september however he found to his sorrow that pancakeice was forming on the sea  when the sea begins to freeze it does so in small needlelike spikes which cross and recross each other until they form thin ice which the motion of the waves breaks up into flat cakes about a foot or so across  these by constantly rubbing against each other get worn into a rounded shape  sailors call this pancakeice  it is the first sign of coming winter  the cakes soon become joined together as the frost increases  the place where this occurred was near to those wild cliffs that rise out of the sea in the channels or straits that lie at the head of baffins bay  the vessel was now beyond the farthest point of land that had been discovered at the time of which i am writing and already one or two of the headlands had been named by captain harvey and marked on his chart  i dont like to see pancakeice so early in the season remarked the captain to mr mansell  no more do i sir answered the mate  this would be a bad place to winter in i fear  land ahead was shouted at that moment by the lookout at the masthead  keep her away two points said the captain to the man at the helm how does it lie  right ahead sir  any ice near it  no all clear  the brig was kept a little more out to sea  soon she came to more open water and in the course of four hours was close to the land which proved to be a low barren island not more than a mile across  here the wind died away altogether and a sharp frost set in  the pancakes became joined together and on the following morning when our friend gregory came on deck he found that the whole ocean was covered with ice  it did not indeed look very like ice because being so thin it did not prevent the usual swell from rolling over the sea  a light breeze was blowing and the brig cut her way through it for some time but the breeze soon died away leaving her becalmed within a quarter of a mile of the island  for some time the voyagers hoped that a thaw would take place or that wind would break up the ice  but they were disappointed  this was the first touch of the cold hand of winter and the last day of the hopes advance northward  seeing this captain harvey set energetically to work to cut his way into winter quarters for it would not do to remain all winter in the exposed position in which his vessel then lay  on his right was the island already referred to about a quarter of a mile off  beyond this about five miles distant were the high steep cliffs of the western coast of greenland  everywhere else lay the open sea covered here and there with floes and bergs and coated with new ice  this ice became so thick in the course of another night that the men could walk on it without danger  by means of saws and chisels made for the purpose they cut a passage toward the island and finally moored the brig in a small bay which was sheltered on all sides except the east  this being the land side required no protection  they named the place refuge harbour  everyone was now full of activity  the voyagers had reached the spot where they knew they were destined to spend the winter and much had to be done before they could consider themselves in a fit state to face that terrible season  winter in the polar regions extends over eight months of the yearfrom september to may  but so much of ice and snow remains there all the summer that winter can scarcely be said to quit those regions at all  it is difficult to imagine what the arctic winter is  we cannot properly understand the tremendous difficulties and sufferings that men who go to the polar seas have to fight against  let the reader think of the following facts and see if he does not draw his chair closer to the fire and feel thankful that he has not been born an eskimo and is not an arctic seaman  winter within the arctic circle as i have said is fully eight months long  during that time the land is covered with snow many feet deep and the sea with ice of all degrees of thicknessfrom vast fields of ten or fifteen feet thick to bergs the size of islands and mountains all frozen into one solid mass  there is no sunlight there night or day for three out of these eight winter months and there is not much during the remaining five  in summer there is perpetual sunlight all night as well as all day for about two monthsfor many weeks the sun never descends below the horizon  it is seen every day and every night sweeping a complete circle in the bright blue sky  having been so free of his light in summer the sun seems to think he has a right to absent himself in winter for the three months of darkness that i have spoken of are not months of partial but of total darknessas far at least as the sun is concerned  the moon and stars and the northern lights do indeed give their light when the fogs and clouds will allow them but no one will say that these make up for the absence of the sun  then the frost is so intense that everything freezes solid except pure spirits of wine  unless you have studied the thermometer you cannot understand the intensity of this frost but for the sake of those who do know something about extreme cold i give here a few facts that were noted down during the winter that my story tells of  on the 10th of september these icebound voyagers had eighteen degrees of frost and the darkness had advanced on them so rapidly that it was dark about ten at night  by the 1st of october the ice round the brig was a foot and a half thick  up to this time they had shot white hares on the island and the hunting parties that crossed the ice to the mainland shot deer and musk oxen and caught white foxes in traps gulls and other birds too had continued to fly around them but most of these went away to seek warmer regions farther south  walrus and seals did not leave so soon  they remained as long as there was any open water out at sea  the last birds that left them and the first that returned in spring were the snowbirdslittle creatures about the size of a sparrow almost white with a few brown feathers here and there  the last of these fled from the darkening winter on the 7th of november and did not return until the 1st of the following may  when they left it was dark almost all day  the thermometer could scarcely be read at noon and the stars were visible during the day  from this time forward thick darkness set in and the cold became intense  the thermometer fell below zero and after that they never saw it above that point for months together20 degrees 30 degrees and 40 degrees below were common temperatures  the ice around them was ten feet thick on the 1st of december noon was so dark that they could not see fifty yards ahead and on the 15th the fingers could not be counted a foot from the eyes  the thermometer stood at 40 degrees below zero  the darkness could not now become greater but the cold still continued to grow more intense  it almost doubled in severity  in january it fell to 67 degrees below zero  so great was this cold that the men felt impelled to breathe gradually  the breath issued from their mouths in white clouds of steam and instantly settled on their beards and whiskers in hoarfrost  in the cabin of the hope they had the utmost difficulty in keeping themselves moderately warm at this time  things had now reached their worst and by slow degrees matters began to mend  on the 22nd of january the first faint sign of returning day appearedjust a blue glimmer on the horizon  by the middle of february the light tipped the tops of the mountains on shore and the highest peaks of the icebergs on the sea and on the 1st of march it bathed the deck of the hope  then the longimprisoned crew began to feel that spring was really coming  but there was little heat in the suns rays at first and it was not till the month of may that the ice out at sea broke up and summer could be said to have begun  during all this long winterduring all these wonderful changes our arctic voyagers had a hard fight in order to keep themselves alive their life was a constant struggle  they had to fight the bears and the walrus to resist the cold and the darkness to guard against treachery from the natives and to suffer pains sickness and trials such as seldom fall to the lot of men in ordinary climates  how they did and suffered all this i shall try to show in the following pages  in attempting this i shall make occasional extracts from the journal of our friend tom gregory for tom kept his journal regularly and was careful to note down only what he heard and saw    chapter six  preparations for winteringremarkable adventures with a bear  the first care of captain harvey after getting his brig securely laid up in her icy cradle for the winter was to remove some of the stores to the island where he had them carefully secured in a little hut which the crew built of loose stones  this relieved the strain on the vessel and permitted the free circulation of air  the fitting up of the interior of the brig was then begun  the wooden partition between the cabin and the hold was taken down and the whole space thrown into one apartment  the stove was put up in the centre of it and moss was piled round the walls inside about a foot thick  moss was also spread on the deck and above it the snow was allowed to gather for snow although so cold itself keeps things that it covers warm by not permitting the heat to escape  the brig was banked up all round with snow and a regular snowy staircase was built from the ice to her bulwarks  they changed their time now from what is called seatime to that which we follow on land  that is to say they reckoned the day to commence just after twelve midnight instead of dividing it into watches as they were wont to do at sea  journals were begun and careful notes made of everything that occurred or that might in any way further the object for which they had gone there  every man in the ship had his appointed duty and his post  if the native eskimos should arrive in a warlike temper each man had his cutlass and pistols in readiness  if a bear should pay them a visit each could lay hands on his musket in an instant and if a fire should break out on board every man had his bucket ready and his particular post fixed  some were to run to the waterhole which it was the duty of one man to keep open  others were to station themselves from the hole to the ship to pass the buckets while the rest were to remain on board to convey them to the point of danger  captain harvey fixed all the arrangements and superintended the carrying out of his orders in a general way making his two officers and the young doctor responsible for the overseeing of details  each of these foremen furnished him with a report every night of what had been done during the day and the result was noted down by himself in a journal  thus everything went smoothly and pleasantly along during the first weeks of their sojourn in their frozen home  in regard to fresh provisions they were fortunate at first for they obtained sufficient supplies of deer and other game  this was in the early part of winter while there was still plenty of daylight  in tom gregorys journal i find it thus written  september 10ththe days are beginning to shorten now and we are all busily occupied in preparing for the long dark winter that is before us  sam baker who is the best shot among us brought in a deer today  this is fortunate for we stand in need of fresh meat  our greatest enemy this winter i fear will be scurvy  unless we obtain a large supply of fresh provisions we cannot hope to escape it  crofts brought in two arctic hares  they are beautiful creaturespure white and each weighs about seven pounds  these with the four deer shot by myself last week and the ten hares got by baker will keep us going for some time  september 12thi had an adventure with a polar bear last night which has amused the men very much and given them food for jocularity for a few days  some days back davy butts set a trap on the island in which he has caught a few foxes  last night his long legs were so tired that he did not care to visit his trap so i offered to go instead of him  it was while i was out on this errand that i happened to meet with bruin  our meeting was sudden and unexpected on both sides i believe it was midnight when i set off to the trap which was not more than half a mile from the ship and it was quite dark when i reached it  davy is an ingenious fellow  his trap is made of four blocks of hard snow with a sort of wooden trigger that goes off the moment the bait is touched and allows a heavy log to fall down on the poor foxs back there was no fox there however when i reached it  i went down on my knees and was examining the bait when i heard a low growl  i leaped up and felt for the knife which i usually carried in my belt  it was not there  in the haste of my departure from the ship i had forgotten to buckle it on  i had no gun of course  it was too dark to shoot and i had not counted on meeting with any dangerous enemy  i could only crouch down behind a lump of ice and hope that the bear would go away but another growl much louder than the first and close at hand showed that i had been seen  it was so dark that i could hardly see fifty yards ahead  there was a great chasm or hole just in front of me  this was the place where the main body of the seaice had been separated from the shoreice that was aground  here every rise and fall of the tide had broken it afresh so that the rent was twenty yards wide and full of large blocks that had been tossed about in confusion  across this i gazed into the gloom and thought i saw an object that looked like a large block of rounded ice  before i could make up my mind how to act the block of ice rose up with a furious roar and charged me  the chasm checked him for a moment  but for this i should have been caught immediately  while he was scrambling over it i took to my heels and ran along the edge of the ice at the top of my speed  there was a narrow part of the chasm which i had looked at in daylight and wondered whether i might venture to leap across it  i had made up my mind that it was too wide and dangerous to be attempted  but it is wonderful how quickly a man changes his mind on such a point when a polar bear is roaring at his heels  i came to the gap in the ice  it was ten feet deep and thirteen or fourteen feet across  the jagged lumps of ice at the bottom lay there in horrible confusion  there was barely light enough to see where the hole was when i came within ten yards of it but i did not hesitate  a rush a bound and i went over like a cat  not so the bear  he had not measured the place with his eye in daylight as i had done  he made a gallant leap it is true but fell short as i knew from the bursting sound and the growl of rage with which he came against the edge of the ice and fell back among the broken blocks  i did not wait to see how he got out you may be sure but ran as i never ran before in all my life  i reached the brig quite out of breath  the bear had not followed me up for i did not see him that night again  long davy laughed at me a good deal and said he was sure i had been frightened at a shadow  it gave a wonderfully loud roar for a shadow  i hope that davy himself may get a chase before the winter is over just to convince him of his error in not believing me  the kind wish thus expressed in the young doctors journal was gratified sooner than might have been expected  only two days after the incident above described poor davy butts met with the same bear face to face and had a run for his life that turned the laugh from tom gregory to himself  it was on the afternoon of a clear cold day just about sunset  the men had finished dinner and were smoking their pipes on deck stamping their feet and slapping their hands and arms to keep them warm  hallo davy where are you bound for inquired the captain on observing that butts was wrapping himself carefully in his furcoat tightening his belt and putting on his mittens as if bent on a long journey  im only goin to take a look at my foxtrap sir if youll allow me  certainly my lad  if you get a fox its well worth the trouble  and harkee davy take your axe and make one or two more of these snowtraps of yours  it will be a wellspent hour  why butts exclaimed gregory what do you mean to do with that big horsepistol  surely you are not afraid of bears after laughing so much at the one that chased me  oh no not afraid you know replied davy  but theres no harm in being armed  mind you shoot him straight in the eye or send a bullet up his nose thems the vulnerable parts of him cried joe davis with a laugh as butts went down the snowsteps and got upon the ice  i say cried pepper as he was moving away  well  bring his tongue aboard with you and ill cook it for supper  ah and a bit of fat to fry it in added the steward  theres nothin like tongue fried in bears grease  no no dawkins said mr dicey  hallo  davy bring the ams bears ams are considered fustrate heatin  no dont bring the hams shouted jim croft fetch the tongue thats the thing for supper of a cold nightfetch the tongue lad  hold your own tongue shouted davy in reply as he went off amid the laughter of his comrades  the sun sank soon after and before the ingenious seaman had finished two new traps the short twilight had gradually deepened into night still there was plenty of light for the sky was clear and studded with a host of stars  in addition to this the aurora borealis was sending its beautiful flashes of palegreen light all across the western sky  the aurorawhich also goes by the names of northern lights and streamers and merrydancers is seen in great splendour in these northern skies  when the seaman had finished his traps and looked up for a minute or two at the sky before starting on his return to the ship he beheld the aurora extending over the heavens in the form of an irregular arch  it was extremely bright but the brightness was not the same in all parts  it moved and waved gently about like a band of thin green fire  every now and then long tongues or streamers darted up from it and these were brighter than the rest  they were yellowish white and sometimes became pale pink in colour  the light from this beautiful object was equal to that of the moon in her quarter and the stars that were behind it shone dimly through as if they were covered with a thin gauze veil  while davy was gazing in wonder at the splendid lights above him a deep growl fell upon his ear  if the man had been a jackinthebox he could not have leaped more quickly round  his pistol was out and cocked in a moment  the growl was followed by a roar which drove all the blood back into davys heart and seemed to freeze it theresolid  the man was no coward as was quite clear for at first he boldly stood his ground  but he would have been more than mortal if he had not felt some strange qualms about his heart when he saw a large white bear rushing furiously toward him  the animal came this time from the interior of the small island  the seaman knew well the place over which young gregory had jumped when he had been chased  after wavering for a moment or two he turned and fled  another tremendous roar helped him over the ice like a deer and he took the chasm with a bound like an indiarubber ball  it must certainly have been the same animal that chased gregory for instead of trying to leap the chasm it went to another part of the rent and scrambled across  this gave butts time to increase the distance between them but a man is no match for a polar bear in a race  the monster was soon close up with him and the ship still far off  the man knew his danger he turned took a quick aim and fired  he missed of course flung the pistol in desperation in the bears face and ran on the pistol happened to stick in the snow with the butt in the air and when the bear came up to it he stopped to smell it  it it well known nowadays that polar bears are full of curiosity and will stop for a few minutes to examine anything that comes in their way even when they are in full chase of a man  davy butts knew nothing of this at the time but he was a quickwitted fellow  he observed this stopping of the bear and determined to give him something more to stop at  when bruin was close at his heels he threw down his cap  the bear at once pulled up smelt it all round tossed it into the air with his snout pawed it once or twice then tore it to pieces with one wrench and continued the chase  very little time was lost in this operation he was soon up with the man again then a mitten was thrown down for his inspection  after that the other mitten went the cravat followed and the axe went next  all that i have just related happened in a very few minutes  davy was still a good quarter of a mile from the brig everything that he could tear off his person in haste and throw down was gone and the bear was once more coming up behind  as a last hope he pulled off his heavy furcoat and dropped it  this seemed to be a subject of great interest to the bear for it was longer in inspecting it than the other things  and now poor butts went tearing along like a maniac in his flannel shirt and trousers  he was a miserable and curious object for his body besides being very long was uncommonly lanky and his legs and arms seemed to go like the wings of a windmill never since the day of his birth had davy butts run at such a pace in such light clothing and in such severe frost  a long line of low hummocks hid him from the brig  the moment he passed these he came in sight of her and began to yell  wot on airth is yon exclaimed joe davis who chanced to be looking over the gangway when this remarkable object appeared  the wild man o the north himself or my name aint jim said crofts turning pale  why its davy butts i do believe cried sam baker who came on deck at that moment  just then the bear came tearing round the end of the hummocks in full chase  hurrah hallo ho roared the men who had crowded on deck at the first note of alarm  sam baker seized a heavy ash handspike about five feet long and was on his way to meet his comrade before the others had gained the ice  they were not slow however  some with muskets some with pistols and cutlasses and some with nothing but their fistsall followed sam who was now far ahead  baker passed davy without a remark and ran straight at the bear which stopped on seeing such a big powerful man running so furiously at him and flourishing a bludgeon that would almost have suited the hand of a giant  but polar bears are not timid  he rose on his hind legs at once and paid no attention whatever to the tremendous crack that sam dealt him over the skull  the blow broke the handspike in two and the foolhardy seaman would soon have paid for his rashness with his life had not friendly and steady hands been near  nothing daunted he was about to repeat the blow with the piece of the handspike that was still in his grasp and the bear was about to seize him with its claws each of which were full two inches long when the first mate and gregory came running toward him side by side the first armed with a rifle the doctor with pistols  too late gasped gregory  we must fire said mansell and risk hitting sam  here doctor you are a good shot take the rifle  the young man obeyed dropped on one knee and took aim but did not fire  sam was between him and the bear  a sudden movement changed their positions  the side of the monster came into view and in another instant it was stretched on the ice with a bullet in his brain    chapter seven  a great battle with the walrus  it need scarcely be said that there was a jovial feast that night at supper  the bears tongue was cooked after all but the impudent tongues of the party were not silenced for they almost worried the life out of poor davy for having run away from a bear  soon after this event the preparations for spending the winter were completed at least as far as the fitting up of the vessel was concerned  this morning writes gregory in his journal we finished housing over our arctic home  the hope is very snug lined with moss and almost covered with snow  a sail has been spread over the quarterdeck like an awning it is also covered with moss and snow  this we hope will give much additional warmth to our house below  we all live together now men and officers  it will require our united strength to fight successfully against that terrible enemy john frost  john is king of the arctic regions undoubtedly  dawkins got a coldbath yesterday that amused the men much and did him no harm  for some time past we have been carrying moss from the island in large bundles  dawkins got leave to help as he said he was sicktired of always working among stores  he was passing close to the firehole with a great bundle of moss on his back when his foot slipped and down he went  this hole is kept constantly open  it is bakers duty night and morning to break the ice and have it ready in case of fire  the ice on the surface was therefore thin in a moment nothing was to be seen of poor dawkins but his bundle  fortunately he held tight on to it and we hauled him out soaked to the skin  the thermometer stood at 35 degrees below zero the coldest day we have had up to this time and in two minutes the unfortunate mans clothes were frozen so stiff that he could scarcely walk  we had to break the ice on his legs and arms at the joints and even then he had to be half hoisted on board and carried below  we all dress in sealskin and foxskin garments now  dawkins had on a rough coat made of white and grey foxes trousers of the same boots of sealskin and mittens ditto when all this was soaked and frozen he was truly a humbling sight  the undressing of him was a labour of difficulty as well as of love however when he was rubbed dry and reclothed he was none the worse indeed i am inclined to think he was much the better of his ducking  tomorrow we are to make some curious experiments with boats sledges and kites  the captain is anxious to take our largest boat over the ice as far to the south as possible and leave her there with a quantity of provisions so that we may have her to fall back upon if any misfortune should befall the brig which i earnestly pray that god may forbid  davy butts who is an ingenious fellow in his way says that we can sail a boat on the ice almost as well as on the water and that we may drag sledges by means of kites if we choose  the captain means to attempt a journey to the north with sledges in spring so if the kites answer butts will have done us good service  but i have my doubts  the nights are closing in fast very soon we shall be without the sun altogether  but the moon is cheering us  last night 28th october she swept in a complete circle round the sky all day as well as all night  she only touched the horizon and then instead of setting she rose again as if the frozen sea had frightened her  october 30thbaker came in today and reported open water about six miles off and walrus sporting in it  i shall set out tomorrow on a hunt  the hunt which the young doctor here wrote of came off the following day but it was a very different one from what any of the men had expected  early in the morning baker davy butts and gregory set off on foot armed with a rifle and two muskets besides a couple of harpoons a whalelance and a long line  they also took a small sledge which was intended to be used in hauling home the meat if they should be successful  three hours hard walking brought the party to the edge of the solid ice after which they travelled on the floes that were being constantly broken by the tides and were only joined together by ice of a night or two old  this was little more than an inch thick so they had to advance with caution  presently the loud mooing of a bull walrus was heard  its roar was something between the lowing of a bull and the bark of a large dog but much louder for the walrus resembles an elephant in size more than any other animal  soon after they came in sight of their game  five walrus were snorting and barking in a hole which they had broken in the ice the way in which this huge monster opens a hole when he wants to get out of the sea is to come up from below with considerable violence and send his head crashing through the ice  the three men now became very wary  they crept on their hands and knees behind the icehummocks until within about a hundred yards of the brutes  then they ascended a small hummock to take a look round and decide on their plan of operations  while lying there flat on their faces they took particular care to keep their heads well concealed just raising them high enough to observe the position of the walrus there was a sheet of flat ice between them and the hole so that it was impossible to advance nearer without being seen  this perplexed them much for although their bullets might hit at that distance they would not be able to run in quick enough to use their lances and the harpoons would be of no use at all  while thus undecided what to do they were unexpectedly taught a lesson in walrushunting that surprised them not a little  hallo theres a bear whispered davy butts as a hairy object crawled out from behind an icehummock about two hundred yards from the place where they lay and made toward the walrus in a sly catlike manner  more like a seal observed baker  a seal why its a man said gregory in a low excited whisper  so it is sure enough said baker it must be an eskimo though his hairy garments make him look more like a bear than a man and as the fellow has got here before us i suppose we must give up our claim to the brutes  time enough to talk of that when the brutes are killed said gregory with a smile  but lie still lads  we will take a lesson from this fellow who has been so earnestly staring at the walrus that he has not noticed us  the three men lay perfectly motionless watching the native who crept as near to the hole as he could without being seen and then waited for a few minutes until the creatures should dive  this they were constantly doing staying down a few moments at a time and then coming up to breathefor the walrus cannot live without air  he is not a fish and although he can stay down a long time he must come to the surface occasionally to breathe  in this he resembles the seal and the whale  presently down they all went with a tremendous splash  now was the moment the eskimo rose ran at full speed for a few yards then fell flat on his face and lay quite still as if he had been shot dead  the reason of this was soon apparent  he understood the habits of the walrus and knew that they would rise again  this they did almost the moment after and began their snorting bellowing and rolling again once more they dived  up got the eskimo ran a few yards further forward and then fell flat down as before  in this way he got near to the hole without being seen  the watchers observed that he carried a harpoon and a coil of thick line  the next time the walrus dived he ran to the edge of the hole but now instead of falling down he stood quite still with the harpoon raised above his head ready to be thrown  in a few moments the monsters reappeared  two rose close at the edge of the hole one was a male the other a female  they were frightfully ugly to look at  shaking the water from his head and shoulders the bull at once caught sight of the man who had thus suddenly appeared  at that instant the eskimo threw up his left arm  this action instead of frightening the brutes away caused them to raise themselves high out of the water in order to have a good look at the strange creature who had thus dared to disturb them in their watery home  this was just what the native wanted  it gave him a chance of driving the harpoon under the flipper of the male  the instant this was done he caught up the end of his coil and ran quickly back to the full length of the line  the battle that now begun was perhaps one of the fiercest that was ever fought in the arctic regions  the walrus lashed the water furiously for a second or two and dived  this checked the native who at once stopped running drove the sharp point of a little piece of wood into the ice and put the loop at the end of his line over it  he pressed the loop close down to the ice with his feet so that he could hold on when it tightened which it did with great force  but the line was a stout one it had been cut from the hide of a walrus and prepared in a peculiar way for the purpose of standing a heavy strain  the eskimo now played the monster as an angler plays a trout  at one moment he held on the next he eased off  the line was sometimes like a bar of iron then it was slackened off as the animal rose and darted about  after this had happened once or twice the bull came to the surface blowing tremendously and began to bark and roar in great fury the female came up at the same time  she evidently meant to stick by her partner and share his danger  the others had dived and made off at the first sign of war  the wounded walrus was a little flurried and very angry the female was not at all frightened she was passionately furious  both of them tore up the ice tables with their great ivory tusks and glared at their enemy with an expression that there was no mistaking  the walrus is well known to be one of the fiercest animals in the world  woe to the poor native if he had been caught by these monsters at that time  after some minutes spent in uselessly smashing the ice and trying to get at the native they both dived  now came into play the eskimos knowledge of the animals habits and his skill in this curious kind of warfare  before diving they looked steadily at the man for a second and then swam under the ice straight for the spot where he stood  the eskimo of course could not see this but he knew it from past experience  he therefore changed his position instantly ran a few yards to one side and planted his stick and loop again  this had hardly been done when the ice burst up with a loud crash a hole of more than fifteen feet wide was made on the exact spot which the man had quitted and the walrus appeared with a puff like that of a steamengine and a roar that would have done credit to a lion  the great lumpishlooking heads and squarecut faces of the creatures looked frightful at this point in the fight  there was something like human intelligence in their malicious and brutal faces as the water poured down their cheeks and over their bristling beards mingled with blood and foam  at this moment there was a shout close at hand and two other eskimos ran out from behind the icehummocks and joined their comrade  they were armed with long lances the handles of which were made of bone and the points of beautiful white ivory tipped with steel  it was afterwards discovered that these natives obtained small pieces of iron and steel from the eskimos further south who were in the habit of trading at the settlements on the coast of greenland  the strangers at once ran to the edge of the pool and gave the bull walrus two deep wounds with their lances  they also wounded the female this seemed to render them more furious than ever  they dived again the first eskimo again shifted his position and the others ran back a short distance  they were not a moment too soon in these changes for the ice was again burst upward at the spot they had just quitted and the enraged beasts once more came bellowing to the surface and vented their fury on the ice  it may seem almost incredible to the reader but it is a fact that this battle lasted fully four hours  at the end of the third hour it seemed to the sailors who were watching it that the result was still doubtful for the eskimos were evidently becoming tired while the monsters of the polar seas were still furious  i think we might help them with a butlet whispered baker  it might frighten them perhaps but it would save them a good deal of trouble  wait a little longer replied gregory  i have it in my mind to astonish them  you see they have wounded the female very badly but when the male dies which he cannot now be long of doing she will dive and make off and so theyll lose her for they dont seem to have another harpoon and line  perhaps they have one behind the hummocks suggested davy butts whose teeth were chattering in his head with cold  if they had they would have used it long ago said gregory  at any rate i mean to carry out my planwhich is this  when the bull is about dead i will fire at the female and try to hit her in a deadly part so as to kill her at once  then sam you will run out with our harpoon and dart into her to prevent her sinking or diving if she should not be killed  and you davy will follow me and be ready with a musket  this plan had just been settled when the bull walrus began to show signs of approaching death  gregory therefore took a deliberate aim with the rifle and fired  the result was startling  the female walrus began to roll and lash about furiously smashing the ice and covering the sea around with bloody foam  at first the eskimos stood motionlessrooted to the spot as if they had been thunderstruck  but when they saw sam baker dart from behind the hummock flourishing his harpoon followed by gregory and butts their courage deserted them they turned in terror and fled  on getting behind the hummocks however they halted and peeped over the ledges of ice to see what the seamen did  sam baker being an old whaleman darted his harpoon cleverly and held fast the struggling animal  at the same time davy butts seized the end of the line which the natives had thrown down in terror and held on to the bull  it was almost dead and quite unable to show any more fight seeing that all was right gregory now laid down his rifle and advanced slowly to the hummock behind which the eskimos had taken refuge  he knew from the reports of previous travellers that holding up both arms is a sign of peace with the eskimos  he therefore stopped when within a short distance of the hummocks and held up his arms  the signal was understood at once  the natives leaped upon the top of the hummock and held up their arms in reply  again gregory tossed up his and made signs to them to draw near  this they did without hesitation and the doctor shook them by the hand and patted their hairy shoulders they were all of them stout wellmade fellows about five feet seven or eight inches high and very broad across the shoulders  they were fat too and oilyfaced jollylooking men  they smiled and talked to each other for a few moments and then spoke to gregory but when he shook his head as much as to say i dont understand you they burst into a loud laugh  then they suddenly became grave and ran at full speed toward the hole where the walrus floated  davy butts made the usual sign of friendship and handed them the end of their line which they seized and set about securing their prize without taking any farther notice of their new friends  the manner in which these wild yet goodnatured fellows hauled the enormous carcass out of the water was simple and ingenious  they made four cuts in the neck about two inches apart from each other and raised the skin between these cuts thus making two bands  through one of these bands they passed a line and carried it to a stick made fast in the ice where they passed it through a loop of wellgreased hide it was then carried back to the animal made to pass under the second band and the end was hauled in by the eskimos  this formed a sort of double purchase that enabled them to pull out of the hole a carcass which double their numbers could not have hauled up  some idea of the bulls weight may be formed when i say that the carcass was eighteen feet long and eleven feet in circumference at the thickest part  there were no fewer than sixty deep lancewounds in various parts of its body  when seen close at hand the walrus is a very ugly monster  it is something like a gigantic seal having two large flippers or fins near its shoulders and two others behind that look like its tail  it uses these in swimming but can also use them on land so as to crawl or rather to bounce forward in a clumsy fashion  by means of its foreflippers it can raise itself high out of the water and get upon the ice and rocks  it is fond of doing this and is often found sleeping in the sunshine on the ice and on rocks  it has even been known to scramble up the side of an island to a height of a hundred feet and there lie basking in the sun  nevertheless the water is the proper element of the walrus  all its motions are clumsy and slow until it gets into the sea there it is at home  its upper face has a square bluff look and its broad muzzle and cheeks are covered by a coarse beard of bristles like quills  the two white tusks point downward  in this they are unlike to those of the elephant  the tusks of the bull killed on this occasion were thirty inches long  the hide of the walrus is nearly an inch thick and is covered with close short hair  beneath the skin he has a thick layer of fat and this enables him to resist the extreme cold in the midst of which he dwells  the walrus is of great value to the eskimos  but for it and the seal these poor members of the human family could not exist at all in those frozen regions  as it is it costs them a severe struggle to keep the life in their bodies  but they do not complain of what seems to us a hard lot  they have been born to it  they know no happier condition of life  they wish for no better home and the allwise creator has fitted them admirably both in mind and body to live and even to enjoy life in a region where most other men could live only in great discomfort if they could exist at all  the eskimos cut the walrus thick hide into long lines with which they huntas we have seen  they do not cut these lines in strips and join them in many places but beginning at one end of the skin they cut round and round without break to the centre and thus secure a line of many fathoms in length  it is truly said that necessity is the mother of invention  these natives have no wood  not a single tree grows in the whole land of which i am writing  there are plenty of plants grasses mosses and beautiful flowers in summergrowing too close beside icefields that remain unmelted all the year round  but there is not a tree large enough to make a harpoon of  consequently the eskimos are obliged to make sledges of bones and as the bones and tusks of the walrus are not big enough for this purpose they tie and piece them together in a remarkably neat and ingenious manner  sometimes indeed they find pieces of driftwood in the sea  wrecks of whaleships too are occasionally found by the natives in the south of greenland  a few pieces of the precious wood obtained in this way are exchanged from one tribe to another and so find their way north  but the further north we go the fewer pieces of this kind of wood do we find and in the far north where our adventurous voyagers were now icebound the eskimos have very little wood indeed  food is the chief object which the eskimo has in view when he goes out to do battle with the walrus  its flesh is somewhat coarse no doubt but it is excellent nourishing food notwithstanding and although a wellfed englishman might turn up his nose at it many starving englishmen have smacked their lips over walrusbeef in days gone by aye and have eaten it raw too with much delight  let not my reader doubt the truth of this  wellknown and truthloving men have dwelt for a time in those regions and some of these have said that they actually came to prefer the walrus flesh raw because it was more strengthening and fitted them better for undertaking long and trying journeys in extremely cold weather  one of the most gallant men who ever went to the polar seas dr kane of the american navy tells us in his delightful book arctic explorations that he frequently ate raw flesh and liked it and that the eskimos often eat it raw  in fact they are not particular  they will eat it cooked or rawjust as happens to be most convenient for them  when the animals whose killing i have described were secured the eskimos proceeded to skin and cut them up  the sailors of course assisted and learned a lesson  while this was going on one of their number went away for a short time and soon returned with a sledge drawn by about a dozen dogs  this they loaded with the meat and hide of the bull intending evidently to leave the cow to their new friends as being their property  but gregory thought they were entitled to a share of it so after loading his sledge with a considerable portion of the meat he gave them the remainder along with the hide  this pleased them mightily and caused them to talk much though to little purpose  however gregory made good use of the language of signs  he also delighted them with the gift of a brass ring an old knife and a broken pencilcase and made them understand that his abode was not far distant by drawing the figure of a walrus in a hole in the snow and then a thing like a beehive at some distance from it pointing northward at the same time  he struck a harpoon into the outline of the walrus to show that it was the animal that had just been killed and then went and lay down in the picture of the beehive to show that he dwelt there  the natives understood this quite well  they immediately drew another beehive pointed to the south and to the sun and held up five fingers from this it was understood that their village was five days distant from the spot where they then were  he next endeavored to purchase three of their dogs but they objected to this and refused to accept of three knives as a price for them  they were tempted however by the offer of a whale harpoon and a hemp line and at last agreed to let him have three of their best dogs  this the young doctor considered a piece of great good fortune and being afraid that they would repent he prepared to leave the place at once  the dogs were fastened by lines to the sledge of their new masters  a whip was made out of a strip of walrus hide a bone served for a handle and away they went for the brig at a rattling pace after bidding the natives farewell and making them understand that they hoped to meet again in the course of the winter  thus happily ended their first meeting with the eskimos  it may well be believed that there were both astonishment and satisfaction on board the hope that night when the hunting party returned much sooner than had been expected with the whip cracking the men cheering the dogs howling and the sledge well laden with fresh meat    chapter eight  the cause of icebergsfoxchasea bear  one day long after the walrushunt just described joe davis stood on the deck of the hope leaning over the side and looking out to seaat least in the direction of the sea for although midday it was so dark that he could not see very far in any direction  joe was conversing with mr dicey on the appearance of things around him  do you know mr dicey said he wot it is as causes them there icebergs  mr dicey looked very grave and wise for a few seconds without answering  then he said in rather a solemn tone well davis to tell you the real truth i dont know  now as this question is one of considerable interest i shall endeavour to answer it for the benefit of the reader  the whole of the interior of greenland is covered with ice and snow this snowy covering does not resemble that soft snow which falls on our own hills  it is hard and never melts entirely away  the snow there is in some places a thousand feet thick  it covers all the hilltops and fills up all the valleys so that the country may be said to be a buried land  since the world began perhaps snow has been falling on it every winter but the summers there have been so short that they could not melt away the snow of one winter before that of another came and covered it up and pressed it down  thus for ages the snow of one year has been added to that which was left of the preceding and the pressure has been so great that the mass has been squeezed nearly as hard as pure ice  the ice that has been formed in this way is called glacier and the glaciers of greenland cover as i have said the whole country so that it can never be cultivated or inhabited by man unless the climate change  there are glaciers of this kind in many other parts of the world  we have them in switzerland and in norway but not on nearly so large a scale as in greenland  now although this glacierice is clear and hard it is not quite so solid as pure ice and when it is pushed down into the valleys by the increasing masses above it actually flows  but this flowing motion cannot be seen  it is like the motion of the hour hand of a watch which cannot be perceived however closely it may be looked at  you might go to one of the valleys of greenland and gaze at a glacier for days together but you would see no motion whatever  all would appear solid frozen up and still  but notice a block of stone lying on the surface of the glacier and go back many months after and you will find the stone lying a little further down the valley than when you first saw it  thus glaciers are formed and thus they slowly move  but what has all this to do with icebergs  we shall see  as the great glaciers of the north then are continually moving down the valleys of course their ends are pushed into the sea  these ends or tongues are often hundreds of feet thick  in some places they present a clear glittering wall to the sea of several hundreds of feet in height with perhaps as much again lost to view down in the deep water  as the extremities of these tongues are shoved farther and farther out they chip off and float away  these chips are icebergs i have already said that icebergs are sometimes miles in extentlike islands that they sink seven or eight hundred feet below the surface while their tops rise more than a hundred feet above itlike mountains if these then are the chips of the greenland glaciers what must the old blocks be  many a long and animated discussion the sailors had that winter in the cabin of the hope on the subject of ice and icebergs  when the dark nights drew on little or nothing could be done outside by our voyagers and when the ice everywhere closed up all the animals forsook them except polar bears so that they ran short of fresh provisions  as months of dreary darkness passed away the scurvy that terrible disease began to show itself among the men their bodies became less able to withstand the cold and it was difficult for them at last to keep up their spirits  but they fought against their troubles bravely  captain harvey knew well that when a mans spirits go he is not worth much  he therefore did his utmost to cheer and enliven those around him  one day for instance he went on deck to breathe a mouthful of fresh air  it was about eleven in the forenoon and the moon was shining brightly in the clear sky  the stars too and the aurora borealis helped to make up for the total absence of the sun  the cold air cut like a knife against his face when he issued from the hatchway and the cold nose of one of the dogs immediately touched his hand as the animal gambolled round him with delight for the extreme severity of the weather began to tell on the poor dogs and made them draw more lovingly to their human companions  ho hallo shouted the captain down the hatchway  a foxchase a foxchase  tumble up all hands  the men were sitting at the time in a very dull and silent mood  they were much cast down for as it had been cloudy weather for some weeks past thick darkness had covered them night and day so that they could not tell the one from the other except by the help of their watches which were kept carefully going  their journals also were written up daily otherwise they must certainly have got confused in their time altogether  in consequence of this darkness the men were confined almost entirely to the cabin for a time  those who had scurvy got worse those who were well became gloomy  even pepper who was a tremendous joker held his tongue and joe davis who was a great singer became silent  jim crofts was in his bunk down with the scurvy and stout sam baker who was a capital teller of stories could not pluck up spirit enough to open his mouth  in fact as mr dicey said they all had a most orrible fit o the blues  the captain and officers were in better health and spirits than the men though they all fared alike at the same table and did the same kind of work whatever that might chance to be the officers however were constantly exerting themselves to cheer the men and i have no doubt that this very effort of theirs was the means of doing good to themselves  he that watereth others shall be watered says the word of god  i take this to meanhe that does good to others shall get good to himself  so it certainly was with the officers of the hope  when the captains shout reached the cabin jim crofts had just said ill tell ee what it is messmates if this here state of things goes on much longer ill go out on the floes walk up to the first polar bear i meet and ask him to take his supper off me  there was no laugh at this but pepper remarked in a quiet way that he neednt put himself to so much trouble for he was such a palefaced disagreeable looking object that no bear would eat him unless it was starving  well then ill offer myself to a starvin bearto one thats amost dead with hunger retorted jim gloomily  whats that the capen is singin out said davy butts who was mending a pair of canvas shoes  the men roused themselves at once for the hope of anything new turning up excited them  hallo ho roared the captain again in a voice that might have started a dead walrus  tumble up therea foxchase  ill give my secondbest furcoat to the man that catches foxey  in one instant the whole crew were scrambling up the ladder  even jim crofts who was really ill rolled out of his bunk and staggered on deck saying he would have a go after foxey if he should die for it  the game of fox is simple  one man is chosen to be the fox  he runs off and the rest follow  they are bound to go wherever the fox leads in this case it was arranged that the fox should run round the deck until he should be caught then the man who caught him should become fox and continue running on with all the rest following until he in turn should be caught and so on until the one who could run longest and fastest should break down all the rest  the warm furcoat was a prize worth running for in such a cold climate so the game began with spirit  young gregory offered to be fox first and away they went with a yell  mr mansell was a little lame and soon gave in  mr dicey fell at the second round and was unable to recover distance  gregory would certainly have gained the coat for he was strong and had been a crack racer at school but he did not want the coat so allowed sam baker to catch him  sam held on like a deer for a few minutes and one after another the men dropped off as they were blown  jim crofts poor fellow made a gallant burst but his limbs refused to help his spirit he fell and was assisted below by the captain and replaced in his bunk where however he felt the benefit of his efforts  the race was now kept up by sam baker joe davis and butts  these three were struggling on and panting loudly while their comrades danced about clapped their mittened hands and shouted now then samgo in and win joebutts forever and suchlike encouraging cries  to the surprise of everyone davy butts came off the winner and for many a day after that enjoyed the warm coat which he said his long legs had gained for him  this effort of the captain to cheer the men was very successful so he resolved to follow it up with an attempt at private theatricals accordingly this thing was proposed and heartily agreed to  next day everyone was busy making preparations  tom gregory agreed to write a short play  sam baker being the healthiest man on board was willing to act the part of an invalid old lady and jim crofts consented to become a gay young doctor for that occasion  meanwhile the captain arranged a piece of real work for he felt that the attempt to keep up the spirits alone would not do  they had been for a long time living on salt provisions  nothing could restore the crew but fresh meatyet fresh meat was not to be had  the walrus and deer were gone and although foxes and bears were still around them they had failed in all their attempts to shoot or trap any of these animals  a visit to the eskimo camp therefore if such a camp really existed became necessary so while the theatricals were in preparation a small sledge was rigged up gregory and sam baker were chosen to go with him the dogs were harnessed and on a fine starry forenoon away they went to the south at full gallop with three hearty cheers from the crew of the brig who were left in charge of the first mate  the journey thus undertaken was one full of risk  it was not known how far distant the natives might be or where they were likely to be found the weather was intensely cold  only a small quantity of preserved meat could be takenfor the rest they trusted in some measure to their guns  but the captains great hope was to reach the eskimo village in a day or two at the farthest  if he should fail to do so the prospect of himself and his crew surviving the remainder of the long winter was he felt very gloomy indeed  success attended this expedition at the very beginning  they had only been eight hours out when they met a bear sitting on its haunches behind a hummock  hallo look out cried gregory on catching sight of him fire lads said the captain im not quite ready  gregory fired and the bear staggered  baker then fired and it fell  this was a blessing which filled their hearts so full of thankfulness that they actually shook hands with each other and then gave vent to three hearty cheers  their next thoughts were given to their comrades in the hope  you and baker will camp here tom said the captain and i will return to the brig with a sledgeload of the meat  when ive put it aboard ill come straight back to you  well keep a ham for ourselves of course  now then to work  to work the three men went  a hind leg of the bear was cut off the rest was lashed firmly on the sledge and the dogs enjoyed a feed while this was being done  then the captain cracked his whip  goodbye lads goodbye captain and away he and the dogs and sledge went and were soon lost to view among the hummocks of the frozen sea    chapter nine  a visit to the eskimoswonderful doingsa mystery  the proceedings of this sledge party were so interesting that i give them in the words of tom gregorys journal  sundaywe have indeed cause to rejoice and to thank god for his mercies this morning  last night we shot a bear and the captain is away with the carcass of it to our poor scurvysmitten friends in the hope  this sunday will be a real day of rest for me and sam baker though our restingplace is a very queer one  after the captain left us we looked about for a convenient place to encamp and only a few yards from the spot where we killed the bear we found the ruins of an old eskimo hut made partly of stones partly of ice  we set to work to patch it up with snow and made it perfectly airtight in about two hours  into this we carried our bearskins and things spread them on the snowy floor put a lump of bears fat into our tin travelling lamp and prepared supper  we were not particular about the cookery  we cut a couple of huge slices off our bears ham half roasted them over the lamp and began  it was cut roast and come again for the next hour and a half  i positively never knew what hunger was until i came to this savage country  and i certainly never before had any idea of how much i could eat at one sitting  this hearty supper was washed down with a swig of melted snowwater we had some coffee with us but were too tired to infuse it  then we blocked up the door with snow rolled our bearskins round us and were sound asleep in five minutes  lucky for us that we were so careful to stop up every hole with snow for during the night the wind rose and it became so intensely cold that baker and i could scarcely keep each other warm enough to sleep tired though we were  at this moment my fingers are so stiff that they will hardly hold the pencil with which i write and the gale is blowing so furiously outside that we dare not open the door  this door by the way is only a hole big enough to creep through  the captain cannot travel today  he knows we are safe so i will not expect him  i have brought my small testament with me  it has hitherto been my constant travelling companion  i am thus provided with mental food  but in truth i shall not want much of that for the next twelve hours  rest rest rest is what we require  no one can imagine how a man can enjoy rest after he has been for many months exposed to constant exhausting heartbreaking toil with the thermometer always below zero and with nothing but salt food to keep him alive  tuesday nighthere we are at lastamong the eskimos and what a queer set they are to be sure  all fat and fur  they look as broad as they are long  they wear short fox and sealskin coats or shirts with hoods to then no trousers but long boots that come up and meet the coats  women men and babies all dressed alike or nearly so  the only difference is that the womens boots are longer and wider than those of the men  but i forgotyes there is one other difference the women have tails to their coats the men have none  real tailsnot like the broad skirts of our dresscoats but long narrow tails something like the tail of a cow with a broadish flap at the end of it this they evidently look upon as a handsome ornament for i observe that when they go off on a journey each woman buttons her tail up to her waist to keep it out of the way and when she returns she unbuttons it and comes into camp with her tail flowing gracefully behind her  we had a terrible journey of it down here  the captain returned to us on monday morning early and the next two days we spent struggling over the hummocks and out upon the floes  it was so cold that the wind cut into our very marrow  we have all had our faces frozen more or less but not badly  baker will have an ugly spot on the end of his nose for some weeks to come  it is getting black now and as the nose itself is bright red and much swelled his appearance is not improved  i foolishly tried to eat a little snow yesterday morning and the consequence is that my lips are sore and bloody  on monday afternoon the dogs and sledge went head over heels into a deep rut in the ice and it cost us two hours to get them out again  luckily no damage was done although the captain was on the sledge at the time  we had almost despaired of finding the village when we came upon a sledge track that led us straight up to it  i shall never forget the beauty of the scene on our arrival  the sky was lighted up with the most beautiful aurora i have yet seen in these regions  stars spangled the sky in millions  great icebergs rose in wild confusion in the distance and all along the shore for a few hundred yards were clusters of snowhuts  they looked exactly like beehives  i have seen many a strange house but the strangest of all is certainly a house of snow today i was fortunate enough to see one built  it was done very neatly  the hard snow was cut into slabs with a wooden knife  these were piled one above another in regular order and cemented with snow as bricks are with lime  the form of the wall was circular and the slabs were so shaped that they sloped inwards thus forming a dome or large beehive with a keystone slab in the top to keep all firm  a hole was then cut in the side for a doorjust large enough to admit of a man creeping through  in front of this door a porch or passage of snow was built  the only way of getting into the hut is by creeping on hands and knees along the passage  a hole was also cut in the roof into which was inserted a piece of clear ice to serve for a window  the natives received us with wild surprise and i found my old friends the walrushunters among them  they were remarkably friendly  one stout middleaged fellow invited us to his hut  i am now seated in it beside the eskimos wife who would be a goodlooking woman if she were not so fat dirty and oily  but we cannot expect people living in this fashion and in such a country to be very clean  although the hut is white outside it is by no means white inside  they cook all their food over an oillamp which also serves to heat the place and it is wonderful how warm a house of snow becomes  the cold outside is so great as to prevent the walls melting inside  besides myouk our host and his wife there are two of the mans sisters two lads two girls and a baby in the hut  also six dogs  the whole of themmen women children and dogs are as fat as they can be for they have been successful in walrushunting of late  no wonder that the perspiration is running down my face  the natives feel the heat too for they are all halfnakedthe baby entirely so but they seem to like it  what a chattering to be sure  i am trying to take notes and myouks wife is staring at me with her mouth wide open  it is a wonder she can open her eyes at all her cheeks are so fat  the captain is trying by the language of signs to get our host to understand that we are much in want of fresh meat  sam baker is making himself agreeable to the young people and the plan he has hit upon to amuse them is to show them his watch and let them hear it tick  truly i have seldom seen a happier family group than this eskimo household under their snowy roof  there is to be a grand walrushunt tomorrow  we shall accompany them and see whether our endurance on a long march and our powers with the rifle cannot impress them with some respect for us  at present they have not much  they seem to think us a palefaced set of helpless creatures  wednesday nightwe have just returned from the hunt and a tremendous hunt it was  six walrus and two bears have been killed and the whole village is wild with delight  cooking is going on in every hut  but they have no patience  nearly everyone is munching away at a lump of raw walrus flesh  all their faces are more or less greasy and bloody  even myouks babythough not able to speakis choking itself with a long stringy piece of blubber  the dogs too have got their share  an eskimos chief happiness seems to be in eating and i cannot wonder at it for the poor creatures have hard work to get food and they are often on the verge of starvation  what a dirty set they are  i shall never forget the appearance of myouks hut when we entered it this evening after returning from the hunt  the mans wife had made the wick of her stone lamp as long as possible in order to cook a large supper  there were fifteen people crowded together in this hive of snow and the heat had induced them to throw off the greater part of their clothing  every hand had a greasy lump of bear or walrus meat in it every mouth was in full occupation and every fat face of man woman and child was beaming with delight and covered with dirt and oil  the captain and i looked at each other and smiled as we entered and sam baker laughed outright  this set all the natives laughing too  we did not much relish the idea of supping and sleeping in such a place but necessity has no law  we were hungry as hawks desperately tired and the temperature outside is 35 degrees below zero  the first duty of the night is now over  we have supped  the natives will continue to eat the greater part of the night  they eat till they fall asleep if they chance to awake they eat again  half of them are asleep now and snoring  the other half are eating slowly for they are nearly full the heat and smell are awful  i am perspiring at every pore  we have taken off as much of our clothes as decency will permit  sam has on a pair of trousersnothing more  i am in the same state  there is little room as may be supposed  we have to lie huddled up as we best can and a strange sight we are as the red light of the flaring lamp falls on us  at this moment myouks wife is cutting a fresh steak  the youngest boy is sound asleep with a lump of fat between his teeth  the captain is also sound with his legs sprawling over the limbs of half a dozen slumbering natives  he is using the baby as a pillow  it is curious to think that these poor creatures always live in this way sometimes feasting sometimes starving  freezing out on the floes stewing under their roofs of snow  usually fat for the most part jolly always dirty  it is sad too to think of this for it is a low condition for human beings to live in  they seem to have no religion at all  certainly none that is worthy of the name  i am much puzzled when i think of the difficulties in the way of introducing christianity among these northern eskimos  no missionary could exist in such a climate and in such circumstances  it is with the utmost difficulty that hardy seamen can hold out for a year even with a shipload of comforts  but this is too deep a subject to write about tonight  i cant keep my eyes open  i will therefore close my notebook and lie down to sleepperhaps to be suffocated  i hope not  accordingly our young friend the doctor did lie down to sleep and got through the night without being suffocated  indeed he slept so soundly that captain harvey could scarcely rouse him next morning  hallo  tom  tom cried he loudly at the same time shaking his nephews arm violently  aye eh and a tremendous yawn from tom  what now uncle  time to rise is it  where am i  time to rise replied the captain laughing  i should think it is why its past eleven in the forenoon  the stars are bright and the sky clear  the aurora too is shining  come get up  the natives are all outside watching sam while he packs our sledge  the ladies are going about the camp whisking their tails and whacking their babies in great glee for it is not every day they enjoy such a feed as they had last night  in half an hour they were ready  the whole village turned out to see them start  myouk with his wife oomia and the baby and his son meetek accompanied them to refuge harbour  oomias baby was part of herself  she could not move without it  it was always naked but being stuffed into the hood of its mothers furcoat it seemed always warm  i say tom whats that up in the sky said captain harvey suddenly after they had been driving for a couple of hours  its the strangest looking thing i ever did see  so it is replied gregory gazing intently at the object in question which seemed high up in the air  it cant be a comet because it gives no light  perhaps not but it has got a tail thats a fact said baker in a voice of surprise  who ever heard of a dark fourcornered star with a tail  if i had seen it in daylight and in merry england i would have said it was a kite  a kite nonsense cried the captain what in the world can it be  reader you shall find that out in the next chapter    chapter ten  the tale of a kitea great bearfight  when mr mansell was left in charge of the brig a heavy weight lay on his heart and he could by no means take part in the preparations for the theatricals which occupied the rest of the crew  he felt that life or death depended on the success of the captain in his search for fresh meat  already most of the men were ill with scurvy and some of them were alarmingly low  nothing could save them but fresh meat and when the first mate thought of the difficulties and dangers of a journey on the floes in such weather and the uncertainty of the eskimos being discovered his heart misgave him  about an hour after the departure of captain harvey on the monday morning he took davy butts aside  davy said he youve been at work on these kites a long time  are they nearly finished  quite finished sir answered butts  then get them up for there is a good breeze  i shall try them on our small sledges  it will at least stir up and amuse the men  ten minutes after this the crew were summoned on deck to witness an experiment  a small dog sledge lay on the hard snow beside the vessel and near to this davy butts and mr dicey were holding on to a stout line at the end of which an enormous kite was pulling  this kite was square in shape made of the thickest brown paper and nearly six feet across  that its power was great was evident from the difficulty with which the two men held it  the end of the line was fastened to the sledge  now boys ease off line till it is taut and then wait for the word said davy butts jumping on to the sledge  now  let go  away went the sledge over the hard snow at the rate of three miles an hour which soon increased to double that rate  davy cheered and waved his arms  the men gave one loud hurrah of surprise and delight and set off in mad pursuit  they were soon left behind  hold on davy goodbye butts  look out mind the ridge  the last warning was needful  the sledge was rushing furiously toward a long ridge of ice which rose in a sharp slope to a height of three feet and descended on the other side to an equal depth but without any slope  davy saw his danger but he did not dare to put out foot or hand to check his progress  even if he had it would have been of no use  up the slope he went as a seagull skims over a wave for one moment he was in the airthe next he came down with a crash that nearly dislocated all his joints and his teeth came together with a loud snap  by good fortune his tongue was not between them  the sledge was a strong one and the thing was done so quickly and neatly that it did not upset  but now a large and rugged hummock lay right before him  to go against that would have been certain death so davy made up his mind at once and jumped off at the smoothest part of the floe he could find  the lightened sledge sprang away like a rocket and was brought up with a sudden jerk by the hummock  of course the line broke and the kite commenced to descend  it twirled and circled violently round and at last went crash into an iceberg where it was broken to pieces  not so bad for a beginning said mansell as poor davy came back looking very crestfallen  now butts come below  you have proved that the thing will do  mr dicey get yourself ready for a trip over the ice  let three men prepare to accompany you  i shall send you off tomorrow  dicey much surprised went off to obey these orders and mansell with the assistance of butts fitted the second kite for the intended journey  he made a rough guess at the strength of its pull and loaded the sledge accordingly  two tail ropes were fastened to the last bar of the sledge for the men to hold on by and check its speed  a sort of anchor was made by which it could be stopped at any moment and two stout poles with iron claws at the end of them were prepared for scraping over the snow and checking the pace  next day all was ready  a trial was made and the thing found to work admirably  the trial trip over they bade their comrades farewell and away they went due south in the direction where the native village was supposed to be  it was this remarkable towhorse that had filled captain harvey and his companions with so much surprise  the appearance of the sledge immediately after with a shout and a cheer from dicey and the men explained the mystery  being so near the eskimo camp they at once returned to it in order to allow the newly arrived party to rest as well as to load their sledge with as much fresh meat as it could carry for which supplies the captain took care to pay the natives with a few knives and a large quantity of hoopironarticles that were much more valuable to them than gold  as the wind could not be made to turn about to suit their convenience the kite was brought down and given to davy to carry and a team of native dogs were harnessed to the sledge instead  on the following day the united party set out on their return to the brig which they reached in safety  tom gregorys account of the eskimos who accompanied them to their wooden home is amusing  his journal runs thus  the amazement of our visitors is very great  myouk his wife and baby and his son meetek are now our guests  when they first came in sight of the brig they uttered a wild shoutthe men did so at leastand tossed their arms and opened their eyes and mouths  they have never shut them since  they go all round the vessel staring and gaping with amazement  we have given them a number of useful presents and intend to send them home loaded with gifts for their friends  it is necessary to make a good impression on them  our lives depend very much on the friendship of these poor people  we find that they are terrible thieves  a number of knives and a hatchet were missedthey were found hidden in myouks sledge  we tried to prevail on oomia to sell her long boots  to our surprise she was quite willing to part with one but nothing would induce her to give up the other  one of the men observed her steal a knife out of the cabin and hide it in the leg of her boot  the reason was now plain  we pulled off the boot without asking leave and found there a large assortment of articles stolen from us  two or three knives a spoon a bit of hoopiron and a marline spike  i have tried to make them understand by signs that this is very wicked conduct but they only laugh at me  they are not in the least ashamed and evidently regard stealing as no sin  we have shot a musk ox  there are many of these creatures in other parts of the arctic regions but this is the first we have seen here he fell to my rifle and is now being devoured by ourselves and our dogs with great relish  he is about the size of a very small cow has a large head and enormously thick horns which cover the whole top of his head bend down toward his cheeks and then curve up and outward at the point  he is covered with long brown hair which almost reaches the ground and has no tail worthy of the name  he seems to be an active and an angry creature  when i wounded him he came at me furiously but had not pluck to charge home  as he turned away i gave him the shot that killed him  the meat is not bad but it smells strongly of musk walrus is better  myouk and his son meetek and i have had a most exciting bearhunt since we returned  i followed these men one day as i thought them bold activelooking fellows who would be likely to show me good eskimo sport  and i was not disappointed  about two miles from the brig we came on fresh bear tracks  a glow of the aurora gave us plenty of light  what is yon round white lump thought i  a bear  no it must be a snowwreath  myouk did not think so for he ran behind a lump of ice and became excited  he made signs to me to remain there while he and his son should go and attack the bear  they were armed each with a long lance  i must say when i remembered the size and strength of the polar bear that i was surprised to find these men bold enough to attack him with such arms  i had my rifle but determined not to use it except in case of necessity  i wished to see how the natives were accustomed to act  they were soon ready  gliding swiftly from one lump of ice to another they got near enough to make a rush  i was disobedient  i followed and when the rush was made i was not far behind them  the bear was a very large one  it uttered an angry growl on seeing the men running toward it and rose on its hind legs to receive them  it stood nearly eight feet high when in this position and looked really a terrible monster  i stood still behind a hummock at a distance of about fifty yards with my rifle ready  on coming close up the father and son separated and approached the bear one on each side  this divided his attention and puzzled him very much for when he made a motion as if he were going to rush at myouk meetek flourished his spear and obliged him to turnthen myouk made a demonstration and turned him back again  thus they were enabled to get close to its side before it could make up its mind which to attack  but the natives soon settled the question for it  myouk was on the bears right side meetek on its left  the father pricked it with the point of his lance  a tremendous roar followed and the enraged animal turned towards him  this was just what he wanted because it gave the son an opportunity of making a deadly thrust  meetek was not slow to do it he plunged his lance deep into the bears heart and it fell at once at full length while a crimson stream poured out of the wound upon the snow  while this fight was going on i might have shot the animal through the heart with great ease for it was quite near to me and when it got up on its hind legs its broad chest presented a fine target  it was difficult to resist the temptation to fire but i wished to see the native manner of doing the thing from beginning to end so did not interfere  i was rewarded for my selfdenial  half an hour later while we were dragging the carcass toward the brig we came unexpectedly upon another bear  myouk and meetek at once grasped their lances and ran forward to attack him  i now resolved to play them a trick  besides my rifle i carried a large horsepistol in my belt  this i examined and finding it all right i followed close at the heels of the eskimos  bruin got up on his hind legs as before and the two men advanced close to him  i stopped when within thirty yards cocked my rifle and stood ready  myouk was just going to thrust with his lance whenbang went my rifle  the bear fell  it was shot right through the heart but it struggled for some time after that  the natives seemed inclined to run away when they heard the shot but i laughed and made signs of friendship  then i went close up and shot the bear through the head with my pistol  this affair has filled my savage companions with deep respect for me  these two bears were the last they obtained that winter but as a good supply of meat had been obtained from the eskimos they were relieved from anxiety for the time and the health of the men began to improve a little  but this happy state of things did not last till spring  these sorely tried men were destined to endure much suffering before the light of the sun came back to cheer their drooping spirits    chapter eleven  christmas timedeathreturn of light and hopedisasters and final deliverance  christmas came at last but with it came no bright sun to remind those icebound men of our saviourthe sun of righteousnesswhose birth the day commemorated  it was even darker than usual in refuge harbour on that christmasday  it was so dark at noon that one could not see any object more than a few yards distant from the eyes  a gale of wind from the norwest blew the snowdrift in whirling ghostlike clouds round the hope so that it was impossible to face it for a moment  so intense was the cold that it felt like sheets of fire being driven against the face  truly it was a day well fitted to have depressed the heartiest of men  but man is a wonderful creature not easy to comprehend  the very things that ought to have cast down the spirits of the men of the hope were the things that helped to cheer them  about this time as i have said the health of the crew had improved a little so they were prepared to make the most of everything  those feelings of kindliness and goodwill which warm the breasts of all rightminded men at this season of the year filled our arctic voyagers to overflowing  thoughts of home came crowding on them with a power that they had not felt at other times  each man knew that on this day more than any other day of that long dark winter the talk round a wellknown hearth in merry england would be of one who was far far away in the dark regions of ice and snow  a tear or two that could not be forced back tumbled over rough cheeks which were not used to that kind of salt water and many a silent prayer went up to call down a blessing on the heads of dear ones at home  it blew great guns outside as baker said but what of that it was a dead calm in the cabin  it was dark as a coalhole on the floes  what then it was bright as noonday in the hope  no sun blazed through the skylight to be sure but a lamp filled with fat glared on the table and a great fire of coal glowed in the stove  both of these together did not make the place too warm but there were furcoats and trousers and boots to help defy the cold  the men were few in number and not likely to see many friends on that christmasday  all the more reason why they should make the most of each other  besides they were wrong in their last idea about friends for it chanced on that very day that myouk the eskimo paid them a visitquite ignorant of its being christmas of course  meetek was with him and so was oomia and so was the babythat remarkably fat oily naked baby that seemed rather to enjoy the cold than otherwise  they had a plumpudding that day  butts said it was almost as big as the head of a walrus  they had also a roast of beefwalrusbeef of courseand firstrate it was  but before dinner the captain made them go through their usual morning work of cleaning airing making beds posting journals noting temperatures opening the firehole and redding up  for the captain was a great believer in the value of discipline  he knew that no man enjoys himself so much as he who has got through his work earlywho has done his duty  it did not take them long and when it was done the captain said now boys we must be jolly today  as we cant get out we must take some exercise indoors we shall need extra appetite to make away with that plumpudding  so at it they went  every sort of game or feat of strength known to sailors was played or attempted  it was in the middle of all this that myouk and his family arrived so they were compelled to join  even the fat baby was put into a blanket and swung round the cabin by jim croft to the horror of its mother who seemed to think it would be killed and to the delight of its father who didnt seem to care whether it was killed or not  then came the dinner  what a scene that was to be sure  it would take a whole book to describe all that was said and done that day  the eskimos ate till they could hardly standthat was their usual custom then they lay down and went to sleepthat was their usual custom too the rest ate as heartily poor fellows as was possible for men not yet quite recovered from scurvy  they had no wine but they had excellent coffee and with this they drank to absent friends sweethearts and wives and many other toasts the mere mention of which raised such strong homefeelings in their breasts that some of them almost choked in the attempt to cheer  then came songs and storiesall of them old very old indeedbut they came out on this occasion as good as new  the great event of the evening however was a fancy ball in which our friends butts baker gregory and pepper distinguished themselves they had a fiddle and dawkins the steward could play it  he knew nothing but scotch reels but what could have been better  they could all dance or if they could not they all tried  myouk and meetek were made to join and they capered as gracefully as polar bears which animals they strongly resembled in their hairy garments  late in the evening came supper  it was just a repetition of dinner with the remains of the pudding fried in bears grease  thus passed christmasday much in the same way passed new years day then the men settled down to their old style of life but the time hung so heavy on their hands that their spirits began to sink again  the long darkness became intolerable and the fresh meat began to fail everything with life seemed to have forsaken the place  the captain made another trip to the eskimo village and found the huts emptythe whole race had flown he knew not whither  the private theatricals were at first very successful but by degrees they lost their interest and were given up  then a school was started and gregory became head master  writing and arithmetic were the only branches taught  some of the men were much in need of instruction and all of them took to the school with energy and much delight  it lasted longer than the theatricals did  as time wore on the fresh meat was finished scurvy became worse and it was as much as the men who were not quite knocked down could do to attend to those who were  day after day tom and gregory and sam baker went out to hunt and each day returned emptyhanded  sometimes an arctic hare or a fox was got but not often at last rats were eaten as food  these creatures swarmed in the hold of the brig  they were caught in traps and shot with a bow and a bluntheaded arrow  but few of the men would eat them  the captain urged them to do so in vain  those who did eat kept in better health than those who did not  at last death came  mr mansell sank beneath the terrible disease and was buried on the island  no grave could be dug in that hard frozen soil  the burial service was read by his sorrowing comrades over his body which was frozen quite hard before they reached the grave and then they laid it in a tomb of ice  time hung heavier than ever after that  death is at all time a terrible visitant but in such a place and under such circumstances it was tenfold more awful than usual  the blank in so small a band was a great one  it would perhaps have depressed them more than it did had their own situation been less desperate  but they had too fierce a battle to fight with disease and the midnight gloom and the bitter frost to give way to much feeling about him who was gone  thus the long winter passed heavily away  the sun came back at last and when he came his beams shone upon a pale shattered and heartweary band of men  but with his cheering light came also hope and health soon followed in his train  let young gregorys journal tell the rest of our story little of which now remains to be told  february 21sti have to record with joy and gratitude that the sun shone on the peaks of the icebergs today  the first time it has done so since october last  by the end of this month we shall have his rays on deck  i climbed to the top of a berg and actually bathed in sunshine this forenoon  we are all quite excited by the event some of us even look jolly  ah what miserable faces my comrades have so pale so thin  we are all as weak as water  the captain and i are the strongest  baker is also pretty well  crofts and davis are almost useless the rest being quite helpless  the captain cooks baker and i hunt crofts and davis attend to the sick  another month of darkness would have killed the half of us  march 10thi shot a bear today  it did my heart good to see the faces of the men when i brought them the news and a piece of the flesh the cold is not quite so intense now  our coldest day this year has been the 17th of january  the glass stood at 67 degrees below zero on that morning  what a winter we have had  i shudder when i think of it but there is more cause to be anxious about what yet lies before us  a single bear will not last long  many weeks must pass before we are free  in june we hope to be released from our iceprison  fresh meat we shall then have in abundance  with it strength will return and then if god permits we shall attempt to continue our voyage northward the captain is confident on the point of open water round the pole the men are game for anything in spite of their sad condition  thus wrote gregory at that date  many weeks later we find him writing as follows  june 15thfree at last  the ice has been breaking up out at sea for some time past  it gave way in refuge harbour yesterday and we warped out in the night  everything is ready to push north again  we have been feeding heartily for many weeks on walrus seals wildfowl and last but not least on some grasses which make bad greens but they have put scurvy to flight  all the men are well and strong and fit for hard workthough nothing like what they were when we first came here could it be otherwise  there are some of us who will carry the marks of this winter to our graves  the bright beautiful sunshine shines now all day and all night cheering our hearts and inspiring hope  june 16thall is lost  how little we know what a day may bring forth  our good little brig is gone and we are here on the ice without a thing in the world except the clothes on our backs  i have saved my notebook which chanced to be in my breastpocket when the nip took place  how awfully sudden it was  we now appreciate the wise forethought of captain harvey in sending the large boat to forlornhope bay  this boat is our last and only hope  we shall have to walk forty miles before we reach it  our brig went down at three oclock this afternoon  we had warped out into the floes to catch a light breeze that was blowing outside  for some time we held on steadily to the northward but had not got out of sight of our winter quarters when a stream of ice set down upon us and closed in all around  at first we thought nothing of this having escaped so many dangers of the kind last autumn but by degrees the pressure increased alarmingly  we were jammed against a great icefield which was still fast to the shore  in a few moments the sides of our little vessel began to creak and groan loudly  the men laboured like tigers at the icepoles but in vain  we heard a loud report in the cabin  no one knows what it was but i suppose it must have been the breaking of a large bolt  at any rate it was followed by a series of crashes and reports that left no doubt in our minds as to what was going on  the ice was cracking the brig as if she had been a nutshell save yourselves lads cried the captain  one or two of the men made a rush to the hatchway intending to run below and save some of their things  i ran to the cabinladder in the hope of saving our logbook and journals but we all started back in horror for the deck at that moment burst open almost under our feet  i cast one glance down through the opening into the hold  that glance was sufficient  the massive timbers and beams were being crushed together doubled up split and shivered as if they had been rotten straws  in another moment i was on the ice where the whole crew were assembled looking on at the work of destruction in solemn silence  after bursting in the vessels sides the ice eased off and she at once began to settle down  we could hear the water rushing furiously into the hold  ten minutes later she was gone  thus end our hopes of farther discovery and we are now left to fight our way in an open boat to the settlements on the south coast of greenland  we have little time to think  prompt action must be our watchword now if we would escape from this world of ice  july 20thi have not entered a line in this journal since our vessel was lost  our work has been so severe and our sufferings so great that i have had no heart for writing  our walk to the place where we left the boat was a hard one but we were cheered by finding the boat all safe and the provisions and stores just as we left them there was not enough to last out the voyage but we had guns and powder it is in vain to attempt to describe the events of the last few weeks constant and hard and cold workat the oars with the icepoles warping hauling and shoving  beset by ice driving before storms detained by thick fogs often wet to the skin always tired almost starvingsuch has been our fate since that sad day when our brig went down  and yet i dont think there is one of our party who would not turn about on the spot and renew our voyage of discovery if he only got a chance of going in a wellappointed vessel  as it is we must push on  home home is our cry now  august 1stwe are now in clover after having been reduced to think of roasting our shoes for breakfast  for three days last week we ate nothing at all  our powder has been expended for some weeks past  on monday we finished our last morsel of the gull that pepper managed to bring down with a stone  tuesday was a terrible day  the agony of hunger was worse than i had expected it to be  nevertheless we tried hard to cheer each other as we laboured at the oars  our only hope was to fall in with natives  signs of them were seen everywhere and we expected to hear their shouts at every point of land we doubled  the captain suggested that we should try shoesoup on wednesday morning he was more than half in earnest but spoke as if he were jesting pepper cocked his ears as if there was some hope still of work for him to do in his own line  jim crofts pulled off his shoe and looking at it earnestly wondered if the sole would make a very tough chop  we all laughed but i cannot say that the laugh sounded hearty  on the thursday i began to feel weak but the pangs of hunger were not so bad our eyes seemed very large and wolfish  i could not help shuddering when i thought of the terrible things that men have done when reduced to this state  that evening as we rounded a point we saw an eskimo boy high on a cliff with a net in his hand  he did not see us for some time and we were so excited that we stopped rowing to watch him in breathless silence  thousands of birds were flying round his head among the cliffs  how often we had tried to kill some of these with sticks and stones in vain  the net he held was a round one with a long handle suddenly he made a dashing sweep with it and caught two of the birds as they passed  we now saw that a number of dead birds lay at his feet in one moment our boat was ashore and we scrambled up the cliffs in eager haste  the boy fled in terror but before he was well out of sight every man was seated on a ledge of rock with a bird at his mouth sucking the blood  hunger like ours despises cookery  it was fortunate that there were not many birds else we should have done ourselves harm by eating too much  i have eaten many a good meal in my life but never one so sweet or for which i was so thankful as that meal of raw birds devoured on the cliffs of greenland  that night we reached the eskimo village where we now lie  we find that it is only two days journey from this place to the danish settlements  there we mean to get on board the first ship that is bound for europeno matter what port she sails for  meanwhile we rest our weary limbs in peace for our dangers are past andthanks be to god we are saved    reader my tale is told  a little book cannot be made to contain a long story else would i have narrated many more of the strange and interesting events that befell our adventurers during that voyage  but enough has been
