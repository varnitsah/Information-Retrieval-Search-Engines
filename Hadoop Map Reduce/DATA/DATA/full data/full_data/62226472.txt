his way to a method the principles observed in its composition are no doubt too exclusively those in which mystery entanglement surprise and moral obliquity are depended on for exciting interest but some of the scenes and at least one of the characters have been deemed not unworthy of a little longer preservation and as they could hardly be reproduced in a fragmentary form the novel is reissued completethe more readily that it has for some considerable time been reprinted and widely circulated in america january 1889  to the foregoing note i have only to add that in the present edition of desperate remedies some wessex towns and other places that are common to the scenes of several of these stories have been called for the first time by the names under which they appear elsewhere for the satisfaction of any reader who may care for consistency in such matters  this is the only material change for as it happened that certain characteristics which provoked most discussion in my latest story were present in this my firstpublished in 1871 when there was no french name for them it has seemed best to let them stand unaltered  th february 1896     i the events of thirty years  1 december and january 183536  in the long and intricately inwrought chain of circumstance which renders worthy of record some experiences of cytherea graye edward springrove and others the first event directly influencing the issue was a christmas visit  in the abovementioned year 1835 ambrose graye a young architect who had just begun the practice of his profession in the midland town of hocbridge to the north of christminster went to london to spend the christmas holidays with a friend who lived in bloomsbury they had gone up to cambridge in the same year and after graduating together huntway the friend had taken orders  graye was handsome frank and gentle he had a quality of thought which exercised on homeliness was humour on nature picturesqueness on abstractions poetry being as a rule broadcast it was all three  of the wickedness of the world he was too forgetful to discover evil in a new friend is to most people only an additional experience to him it was ever a surprise  while in london he became acquainted with a retired officer in the navy named bradleigh who with his wife and their daughter lived in a street not far from russell square though they were in no more than comfortable circumstances the captains wife came of an ancient family whose genealogical tree was interlaced with some of the most illustrious and wellknown in the kingdom  the young lady their daughter seemed to graye by far the most beautiful and queenly being he had ever beheld she was about nineteen or twenty and her name was cytherea in truth she was not so very unlike country girls of that type of beauty except in one respect she was perfect in her manner and bearing and they were not a mere distinguishing peculiarity by catching the eye is often read as the pervading characteristic and she appeared to him no less than perfection throughouttranscending her rural rivals in very nature graye did a thing the blissfulness of which was only eclipsed by its hazardousness he loved her at first sight  his introductions had led him into contact with cytherea and her parents two or three times on the first week of his arrival in london and accident and a lovers contrivance brought them together as frequently the week following the parents liked young graye and having few friends for their equals in blood were their superiors in position he was received on very generous terms his passion for cytherea grew not only strong but ineffably exalted she without positively encouraging him tacitly assented to his schemes for being near her her father and mother seemed to have lost all confidence in nobility of birth without money to give effect to its presence and looked upon the budding consequence of the young peoples reciprocal glances with placidity if not actual favour  grayes whole impassioned dream terminated in a sad and unaccountable episode after passing through three weeks of sweet experience he had arrived at the last stagea kind of moral gazabefore plunging into an emotional desert the second week in january had come round and it was necessary for the young architect to leave town  throughout his acquaintanceship with the lady of his heart there had been this marked peculiarity in her love she had delighted in his presence as a sweetheart should do yet from first to last she had repressed all recognition of the true nature of the thread which drew them together blinding herself to its meaning and only natural tendency and appearing to dread his announcement of them the present seemed enough for her without cumulative hope usually even if love is in itself an end it must be regarded as a beginning to be enjoyed  in spite of evasions as an obstacle and in consequence of them as a spur he would put the matter off no longer it was evening he took her into a little conservatory on the landing and there among the evergreens by the light of a few tiny lamps infinitely enhancing the freshness and beauty of the leaves he made the declaration of a love as fresh and beautiful as they  my lovemy darling be my wife  she seemed like one just awakened ahwe must part now she faltered in a voice of anguish i will write to you she loosened her hand and rushed away  in a wild fever graye went home and watched for the next morning who shall express his misery and wonder when a note containing these words was put into his hand  goodbye goodbye for ever as recognized lovers something divides us eternally forgive mei should have told you before but your love was sweet never mention me  that very day and as it seemed to put an end to a painful condition of things daughter and parents left london to pay off a promised visit to a relative in a western county no message or letter of entreaty could wring from her any explanation she begged him not to follow her and the most bewildering point was that her father and mother appeared from the tone of a letter graye received from them as vexed and sad as he at this sudden renunciation one thing was plain without admitting her reason as valid they knew what that reason was and did not intend to reveal it  a week from that day ambrose graye left his friend huntways house and saw no more of the love he mourned from time to time his friend answered any inquiry graye made by letter respecting her but very poor food to a lover is intelligence of a mistress filtered through a friend huntway could tell nothing definitely he said he believed there had been some prior flirtation between cytherea and her cousin an officer of the line two or three years before graye met her which had suddenly been terminated by the cousins departure for india and the young ladys travelling on the continent with her parents the whole of the ensuing summer on account of delicate health eventually huntway said that circumstances had rendered grayes attachment more hopeless still cythereas mother had unexpectedly inherited a large fortune and estates in the west of england by the rapid fall of some intervening lives this had caused their removal from the small house in bloomsbury and as it appeared a renunciation of their old friends in that quarter  young graye concluded that his cytherea had forgotten him and his love but he could not forget her  2 from 1843 to 1861  eight years later feeling lonely and depresseda man without relatives with many acquaintances but no friendsambrose graye met a young lady of a different kind fairly endowed with money and good gifts as to caring very deeply for another woman after the loss of cytherea it was an absolute impossibility with him with all the beautiful things of the earth become more dear as they elude pursuit but with some natures utter elusion is the one special event which will make a passing love permanent for ever  this second young lady and graye were married that he did not first or last love his wife as he should have done was known to all but few knew that his unmanageable heart could never be weaned from useless repining at the loss of its first idol  his character to some extent deteriorated as emotional constitutions will under the long sense of disappointment at having missed their imagined destiny and thus though naturally of a gentle and pleasant disposition he grew to be not so tenderly regarded by his acquaintances as it is the lot of some of those persons to be the winning and sanguine receptivity of his early life developed by degrees a moody nervousness and when not picturing prospects drawn from baseless hope he was the victim of indescribable depression the practical issue of such a condition was improvidence originally almost an unconscious improvidence for every debt incurred had been mentally paid off with a religious exactness from the treasures of expectation before mentioned but as years revolved the same course was continued from the lack of spirit sufficient for shifting out of an old groove when it has been found to lead to disaster  in the year 1861 his wife died leaving him a widower with two children the elder a son named owen now just turned seventeen was taken from school and initiated as pupil to the profession of architect in his fathers office the remaining child was a daughter and owens junior by a year  her christian name was cytherea and it is easy to guess why  3 october the twelfth 1863  we pass over two years in order to reach the next cardinal event of these persons lives the scene is still the grayes native town of hocbridge but as it appeared on a monday afternoon in the month of october  the weather was sunny and dry but the ancient borough was to be seen wearing one of its least attractive aspects first on account of the time it was that stagnant hour of the twentyfour when the practical garishness of day having escaped from the fresh long shadows and enlivening newness of the morning has not yet made any perceptible advance towards acquiring those mellow and soothing tones which grace its decline next it was that stage in the progress of the week when businesswhich carried on under the gables of an old country place is not devoid of a romantic sparklewas wellnigh extinguished lastly the town was intentionally bent upon being attractive by exhibiting to an influx of visitors the local talent for dramatic recitation and provincial towns trying to be lively are the dullest of dull things  little towns are like little children in this respect that they interest most when they are enacting native peculiarities unconscious of beholders discovering themselves to be watched they attempt to be entertaining by putting on an antic and produce disagreeable caricatures which spoil them  the weatherstained clockface in the low church tower standing at the intersection of the three chief streets was expressing halfpast two to the town hall opposite where the much talkedof reading from shakespeare was about to begin the doors were open and those persons who had already assembled within the building were noticing the entrance of the newcomerssilently criticizing their dressquestioning the genuineness of their teeth and hairestimating their private means  among these later ones came an exceptional young maiden who glowed amid the dulness like a single brightred poppy in a field of brown stubble she wore an elegant dark jacket lavender dress hat with grey strings and trimmings and gloves of a colour to harmonize she lightly walked up the side passage of the room cast a slight glance around and entered the seat pointed out to her  the young girl was cytherea graye her age was now about eighteen during her entry and at various times whilst sitting in her seat and listening to the reader on the platform her personal appearance formed an interesting subject of study for several neighbouring eyes  her face was exceedingly attractive though artistically less perfect than her figure which approached unusually near to the standard of faultlessness but even this feature of hers yielded the palm to the gracefulness of her movement which was fascinating and delightful to an extreme degree  indeed motion was her speciality whether shown on its most extended scale of bodily progression or minutely as in the uplifting of her eyelids the bending of her fingers the pouting of her lip the carriage of her headmotion within motiona glide upon a glidewas as delicate as that of a magnetic needle and this flexibility and elasticity had never been taught her by rule nor even been acquired by observation but nullo cultu had naturally developed itself with her years in childhood a stone or stalk in the way which had been the inevitable occasion of a fall to her playmates had usually left her safe and upright on her feet after the narrowest escape by oscillations and whirls for the preservation of her balance at mixed christmas parties when she numbered but twelve or thirteen years and was heartily despised on that account by lads who deemed themselves men her apt lightness in the dance covered this incompleteness in her womanhood and compelled the selfsame youths in spite of resolutions to seize upon her childish figure as a partner whom they could not afford to contemn and in later years when the instincts of her sex had shown her this point as the best and rarest feature in her external self she was not found wanting in attention to the cultivation of finish in its details  her hair rested gaily upon her shoulders in curls and was of a shining corn yellow in the high lights deepening to a definite nutbrown as each curl wound round into the shade she had eyes of a sapphire hue though rather darker than the gem ordinarily appears they possessed the affectionate and liquid sparkle of loyalty and good faith as distinguishable from that harder brightness which seems to express faithfulness only to the object confronting them  but to attempt to gain a view of heror indeed of any fascinating womanfrom a measured category is as difficult as to appreciate the effect of a landscape by exploring it at night with a lanternor of a full chord of music by piping the notes in succession nevertheless it may readily be believed from the description here ventured that among the many winning phases of her aspect these were particularly striking    during pleasant doubt when her eyes brightened stealthily and   smiled as eyes will smile as distinctly as her lips and in the   space of a single instant expressed clearly the whole round of   degrees of expectancy which lie over the wide expanse between yea   and nay    during the telling of a secret which was involuntarily   accompanied by a sudden minute start and ecstatic pressure of   the listeners arm side or neck as the position and degree   of intimacy dictated    when anxiously regarding one who possessed her affections  she suddenly assumed the lastmentioned bearing in the progress of the present entertainment her glance was directed out of the window  why the particulars of a young ladys presence at a very mediocre performance were prevented from dropping into the oblivion which their intrinsic insignificance would naturally have involvedwhy they were remembered and individualized by herself and others through after yearswas simply that she unknowingly stood as it were upon the extreme posterior edge of a tract in her life in which the real meaning of taking thought had never been known it was the last hour of experience she ever enjoyed with a mind entirely free from a knowledge of that labyrinth into which she stepped immediately afterwardsto continue a perplexed course along its mazes for the greater portion of twentynine subsequent months  the town hall in which cytherea sat was a building of brown stone and through one of the windows could be seen from the interior of the room the housetops and chimneys of the adjacent street and also the upper part of a neighbouring church spire now in course of completion under the superintendence of miss grayes father the architect to the work  that the top of this spire should be visible from her position in the room was a fact which cythereas idling eyes had discovered with some interest and she was now engaged in watching the scene that was being enacted about its airy summit round the conical stonework rose a cage of scaffolding against the blue sky and upon this stood five menfour in clothes as white as the new erection close beneath their hands the fifth in the ordinary dark suit of a gentleman  the four workingmen in white were three masons and a masons labourer the fifth man was the architect mr graye he had been giving directions as it seemed and retiring as far as the narrow footway allowed stood perfectly still  the picture thus presented to a spectator in the town hall was curious and striking it was an illuminated miniature framed in by the dark margin of the window the keenedged shadiness of which emphasized by contrast the softness of the objects enclosed  the height of the spire was about one hundred and twenty feet and the five men engaged thereon seemed entirely removed from the sphere and experiences of ordinary human beings they appeared little larger than pigeons and made their tiny movements with a soft spiritlike silentness one idea above all others was conveyed to the mind of a person on the ground by their aspect namely concentration of purpose that they were indifferent toeven unconscious ofthe distracted world beneath them and all that moved upon it they never looked off the scaffolding  then one of them turned it was mr graye again he stood motionless with attention to the operations of the others he appeared to be lost in reflection and had directed his face towards a new stone they were lifting  why does he stand like that the young lady thought at lengthup to that moment as listless and careless as one of the ancient tarentines who on such an afternoon as this watched from the theatre the entry into their harbour of a power that overturned the state  she moved herself uneasily i wish he would come down she whispered still gazing at the skybacked picture it is so dangerous to be absentminded up there  when she had done murmuring the words her father indecisively laid hold of one of the scaffoldpoles as if to test its strength then let it go and stepped back in stepping his foot slipped an instant of doubling forward and sideways and he reeled off into the air immediately disappearing downwards  his agonized daughter rose to her feet by a convulsive movement her lips parted and she gasped for breath she could utter no sound one by one the people about her unconscious of what had happened turned their heads and inquiry and alarm became visible upon their faces at the sight of the poor child a moment longer and she fell to the floor  the next impression of which cytherea had any consciousness was of being carried from a strange vehicle across the pavement to the steps of her own house by her brother and an older man recollection of what had passed evolved itself an instant later and just as they entered the doorthrough which another and sadder burden had been carried but a few instants beforeher eyes caught sight of the southwestern sky and without heeding saw white sunlight shining in shaftlike lines from a rift in a slaty cloud emotions will attach themselves to scenes that are simultaneoushowever foreign in essence these scenes may beas chemical waters will crystallize on twigs and wires even after that time any mental agony brought less vividly to cythereas mind the scene from the town hall windows than sunlight streaming in shaftlike lines  4 october the nineteenth  when death enters a house an element of sadness and an element of horror accompany it sadness from the death itself horror from the clouds of blackness we designedly labour to introduce  the funeral had taken place depressed yet resolved in his demeanour owen graye sat before his fathers private escritoire engaged in turning out and unfolding a heterogeneous collection of papersforbidding and inharmonious to the eye at all timesmost of all to one under the influence of a great grief laminae of white paper tied with twine were indiscriminately intermixed with other white papers bounded by black edgesthese with blue foolscap wrapped round with crude red tape  the bulk of these letters bills and other documents were submitted to a careful examination by which the appended particulars were ascertained    first that their fathers income from professional sources had   been very small amounting to not more than half their expenditure   and that his own and his wifes property upon which he had relied   for the balance had been sunk and lost in unwise loans to   unscrupulous men who had traded upon their fathers too   openhearted trustfulness    second that finding his mistake he had endeavoured to regain   his standing by the illusory path of speculation the most notable   instance of this was the following he had been induced when at   plymouth in the autumn of the previous year to venture all his   spare capital on the bottomry security of an italian brig which   had put into the harbour in distress the profit was to be   considerable so was the risk there turned out to be no security   whatever the circumstances of the case tendered it the most   unfortunate speculation that a man like himselfignorant of all   such matterscould possibly engage in the vessel went down and   all mr grayes money with it    third that these failures had left him burdened with debts he   knew not how to meet so that at the time of his death even the few   pounds lying to his account at the bank were his only in name    fourth that the loss of his wife two years earlier had   awakened him to a keen sense of his blindness and of his duty by   his children he had then resolved to reinstate by unflagging zeal   in the pursuit of his profession and by no speculation at least a   portion of the little fortune he had let go  cytherea was frequently at her brothers elbow during these examinations she often remarked sadly  poor papa failed to fulfil his good intention for want of time didnt he owen and there was an excuse for his past though he never would claim it i never forget that original disheartening blow and how that from it sprang all the ills of his lifeeverything connected with his gloom and the lassitude in business we used so often to see about him  i remember what he said once returned the brother when i sat up late with him he said owen dont love too blindly blindly you will love if you love at all but a little care is still possible to a welldisciplined heart may that heart be yours as it was not mine father said cultivate the art of renunciation and i am going to cytherea  and once mamma said that an excellent woman was papas ruin because he did not know the way to give her up when he had lost her i wonder where she is now owen we were told not to try to find out anything about her papa never told us her name did he  that was by her own request i believe but never mind her she was not our mother  the love affair which had been ambrose grayes disheartening blow was precisely of that nature which lads take little account of but girls ponder in their hearts  5 from october the nineteenth to july the ninth  thus ambrose grayes good intentions with regard to the reintegration of his property had scarcely taken tangible form when his sudden death put them for ever out of his power  heavy bills showing the extent of his obligations tumbled in immediately upon the heels of the funeral from quarters previously unheard and unthought of thus pressed a bill was filed in chancery to have the assets such as they were administered by the court  what will become of us now thought owen continually  there is in us an unquenchable expectation which at the gloomiest time persists in inferring that because we are ourselves there must be a special future in store for us though our nature and antecedents to the remotest particular have been common to thousands thus to cytherea and owen graye the question how their lives would end seemed the deepest of possible enigmas to others who knew their position equally well with themselves the question was the easiest that could be askedlike those of other people similarly circumstanced  then owen held a consultation with his sister to come to some decision on their future course and a month was passed in waiting for answers to letters and in the examination of schemes more or less futile sudden hopes that were rainbows to the sight proved but mists to the touch in the meantime unpleasant remarks disguise them as some wellmeaning people might were floating around them every day the undoubted truth that they were the children of a dreamer who let slip away every farthing of his money and ran into debt with his neighboursthat the daughter had been brought up to no professionthat the son who had had made no progress in it and might come to the dogscould not from the nature of things be wrapped up in silence in order that it might not hurt their feelings and as a matter of fact it greeted their ears in some form or other wherever they went their few acquaintances passed them hurriedly ancient potwallopers and thriving shopkeepers in their intervals of leisure stood at their shopdoorstheir toes hanging over the edge of the step and their obese waists hanging over their toesand in discourses with friends on the pavement formulated the course of the improvident and reduced the childrens prospects to a shadowlike attenuation the sons of these men who wore breastpins of a sarcastic kind and smoked humorous pipes stared at cytherea with a stare unmitigated by any of the respect that had formerly softened it  now it is a noticeable fact that we do not much mind what men think of us or what humiliating secret they discover of our means parentage or object provided that each thinks and acts thereupon in isolation it is the exchange of ideas about us that we dread most and the possession by a hundred acquaintances severally insulated of the knowledge of our skeletonclosets whereabouts is not so distressing to the nerves as a chat over it by a party of halfadozenexclusive depositaries though these may be  perhaps though hocbridge watched and whispered its animus would have been little more than a trifle to persons in thriving circumstances but unfortunately poverty whilst it is new and before the skin has had time to thicken makes people susceptible inversely to their opportunities for shielding themselves in owen was found in place of his fathers impressibility a larger share of his fathers pride and a squareness of idea which if coupled with a little more blindness would have amounted to positive prejudice to him humanity so far as he had thought of it at all was rather divided into distinct classes than blended from extreme to extreme hence by a sequence of ideas which might be traced if it were worth while he either detested or respected opinion and instinctively sought to escape a cold shade that mere sensitiveness would have endured he could have submitted to separation sickness exile drudgery hunger and thirst with stoical indifference but superciliousness was too incisive  after living on for nine months in attempts to make an income as his fathers successor in the professionattempts which were utterly fruitless by reason of his inexperiencegraye came to a simple and sweeping resolution they would privately leave that part of england drop from the sight of acquaintances gossips harsh critics and bitter creditors of whose misfortune he was not the cause and escape the position which galled him by the only road their great poverty left open to themthat of his obtaining some employment in a distant place by following his profession as a humble underdraughtsman  he thought over his capabilities with the sensations of a soldier grinding his sword at the opening of a campaign what with lack of employment owing to the decrease of his late fathers practice and the absence of direct and uncompromising pressure towards monetary results from a pupils labour which seems to be always the case when a professional mans pupil is also his son owens progress in the art and science of architecture had been very insignificant indeed though anything but an idle young man he had hardly reached the age at which industrious men who lack an external whip to send them on in the world are induced by their own common sense to whip on themselves hence his knowledge of plans elevations sections and specifications was not greater at the end of two years of probation than might easily have been acquired in six months by a youth of average abilityhimself for instanceamid a bustling london practice  but at any rate he could make himself handy to one of the professionsome man in a remote townand there fulfil his indentures a tangible inducement lay in this direction of survey he had a slight conception of such a mana mr gradfieldwho was in practice in budmouth regis a seaport town and wateringplace in the south of england  after some doubts graye ventured to write to this gentleman asking the necessary question shortly alluding to his fathers death and stating that his term of apprenticeship had only half expired he would be glad to complete his articles at a very low salary for the whole remaining two years provided payment could begin at once  the answer from mr gradfield stated that he was not in want of a pupil who would serve the remainder of his time on the terms mr graye mentioned but he would just add one remark he chanced to be in want of some young man in his officefor a short time only probably about two monthsto trace drawings and attend to other subsidiary work of the kind if mr graye did not object to occupy such an inferior position as these duties would entail and to accept weekly wages which to one with his expectations would be considered merely nominal the post would give him an opportunity for learning a few more details of the profession  it is a beginning and above all an abidingplace away from the shadow of the cloud which hangs over us herei will go said owen  cythereas plan for her future an intensely simple one owing to the even greater narrowness of her resources was already marked out one advantage had accrued to her through her mothers possession of a fair share of personal property and perhaps only one she had been carefully educated upon this consideration her plan was based she was to take up her abode in her brothers lodging at budmouth when she would immediately advertise for a situation as governess having obtained the consent of a lawyer at aldbrickham who was winding up her fathers affairs and who knew the history of her position to allow himself to be referred to in the matter of her past life and respectability  early one morning they departed from their native town leaving behind them scarcely a trace of their footsteps  then the town pitied their want of wisdom in taking such a step rashness they would have made a better income in hocbridge where they are known there is no doubt that they would  but what is wisdom really a steady handling of any means to bring about any end necessary to happiness  yet whether ones end be the usual enda wealthy position in lifeor no the name of wisdom is seldom applied but to the means to that usual end     ii the events of a fortnight  1 the ninth of july  the day of their departure was one of the most glowing that the climax of a long series of summer heats could evolve the wide expanse of landscape quivered up and down like the flame of a taper as they steamed along through the midst of it placid flocks of sheep reclining under trees a little way off appeared of a pale blue colour clover fields were livid with the brightness of the sun upon their deep red flowers all waggons and carts were moved to the shade by their careful owners rainwater butts fell to pieces wellbuckets were lowered inside the covers of the wellhole to preserve them from the fate of the butts and generally water seemed scarcer in the country than the beer and cider of the peasantry who toiled or idled there  to see persons looking with childrens eyes at any ordinary scenery is a proof that they possess the charming faculty of drawing new sensations from an old experiencea healthy sign rare in these feverish daysthe mark of an imperishable brightness of nature  both brother and sister could do this cytherea more noticeably they watched the undulating cornlands monotonous to all their companions the stony and clayey prospect succeeding those with its angular and abrupt hills boggy moors came next now withered and drythe spots upon which pools usually spread their waters showing themselves as circles of smooth bare soil overrun by a network of innumerable little fissures then arose plantations of firs abruptly terminating beside meadows cleanly mown in which highhipped richcoloured cows with backs horizontal and straight as the ridge of a house stood motionless or lazily fed glimpses of the sea now interested them which became more and more frequent till the train finally drew up beside the platform at budmouth  the whole town is looking out for us had been grayes impression throughout the day he called upon mr gradfieldthe only man who had been directly informed of his comingand found that mr gradfield had forgotten it  however arrangements were made with this gentlemana stout active greybearded burgher of sixtyby which owen was to commence work in his office the following week  the same day cytherea drew up and sent off the advertisement appended     a young lady is desirous of meeting with an engagement as   governess or companion she is competent to teach english   french and music satisfactory referencesaddress c g   postoffice budmouth   it seemed a more material existence than her own that she saw thus delineated on the paper that cant be myself how odd i look she said and smiled  2 july the eleventh  on the monday subsequent to their arrival in budmouth owen graye attended at mr gradfields office to enter upon his duties and his sister was left in their lodgings alone for the first time  despite the sad occurrences of the preceding autumn an unwonted cheerfulness pervaded her spirit throughout the day change of sceneand that to untravelled eyesconjoined with the sensation of freedom from supervision revived the sparkle of a warm young nature ready enough to take advantage of any adventitious restoratives pointblank grief tends rather to seal up happiness for a time than to produce that attrition which results from griefs of anticipation that move onward with the days these may be said to furrow away the capacity for pleasure  her expectations from the advertisement began to be extravagant a thriving family who had always sadly needed her was already definitely pictured in her fancy which in its exuberance led her on to picturing its individual members their possible peculiarities virtues and vices and obliterated for a time the recollection that she would be separated from her brother  thus musing as she waited for his return in the evening her eyes fell on her left hand the contemplation of her own left fourth finger by symbolloving girlhood of this age is it seems very frequently if not always followed by a peculiar train of romantic ideas cythereas thoughts still playing about her future became directed into this romantic groove she leant back in her chair and taking hold of the fourth finger which had attracted her attention she lifted it with the tips of the others and looked at the smooth and tapering member for a long time  she whispered idly i wonder who and what he will be  if hes a gentleman of fashion he will take my finger so just with the tips of his own and with some fluttering of the heart and the least trembling of his lip slip the ring so lightly on that i shall hardly know it is therelooking delightfully into my eyes all the time  if hes a bold dashing soldier i expect he will proudly turn round take the ring as if it equalled her majestys crown in value and desperately set it on my finger thus he will fix his eyes unflinchingly upon what he is doingjust as if he stood in battle before the enemy though in reality very fond of me of course and blush as much as i shall  if hes a sailor he will take my finger and the ring in this way and deck it out with a housewifely touch and a tenderness of expression about his mouth as sailors do kiss it perhaps with a simple air as if we were children playing an idle game and not at the very height of observation and envy by a great crowd saying ah they are happy now  if he should be rather a poor mannobleminded and affectionate but still poor  owens footsteps rapidly ascending the stairs interrupted this fancyfree meditation reproaching herself even angry with herself for allowing her mind to stray upon such subjects in the face of their present desperate condition she rose to meet him and make tea  cythereas interest to know how her brother had been received at mr gradfields broke forth into words at once almost before they had sat down to table she began crossexamining him in the regular sisterly way  well owen how has it been with you today what is the place likedo you think you will like mr gradfield  o yes but he has not been there today i have only had the head draughtsman with me  young women have a habit not noticeable in men of putting on at a moments notice the drama of whosoevers life they choose cythereas interest was transferred from mr gradfield to his representative  what sort of a man is he  he seems a very nice fellow indeed though of course i can hardly tell to a certainty as yet but i think hes a very worthy fellow theres no nonsense in him and though he is not a public school man he has read widely and has a sharp appreciation of whats good in books and art in fact his knowledge isnt nearly so exclusive as most professional mens  thats a great deal to say of an architect for of all professional men they are as a rule the most professional  yes perhaps they are this man is rather of a melancholy turn of mind i think  has the managing clerk any family she mildly asked after a while pouring out some more tea  family no  well dear owen how should i know  why of course he isnt married but there happened to be a conversation about women going on in the office and i heard him say what he should wish his wife to be like  what would he wish his wife to be like she said with great apparent lack of interest  o he says she must be girlish and artless yet he would be loth to do without a dash of womanly subtlety tis so piquant yes he said that must be in her she must have womanly cleverness and yet i should like her to blush if only a cocksparrow were to look at her hard he said which brings me back to the girl again and so i flit backwards and forwards i must have what comes i suppose he said and whatever she may be thank god shes no worse however if he might give a final hint to providence he said a child among pleasures and a woman among pains was the rough outline of his requirement  did he say that what a musing creature he must be  he did indeed  3 from the twelfth to the fifteenth of july  as is well known ideas are so elastic in a human brain that they have no constant measure which may be called their actual bulk any important idea may be compressed to a molecule by an unwonted crowding of others and any small idea will expand to whatever length and breadth of vacuum the mind may be able to make over to it cythereas world was tolerably vacant at this time and the young architectural designers image became very pervasive the next evening this subject was again renewed  his name is springrove said owen in reply to her he is a thorough artist but a man of rather humble origin it seems who has made himself so far i think he is the son of a farmer or something of the kind  well hes none the worse for that i suppose  none the worse as we come down the hill we shall be continually meeting people going up but owen had felt that springrove was a little the worse nevertheless  of course hes rather old by this time  o no hes about sixandtwentynot more  ah i see what is he like owen  i cant exactly tell you his appearance tis always such a difficult thing to do  a man you would describe as short most men are those we should describe as short i fancy  i should call him i think of the middle height but as i only see him sitting in the office of course i am not certain about his form and figure  i wish you were then  perhaps you do but i am not you see  of course not you are always so provoking owen i saw a man in the street today whom i fancied was heand yet i dont see how it could be either he had light brown hair a snub nose very round face and a peculiar habit of reducing his eyes to straight lines when he looked narrowly at anything  o no that was not he cytherea  not a bit like him in all probability  not a bit he has dark hairalmost a grecian nose regular teeth and an intellectual face as nearly as i can recall to mind  ah there now owen you have described him but i suppose hes not generally called pleasing or  handsome  i scarcely meant that but since you have said it is he handsome  rather  his tout ensemble is striking  yeso no noi forgot it is not he is rather untidy in his waistcoat and neckties and hair  how vexing it must be to himself poor thing  hes a thorough bookwormdespises the papanddaisy school of verseknows shakespeare to the very dregs of the footnotes indeed hes a poet himself in a small way  how delicious she said i have never known a poet  and you dont know him said owen dryly  she reddened of course i dont i know that  have you received any answer to your advertisement he inquired  ahno she said and the forgotten disappointment which had showed itself in her face at different times during the day became visible again  another day passed away on thursday without inquiry she learnt more of the head draughtsman he and graye had become very friendly and he had been tempted to show her brother a copy of some poems of hissome serious and sadsome humorouswhich had appeared in the poets corner of a magazine from time to time owen showed them now to cytherea who instantly began to read them carefully and to think them very beautiful  yesspringroves no fool said owen sententiously  no fooli should think he isnt indeed said cytherea looking up from the paper in quite an excitement to write such verses as these  what logic are you chopping cytherea well i dont mean on account of the verses because i havent read them but for what he said when the fellows were talking about falling in love  which you will tell me  he says that your true lover breathlessly finds himself engaged to a sweetheart like a man who has caught something in the dark he doesnt know whether it is a bat or a bird and takes it to the light when he is cool to learn what it is he looks to see if she is the right age but right age or wrong age he must consider her a prize sometime later he ponders whether she is the right kind of prize for him right kind or wrong kindhe has called her his and must abide by it after a time he asks himself has she the temper hair and eyes i meant to have and was firmly resolved not to do without he finds it is all wrong and then comes the tussle  do they marry and live happily  who o the supposed pair i think he saidwell i really forget what he said  that is stupid of you said the young lady with dismay  yes  but hes a satiristi dont think i care about him now  there you are just wrong he is not he is as i believe an impulsive fellow who has been made to pay the penalty of his rashness in some love affair  thus ended the dialogue of thursday but cytherea read the verses again in private on friday her brother remarked that springrove had informed him he was going to leave mr gradfields in a fortnight to push his fortunes in london  an indescribable feeling of sadness shot through cythereas heart why should she be sad at such an announcement as that she thought concerning a man she had never seen when her spirits were elastic enough to rebound after hard blows from deep and real troubles as if she had scarcely known them though she could not answer this question she knew one thing she was saddened by owens news  4 july the twentyfirst  a very popular local excursion by steamboat to lulstead cove was announced through the streets of budmouth one thursday morning by the weakvoiced towncrier to start at six oclock the same day the weather was lovely and the opportunity being the first of the kind offered to them owen and cytherea went with the rest  they had reached the cove and had walked landward for nearly an hour over the hill which rose beside the strand when graye recollected that two or three miles yet further inland from this spot was an interesting mediaeval ruin he was already familiar with its characteristics through the medium of an archaeological work and now finding himself so close to the reality felt inclined to verify some theory he had formed respecting it concluding that there would be just sufficient time for him to go there and return before the boat had left the shore he parted from cytherea on the hill struck downwards and then up a heathery valley  she remained on the summit where he had left her till the time of his expected return scanning the details of the prospect around placidly spread out before her on the south was the open channel reflecting a blue intenser by many shades than that of the sky overhead and dotted in the foreground by halfadozen small craft of contrasting rig their sails graduating in hue from extreme whiteness to reddish brown the varying actual colours varied again in a double degree by the rays of the declining sun  presently the distant bell from the boat was heard warning the passengers to embark this was followed by a lively air from the harps and violins on board their tones as they arose becoming intermingled with though not marred by the brush of the waves when their crests rolled overat the point where the check of the shallows was first feltand then thinned away up the slope of pebbles and sand  she turned her face landward and strained her eyes to discern if possible some sign of owens return nothing was visible save the strikingly brilliant still landscape the wide concave which lay at the back of the hill in this direction was blazing with the western light adding an orange tint to the vivid purple of the heather now at the very climax of bloom and free from the slightest touch of the invidious brown that so soon creeps into its shades the light so intensified the colours that they seemed to stand above the surface of the earth and float in midair like an exhalation of red in the minor valleys between the hillocks and ridges which diversified the contour of the basin but did not disturb its general sweep she marked brakes of tall heavystemmed ferns five or six feet high in a brilliant lightgreen dressa broad riband of them with the path in their midst winding like a stream along the little ravine that reached to the foot of the hill and delivered up the path to its grassy area among the ferns grew holly bushes deeper in tint than any shadow about them whilst the whole surface of the scene was dimpled with small conical pits and here and there were round ponds now dry and half overgrown with rushes  the last bell of the steamer rang cytherea had forgotten herself and what she was looking for in a fever of distress lest owen should be left behind she gathered up in her hand the corners of her handkerchief containing specimens of the shells plants and fossils which the locality produced started off to the sands and mingled with the knots of visitors there congregated from other interesting points around from the inn the cottages and hired conveyances that had returned from short drives inland they all went aboard by the primitive plan of a narrow plank on two wheelsthe women being assisted by a rope cytherea lingered till the very last reluctant to follow and looking alternately at the boat and the valley behind her delay provoked a remark from captain jacobs a thickset man of hybrid stains resulting from the mixed effects of fire and water peculiar to sailors where engines are the propelling power  now then missy if you please i am sorry to tell ee our times up who are you looking for miss  my brotherhe has walked a short distance inland he must be here directly could you wait for himjust a minute  really i am afraid not mm cytherea looked at the stout roundfaced man and at the vessel with a light in her eyes so expressive of her own opinion being the same on reflection as his and with such resignation too that from an instinctive feeling of pride at being able to prove himself more humane than he was thought to beworks of supererogation are the only sacrifices that entice in this wayand that at a very small cost he delayed the boat till some among the passengers began to murmur  there never mind said cytherea decisively go on without mei shall wait for him  well tis a very awkward thing to leave you here all alone said the captain i certainly advise you not to wait  hes gone across to the railway station for certain said another passenger  nohere he is cytherea said regarding as she spoke the half hidden figure of a man who was seen advancing at a headlong pace down the ravine which lay between the heath and the shore  he cant get here in less than five minutes a passenger said people should know what they are about and keep time really if  you see sir said the captain in an apologetic undertone since tis her brother and shes all alone tis only nater to wait a minute now hes in sight suppose now you were a young woman as might be and had a brother like this one and you stood of an evening upon this here wild lonely shore like her why youd want us to wait too wouldnt you sir i think you would  the person so hastily approaching had been lost to view during this remark by reason of a hollow in the ground and the projecting cliff immediately at hand covered the path in its rise his footsteps were now heard striking sharply upon the flinty road at a distance of about twenty or thirty yards but still behind the escarpment to save time cytherea prepared to ascend the plank  let me give you my hand miss said captain jacobs  noplease dont touch me said she ascending cautiously by sliding one foot forward two or three inches bringing up the other behind it and so on alternatelyher lips compressed by concentration on the feat her eyes glued to the plank her hand to the rope and her immediate thought to the fact of the distressing narrowness of her footing steps now shook the lower end of the board and in an instant were up to her heels with a bound  o owen i am so glad you are come she said without turning dont dont shake the plank or touch me whatever you do there i am up where have you been so long she continued in a lower tone turning round to him as she reached the top  raising her eyes from her feet which standing on the firm deck demanded her attention no longer she acquired perceptions of the newcomer in the following order unknown trousers unknown waistcoat unknown face the man was not her brother but a total stranger  off went the plank the paddles started stopped backed pattered in confusion then revolved decisively and the boat passed out into deep water  one or two persons had said how dye do mr springrove and looked at cytherea to see how she bore her disappointment her ears had but just caught the name of the head draughtsman when she saw him advancing directly to address her  miss graye i believe he said lifting his hat  yes said cytherea colouring and trying not to look guilty of a surreptitious knowledge of him  i am mr springrove i passed corvsgate castle about an hour ago and soon afterwards met your brother going that way he had been deceived in the distance and was about to turn without seeing the ruin on account of a lameness that had come on in his leg or foot i proposed that he should go on since he had got so near and afterwards instead of walking back to the boat get across to anglebury stationa shorter walk for himwhere he could catch the late train and go directly home i could let you know what he had done and allay any uneasiness  is the lameness serious do you know  o no simply from overwalking himself still it was just as well to ride home  relieved from her apprehensions on owens score she was able slightly to examine the appearance of her informantedward springrovewho now removed his hat for a while to cool himself he was rather above her brothers height although the upper part of his face and head was handsomely formed and bounded by lines of sufficiently masculine regularity his brows were somewhat too softly arched and finely pencilled for one of his sex without prejudice however to the belief which the sum total of his features inspiredthat though they did not prove that the man who thought inside them would do much in the world men who had done most of all had had no better ones across his forehead otherwise perfectly smooth ran one thin line the healthy freshness of his remaining features expressing that it had come there prematurely  though some years short of the age at which the clear spirit bids goodbye to the last infirmity of noble mind and takes to househunting and investments he had reached the period in a young mans life when episodic periods with a hopeful birth and a disappointing death have begun to accumulate and to bear a fruit of generalities his glance sometimes seeming to state i have already thought out the issue of such conditions as these we are experiencing at other times he wore an abstracted look i seem to have lived through this moment before  he was carelessly dressed in dark grey wearing a rolledup black kerchief as a neckcloth the knot of which was disarranged and stood obliquelya deposit of white dust having lodged in the creases  i am sorry for your disappointment he continued glancing into her face their eyes having met became as it were mutually locked together and the single instant only which good breeding allows as the length of such a look became trebled a clear penetrating ray of intelligence had shot from each into each giving birth to one of those unaccountable sensations which carry home to the heart before the hand has been touched or the merest compliment passed by something stronger than mathematical proof the conviction a tie has begun to unite us  both faces also unconsciously stated that their owners had been much in each others thoughts of late owen had talked to the young architect of his sister as freely as to cytherea of the young architect  a conversation began which was none the less interesting to the parties engaged because it consisted only of the most trivial and commonplace remarks then the band of harps and violins struck up a lively melody and the deck was cleared for dancing the sun dipping beneath the horizon during the proceeding and the moon showing herself at their stern the sea was so calm that the soft hiss produced by the bursting of the innumerable bubbles of foam behind the paddles could be distinctly heard the passengers who did not dance including cytherea and springrove lapsed into silence leaning against the paddleboxes or standing aloofnoticing the trembling of the deck to the steps of the dancewatching the waves from the paddles as they slid thinly and easily under each others edges  night had quite closed in by the time they reached budmouth harbour sparkling with its white red and green lights in opposition to the shimmering path of the moons reflection on the other side which reached away to the horizon till the flecked ripples reduced themselves to sparkles as fine as gold dust  i will walk to the station and find out the exact time the train arrives said springrove rather eagerly when they had landed  she thanked him much  perhaps we might walk together he suggested hesitatingly she looked as if she did not quite know and he settled the question by showing the way  they found on arriving there that on the first day of that month the particular train selected for grayes return had ceased to stop at anglebury station  i am very sorry i misled him said springrove  o i am not alarmed at all replied cytherea  well its sure to be all righthe will sleep there and come by the first in the morning but what will you do alone  i am quite easy on that point the landlady is very friendly i must go indoors now goodnight mr springrove  let me go round to your door with you he pleaded  no thank you we live close by  he looked at her as a waiter looks at the change he brings back but she was inexorable  dontforget me he murmured she did not answer  let me see you sometimes he said  perhaps you never will againi am going away she replied in lingering tones and turning into cross street ran indoors and upstairs  the sudden withdrawal of what was superfluous at first is often felt as an essential loss it was felt now with regard to the maiden more too after a meeting so pleasant and so enkindling she had seemed to imply that they would never come together again  the young man softly followed her stood opposite the house and watched her come into the upper room with the light presently his gaze was cut short by her approaching the window and pulling down the blindedward dwelling upon her vanishing figure with a hopeless sense of loss akin to that which adam is said by logicians to have felt when he first saw the sun set and thought in his inexperience that it would return no more  he waited till her shadow had twice crossed the window when finding the charming outline was not to be expected again he left the street crossed the harbourbridge and entered his own solitary chamber on the other side vaguely thinking as he went for undefined reasons     one hope is too like despair    for prudence to smother     iii the events of eight days  1 from the twentysecond to the twentyseventh of july  but things are not what they seem a responsive love for edward springrove had made its appearance in cythereas bosom with all the fascinating attributes of a first experience not succeeding to or displacing other emotions as in older hearts but taking up entirely new ground as when gazing just after sunset at the pale blue sky we see a star come into existence where nothing was before  his parting words dont forget me she repeated to herself a hundred times and though she thought their import was probably commonplace she could not help toying with themlooking at them from all points and investing them with meanings of love and faithfulnessostensibly entertaining such meanings only as fables wherewith to pass the time yet in her heart admitting for detached instants a possibility of their deeper truth and thus for hours after he had left her her reason flirted with her fancy as a kitten will sport with a dove pleasantly and smoothly through easy attitudes but disclosing its cruel and unyielding nature at crises  to turn now to the more material media through which this story moves it so happened that the very next morning brought round a circumstance which slight in itself took up a relevant and important position between the past and the future of the persons herein concerned  at breakfast time just as cytherea had again seen the postman pass without bringing her an answer to the advertisement as she had fully expected he would do owen entered the room  well he said kissing her you have not been alarmed of course springrove told you what i had done and you found there was no train  yes it was all clear but what is the lameness owing to  i dont knownothing it has quite gone off now cytherea i hope you like springrove springroves a nice fellow you know  yes i think he is except that  it happened just to the purpose that i should meet him there didnt it and when i reached the station and learnt that i could not get on by train my foot seemed better i started off to walk home and went about five miles along a path beside the railway it then struck me that i might not be fit for anything today if i walked and aggravated the bothering foot so i looked for a place to sleep at there was no available village or inn and i eventually got the keeper of a gatehouse where a lane crossed the line to take me in  they proceeded with their breakfast owen yawned  you didnt get much sleep at the gatehouse last night im afraid owen said his sister  to tell the truth i didnt i was in such very close and narrow quarters those gatehouses are such small places and the man had only his own bed to offer me ah bythebye cythie i have such an extraordinary thing to tell you in connection with this manby jove i had nearly forgotten it but ill go straight on as i was saying he had only his own bed to offer me but i could not afford to be fastidious and as he had a hearty manner though a very queer one i agreed to accept it and he made a rough pallet for himself on the floor close beside me well i could not sleep for my life and i wished i had not stayed there though i was so tired for one thing there were the luggage trains rattling by at my elbow the early part of the night but worse than this he talked continually in his sleep and occasionally struck out with his limbs at something or another knocking against the post of the bedstead and making it tremble my condition was altogether so unsatisfactory that at last i awoke him and asked him what he had been dreaming about for the previous hour for i could get no sleep at all he begged my pardon for disturbing me but a name i had casually let fall that evening had led him to think of another stranger he had once had visit him who had also accidentally mentioned the same name and some very strange incidents connected with that meeting the affair had occurred years and years ago but what i had said had made him think and dream about it as if it were but yesterday what was the word i said cytherea he said what was the story i asked then he then told me that when he was a young man in london he borrowed a few pounds to add to a few he had saved up and opened a little inn at hammersmith one evening after the inn had been open about a couple of months every idler in the neighbourhood ran off to westminster the houses of parliament were on fire  not a soul remained in his parlour besides himself and he began picking up the pipes and glasses his customers had hastily relinquished at length a young lady about seventeen or eighteen came in she asked if a woman was there waiting for herselfmiss jane taylor he said no asked the young lady if she would wait and showed her into the small inner room there was a glasspane in the partition dividing this room from the bar to enable the landlord to see if his visitors who sat there wanted anything a curious awkwardness and melancholy about the behaviour of the girl who called caused my informant to look frequently at her through the partition she seemed weary of her life and sat with her face buried in her hands evidently quite out of her element in such a house then a woman much older came in and greeted miss taylor by name the man distinctly heard the following words pass between them  why have you not brought him  he is ill he is not likely to live through the night  at this announcement from the elderly woman the young lady fell to the floor in a swoon apparently overcome by the news the landlord ran in and lifted her up well do what they would they could not for a long time bring her back to consciousness and began to be much alarmed who is she the innkeeper said to the other woman i know her the other said with deep meaning in her tone the elderly and young woman seemed allied and yet strangers  she now showed signs of life and it struck him he was plainly of an inquisitive turn that in her halfbewildered state he might get some information from her he stooped over her put his mouth to her ear and said sharply whats your name to catch a woman napping is difficult even when shes half dead but i did it says the gatekeeper when he asked her her name she said immediately  cythereaand stopped suddenly  my own name said cytherea  yesyour name well the gateman thought at the time it might be equally with jane a name she had invented for the occasion that they might not trace her but i think it was truth unconsciously uttered for she added directly afterwards o what have i said and was quite overcome againthis time with fright her vexation that the woman now doubted the genuineness of her other name was very much greater than that the innkeeper did and it is evident that to blind the woman was her main object he also learnt from words the elderly woman casually dropped that meetings of the same kind had been held before and that the falseness of the soidisant miss jane taylors name had never been suspected by this dependent or confederate till then  she recovered rested there for an hour and first sending off her companion peremptorily which was another odd thing she left the house offering the landlord all the money she had to say nothing about the circumstance he has never seen her since according to his own account i said to him again and again did you find any more particulars afterwards not a syllable he said o he should never hear any more of that too many years had passed since it happened at any rate you found out her surname i said well well thats my secret he went on perhaps i should never have been in this part of the world if it hadnt been for that i failed as a publican you know i imagine the situation of gateman was given him and his debts paid off as a bribe to silence but i cant say ah yes he said with a long breath i have never heard that name mentioned since that time till tonight and then there instantly rose to my eyes the vision of that young lady lying in a fainting fit he then stopped talking and fell asleep telling the story must have relieved him as it did the ancient mariner for he did not move a muscle or make another sound for the remainder of the night now isnt that an odd story  it is indeed cytherea murmured very very strange  why should she have said your most uncommon name continued owen the man was evidently truthful for there was not motive sufficient for his invention of such a tale and he could not have done it either  cytherea looked long at her brother dont you recognize anything else in connection with the story she said  what he asked  do you remember what poor papa once let dropthat cytherea was the name of his first sweetheart in bloomsbury who so mysteriously renounced him a sort of intuition tells me that this was the same woman  o nonot likely said her brother sceptically  how not likely owen theres not another woman of the name in england in what year used papa to say the event took place  eighteen hundred and thirtyfive  and when were the houses of parliament burntstop i can tell you she searched their little stock of books for a list of dates and found one in an old school history  the houses of parliament were burnt down in the evening of the sixteenth of october eighteen hundred and thirtyfour  nearly a year and a quarter before she met father remarked owen  they were silent if papa had been alive what a wonderful absorbing interest this story would have had for him said cytherea byandby and how strangely knowledge comes to us we might have searched for a clue to her secret half the world over and never found one if we had really had any motive for trying to discover more of the sad history than papa told us we should have gone to bloomsbury but not caring to do so we go two hundred miles in the opposite direction and there find information waiting to be told us what could have been the secret owen  heaven knows but our having heard a little more of her in this way if she is the same woman is a mere coincidence after alla family story to tell our friends if we ever have any but we shall never know any more of the episode nowtrust our fates for that  cytherea sat silently thinking  there was no answer this morning to your advertisement cytherea he continued  none  i could see that by your looks when i came in  fancy not getting a single one she said sadly surely there must be people somewhere who want governesses  yes but those who want them and can afford to have them get them mostly by friends recommendations whilst those who want them and cant afford to have them make use of their poor relations  what shall i do  never mind it go on living with me dont let the difficulty trouble your mind so you think about it all day i can keep you cythie in a plain way of living twentyfive shillings a week do not amount to much truly but then many mechanics have no more and we live quite as sparingly as journeymen mechanics it is a meagre narrow life we are drifting into he added gloomily but it is a degree more tolerable than the worrying sensation of all the world being ashamed of you which we experienced at hocbridge  i couldnt go back there again she said  nor i o i dont regret our course for a moment we did quite right in dropping out of the world the sneering tones of the remark were almost too laboured to be real besides he continued something better for me is sure to turn up soon i wish my engagement here was a permanent one instead of for only two months it may certainly be for a longer time but all is uncertain  i wish i could get something to do and i must too she said firmly suppose as is very probable you are not wanted after the beginning of octoberthe time mr gradfield mentionedwhat should we do if i were dependent on you only throughout the winter  they pondered on numerous schemes by which a young lady might be supposed to earn a decent livelihoodmore or less convenient and feasible in imagination but relinquished them all until advertising had been once more tried this time taking lower ground cytherea was vexed at her temerity in having represented to the world that so inexperienced a being as herself was a qualified governess and had a fancy that this presumption of hers might be one reason why no ladies applied the new and humbler attempt appeared in the following form     nursery governess or useful companion a young person wishes to   hear of a situation in either of the above capacities salary very   moderate she is a good needlewomanaddress g 3 cross street   budmouth   in the evening they went to post the letter and then walked up and down the parade for a while soon they met springrove said a few words to him and passed on owen noticed that his sisters face had become crimson rather oddly they met springrove again in a few minutes this time the three walked a little way together edward ostensibly talking to owen though with a single thought to the reception of his words by the maiden at the farther side upon whom his gaze was mostly resting and who was attentively listeninglooking fixedly upon the pavement the while it has been said that men love with their eyes women with their ears  as owen and himself were little more than acquaintances as yet and as springrove was wanting in the assurance of many men of his age it now became necessary to wish his friends goodevening or to find a reason for continuing near cytherea by saying some nice new thing he thought of a new thing he proposed a pull across the bay this was assented to they went to the pier stepped into one of the gaily painted boats moored alongside and sheered off cytherea sat in the stern steering  they rowed that evening the next came and with it the necessity of rowing again then the next and the next cytherea always sitting in the stern with the tiller ropes in her hand the curves of her figure welded with those of the fragile boat in perfect continuation as she girlishly yielded herself to its heaving and sinking seeming to form with it an organic whole  then owen was inclined to test his skill in paddling a canoe edward did not like canoes and the issue was that having seen owen on board springrove proposed to pull off after him with a pair of sculls but not considering himself sufficiently accomplished to do finished rowing before a parade full of promenaders when there was a little swell on and with the rudder unshipped in addition he begged that cytherea might come with him and steer as before she stepped in and they floated along in the wake of her brother thus passed the fifth evening on the water  but the sympathetic pair were thrown into still closer companionship and much more exclusive connection  2 july the twentyninth  it was a sad time for cythereathe last day of springroves management at gradfields and the last evening before his return from budmouth to his fathers house previous to his departure for london  graye had been requested by the architect to survey a plot of land nearly twenty miles off which with the journey to and fro would occupy him the whole day and prevent his returning till late in the evening cytherea made a companion of her landlady to the extent of sharing meals and sitting with her during the morning of her brothers absence midday found her restless and miserable under this arrangement all the afternoon she sat alone looking out of the window for she scarcely knew whom and hoping she scarcely knew what halfpast five oclock camethe end of springroves official day two minutes later springrove walked by  she endured her solitude for another halfhour and then could endure no longer she had hopedwhile affecting to fearthat edward would have found some reason or other for calling but it seemed that he had not hastily dressing herself she went out when the farce of an accidental meeting was repeated edward came upon her in the street at the first turning and like the great duke ferdinand in the statue and the bust     he looked at her as a lover can    she looked at him as one who awakes    the past was a sleep and her life began  shall we have a boat he said impulsively  how blissful it all is at first perhaps indeed the only bliss in the course of love which can truly be called edenlike is that which prevails immediately after doubt has ended and before reflection has set inat the dawn of the emotion when it is not recognized by name and before the consideration of what this love is has given birth to the consideration of what difficulties it tends to create when on the mans part the mistress appears to the minds eye in picturesque hazy and fresh morning lights and soft morning shadows when as yet she is known only as the wearer of one dress which shares her own personality as the stander in one special position the giver of one bright particular glance and the speaker of one tender sentence when on her part she is timidly careful over what she says and does lest she should be misconstrued or underrated to the breadth of a shadow of a hair  shall we have a boat he said again more softly seeing that to his first question she had not answered but looked uncertainly at the ground then almost but not quite in his face blushed a series of minute blushes left off in the midst of them and showed the usual signs of perplexity in a matter of the emotions  owen had always been with her before but there was now a force of habit in the proceeding and with arcadian innocence she assumed that a row on the water was under any circumstances a natural thing without another word being spoken on either side they went down the steps he carefully handed her in took his seat slid noiselessly off the sand and away from the shore  they thus sat facing each other in the graceful yellow cockleshell and his eyes frequently found a restingplace in the depths of hers the boat was so small that at each return of the sculls when his hands came forward to begin the pull they approached so near to her that her vivid imagination began to thrill her with a fancy that he was going to clasp his arms round her the sensation grew so strong that she could not run the risk of again meeting his eyes at those critical moments and turned aside to inspect the distant horizon then she grew weary of looking sideways and was driven to return to her natural position again at this instant he again leant forward to begin and met her glance by an ardent fixed gaze an involuntary impulse of girlish embarrassment caused her to give a vehement pull at the tillerrope which brought the boats head round till they stood directly for shore  his eyes which had dwelt upon her form during the whole time of her look askance now left her he perceived the direction in which they were going  why you have completely turned the boat miss graye he said looking over his shoulder look at our track on the watera great semicircle preceded by a series of zigzags as far as we can see  she looked attentively is it my fault or yours she inquired mine i suppose  i cant help saying that it is yours  she dropped the ropes decisively feeling the slightest twinge of vexation at the answer  why do you let go  i do it so badly  o no you turned about for shore in a masterly way do you wish to return  yes if you please  of course then i will at once  i fear what the people will think of usgoing in such absurd directions and all through my wretched steering  never mind what the people think a pause you surely are not so weak as to mind what the people think on such a matter as that  those words might almost be called too firm and hard to be given by him to her but never mind for almost the first time in her life she felt the charming sensation although on such an insignificant subject of being compelled into an opinion by a man she loved owen though less yielding physically and more practical would not have had the intellectual independence to answer a woman thus she replied quietly and honestlyas honestly as when she had stated the contrary fact a minute earlier  i dont mind  ill unship the tiller that you may have nothing to do going back but to hold your parasol he continued and arose to perform the operation necessarily leaning closely against her to guard against the risk of capsizing the boat as he reached his hands astern his warm breath touched and crept round her face like a caress but he was apparently only concerned with his task she looked guilty of something when he seated himself he read in her face what that something wasshe had experienced a pleasure from his touch but he flung a practical glance over his shoulder seized the oars and they sped in a straight line towards the shore  cytherea saw that he noted in her face what had passed in her heart and that noting it he continued as decided as before she was inwardly distressed she had not meant him to translate her words about returning home so literally at the first she had not intended him to learn her secret but more than all she was not able to endure the perception of his learning it and continuing unmoved  there was nothing but misery to come now they would step ashore he would say goodnight go to london tomorrow and the miserable she would lose him for ever she did not quite suppose what was the fact that a parallel thought was simultaneously passing through his mind  they were now within ten yards now within five he was only now waiting for a smooth to bring the boat in sweet sweet love must not be slain thus was the fair maids reasoning she was equal to the occasionladies areand delivered the god  do you want very much to land mr springrove she said letting her young violet eyes pine at him a very very little  i not at all said he looking an astonishment at her inquiry which a slight twinkle of his eye half belied but you do  i think that now we have come out and it is such a pleasant evening she said gently and sweetly i should like a little longer row if you dont mind ill try to steer better than before if it makes it easier for you ill try very hard  it was the turn of his face to tell a tale now he looked we understand each otherah we do darling turned the boat and pulled back into the bay once more  now steer wherever you will he said in a low voice never mind the directness of the coursewherever you will  shall it be creston shore she said pointing to a stretch of beach northward from budmouth esplanade  creston shore certainly he responded grasping the sculls she took the strings daintily and they wound away to the left  for a long time nothing was audible in the boat but the regular dip of the oars and their movement in the rowlocks springrove at length spoke  i must go away tomorrow he said tentatively  yes she replied faintly  to endeavour to advance a little in my profession in london  yes she said again with the same preoccupied softness  but i shant advance  why not architecture is a bewitching profession they say that an architects work is another mans play  yes but worldly advantage from an art doesnt depend upon mastering it i used to think it did but it doesnt those who get rich need have no skill at all as artists  what need they have  a certain kind of energy which men with any fondness for art possess very seldom indeedan earnestness in making acquaintances and a love for using them they give their whole attention to the art of dining out after mastering a few rudimentary facts to serve up in conversation now after saying that do i seem a man likely to make a name  you seem a man likely to make a mistake  whats that  to give too much room to the latent feeling which is rather common in these days among the unappreciated that because some remarkably successful men are fools all remarkably unsuccessful men are geniuses  pretty subtle for a young lady he said slowly from that remark i should fancy you had bought experience  she passed over the idea do try to succeed she said with wistful thoughtfulness leaving her eyes on him  springrove flushed a little at the earnestness of her words and mused then like cato the censor i shall do what i despise to be in the fashion he said at last well when i found all this out that i was speaking of what ever do you think i did from having already loved verse passionately i went on to read it continually then i went rhyming myself if anything on earth ruins a man for useful occupation and for content with reasonable success in a profession or trade it is the habit of writing verses on emotional subjects which had much better be left to die from want of nourishment  do you write poems now she said  none poetical days are getting past with me according to the usual rule writing rhymes is a stage people of my sort pass through as they pass through the stage of shaving for a beard or thinking they are illused or saying theres nothing in the world worth living for  then the difference between a common man and a recognized poet is that one has been deluded and cured of his delusion and the other continues deluded all his days  well theres just enough truth in what you say to make the remark unbearable however it doesnt matter to me now that i meditate the thankless muse no longer but he paused as if endeavouring to think what better thing he did  cythereas mind ran on to the succeeding lines of the poem and their startling harmony with the present situation suggested the fancy that he was sporting with her and brought an awkward contemplativeness to her face  springrove guessed her thoughts and in answer to them simply said yes then they were silent again  if i had known an amaryllis was coming here i should not have made arrangements for leaving he resumed  such levity superimposed on the notion of sport was intolerable to cytherea for a woman seems never to see any but the serious side of her attachment though the most devoted lover has all the time a vague and dim perception that he is losing his old dignity and frittering away his time  but will you not try again to get on in your profession try once more do try once more she murmured i am going to try again i have advertised for something to do  of course i will he said with an eager gesture and smile but we must remember that the fame of christopher wren himself depended upon the accident of a fire in pudding lane my successes seem to come very slowly i often think that before i am ready to live it will be time for me to die however i am tryingnot for fame now but for an easy life of reasonable comfort  it is a melancholy truth for the middle classes that in proportion as they develop by the study of poetry and art their capacity for conjugal love of the highest and purest kind they limit the possibility of their being able to exercise itthe very act putting out of their power the attainment of means sufficient for marriage the man who works up a good income has had no time to learn love to its solemn extreme the man who has learnt that has had no time to get rich  and if you should failutterly fail to get that reasonable wealth she said earnestly dont be perturbed the truly great stand upon no middle ledge they are either famous or unknown  unknown he said if their ideas have been allowed to flow with a sympathetic breadth famous only if they have been convergent and exclusive  yes and i am afraid from that that my remark was but discouragement wearing the dress of comfort perhaps i was not quite right in  it depends entirely upon what is meant by being truly great but the long and the short of the matter is that men must stick to a thing if they want to succeed in itnot giving way to overmuch admiration for the flowers they see growing in other peoples borders which i am afraid has been my case he looked into the far distance and paused  adherence to a course with persistence sufficient to ensure success is possible to widely appreciative minds only when there is also found in them a powercommonplace in its nature but rare in such combinationthe power of assuming to conviction that in the outlying paths which appear so much more brilliant than their own there are bitternesses equally greatunperceived simply on account of their remoteness  they were opposite ringsworth shore the cliffs here were formed of strata completely contrasting with those of the further side of the bay whilst in and beneath the water hard boulders had taken the place of sand and shingle between which however the sea glided noiselessly without breaking the crest of a single wave so strikingly calm was the air the breeze had entirely died away leaving the water of that rare glassy smoothness which is unmarked even by the small dimples of the least aerial movement purples and blues of divers shades were reflected from this mirror accordingly as each undulation sloped east or west they could see the rocky bottom some twenty feet beneath them luxuriant with weeds of various growths and dotted with pulpy creatures reflecting a silvery and spangled radiance upwards to their eyes  at length she looked at him to learn the effect of her words of encouragement he had let the oars drift alongside and the boat had come to a standstill everything on earth seemed taking a contemplative rest as if waiting to hear the avowal of something from his lips at that instant he appeared to break a resolution hitherto zealously kept leaving his seat amidships he came and gently edged himself down beside her upon the narrow seat at the stern  she breathed more quickly and warmly he took her right hand in his own right it was not withdrawn he put his left hand behind her neck till it came round upon her left cheek it was not thrust away lightly pressing her he brought her face and mouth towards his own when at this the very brink some unaccountable thought or spell within him suddenly made him halteven now and as it seemed as much to himself as to her he timidly whispered may i  her endeavour was to say no so denuded of its flesh and sinews that its nature would hardly be recognized or in other words a no from so near the affirmative frontier as to be affected with the yes accent it was thus a whispered no drawn out to nearly a quarter of a minutes length the o making itself audible as a sound like the spring coo of a pigeon on unusually friendly terms with its mate though conscious of her success in producing the kind of word she had wished to produce she at the same time trembled in suspense as to how it would be taken but the time available for doubt was so short as to admit of scarcely more than half a pulsation pressing closer he kissed her then he kissed her again with a longer kiss  it was the supremely happy moment of their experience the bloom and the purple light were strong on the lineaments of both their hearts could hardly believe the evidence of their lips  i love you and you love me cytherea he whispered  she did not deny it and all seemed well the gentle sounds around them from the hills the plains the distant town the adjacent shore the water heaving at their side the kiss and the long kiss were all many a voice of one delight and in unison with each other  but his mind flew back to the same unpleasant thought which had been connected with the resolution he had broken a minute or two earlier i could be a slave at my profession to win you cytherea i would work at the meanest honest trade to be near youmuch less claim you as mine i wouldanything but i have not told you all it is not this you dont know what there is yet to tell could you forgive as you can love she was alarmed to see that he had become pale with the question  nodo not speak he said i have kept something from you which has now become the cause of a great uneasiness i had no rightto love you but i did it something forbade  what she exclaimed  something forbade metill the kissyes till the kiss came and now nothing shall forbid it well hope in spite of all i must however speak of this love of ours to your brother dearest you had better go indoors whilst i meet him at the station and explain everything  cythereas shortlived bliss was dead and gone o if she had known of this sequel would she have allowed him to break down the barrier of mere acquaintanceshipnever never  will you not explain to me she faintly urged doubtindefinite carking doubt had taken possession of her  not now you alarm yourself unnecessarily he said tenderly my only reason for keeping silence is that with my present knowledge i may tell an untrue story it may be that there is nothing to tell i am to blame for haste in alluding to any such thing forgive me sweetforgive me her heart was ready to burst and she could not answer him he returned to his place and took to the oars  they again made for the distant esplanade now with its line of houses lying like a dark grey band against the light western sky the sun had set and a star or two began to peep out they drew nearer their destination edward as he pulled tracing listlessly with his eyes the red stripes upon her scarf which grew to appear as black ones in the increasing dusk of evening she surveyed the long line of lamps on the seawall of the town now looking small and yellow and seeming to send long taproots of fire quivering down deep into the sea byandby they reached the landingsteps he took her hand as before and found it as cold as the water about them it was not relinquished till he reached her door his assurance had not removed the constraint of her manner he saw that she blamed him mutely and with her eyes like a captured sparrow left alone he went and seated himself in a chair on the esplanade  neither could she go indoors to her solitary room feeling as she did in such a state of desperate heaviness when springrove was out of sight she turned back and arrived at the corner just in time to see him sit down then she glided pensively along the pavement behind him forgetting herself to marble like melancholy herself as she mused in his neighbourhood unseen she heard without heeding the notes of pianos and singing voices from the fashionable houses at her back from the open windows of which the lamplight streamed to join that of the orangehued full moon newly risen over the bay in front then edward began to pace up and down and cytherea fearing that he would notice her hastened homeward flinging him a last look as she passed out of sight no promise from him to write no request that she herself would do sonothing but an indefinite expression of hope in the face of some fear unknown to her alas alas  when owen returned he found she was not in the small sittingroom and creeping upstairs into her bedroom with a light he discovered her there lying asleep upon the coverlet of the bed still with her hat and jacket on she had flung herself down on entering and succumbed to the unwonted oppressiveness that ever attends fullblown love the wet traces of tears were yet visible upon her long drooping lashes       love is a sowre delight and sugred griefe      a living death and everdying life  cytherea he whispered kissing her she awoke with a start and vented an exclamation before recovering her judgment hes gone she said  he has told me all said graye soothingly he is going off early tomorrow morning twas a shame of him to win you away from me and cruel of you to keep the growth of this attachment a secret  we couldnt help it she said and then jumping upowen has he told you all  all of your love from beginning to end he said simply  edward then had not told moreas he ought to have done yet she could not convict him but she would struggle against his fetters she tingled to the very soles of her feet at the very possibility that he might be deluding her  owen she continued with dignity what is he to me nothing i must dismiss such weakness as thisbelieve me i will something far more pressing must drive it away i have been looking my position steadily in the face and i must get a living somehow i mean to advertise once more  advertising is no use  this one will be he looked surprised at the sanguine tone of her answer till she took a piece of paper from the table and showed it him see what i am going to do she said sadly almost bitterly this was her third effort     ladysmaid inexperienced age eighteeng 3 cross street   budmouth   owenowen the respectablelooked blank astonishment he repeated in a nameless varying tone the two words  ladysmaid  yes ladysmaid tis an honest profession said cytherea bravely  but you cytherea  yes iwho am i  you will never be a ladysmaidnever i am quite sure  i shall try to be at any rate  such a disgrace  nonsense i maintain that it is no disgrace she said rather warmly you know very well  well since you will you must he interrupted why do you put inexperienced  because i am  never mind thatscratch out inexperienced we are poor cytherea arent we he murmured after a silence and it seems that the two months will close my engagement here  we can put up with being poor she said if they only give us work to do yes we desire as a blessing what was given us as a curse and even that is denied however be cheerful owen and never mind  in justice to desponding men it is as well to remember that the brighter endurance of women at these epochsinvaluable sweet angelic as it isowes more of its origin to a narrower vision that shuts out many of the leadeneyed despairs in the van than to a hopefulness intense enough to quell them     iv the events of one day  1 august the fourth till four oclock  the early part of the next week brought an answer to cythereas last note of hope in the way of advertisementnot from a distance of hundreds of miles london scotland ireland the continentas cytherea seemed to think it must to be in keeping with the means adopted for obtaining it but from a place in the neighbourhood of that in which she was livinga country mansion not twenty miles off the reply ran thus                         knapwater house                          august 3 1864  miss aldclyffe is in want of a young person as ladysmaid the duties of the place are light miss aldclyffe will be in budmouth on thursday when should g still not have heard of a place she would like to see her at the belvedere hotel esplanade at four oclock no answer need be returned to this note   a little earlier than the time named cytherea clothed in a modest bonnet and a black silk jacket turned down to the hotel expectation the fresh air from the water the bright farextending outlook raised the most delicate of pink colours to her cheeks and restored to her tread a portion of that elasticity which her past troubles and thoughts of edward had wellnigh taken away  she entered the vestibule and went to the window of the bar  is miss aldclyffe here she said to a nicelydressed barmaid in the foreground who was talking to a landlady covered with chains knobs and clamps of gold in the background  no she isnt said the barmaid not very civilly cytherea looked a shade too pretty for a plain dresser  miss aldclyffe is expected here the landlady said to a third person out of sight in the tone of one who had known for several days the fact newly discovered from cytherea get ready her roombe quick from the alacrity with which the order was given and taken it seemed to cytherea that miss aldclyffe must be a woman of considerable importance  you are to have an interview with miss aldclyffe here the landlady inquired  yes  the young person had better wait continued the landlady with a moneytakers intuition she had rightly divined that cytherea would bring no profit to the house  cytherea was shown into a nondescript chamber on the shady side of the building which appeared to be either bedroom or dayroom as occasion necessitated and was one of a suite at the end of the firstfloor corridor the prevailing colour of the walls curtains carpet and coverings of furniture was more or less blue to which the cold light coming from the north easterly sky and falling on a wide roof of new slatesthe only object the small window commandedimparted a more striking paleness but underneath the door communicating with the next room of the suite gleamed an infinitesimally small yet very powerful fraction of contrasta very thin line of ruddy light showing that the sun beamed strongly into this room adjoining the line of radiance was the only cheering thing visible in the place  people give way to very infantine thoughts and actions when they wait the battlefield of life is temporarily fenced off by a hard and fast linethe interview cytherea fixed her eyes idly upon the streak and began picturing a wonderful paradise on the other side as the source of such a beamreminding her of the wellknown good deed in a naughty world  whilst she watched the particles of dust floating before the brilliant chink she heard a carriage and horses stop opposite the front of the house afterwards came the rustle of a ladys skirts down the corridor and into the room communicating with the one cytherea occupied  the golden line vanished in parts like the phosphorescent streak caused by the striking of a match there was the fall of a light footstep on the floor just behind it then a pause then the foot tapped impatiently and theres no one here was spoken imperiously by a ladys tongue  no madam in the next room i am going to fetch her said the attendant  that will door you neednt go in i will call her  cytherea had risen and she advanced to the middle door with the chink under it as the servant retired she had just laid her hand on the knob when it slipped round within her fingers and the door was pulled open from the other side  2 four oclock  the direct blaze of the afternoon sun partly refracted through the crimson curtains of the window and heightened by reflections from the crimsonflock paper which covered the walls and a carpet on the floor of the same tint shone with a burning glow round the form of a lady standing close to cythereas front with the door in her hand the stranger appeared to the maidens eyesfresh from the blue gloom and assisted by an imagination fresh from naturelike a tall black figure standing in the midst of fire it was the figure of a finelybuilt woman of spare though not angular proportions  cytherea involuntarily shaded her eyes with her hand retreated a step or two and then she could for the first time see miss aldclyffes face in addition to her outline lit up by the secondary and softer light that was reflected from the varnished panels of the door she was not a very young woman but could boast of much beauty of the majestic autumnal phase  o said the lady come this way cytherea followed her to the embrasure of the window  both the women showed off themselves to advantage as they walked forward in the orange light and each showed too in her face that she had been struck with her companions appearance the warm tint added to cythereas face a voluptuousness which youth and a simple life had not yet allowed to express itself there ordinarily whilst in the elder ladys face it reduced the customary expression which might have been called sternness if not harshness to grandeur and warmed her decaying complexion with much of the youthful richness it plainly had once possessed  she appeared now no more than fiveandthirty though she might easily have been ten or a dozen years older she had clear steady eyes a roman nose in its purest form and also the round prominent chin with which the caesars are represented in ancient marbles a mouth expressing a capability for and tendency to strong emotion habitually controlled by pride there was a severity about the lower outlines of the face which gave a masculine cast to this portion of her countenance womanly weakness was nowhere visible save in one partthe curve of her forehead and browsthere it was clear and emphatic she wore a lace shawl over a brown silk dress and a net bonnet set with a few blue cornflowers  you inserted the advertisement for a situation as ladysmaid giving the address g cross street  yes madam graye  yes i have heard your namemrs morris my housekeeper mentioned you and pointed out your advertisement  this was puzzling intelligence but there was not time enough to consider it  where did you live last continued miss aldclyffe  i have never been a servant before i lived at home  never been out i thought too at sight of you that you were too girlishlooking to have done much but why did you advertise with such assurance it misleads people  i am very sorry i put inexperienced at first but my brother said it is absurd to trumpet your own weakness to the world and would not let it remain  but your mother knew what was right i suppose  i have no mother madam  your father then  i have no father  well she said more softly your sisters aunts or cousins  they didnt think anything about it  you didnt ask them i suppose  no  you should have done so then why didnt you  because i havent any of them either  miss aldclyffe showed her surprise you deserve forgiveness then at any rate child she said in a sort of drilykind tone however i am afraid you do not suit me as i am looking for an elderly person you see i want an experienced maid who knows all the usual duties of the office she was going to add though i like your appearance but the words seemed offensive to apply to the ladylike girl before her and she modified them to though i like you much  i am sorry i misled you madam said cytherea  miss aldclyffe stood in a reverie without replying  good afternoon continued cytherea  goodbye miss grayei hope you will succeed  cytherea turned away towards the door the movement chanced to be one of her masterpieces it was precise it had as much beauty as was compatible with precision and as little coquettishness as was compatible with beauty  and she had in turning looked over her shoulder at the other lady with a faint accent of reproach in her face those who remember greuzes head of a girl have an idea of cythereas look askance at the turning it is not for a man to tell fishers of men how to set out their fascinations so as to bring about the highest possible average of takes within the year but the action that tugs the hardest of all at an emotional beholder is this sweet method of turning which steals the bosom away and leaves the eyes behind  now miss aldclyffe herself was no tyro at wheeling when cytherea had closed the door upon her she remained for some time in her motionless attitude listening to the gradually dying sound of the maidens retreating footsteps she murmured to herself it is almost worth while to be bored with instructing her in order to have a creature who could glide round my luxurious indolent body in that manner and look at me in that wayi warrant how light her fingers are upon ones head and neck what a silly modest young thing she is to go away so suddenly as that she rang the bell  ask the young lady who has just left me to step back again she said to the attendant quick or she will be gone  cytherea was now in the vestibule thinking that if she had told her history miss aldclyffe might perhaps have taken her into the household yet her history she particularly wished to conceal from a stranger when she was recalled she turned back without feeling much surprise something she knew not what told her she had not seen the last of miss aldclyffe  you have somebody to refer me to of course the lady said when cytherea had reentered the room  yes mr thorn a solicitor at aldbrickham  and are you a clever needlewoman  i am considered to be  then i think that at any rate i will write to mr thorn said miss aldclyffe with a little smile it is true the whole proceeding is very irregular but my present maid leaves next monday and neither of the five i have already seen seem to do for me well i will write to mr thorn and if his reply is satisfactory you shall hear from me it will be as well to set yourself in readiness to come on monday  when cytherea had again been watched out of the room miss aldclyffe asked for writing materials that she might at once communicate with mr thorn she indecisively played with the pen suppose mr thorns reply to be in any way dishearteningand even if so from his own imperfect acquaintance with the young creature more than from circumstantial knowledgei shall feel obliged to give her up then i shall regret that i did not give her one trial in spite of other peoples prejudices all her account of herself is reliable enoughyes i can see that by her face i like that face of hers  miss aldclyffe put down the pen and left the hotel without writing to mr thorn     v the events of one day  1 august the eighth morning and afternoon  at posttime on that following monday morning cytherea watched so anxiously for the postman that as the time which must bring him narrowed less and less her vivid expectation had only a degree less tangibility than his presence itself in another second his form came into view he brought two letters for cytherea  one from miss aldclyffe simply stating that she wished cytherea to come on trial that she would require her to be at knapwater house by monday evening  the other was from edward springrove he told her that she was the bright spot of his life that her existence was far dearer to him than his own that he had never known what it was to love till he had met her true he had felt passing attachments to other faces from time to time but they all had been weak inclinations towards those faces as they then appeared he loved her past and future as well as her present he pictured her as a child he loved her he pictured her of sage years he loved her he pictured her in trouble he loved her homely friendship entered into his love for her without which all love was evanescent  he would make one depressing statement uncontrollable circumstances a long history with which it was impossible to acquaint her at present operated to a certain extent as a drag upon his wishes he had felt this more strongly at the time of their parting than he did nowand it was the cause of his abrupt behaviour for which he begged her to forgive him he saw now an honourable way of freeing himself and the perception had prompted him to write in the meantime might he indulge in the hope of possessing her on some bright future day when by hard labour generated from her own encouraging words he had placed himself in a position she would think worthy to be shared with him  dear little letter she huddled it up so much more important a loveletter seems to a girl than to a man springrove was unconsciously clever in his letters and a man with a talent of that kind may write himself up to a hero in the mind of a young woman who loves him without knowing much about him springrove already stood a cubit higher in her imagination than he did in his shoes  during the day she flitted about the room in an ecstasy of pleasure packing the things and thinking of an answer which should be worthy of the tender tone of the question her love bubbling from her involuntarily like prophesyings from a prophet  in the afternoon owen went with her to the railwaystation and put her in the train for carriford road the station nearest to knapwater house  halfanhour later she stepped out upon the platform and found nobody there to receive herthough a ponycarriage was waiting outside in two minutes she saw a melancholy man in cheerful livery running towards her from a publichouse close adjoining who proved to be the servant sent to fetch her there are two ways of getting rid of sorrows one by living them down the other by drowning them the coachman drowned his  he informed her that her luggage would be fetched by a springwaggon in about halfanhour then helped her into the chaise and drove off  her lovers letter lying close against her neck fortified her against the restless timidity she had previously felt concerning this new undertaking and completely furnished her with the confident ease of mind which is required for the critical observation of surrounding objects it was just that stage in the slow decline of the summer days when the deep dark and vacuous hotweather shadows are beginning to be replaced by blue ones that have a surface and substance to the eye they trotted along the turnpike road for a distance of about a mile which brought them just outside the village of carriford and then turned through large lodgegates on the heavy stone piers of which stood a pair of bitterns cast in bronze they then entered the park and wound along a drive shaded by old and drooping limetrees not arranged in the form of an avenue but standing irregularly sometimes leaving the track completely exposed to the sky at other times casting a shade over it which almost approached gloomthe under surface of the lowest boughs hanging at a uniform level of six feet above the grassthe extreme height to which the nibbling mouths of the cattle could reach  is that the house said cytherea expectantly catching sight of a grey gable between the trees and losing it again  no thats the old manorhouseor rather all thats left of it the aldycliffes used to let it sometimes but it was oftener empty tis now divided into three cottages respectable people didnt care to live there  why didnt they  well tis so awkward and unhandy you see so much of it has been pulled down and the rooms that are left wont do very well for a small residence tis so dismal too and like most old houses stands too low down in the hollow to be healthy  do they tell any horrid stories about it  no not a single one  ah thats a pity  yes thats what i say tis jest the house for a nice ghastly haironend story that would make the parish religious perhaps it will have one some day to make it complete but theres not a word of the kind now there i wouldnt live there for all that in fact i couldnt o no i couldnt  why couldnt you  the sounds  what are they  one is the waterfall which stands so close by that you can hear that there waterfall in every room of the house night or day ill or well tis enough to drive anybody mad now hark  he stopped the horse above the slight common sounds in the air came the unvarying steady rush of falling water from some spot unseen on account of the thick foliage of the grove  theres something awful in the timing o that sound aint there miss  when you say there is there really seems to be you said there were twowhat is the other horrid sound  the pumpingengine thats close by the old house and sends water up the hill and all over the great house we shall hear that directly there now hark again  from the same direction down the dell they could now hear the whistling creak of cranks repeated at intervals of halfaminute with a sousing noise between each a creak a souse then another creak and so on continually  now if anybody could make shift to live through the other sounds these would finish him off dont you think so miss that machine goes on night and day summer and winter and is hardly ever greased or visited ah it tries the nerves at night especially if you are not very well though we dont often hear it at the great house  that sound is certainly very dismal they might have the wheel greased does miss aldclyffe take any interest in these things  well scarcely you see her father doesnt attend to that sort of thing as he used to the engine was once quite his hobby but now hes getten old and very seldom goes there  how many are there in family  only her father and herself hes a old man of seventy  i had thought that miss aldclyffe was sole mistress of the property and lived here alone  no m the coachman was continually checking himself thus being about to style her miss involuntarily and then recollecting that he was only speaking to the new ladysmaid  she will soon be mistress however i am afraid he continued as if speaking by a spirit of prophecy denied to ordinary humanity the poor old gentleman has decayed very fast lately the man then drew a long breath  why did you breathe sadly like that said cytherea  ah

reasonable limits  tis to be hoped youll please in dressen her tonight  why tonight  theres a dinnerparty of seventeen tis her fathers birthday and shes very particular about her looks at such times now see this is the house livelier up here isnt it miss  they were now on rising ground and had just emerged from a clump of trees still a little higher than where they stood was situated the mansion called knapwater house the offices gradually losing themselves among the trees behind  2 evening  the house was regularly and substantially built of clean grey freestone throughout in that plainer fashion of greek classicism which prevailed at the latter end of the last century when the copyists called designers had grown weary of fantastic variations in the roman orders the main block approximated to a square on the ground plan having a projection in the centre of each side surmounted by a pediment from each angle of the inferior side ran a line of buildings lower than the rest turning inwards again at their further end and forming within them a spacious open court within which resounded an echo of astonishing clearness these erections were in their turn backed by ivycovered icehouses laundries and stables the whole mass of subsidiary buildings being half buried beneath closeset shrubs and trees  there was opening sufficient through the foliage on the right hand to enable her on nearer approach to form an idea of the arrangement of the remoter or lawn front also the natural features and contour of this quarter of the site had evidently dictated the position of the house primarily and were of the ordinary and upon the whole most satisfactory kind namely a broad graceful slope running from the terrace beneath the walls to the margin of a placid lake lying below upon the surface of which a dozen swans and a green punt floated at leisure an irregular wooded island stood in the midst of the lake beyond this and the further margin of the water were plantations and greensward of varied outlines the trees heightening by half veiling the softness of the exquisite landscape stretching behind  the glimpses she had obtained of this portion were now checked by the angle of the building in a minute or two they reached the side door at which cytherea alighted she was welcomed by an elderly woman of lengthy smiles and general pleasantness who announced herself to be mrs morris the housekeeper  mrs graye i believe she said  i am noto yes yes we are all mistresses said cytherea smiling but forcedly the title accorded her seemed disagreeably like the first slight scar of a brand and she thought of owens prophecy  mrs morris led her into a comfortable parlour called the room here tea was made ready and cytherea sat down looking whenever occasion allowed at mrs morris with great interest and curiosity to discover if possible something in her which should give a clue to the secret of her knowledge of herself and the recommendation based upon it but nothing was to be learnt at any rate just then mrs morris was perpetually getting up feeling in her pockets going to cupboards leaving the room two or three minutes and trotting back again  youll excuse me mrs graye she said but tis the old gentlemans birthday and they always have a lot of people to dinner on that day though hes getting up in years now however none of them are sleepersshe generally keeps the house pretty clear of lodgers being a lady with no intimate friends though many acquaintances which though it gives us less to do makes it all the duller for the younger maids in the house mrs morris then proceeded to give in fragmentary speeches an outline of the constitution and government of the estate  now are you sure you have quite done tea not a bit or drop more why youve eaten nothing im sure well now it is rather inconvenient that the other maid is not here to show you the ways of the house a little but she left last saturday and miss aldclyffe has been making shift with poor old clumsy me for a maid all yesterday and this morning she is not come in yet i expect she will ask for you mrs graye the first thing i was going to say that if you have really done tea i will take you upstairs and show you through the wardrobesmiss aldclyffes things are not laid out for tonight yet  she preceded cytherea upstairs pointed out her own room and then took her into miss aldclyffes dressingroom on the firstfloor where after explaining the whereabouts of various articles of apparel the housekeeper left her telling her that she had an hour yet upon her hands before dressingtime cytherea laid out upon the bed in the next room all that she had been told would be required that evening and then went again to the little room which had been appropriated to herself  here she sat down by the open window leant out upon the sill like another blessed damozel and listlessly looked down upon the brilliant pattern of colours formed by the flowerbeds on the lawnnow richly crowded with late summer blossom but the vivacity of spirit which had hitherto enlivened her was fast ebbing under the pressure of prosaic realities and the warm scarlet of the geraniums glowing most conspicuously and mingling with the vivid cold red and green of the verbenas the rich depth of the dahlia and the ripe mellowness of the calceolaria backed by the pale hue of a flock of meek sheep feeding in the open park close to the other side of the fence were to a great extent lost upon her eyes she was thinking that nothing seemed worth while that it was possible she might die in a workhouse and what did it matter the petty vulgar details of servitude that she had just passed through her dependence upon the whims of a strange woman the necessity of quenching all individuality of character in herself and relinquishing her own peculiar tastes to help on the wheel of this alien establishment made her sick and sad and she almost longed to pursue some free outofdoors employment sleep under trees or a hut and know no enemy but winter and cold weather like shepherds and cowkeepers and birds and animalsay like the sheep she saw there under her window she looked sympathizingly at them for several minutes imagining their enjoyment of the rich grass  yeslike those sheep she said aloud and her face reddened with surprise at a discovery she made that very instant  the flock consisted of some ninety or a hundred young stock ewes the surface of their fleece was as rounded and even as a cushion and white as milk now she had just observed that on the left buttock of every one of them were marked in distinct red letters the initials e s  e s could bring to cythereas mind only one thought but that immediately and for everthe name of her lover edward springrove  o if it should be she interrupted her words by a resolve miss aldclyffes carriage at the same moment made its appearance in the drive but miss aldclyffe was not her object now it was to ascertain to whom the sheep belonged and to set her surmise at rest one way or the other she flew downstairs to mrs morris  whose sheep are those in the park mrs morris  farmer springroves  what farmer springrove is that she said quickly  why surely you know your friend farmer springrove the cidermaker and who keeps the three tranters inn who recommended you to me when he came in to see me the other day  cythereas motherwit suddenly warned her in the midst of her excitement that it was necessary not to betray the secret of her love o yes she said of course her thoughts had run as follows in that short interval  farmer springrove is edwards father and his name is edward too  edward knew i was going to advertise for a situation of some kind  he watched the times and saw it my address being attached  he thought it would be excellent for me to be here that we might meet whenever he came home  he told his father that i might be recommended as a ladysmaid and he knew my brother and myself  his father told mrs morris mrs morris told miss aldclyffe  the whole chain of incidents that drew her there was plain and there was no such thing as chance in the matter it was all edwards doing  the sound of a bell was heard cytherea did not heed it and still continued in her reverie  thats miss aldclyffes bell said mrs morris  i suppose it is said the young woman placidly  well it means that you must go up to her the matron continued in a tone of surprise  cytherea felt a burning heat come over her mingled with a sudden irritation at mrs morriss hint but the good sense which had recognized stern necessity prevailed over rebellious independence the flush passed and she said hastily  yes yes of course i must go to her when she pulls the bellwhether i want to or no  however in spite of this painful reminder of her new position in life cytherea left the apartment in a mood far different from the gloomy sadness of ten minutes previous the place felt like home to her now she did not mind the pettiness of her occupation because edward evidently did not mind it and this was edwards own spot she found time on her way to miss aldclyffes dressingroom to hurriedly glide out by a side door and look for a moment at the unconscious sheep bearing the friendly initials she went up to them to try to touch one of the flock and felt vexed that they all stared sceptically at her kind advances and then ran pellmell down the hill then fearing any one should discover her childish movements she slipped indoors again and ascended the staircase catching glimpses as she passed of silverbuttoned footmen who flashed about the passages like lightning  miss aldclyffes dressingroom was an apartment which on a casual survey conveyed an impression that it was available for almost any purpose save the adornment of the feminine person in its hours of perfect order nothing pertaining to the toilet was visible even the inevitable mirrors with their accessories were arranged in a roomy recess not noticeable from the door lighted by a window of its own called the dressingwindow  the washingstand figured as a vast oak chest carved with grotesque renaissance ornament the dressing table was in appearance something between a high altar and a cabinet piano the surface being richly worked in the same style of semiclassic decoration but the extraordinary outline having been arrived at by an ingenious joiner and decorator from the neighbouring town after months of painful toil in cutting and fitting under miss aldclyffes immediate eye the materials being the remains of two or three old cabinets the lady had found in the lumberroom about twothirds of the floor was carpeted the remaining portion being laid with parquetry of light and dark woods  miss aldclyffe was standing at the larger window away from the dressingniche she bowed and said pleasantly i am glad you have come we shall get on capitally i dare say  her bonnet was off cytherea did not think her so handsome as on the earlier day the queenliness of her beauty was harder and less warm but a worse discovery than this was that miss aldclyffe with the usual obliviousness of rich people to their dependents specialities seemed to have quite forgotten cythereas inexperience and mechanically delivered up her body to her handmaid without a thought of details and with a mild yawn  everything went well at first the dress was removed stockings and black boots were taken off and silk stockings and white shoes were put on miss aldclyffe then retired to bathe her hands and face and cytherea drew breath if she could get through this first evening all would be right she felt that it was unfortunate that such a crucial test for her powers as a birthday dinner should have been applied on the threshold of her arrival but set to again  miss aldclyffe was now arrayed in a white dressinggown and dropped languidly into an easychair pushed up before the glass the instincts of her sex and her own practice told cytherea the next movement she let miss aldclyffes hair fall about her shoulders and began to arrange it it proved to be all real a satisfaction  miss aldclyffe was musingly looking on the floor and the operation went on for some minutes in silence at length her thoughts seemed to turn to the present and she lifted her eyes to the glass  why what on earth are you doing with my head she exclaimed with widely opened eyes at the words she felt the back of cythereas little hand tremble against her neck  perhaps you prefer it done the other fashion madam said the maiden  no no thats the fashion right enough but you must make more show of my hair than that or i shall have to buy some which god forbid  it is how i do my own said cytherea naively and with a sweetness of tone that would have pleased the most acrimonious under favourable circumstances but tyranny was in the ascendant with miss aldclyffe at this moment and she was assured of palatable food for her vice by having felt the trembling of cythereas hand  yours indeed your hair come go on considering that cytherea possessed at least five times as much of that valuable auxiliary to womans beauty as the lady before her there was at the same time some excuse for miss aldclyffes outburst she remembered herself however and said more quietly now then grayebythebye what do they call you downstairs  mrs graye said the handmaid  then tell them not to do any such absurd thingnot but that it is quite according to usage but you are too young yet  this dialogue tided cytherea safely onward through the hairdressing till the flowers and diamonds were to be placed upon the ladys brow cytherea began arranging them tastefully and to the very best of her judgment  that wont do said miss aldclyffe harshly  why  i look too youngan old dressed doll  will that madam  no i look a frighta perfect fright  this way perhaps  heavens dont worry me so she shut her lips like a trap  having once worked herself up to the belief that her headdress was to be a failure that evening no cleverness of cythereas in arranging it could please her she continued in a smouldering passion during the remainder of the performance keeping her lips firmly closed and the muscles of her body rigid finally snatching up her gloves and taking her handkerchief and fan in her hand she silently sailed out of the room without betraying the least consciousness of another womans presence behind her  cythereas fears that at the undressing this suppressed anger would find a vent kept her on thorns throughout the evening she tried to read she could not she tried to sew she could not she tried to muse she could not do that connectedly if this is the beginning what will the end be she said in a whisper and felt many misgivings as to the policy of being overhasty in establishing an independence at the expense of congruity with a cherished past  3 midnight  the clock struck twelve the aldclyffe state dinner was over the company had all gone and miss aldclyffes bell rang loudly and jerkingly  cytherea started to her feet at the sound which broke in upon a fitful sleep that had overtaken her she had been sitting drearily in her chair waiting minute after minute for the signal her brain in that state of intentness which takes cognizance of the passage of time as a real motionmotion without matterthe instants throbbing past in the company of a feverish pulse she hastened to the room to find the lady sitting before the dressing shrine illuminated on both sides and looking so queenly in her attitude of absolute repose that the younger woman felt the awfullest sense of responsibility at her vandalism in having undertaken to demolish so imposing a pile  the ladys jewelled ornaments were taken off in silencesome by her own listless hands some by cythereas then followed the outer stratum of clothing the dress being removed cytherea took it in her hand and went with it into the bedroom adjoining intending to hang it in the wardrobe but on second thoughts in order that she might not keep miss aldclyffe waiting a moment longer than necessary she flung it down on the first restingplace that came to hand which happened to be the bed and reentered the dressingroom with the noiseless footfall of a kitten she paused in the middle of the room  she was unnoticed and her sudden return had plainly not been expected during the short time of cythereas absence miss aldclyffe had pulled off a kind of chemisette of brussels net drawn high above the throat which she had worn with her evening dress as a semiopaque covering to her shoulders and in its place had put her nightgown round her her right hand was lifted to her neck as if engaged in fastening her nightgown  but on a second glance miss aldclyffes proceeding was clearer to cytherea she was not fastening her nightgown it had been carelessly thrown round her and miss aldclyffe was really occupied in holding up to her eyes some small object that she was keenly scrutinizing and now on suddenly discovering the presence of cytherea at the back of the apartment instead of naturally continuing or concluding her inspection she desisted hurriedly the tiny snap of a spring was heard her hand was removed and she began adjusting her robes  modesty might have directed her hasty action of enwrapping her shoulders but it was scarcely likely considering miss aldclyffes temperament that she had all her life been used to a maid cythereas youth and the elder ladys marked treatment of her as if she were a mere child or plaything the matter was too slight to reason about and yet upon the whole it seemed that miss aldclyffe must have a practical reason for concealing her neck  with a timid sense of being an intruder cytherea was about to step back and out of the room but at the same moment miss aldclyffe turned saw the impulse and told her companion to stay looking into her eyes as if she had half an intention to explain something cytherea felt certain it was the little mystery of her late movements the other withdrew her eyes cytherea went to fetch the dressinggown and wheeled round again to bring it up to miss aldclyffe who had now partly removed her nightdress to put it on the proper way and still sat with her back towards cytherea  her neck was again quite open and uncovered and though hidden from the direct line of cythereas vision she saw it reflected in the glassthe fair white surface and the inimitable combination of curves between throat and bosom which artists adore being brightly lit up by the light burning on either side  and the ladys prior proceedings were now explained in the simplest manner in the midst of her breast like an island in a sea of pearl reclined an exquisite little gold locket embellished with arabesque work of blue red and white enamel that was undoubtedly what miss aldclyffe had been contemplating and moreover not having been put off with her other ornaments it was to be retained during the nighta slight departure from the custom of ladies which miss aldclyffe had at first not cared to exhibit to her new assistant though now on further thought she seemed to have become indifferent on the matter  my dressinggown she said quietly fastening her nightdress as she spoke  cytherea came forward with it miss aldclyffe did not turn her head but looked inquiringly at her maid in the glass  you saw what i wear on my neck i suppose she said to cythereas reflected face  yes madam i did said cytherea to miss aldclyffes reflected face  miss aldclyffe again looked at cythereas reflection as if she were on the point of explaining again she checked her resolve and said lightly  few of my maids discover that i wear it always i generally keep it a secretnot that it matters much but i was careless with you and seemed to want to tell you you win me to make confidences that  she ceased took cythereas hand in her own lifted the locket with the other touched the spring and disclosed a miniature  it is a handsome face is it not she whispered mournfully and even timidly  it is  but the sight had gone through cytherea like an electric shock and there was an instantaneous awakening of perception in her so thrilling in its presence as to be wellnigh insupportable the face in the miniature was the face of her own fatheryounger and fresher than she had ever known himbut her father  was this the woman of his wild and unquenchable early love and was this the woman who had figured in the gatemans story as answering the name of cytherea before her judgment was awake surely it was and if so here was the tangible outcrop of a romantic and hidden stratum of the past hitherto seen only in her imagination but as far as her scope allowed clearly defined therein by reason of its strangeness  miss aldclyffes eyes and thoughts were so intent upon the miniature that she had not been conscious of cythereas start of surprise she went on speaking in a low and abstracted tone  yes i lost him she interrupted her words by a short meditation and went on again i lost him by excess of honesty as regarded my past but it was best that it should be so i was led to think rather more than usual of the circumstances tonight because of your name it is pronounced the same way though differently spelt  the only means by which cythereas surname could have been spelt to miss aldclyffe must have been by mrs morris or farmer springrove she fancied farmer springrove would have spelt it properly if edward was his informant which made miss aldclyffes remark obscure  women make confidences and then regret them the impulsive rush of feeling which had led miss aldclyffe to indulge in this revelation trifling as it was died out immediately her words were beyond recall and the turmoil occasioned in her by dwelling upon that chapter of her life found vent in another kind of emotionthe result of a trivial accident  cytherea after letting down miss aldclyffes hair adopted some plan with it to which the lady had not been accustomed a rapid revulsion to irritation ensued the maidens mere touch seemed to discharge the pentup regret of the lady as if she had been a jar of electricity  how strangely you treat my hair she exclaimed  a silence  i have told you what i never tell my maids as a rule of course nothing that i say in this room is to be mentioned outside it she spoke crossly no less than emphatically  it shall not be madam said cytherea agitated and vexed that the woman of her romantic wonderings should be so disagreeable to her  why on earth did i tell you of my past she went on  cytherea made no answer  the ladys vexation with herself and the accident which had led to the disclosure swelled little by little till it knew no bounds but what was done could not be undone and though cytherea had shown a most winning responsiveness quarrel miss aldclyffe must she recurred to the subject of cythereas want of expertness like a bitter reviewer who finding the sentiments of a poet unimpeachable quarrels with his rhymes  never never before did i serve myself such a trick as this in engaging a maid she waited for an expostulation none came miss aldclyffe tried again  the idea of my taking a girl without asking her more than three questions or having a single reference all because of her good l the shape of her face and body it was a fools trick there i am served right quite rightby being deceived in such a way  i didnt deceive you said cytherea the speech was an unfortunate one and was the very fuel to maintain its fires that the others petulance desired  you did she said hotly  i told you i couldnt promise to be acquainted with every detail of routine just at first  will you contradict me in this way you are telling untruths i say  cythereas lip quivered i would answer the remark ifif  if what  if it were a ladys  you girl of impudencewhat do you say leave the room this instant i tell you  and i tell you that a person who speaks to a lady as you do to me is no lady herself  to a lady a ladysmaid speaks in this way the idea  dont ladysmaid me nobody is my mistress i wont have it  good heavens  i wouldnt have comenoi wouldnt if i had known  what  that you were such an illtempered unjust woman  possest beyond the muses painting miss aldclyffe exclaimed  a woman am i ill teach you if i am a woman and lifted her hand as if she would have liked to strike her companion this stung the maiden into absolute defiance  i dare you to touch me she cried strike me if you dare madam i am not afraid of youwhat do you mean by such an action as that  miss aldclyffe was disconcerted at this unexpected show of spirit and ashamed of her unladylike impulse now it was put into words she sank back in the chair i was not going to strike yougo to your roomi beg you to go to your room she repeated in a husky whisper  cytherea red and panting took up her candlestick and advanced to the table to get a light as she stood close to them the rays from the candles struck sharply on her face she usually bore a much stronger likeness to her mother than to her father but now looking with a grave reckless and angered expression of countenance at the kindling wick as she held it slanting into the other flame her fathers features were distinct in her it was the first time miss aldclyffe had seen her in a passionate mood and wearing that expression which was invariably its concomitant it was miss aldclyffes turn to start now and the remark she made was an instance of that sudden change of tone from highflown invective to the pettiness of curiosity which so often makes womens quarrels ridiculous even miss aldclyffes dignity had not sufficient power to postpone the absorbing desire she now felt to settle the strange suspicion that had entered her head  you spell your name the common way g r e y dont you she said with assumed indifference  no said cytherea poised on the side of her foot and still looking into the flame  yes surely the name was spelt that way on your boxes i looked and saw it myself  the enigma of miss aldclyffes mistake was solved o was it said cytherea ah i remember mrs jackson the lodginghouse keeper at budmouth labelled them we spell our name g r a y e  what was your fathers trade  cytherea thought it would be useless to attempt to conceal facts any longer his was not a trade she said he was an architect  the idea of your being an architects daughter  theres nothing to offend you in that i hope  o no  why did you say the idea  leave that alone did he ever visit in gower street bloomsbury one christmas many years agobut you would not know that  i have heard him say that mr huntway a curate somewhere in that part of london and who died there was an old college friend of his  what is your christian name  cytherea  no and is it really and you knew that face i showed you yes i see you did miss aldclyffe stopped and closed her lips impassibly she was a little agitated  do you want me any longer said cytherea standing candle in hand and looking quietly in miss aldclyffes face  wellno no longer said the other lingeringly  with your permission i will leave the house to morrow morning madam  ah miss aldclyffe had no notion of what she was saying  and i know you will be so good as not to intrude upon me during the short remainder of my stay  saying this cytherea left the room before her companion had answered miss aldclyffe then had recognized her at last and had been curious about her name from the beginning  the other members of the household had retired to rest as cytherea went along the passage leading to her room her skirts rustled against the partition a door on her left opened and mrs morris looked out  i waited out of bed till you came up she said it being your first night in case you should be at a loss for anything how have you got on with miss aldclyffe  pretty wellthough not so well as i could have wished  has she been scolding  a little  shes a very odd ladytis all one way or the other with her shes not bad at heart but unbearable in close quarters those of us who dont have much to do with her personally stay on for years and years  has miss aldclyffes family always been rich said cytherea  o no the property with the name came from her mothers uncle her family is a branch of the old aldclyffe family on the maternal side her mother married a bradleigha mere nobody at that timeand was on that account cut by her relations but very singularly the other branch of the family died out one by onethree of them and miss aldclyffes greatuncle then left all his property including this estate to captain bradleigh and his wifemiss aldclyffes father and motheron condition that they took the old family name as well theres all about it in the landed gentry tis a thing very often done  o i see thank you well now i am going goodnight     vi the events of twelve hours  1 august the ninth one to two oclock am  cytherea entered her bedroom and flung herself on the bed bewildered by a whirl of thought only one subject was clear in her mind and it was that in spite of family discoveries that day was to be the first and last of her experience as a ladysmaid starvation itself should not compel her to hold such a humiliating post for another instant ah she thought with a sigh at the martyrdom of her last little fragment of selfconceit owen knows everything better than i  she jumped up and began making ready for her departure in the morning the tears streaming down when she grieved and wondered what practical matter on earth she could turn her hand to next all these preparations completed she began to undress her mind unconsciously drifting away to the contemplation of her late surprises to look in the glass for an instant at the reflection of her own magnificent resources in face and bosom and to mark their attractiveness unadorned was perhaps but the natural action of a young woman who had so lately been chidden whilst passing through the harassing experience of decorating an older beauty of miss aldclyffes temper  but she directly checked her weakness by sympathizing reflections on the hidden troubles which must have thronged the past years of the solitary lady to keep her though so rich and courted in a mood so repellent and gloomy as that in which cytherea found her and then the young girl marvelled again and again as she had marvelled before at the strange confluence of circumstances which had brought herself into contact with the one woman in the world whose history was so romantically intertwined with her own she almost began to wish she were not obliged to go away and leave the lonely being to loneliness still  in bed and in the dark miss aldclyffe haunted her mind more persistently than ever instead of sleeping she called up staring visions of the possible past of this queenly lady her mothers rival up the long vista of bygone years she saw behind all the young girls flirtation little or much with the cousin that seemed to have been nipped in the bud or to have terminated hastily in some way then the secret meetings between miss aldclyffe and the other woman at the little inn at hammersmith and other places the commonplace name she adopted her swoon at some painful news and the very slight knowledge the elder female had of her partner in mystery then more than a year afterwards the acquaintanceship of her own father with this his first love the awakening of the passion his acts of devotion the unreasoning heat of his rapture her tacit acceptance of it and yet her uneasiness under the delight then his declaration amid the evergreens the utter change produced in her manner thereby seemingly the result of a rigid determination and the total concealment of her reason by herself and her parents whatever it was then the ladys course dropped into darkness and nothing more was visible till she was discovered here at knapwater nearly fifty years old still unmarried and still beautiful but lonely embittered and haughty cytherea imagined that her fathers image was still warmly cherished in miss aldclyffes heart and was thankful that she herself had not been betrayed into announcing that she knew many particulars of this page of her fathers history and the chief one the ladys unaccountable renunciation of him it would have made her bearing towards the mistress of the mansion more awkward and would have been no benefit to either  thus conjuring up the past and theorizing on the present she lay restless changing her posture from one side to the other and back again finally when courting sleep with all her art she heard a clock strike two a minute later and she fancied she could distinguish a soft rustle in the passage outside her room  to bury her head in the sheets was her first impulse then to uncover it raise herself on her elbow and stretch her eyes wide open in the darkness her lips being parted with the intentness of her listening whatever the noise was it had ceased for the time  it began again and came close to her door lightly touching the panels then there was another stillness cytherea made a movement which caused a faint rustling of the bedclothes  before she had time to think another thought a light tap was given cytherea breathed the person outside was evidently bent upon finding her awake and the rustle she had made had encouraged the hope the maidens physical condition shifted from one pole to its opposite the cold sweat of terror forsook her and modesty took the alarm she became hot and red her door was not locked  a distinct womans whisper came to her through the keyhole cytherea  only one being in the house knew her christian name and that was miss aldclyffe cytherea stepped out of bed went to the door and whispered back yes  let me come in darling  the young woman paused in a conflict between judgment and emotion it was now mistress and maid no longer woman and woman only yes she must let her come in poor thing  she got a light in an instant opened the door and raising her eyes and the candle saw miss aldclyffe standing outside in her dressinggown  now you see that it is really myself put out the light said the visitor i want to stay here with you cythie i came to ask you to come down into my bed but it is snugger here but remember that you are mistress in this room and that i have no business here and that you may send me away if you choose shall i go  o no you shant indeed if you dont want to said cythie generously  the instant they were in bed miss aldclyffe freed herself from the last remnant of restraint she flung her arms round the young girl and pressed her gently to her heart  now kiss me she said  cytherea upon the whole was rather discomposed at this change of treatment and discomposed or no her passions were not so impetuous as miss aldclyffes she could not bring her soul to her lips for a moment try how she would  come kiss me repeated miss aldclyffe  cytherea gave her a very small one as soft in touch and in sound as the bursting of a bubble  more earnestly than thatcome  she gave another a little but not much more expressively  i dont deserve a more feeling one i suppose said miss aldclyffe with an emphasis of sad bitterness in her tone i am an illtempered woman you think half out of my mind well perhaps i am but i have had grief more than you can think or dream of but i cant help loving youyour name is the same as mineisnt it strange  cytherea was inclined to say no but remained silent  now dont you think i must love you continued the other  yes said cytherea absently she was still thinking whether duty to owen and her father which asked for silence on her knowledge of her fathers unfortunate love or duty to the woman embracing her which seemed to ask for confidence ought to predominate here was a solution she would wait till miss aldclyffe referred to her acquaintanceship and attachment to cythereas father in past times then she would tell her all she knew that would be honour  why cant you kiss me as i can kiss you why cant you she impressed upon cythereas lips a warm motherly salute given as if in the outburst of strong feeling long checked and yearning for something to love and be loved by in return  do you think badly of me for my behaviour this evening child i dont know why i am so foolish as to speak to you in this way i am a very fool i believe yes how old are you  eighteen  eighteen well why dont you ask me how old i am  because i dont want to know  never mind if you dont i am fortysix and it gives me greater pleasure to tell you this than it does to you to listen i have not told my age truly for the last twenty years till now  why havent you  i have met deceit by deceit till i am weary of itweary wearyand i long to be what i shall never be againartless and innocent like you but i suppose that you too will prove to be not worth a thought as every new friend does on more intimate knowledge come why dont you talk to me child have you said your prayers  yesno i forgot them tonight  i suppose you say them every night as a rule  yes  why do you do that  because i have always done so and it would seem strange if i were not to do you  i a wicked old sinner like me no i never do i have thought all such matters humbug for yearsthought so so long that i should be glad to think otherwise from very weariness and yet such is the code of the polite world that i subscribe regularly to missionary societies and others of the sort well say your prayers dearyou wont omit them now you recollect it i should like to hear you very much will you  it seems hardly  it would seem so like old times to mewhen i was young and nearerfar nearer heaven than i am now do sweet one  cytherea was embarrassed and her embarrassment arose from the following conjuncture of affairs since she had loved edward springrove she had linked his name with her brother owens in her nightly supplications to the almighty she wished to keep her love for him a secret and above all a secret from a woman like miss aldclyffe yet her conscience and the honesty of her love would not for an instant allow her to think of omitting his dear name and so endanger the efficacy of all her previous prayers for his success by an unworthy shame now it would be wicked of her she thought and a grievous wrong to him under any worldly circumstances she might have thought the position justified a little finesse and have skipped him for once but prayer was too solemn a thing for such trifling  i would rather not say them she murmured first it struck her then that this declining altogether was the same cowardice in another dress and was delivering her poor edward over to satan just as unceremoniously as before yes i will say my prayers and you shall hear me she added firmly  she turned her face to the pillow and repeated in low soft tones the simple words she had used from childhood on such occasions owens name was mentioned without faltering but in the other case maidenly shyness was too strong even for religion and that when supported by excellent intentions at the name of edward she stammered and her voice sank to the faintest whisper in spite of her  thank you dearest said miss aldclyffe i have prayed too i verily believe you are a good girl i think then the expected question came  bless owen and whom did you say  there was no help for it now and out it came owen and edward said cytherea  who are owen and edward  owen is my brother madam faltered the maid  ah i remember who is edward  a silence  your brother too continued miss aldclyffe  no  miss aldclyffe reflected a moment dont you want to tell me who edward is she said at last in a tone of meaning  i dont mind telling only  you would rather not i suppose  yes  miss aldclyffe shifted her ground were you ever in love she inquired suddenly  cytherea was surprised to hear how quickly the voice had altered from tenderness to harshness vexation and disappointment  yesi think i wasonce she murmured  aha and were you ever kissed by a man  a pause  well were you said miss aldclyffe rather sharply  dont press me to telli cantindeed i wont madam  miss aldclyffe removed her arms from cythereas neck tis now with you as it is always with all girls she said in jealous and gloomy accents you are not after all the innocent i took you for no no she then changed her tone with fitful rapidity cytherea try to love me more than you love himdo i love you more sincerely than any man can do cythie dont let any man stand between us o i cant bear that she clasped cythereas neck again  i must love him now i have begun replied the other  mustyesmust said the elder lady reproachfully yes women are all alike i thought i had at last found an artless woman who had not been sullied by a mans lips and who had not practised or been practised upon by the arts which ruin all the truth and sweetness and goodness in us find a girl if you can whose mouth and ears have not been made a regular highway of by some man or another leave the admittedly notorious spotsthe drawingrooms of societyand look in the villagesleave the villages and search in the schoolsand you can hardly find a girl whose heart has not been hadis not an old thing half worn out by some he or another if men only knew the staleness of the freshest of us that nine times out of ten the first love they think they are winning from a woman is but the hulk of an old wrecked affection fitted with new sails and reused o cytherea can it be that you too are like the rest  no no no urged cytherea awed by the storm she had raised in the impetuous womans mind he only kissed me oncetwice i mean  he might have done it a thousand times if he had cared to theres no doubt about that whoever his lordship is you are as bad as iwe are all alike and ian old foolhave been sipping at your mouth as if it were honey because i fancied no wasting lover knew the spot but a minute ago and you seemed to me like a fresh spring meadownow you seem a dusty highway  o no no cytherea was not weak enough to shed tears except on extraordinary occasions but she was fain to begin sobbing now she wished miss aldclyffe would go to her own room and leave her and her treasured dreams alone this vehement imperious affection was in one sense soothing but yet it was not of the kind that cythereas instincts desired though it was generous it seemed somewhat too rank and capricious for endurance  well said the lady in continuation who is he  her companion was desperately determined not to tell his name she too much feared a taunt when miss aldclyffes fiery mood again ruled her tongue  wont you tell me not tell me after all the affection i have shown  i will perhaps another day  did you wear a hat and white feather in budmouth for the week or two previous to your coming here  yes  then i have seen you and your lover at a distance he rowed you round the bay with your brother  yes  and without your brotherfie there there dont let that little heart beat itself to death throb throb it shakes the bed you silly thing i didnt mean that there was any harm in going alone with him i only saw you from the esplanade in common with the rest of the people i often run down to budmouth he was a very good figure now who was he  ii wont tell madami cannot indeed  wont tellvery well dont you are very foolish to treasure up his name and image as you do why he has had loves before you trust him for that whoever he is and you are but a temporary link in a long chain of others like you who only have your little day as they have had theirs  tisnt true tisnt true tisnt true cried cytherea in an agony of torture he has never loved anybody else i knowi am sure he hasnt  miss aldclyffe was as jealous as any man could have been she continued  he sees a beautiful face and thinks he will never forget it but in a few weeks the feeling passes off and he wonders how he could have cared for anybody so absurdly much  no no he doesntwhat does he do when he has thought thatcome tell metell me  you are as hot as fire and the throbbing of your heart makes me nervous i cant tell you if you get in that flustered state  do do tello it makes me so miserable but tellcome tell me  ahthe tables are turned now dear she continued in a tone which mingled pity with derision     loves passions shall rock thee     as the storm rocks the ravens on high     bright reason will mock thee     like the sun from a wintry sky  what does he do nextwhy this is what he does next ruminate on what he has heard of womens romantic impulses and how easily men torture them when they have given way to those feelings and have resigned everything for their hero it may be that though he loves you heartily nowthat is as heartily as a man canand you love him in return your loves may be impracticable and hopeless and you may be separated for ever you as the weary weary years pass by will fade and fadebright eyes will fadeand you will perhaps then die earlytrue to him to your latest breath and believing him to be true to the latest breath also whilst he in some gay and busy spot far away from your last quiet nook will have married some dashing lady and not purely oblivious of you will long have ceased to regret youwill chat about you as you were in long past yearswill say ah little cytherea used to tie her hair like thatpoor innocent trusting thing it was a pleasant useless idle dreamthat dream of mine for the maid with the bright eyes and simple silly heart but i was a foolish lad at that time then he will tell the tale of all your little wills and wonts and particular ways and as he speaks turn to his wife with a placid smile  it is not true he cant he ccant be sso crueland you are cruel to meyou are you are she was at last driven to desperation her natural common sense and shrewdness had seen all through the piece how imaginary her emotions wereshe felt herself to be weak and foolish in permitting them to rise but even then she could not control them be agonized she must she was only eighteen and the long days labour her weariness her excitement had completely unnerved her and worn her out she was bent hither and thither by this tyrannical working upon her imagination as a young rush in the wind she wept bitterly and now think how much i like you resumed miss aldclyffe when cytherea grew calmer i shall never forget you for anybody else as men donever i will be exactly as a mother to you now will you promise to live with me always and always be taken care of and never deserted  i cannot i will not be anybodys maid for another day on any consideration  no no no you shant be a ladysmaid you shall be my companion i will get another maid  companionthat was a new idea cytherea could not resist the evidently heartfelt desire of the strangetempered woman for her presence but she could not trust to the moments impulse  i will stay i think but do not ask for a final answer tonight  never mind now then put your hair round your mammas neck and give me one good long kiss and i wont talk any more in that way about your lover after all some young men are not so fickle as others but even if hes the ficklest there is consolation the love of an inconstant man is ten times more ardent than that of a faithful manthat is while it lasts  cytherea did as she was told to escape the punishment of further talk flung the twining tresses of her long rich hair over miss aldclyffes shoulders as directed and the two ceased conversing making themselves up for sleep miss aldclyffe seemed to give herself over to a luxurious sense of content and quiet as if the maiden at her side afforded her a protection against dangers which had menaced her for years she was soon sleeping calmly  2 two to five am  with cytherea it was otherwise unused to the place and circumstances she continued wakeful ill at ease and mentally distressed she withdrew herself from her companions embrace turned to the other side and endeavoured to relieve her busy brain by looking at the windowblind and noticing the light of the rising moonnow in her last quartercreep round upon it it was the light of an old waning moon which had but a few days longer to live  the sight led her to think again of what had happened under the rays of the same months moon a little before its full the ecstatic evening scene with edward the kiss and the shortness of those happy momentsmaiden imagination bringing about the apotheosis of a status quo which had had several unpleasantnesses in its earthly reality  but sounds were in the ascendant that night her ears became aware of a strange and gloomy murmur  she recognized it it was the gushing of the waterfall faint and low brought from its source to the unwonted distance of the house by a faint breeze which made it distinct and recognizable by reason of the utter absence of all disturbing sounds the grooms melancholy representation lent to the sound a more dismal effect than it would have had of its own nature she began to fancy what the waterfall must be like at that hour under the trees in the ghostly moonlight black at the head and over the surface of the deep cold hole into which it fell white and frothy at the fall black and white like a pall and its border sad everywhere  she was in the mood for sounds of every kind now and strained her ears to catch the faintest in wayward enmity to her quiet of mind another soon came  the second was quite different from the firsta kind of intermittent whistle it seemed primarily no a creak a metallic creak ever and anon like a plough or a rusty wheelbarrow or at least a wheel of some kind yes it was a wheelthe waterwheel in the shrubbery by the old manorhouse which the coachman had said would drive him mad  she determined not to think any more of these gloomy things but now that she had once noticed the sound there was no sealing her ears to it she could not help timing its creaks and putting on a dread expectancy just before the end of each halfminute that brought them to imagine the inside of the enginehouse whence these noises proceeded was now a necessity no window but crevices in the door through which probably the moonbeams streamed in the most attenuated and skeletonlike rays striking sharply upon portions of wet rusty cranks and chains a glistening wheel turning incessantly labouring in the dark like a captive starving in a dungeon and instead of a floor below gurgling water which on account of the darkness could only be heard water which laboured up dark pipes almost to where she lay  she shivered now she was determined to go to sleep there could be nothing else left to be heard or to imagineit was horrid that her imagination should be so restless yet just for an instant before going to sleep she would think thissuppose another sound should comejust suppose it should before the thought had well passed through her brain a third sound came  the third was a very soft gurgle or rattleof a strange and abnormal kindyet a sound she had heard before at some past period of her lifewhen she could not recollect to make it the more disturbing it seemed to be almost close to hereither close outside the window close under the floor or close above the ceiling the accidental fact of its coming so immediately upon the heels of her supposition told so powerfully upon her excited nerves that she jumped up in the bed the same instant a little dog in some room near having probably heard the same noise set up a low whine the watchdog in the yard hearing the moan of his associate began to howl loudly and distinctly his melancholy notes were taken up directly afterwards by the dogs in the kennel a long way off in every variety of wail  one logical thought alone was able to enter her flurried brain the little dog that began the whining must have heard the other two sounds even better than herself he had taken no notice of them but he had taken notice of the third the third then was an unusual sound  it was not like water it was not like wind it was not the nightjar it was not a clock nor a rat nor a person snoring  she crept under the clothes and flung her arms tightly round miss aldclyffe as if for protection cytherea perceived that the ladys late peaceful warmth had given place to a sweat at the maidens touch miss aldclyffe awoke with a low scream  she remembered her position instantly o such a terrible dream she cried in a hurried whisper holding to cytherea in her turn and your touch was the end of it it was dreadful time with his wings hourglass and scythe coming nearer and nearer to megrinning and mocking then he seized me took a piece of me only but i cant tell you i cant bear to think of it how those dogs howl people say it means death  the return of miss aldclyffe to consciousness was sufficient to dispel the wild fancies which the loneliness of the night had woven in cythereas mind she dismissed the third noise as something which in all likelihood could easily be explained if trouble were taken to inquire into it large houses had all kinds of strange sounds floating about them she was ashamed to tell miss aldclyffe her terrors  a silence of five minutes  are you asleep said miss aldclyffe  no said cytherea in a longdrawn whisper  how those dogs howl dont they  yes a little dog in the house began it  ah yes that was totsy he sleeps on the mat outside my fathers bedroom door a nervous creature  there was a silent interval of nearly halfanhour a clock on the landing struck three  are you asleep miss aldclyffe whispered cytherea  no said miss aldclyffe how wretched it is not to be able to sleep isnt it  yes replied cytherea like a docile child  another hour passed and the clock struck four miss aldclyffe was still awake  cytherea she said very softly  cytherea made no answer she was sleeping soundly  the first glimmer of dawn was now visible miss aldclyffe arose put on her dressinggown and went softly downstairs to her own room  i have not told her who i am after all or found out the particulars of ambroses history she murmured but her being in love alters everything  3 halfpast seven to ten oclock am  cytherea awoke quiet in mind and refreshed a conclusion to remain at knapwater was already in possession of her  finding miss aldclyffe gone she dressed herself and sat down at the window to write an answer to edwards letter and an account of her arrival at knapwater to owen the dismal and heartbreaking pictures that miss aldclyffe had placed before her the preceding evening the later terrors of the night were now but as shadows of shadows and she smiled in derision at her own excitability  but writing edwards letter was the great consoler the effect of each word upon him being enacted in her own face as she wrote it she felt how much she would like to share his troublehow well she could endure poverty with himand wondered what his trouble was but all would be explained at last she knew  at the appointed time she went to miss aldclyffes room intending with the contradictoriness common in people to perform with pleasure as a work of supererogation what as a duty was simply intolerable  miss aldclyffe was already out of bed the bright penetrating light of morning made a vast difference in the elder ladys behaviour to her dependent the day which had restored cythereas judgment had effected the same for miss aldclyffe though practical reasons forbade her regretting that she had secured such a companionable creature to read talk or play to her whenever her whim required she was inwardly vexed at the extent to which she had indulged in the womanly luxury of making confidences and giving way to emotions few would have supposed that the calm lady sitting aristocratically at the toilet table seeming scarcely conscious of cythereas presence in the room even when greeting her was the passionate creature who had asked for kisses a few hours before  it is both painful and satisfactory to think how often these antitheses are to be observed in the individual most open to our observationourselves we pass the evening with faces lit up by some flaring illumination or other we get up the next morningthe fiery jets have all gone out and nothing confronts us but a few crinkled pipes and sooty wirework hardly even recalling the outline of the blazing picture that arrested our eyes before bedtime  emotions would be half starved if there were no candlelight probably ninetenths of the gushing letters of indiscreet confession are written after nine or ten oclock in the evening and sent off before day returns to leer invidiously upon them few that remain open to catch our glance as we rise in the morning survive the frigid criticism of dressingtime  the subjects uppermost in the minds of the two women who had thus cooled from their fires were not the visionary ones of the later hours but the hard facts of their earlier conversation after a remark that cytherea need not assist her in dressing unless she wished to miss aldclyffe said abruptly  i can tell that young mans name she looked keenly at cytherea it is edward springrove my tenants son  the inundation of colour upon the younger lady at hearing a name which to her was a world handled as if it were only an atom told miss aldclyffe that she had divined the truth at last  ahit is he is it she continued well i wanted to know for practical reasons his example shows that i was not so far wrong in my estimate of men after all though i only generalized and had no thought of him this was perfectly true  what do you mean said cytherea visibly alarmed  mean why that all the world knows him to be engaged to be married and that the wedding is soon to take place she made the remark bluntly and superciliously as if to obtain absolution at the hands of her family pride for the weak confidences of the night  but even the frigidity of miss aldclyffes morning mood was overcome by the look of sick and blank despair which the carelessly uttered words had produced upon cythereas face she sank back into a chair and buried her face in her hands  dont be so foolish said miss aldclyffe come make the best of it i cannot upset the fact i have told you of unfortunately but i believe the match can be broken off  o no no  nonsense i liked him much as a youth and i like him now ill help you to captivate and chain him down i have got over my absurd feeling of last night in not wanting you ever to go away from meof course i could not expect such a thing as that there now i have said ill help you and thats enough hes tired of his first choice now that hes been away from home for a while the love that no outer attack can frighten away quails before its idols own homely ways it is always so come finish what you are doing if you are going to and dont be a little goose about such a trumpery affair as that  whois he engaged to cytherea inquired by a movement of her lips but no sound of her voice but miss aldclyffe did not answer it mattered not cytherea thought another womanthat was enough for her curiosity was stunned  she applied herself to the work of dressing scarcely knowing how miss aldclyffe went on  you were too easily won id have made him or anybody else speak out before he should have kissed my face for his pleasure but you are one of those precipitantly fond things who are yearning to throw away their hearts upon the first worthless fellow who says goodmorning in the first place you shouldnt have loved him so quickly in the next if you must have loved him offhand you should have concealed it it tickled his vanity by jove that girls in love with me already he thought  to hasten away at the end of the toilet to tell mrs morriswho stood waiting in a little room prepared for her with tea poured out breadandbutter cut into diaphanous slices and eggs arrangedthat she wanted no breakfast then to shut herself alone in her bedroom was her only thought she was followed thither by the wellintentioned matron with a cup of tea and one piece of breadandbutter on a tray cheerfully insisting that she should eat it  to those who grieve innocent cheerfulness seems heartless levity no thank you mrs morris she said keeping the door closed despite the incivility of the action cytherea could not bear to let a pleasant person see her face then  immediate revocationeven if revocation would be more effective by postponementis the impulse of young wounded natures cytherea went to her blottingbook took out the long letter so carefully written so full of gushing remarks and tender hints and sealed up so neatly with a little seal bearing good faith as its motto tore the missive into fifty pieces and threw them into the grate it was then the bitterest of anguishes to look upon some of the words she had so lovingly written and see them existing only in mutilated forms without meaningto feel that his eye would never read them nobody ever know how ardently she had penned them  pity for ones self for being wasted is mostly present in these moods of abnegation  the meaning of all his allusions his abruptness in telling her of his love his constraint at first then his desperate manner of speaking was clear they must have been the last flickerings of a conscience not quite dead to all sense of perfidiousness and fickleness now he had gone to london she would be dismissed from his memory in the same way as miss aldclyffe had said and here she was in edwards own parish reminded continually of him by what she saw and heard the landscape yesterday so much and so bright to her was now but as the banquethall desertedall gone but herself  miss aldclyffe had wormed her secret out of her and would now be continually mocking her for her trusting simplicity in believing him it was altogether unbearable she would not stay there  she went downstairs and found miss aldclyffe had gone into the breakfastroom but that captain aldclyffe who rose later with increasing infirmities had not yet made his appearance cytherea entered miss aldclyffe was looking out of the window watching a trail of white smoke along the distant landscapesignifying a passing train at cythereas entry she turned and looked inquiry  i must tell you now began cytherea in a tremulous voice  well what miss aldclyffe said  i am not going to stay with you i must go awaya very long way i am very sorry but indeed i cant remain  poohwhat shall we hear next miss aldclyffe surveyed cythereas face with leisurely criticism you are breaking your heart again about that worthless young springrove i knew how it would be it is as hallam says of julietwhat little reason you may have possessed originally has all been whirled away by this love i shant take this notice mind  do let me go  miss aldclyffe took her new pets hand and said with severity as to hindering you if you are determined to go of course thats absurd but you are not now in a state of mind fit for deciding upon any such proceeding and i shall not listen to what you have to say now cythie come with me well let this volcano burst and spend itself and after that well see what had better be done she took cytherea into her workroom opened a drawer and drew forth a roll of linen  this is some embroidery i began one day and now i should like it finished  she then preceded the maiden upstairs to cythereas own room there she said now sit down here go on with this work and remember one thingthat you are not to leave the room on any pretext whatever for two hours unless i send for youi insist kindly dear whilst you stitchyou are to stitch recollect and not go mooning out of the windowthink over the whole matter and get cooled dont let the foolish loveaffair prevent your thinking as a woman of the world if at the end of that time you still say you must leave me you may i will have no more to say in the matter come sit down and promise to sit here the time i name  to hearts in a despairing mood compulsion seems a relief and docility was at all times natural to cytherea she promised and sat down miss aldclyffe shut the door upon her and retreated  she sewed stopped to think shed a tear or two recollected the articles of the treaty and sewed again and at length fell into a reverie which took no account whatever of the lapse of time  4 ten to twelve oclock am  a quarter of an hour might have passed when her thoughts became attracted from the past to the present by unwonted movements downstairs she opened the door and listened  there were hurryings along passages opening and shutting of doors trampling in the stableyard she went across into another bedroom from which a view of the stableyard could be obtained and arrived there just in time to see the figure of the man who had driven her from the station vanishing down the coachroad on a black horsegalloping at the top of the animals speed  another man went off in the direction of the village  whatever had occurred it did not seem to be her duty to inquire or meddle with it stranger and dependent as she was unless she were requested to especially after miss aldclyffes strict charge to her she sat down again determined to let no idle curiosity influence her movements  her window commanded the front of the house and the next thing she saw was a clergyman walk up and enter the door  all was silent again till a long time after the first man had left he returned again on the same horse now matted with sweat and trotting behind a carriage in which sat an elderly gentleman driven by a lad in livery these came to the house entered and all was again the same as before  the whole householdmaster mistress and servantsappeared to have forgotten the very existence of such a being as cytherea she almost wished she had not vowed to have no idle curiosity  halfanhour later the carriage drove off with the elderly gentleman and two or three messengers left the house speeding in various directions rustics in smockfrocks began to hang about the road opposite the house or lean against trees looking idly at the windows and chimneys  a tap came to cythereas door she opened it to a young maidservant  miss aldclyffe wishes to see you maam cytherea hastened down  miss aldclyffe was standing on the hearthrug her elbow on the mantel her hand to her temples her eyes on the ground perfectly calm but very pale  cytherea she said in a whisper come here  cytherea went close  something very serious has taken place she said again and then paused with a tremulous movement of her mouth  yes said cytherea  my father he was found dead in his bed this morning  dead echoed the younger woman it seemed impossible that the announcement could be true that knowledge of so great a fact could be contained in a statement so small  yes dead murmured miss aldclyffe solemnly he died alone though within a few feet of me the room we slept in is exactly over his own  cytherea said hurriedly do they know at what hour  the doctor says it must have been between two and three oclock this morning  then i heard him  heard him  heard him die  you heard him die what did you hear  a sound i heard once before in my lifeat the deathbed of my mother i could not identify itthough i recognized it then the dog howled you remarked it i did not think it worth while to tell you what i had heard a little earlier she looked agonized  it would have been useless said miss aldclyffe all was over by that time she addressed herself as much as cytherea when she continued is it a providence who sent you here at this juncture that i might not be left entirely alone  till this instant miss aldclyffe had forgotten the reason of cythereas seclusion in her own room so had cytherea herself the fact now recurred to both in one moment  do you still wish to go said miss aldclyffe anxiously  i dont want to go now cytherea had remarked simultaneously with the others question she was pondering on the strange likeness which miss aldclyffes bereavement bore to her own it had the appearance of being still another call to her not to forsake this woman so linked to her life for the sake of any trivial vexation  miss aldclyffe held her almost as a lover would have held her and said musingly  we get more and more into one groove i now am left fatherless and motherless as you were other ties lay behind in her thoughts but she did not mention them  you loved your father cytherea and wept for him  yes i did poor papa  i was always at variance with mine and cant weep for him now but you must stay here always and make a better woman of me  the compact was thus sealed and cytherea in spite of the failure of her advertisements was installed as a veritable companion and once more in the history of human endeavour a position which it was impossible to reach by any direct attempt was come to by the seekers swerving from the path and regarding the original object as one of secondary importance     vii the events of eighteen days  1 august the seventeenth  the time of day was four oclock in the afternoon the place was the ladys study or boudoir knapwater house the person was miss aldclyffe sitting there alone clothed in deep mourning  the funeral of the old captain had taken place and his will had been read it was very concise and had been executed about five years previous to his death it was attested by his solicitors messrs nyttleton and tayling of lincolns inn fields the whole of his estate real and personal was bequeathed to his daughter cytherea for her sole and absolute use subject only to the payment of a legacy to the rector their relative and a few small amounts to the servants  miss aldclyffe had not chosen the easiest chair of her boudoir to sit in or even a chair of ordinary comfort but an uncomfortable high narrowbacked oak framed and seated chair which was allowed to remain in the room only on the ground of being a companion in artistic quaintness to an old coffer beside it and was never used except to stand in to reach for a book from the highest row of shelves but she had sat erect in this chair for more than an hour for the reason that she was utterly unconscious of what her actions and bodily feelings were the chair had stood nearest her path on entering the room and she had gone to it in a dream  she sat in the attitude which denotes unflagging intense concentrated thoughtas if she were cast in bronze her feet were together her body bent a little forward and quite unsupported by the back of the chair her hands on her knees her eyes fixed intently on the corner of a footstool  at last she moved and tapped her fingers upon the table at her side her pentup ideas had finally found some channel to advance in motions became more and more frequent as she laboured to carry further and further the problem which occupied her brain she sat back and drew a long breath she sat sideways and leant her forehead upon her hand later still she arose walked up and down the roomat first abstractedly with her features as firmly set as ever but by degrees her brow relaxed her footsteps became lighter and more leisurely her head rode gracefully and was no longer bowed she plumed herself like a swan after exertion  yes she said aloud to get him here without letting him know that i have any other object than that of getting a useful manthats the difficultyand that i think i can master  she rang for the new maid a placid woman of forty with a few grey hairs  ask miss graye if she can come to me  cytherea was not far off and came in  do you know anything about architects and surveyors said miss aldclyffe abruptly  know anything replied cytherea poising herself on her toe to consider the compass of the question  yesknow anything said miss aldclyffe  owen is an architect and surveyors draughtsman the maiden said and thought of somebody else who was likewise  yes thats why i asked you what are the different kinds of work comprised in an architects practice they lay out estates and superintend the various works done upon them i should think among other things  those are more properly a land or building stewards dutiesat least i have always imagined so country architects include those things in their practice city architects dont  i know that child but a stewards is an indefinite fast and loose profession it seems to me shouldnt you think that a man who had been brought up as an architect would do for a steward  cytherea had doubts whether an architect pure would do  the chief pleasure connected with asking an opinion lies in not adopting it miss aldclyffe replied decisively  nonsense of course he would your brother owen makes plans for country buildingssuch as cottages stables homesteads and so on  yes he does  and superintends the building of them  yes he will soon  and he surveys land  o yes  and he knows about hedges and ditcheshow wide they ought to be boundaries levelling planting trees to keep away the winds measuring timber houses for ninetynine years and such things  i have never heard him say that but i think mr gradfield does those things owen i am afraid is inexperienced as yet  yes your brother is not old enough for such a post yet of course and then there are rentdays the audit and winding up of tradesmens accounts i am afraid cytherea you dont know much more about the matter than i do myself i am going out just now she continued i shall not want you to walk with me today run away till dinnertime  miss aldclyffe went out of doors and down the steps to the lawn then turning to the left through a shrubbery she opened a wicket and passed into a neglected and leafy carriagedrive leading down the hill this she followed till she reached the point of its greatest depression which was also the lowest ground in the whole grove  the trees here were so interlaced and hung their branches so near the ground that a whole summers day was scarcely long enough to change the air pervading the spot from its normal state of coolness to even a temporary warmth the unvarying freshness was helped by the nearness of the ground to the level of the springs and by the presence of a deep sluggish stream close by equally well shaded by bushes and a high wall following the road which now ran along at the margin of the stream she came to an opening in the wall on the other side of the water revealing a large rectangular nook from which the stream proceeded covered with froth and accompanied by a dull roar two more steps and she was opposite the nook in full view of the cascade forming its further boundary over the top could be seen the bright outer sky in the form of a crescent caused by the curve of a bridge across the rapids and the trees above  beautiful as was the scene she did not look in that direction the same standingground afforded another prospect straight in the front less sombre than the water on the right or the trees all around the avenue and grove which flanked it abruptly terminated a few yards ahead where the ground began to rise and on the remote edge of the greensward thus laid open stood all that remained of the original manorhouse to which the dark marginline of the trees in the avenue formed an adequate and wellfitting frame it was the picture thus presented that was now interesting miss aldclyffenot artistically or historically but practicallyas regarded its fitness for adaptation to modern requirements  in front detached from everything else rose the most ancient portion of the structurean old arched gateway flanked by the bases of two small towers and nearly covered with creepers which had clambered over the eaves of the sinking roof and up the gable to the crest of the aldclyffe family perched on the apex behind this at a distance of ten or twenty yards came the only portion of the main building that still existedan elizabethan fragment consisting of as much as could be contained under three gables and a cross roof behind against the wall could be seen ragged lines indicating the form of other destroyed gables which had once joined it there the mullioned and transomed windows containing five or six lights were mostly bricked up to the extent of two or three and the remaining portion fitted with cottage windowframes carelessly inserted to suit the purpose to which the old place was now applied it being partitioned out into small rooms downstairs to form cottages for two labourers and their families the upper portion was arranged as a storehouse for divers kinds of roots and fruit  the owner of the picturesque spot after her survey from this point went up to the walls and walked into the old court where the pavingstones were pushed sideways and upwards by the thrust of the grasses between them two or three little children with their fingers in their mouths came out to look at her and then ran in to tell their mothers in loud tones of secrecy that miss aldclyffe was coming miss aldclyffe however did not come in she concluded her survey of the exterior by making a complete circuit of the building then turned into a nook a short distance off where round and square timber a sawpit planks grindstones heaps of building stone and brick explained that the spot was the centre of operations for the building work done on the estate  she paused and looked around a man who had seen her from the window of the workshops behind came out and respectfully lifted his hat to her it was the first time she had been seen walking outside the house since her fathers death  strooden could the old house be made a decent residence of without much trouble she inquired  the mechanic considered and spoke as each consideration completed itself  you dont forget maam that twothirds of the place is already pulled down or gone to ruin  yes i know  and that whats left may almost as well be maam  why may it  twas so cut up inside when they made it into cottages that the whole carcase is full of cracks  still by pulling down the inserted partitions and adding a little outside it could be made to answer the purpose of an ordinary six or eightroomed house  yes maam  about what would it cost was the question which had invariably come next in every communication of this kind to which the superintending workman had been a party during his whole experience to his surprise miss aldclyffe did not put it the man thought her object in altering an old house must have been an unusually absorbing one not to prompt what was so instinctive in owners as hardly to require any prompting at all  thank you thats sufficient strooden she said you will understand that it is not unlikely some alteration may be made here in a short time with reference to the management of the affairs  strooden said yes in a complex voice and looked uneasy  during the life of captain aldclyffe with you as the foreman of works and he himself as his own steward everything worked well but now it may be necessary to have a steward whose management will encroach further upon things which have hitherto been left in your hands than did your late masters what i mean is that he will directly and in detail superintend all  theni shall not be wanted maam he faltered  o yes if you like to stay on as foreman in the yard and workshops only i should be sorry to lose you however you had better consider i will send for you in a few days  leaving him to suspense and all the ills that came in its traindistracted application to his duties and an undefined number of sleepless nights and untasted dinners miss aldclyffe looked at her watch and returned to the house she was about to keep an appointment with her solicitor mr nyttleton who had been to budmouth and was coming to knapwater on his way back to london  2 august the twentieth  on the saturday subsequent to mr nyttletons visit to knapwater house the subjoined advertisement appeared in the field and the builder newspapers                        land steward  a gentleman of integrity and professional skill is required immediately for the management of an estate containing about 1000 acres upon which agricultural improvements and the erection of buildings are contemplated he must be a man of superior education unmarried and not more than thirty years of age considerable preference will be shown for one who possesses an artistic as well as a practical knowledge of planning and laying out the remuneration will consist of a salary of 220 pounds with the old manorhouse as a residenceaddress messrs nyttleton and tayling solicitors lincolns inn fields   a copy of each paper was sent to miss aldclyffe on the day of publication the same evening she told cytherea that she was advertising for a steward who would live at the old manorhouse showing her the papers containing the announcement  what was the drift of that remark thought the maiden or was it merely made to her in confidential intercourse as other arrangements were told her daily yet it seemed to have more meaning than common she remembered the conversation about architects and surveyors and her brother owen miss aldclyffe knew that his situation was precarious that he was well educated and practical and was applying himself heart and soul to the details of the profession and all connected with it miss aldclyffe might be ready to take him if he could compete successfully with others who would reply she hazarded a question  would it be desirable for owen to answer it  not at all said miss aldclyffe peremptorily  a flat answer of this kind had ceased to alarm cytherea miss aldclyffes blunt mood was not her worst cytherea thought of another man whose name in spite of resolves tears renunciations and injured pride lingered in her ears like an old familiar strain that man was qualified for a stewardship under a king  would it be of any use if edward springrove were to answer it she said resolutely enunciating the name  none whatever replied miss aldclyffe again in the same decided tone  you are very unkind to speak in that way  now dont pout like a goosie as you are i dont want men like either of them for of course i must look to the good of the estate rather than to that of any individual the man i want must have been more specially educated i have told you that we are going to london next week it is mostly on this account  cytherea found that she had mistaken the drift of miss aldclyffes peculiar explicitness on the subject of advertising and wrote to tell her brother that if he saw the notice it would be useless to reply  3 august the twentyfifth  five days after the abovementioned dialogue took place they went to london and with scarcely a minutes pause to the solicitors offices in lincolns inn fields  they alighted opposite one of the characteristic entrances about the placea gate which was never and could never be closed flanked by lampstandards carrying no lamp rust was the only active agent to be seen there at this time of the day and year the palings along the front were rusted away at their base to the thinness of wires and the successive coats of paint with which they were overlaid in bygone days had been completely undermined by the same insidious canker which lifted off the paint in flakes leaving the raw surface of the iron on palings standards and gate hinges of a staring bloodred  but once inside the railings the picture changed the court and offices were a complete contrast to the grand ruin of the outwork which enclosed them wellpainted respectability extended over within and around the doorstep and in the carefully swept yard not a particle of dust was visible  mr nyttleton who had just come up from margate where he was staying with his family was standing at the top of his own staircase as the pair ascended he politely took them inside  is there a comfortable room in which this young lady can sit during our interview said miss aldclyffe  it was rather a favourite habit of hers to make much of cytherea when they were out and snub her for it afterwards when they got home  certainlymr taylings cytherea was shown into an inner room  social definitions are all made relatively an absolute datum is only imagined the small gentry about knapwater seemed unpractised to miss aldclyffe miss aldclyffe herself seemed unpractised to mr nyttletons experienced old eyes  now then the lady said when she was alone with the lawyer what is the result of our advertisement  it was late summer the estateagency building engineering and surveying worlds were dull there were fortyfive replies to the advertisement  mr nyttleton spread them one by one before miss aldclyffe you will probably like to read some of them yourself madam he said  yes certainly said she  i will not trouble you with those which are from persons manifestly unfit at first sight he continued and began selecting from the heap twos and threes which he had marked collecting others into his hand  the man we want lies among these if my judgment doesnt deceive me and from them it would be advisable to select a certain number to be communicated with  i should like to see every oneonly just to glance them overexactly as they came she said suasively  he looked as if he thought this a waste of his time but dismissing his sentiment unfolded each singly and laid it before her as he laid them out it struck him that she studied them quite as rapidly as he could spread them he slyly glanced up from the outer corner of his eye to hers and noticed that all she did was look at the name at the bottom of the letter and then put the enclosure aside without further ceremony he thought this an odd way of inquiring into the merits of fortyfive men who at considerable trouble gave in detail reasons why they believed themselves well qualified for a certain post she came to the final one and put it down with the rest  then the lady said that in her opinion it would be best to get as many replies as they possibly could before selectingto give us a wider choice what do you think mr nyttleton  it seemed to him he said that a greater number than those they already had would scarcely be necessary and if they waited for more there would be this disadvantage attending it that some of those they now could command would possibly not be available  never mind we will run that risk said miss aldclyffe let the advertisement be inserted once more and then we will certainly settle the matter  mr nyttleton bowed and seemed to think miss aldclyffe for a single woman and one who till so very recently had never concerned herself with business of any kind a very meddlesome client but she was rich and handsome still shes a new broom in estatemanagement as yet he thought she will soon get tired of this and he parted from her without a sentiment which could mar his habitual blandness  the two ladies then proceeded westward dismissing the cab in waterloo place they went along pall mall on foot where in place of the usual welldressed clubbistsrubicund with alcoholwere to be seen in linen pinafores flocks of housepainters pallid from white lead when they had reached the green park cytherea proposed that they should sit down awhile under the young elms at the brow of the hill this they didthe growl of piccadilly on their left handthe monastic seclusion of the palace on their right before them the clock tower of the houses of parliament standing forth with a metallic lustre against a livid lambeth sky  miss aldclyffe still carried in her hand a copy of the newspaper and while cytherea had been interesting herself in the picture around glanced again at the advertisement  she heaved a slight sigh and began to fold it up again in the action her eye caught sight of two consecutive advertisements on the cover one relating to some lecture on art and addressed to members of the institute of architects the other emanated from the same source but was addressed to the public and stated that the exhibition of drawings at the institutes rooms would close at the end of that week  her eye lighted up she sent cytherea back to the hotel in a cab then turned round by piccadilly into bond street and proceeded to the rooms of the institute the secretary was sitting in the lobby after making her payment and looking at a few of the drawings on the walls in the company of three gentlemen the only other visitors to the exhibition she turned back and asked if she might be allowed to see a list of the members she was a little connected with the architectural world she said with a smile and was interested in some of the names  here it is madam he replied politely handing her a pamphlet containing the names  miss aldclyffe turned the leaves till she came to the letter m the name she hoped to find there was there with the address appended as was the case with all the rest  the address was at some chambers in a street not far from charing cross chambers as a residence had always been assumed by the lady to imply the condition of a bachelor she murmured two words there still  another request had yet to be made but it was of a more noticeable kind than the first and might compromise the secrecy with which she wished to act throughout this episode her object was to get one of the envelopes lying on the secretarys table stamped with the die of the institute and in order to get it she was about to ask if she might write a note  but the secretarys back chanced to be turned and he now went towards one of the men at the other end of the room who had called him to ask some question relating to an etching on the wall quick as thought miss aldclyffe stood before the table slipped her hand behind her took one of the envelopes and put it in her pocket  she sauntered round the rooms for two or three minutes longer then withdrew and returned to her hotel  here she cut the knapwater advertisement from the paper put it into the envelope she had stolen embossed with the societys stamp and directed it in a round clerkly hand to the address she had seen in the list of members names submitted to her       aeneas manston esq           wykeham chambers                spring gardens  this ended her first days work in london  4 from august the twentysixth to september the first  the two cythereas continued at the westminster hotel miss aldclyffe informing her companion that business would detain them in london another week the days passed as slowly and quietly as days can pass in a city at that time of the year the shuttered windows about the squares and terraces confronting their eyes like the white and sightless orbs of blind men on thursday mr nyttleton called bringing the whole number of replies to the advertisement cytherea was present at the interview by miss aldclyffes requesteither from whim or design  ten additional letters were the result of the second weeks insertion making fiftyfive in all miss aldclyffe looked them over as before one was signed  aeneas manston     133 turngate street           liverpool  now then mr nyttleton will you make a selection and i will add one or two miss aldclyffe said  mr nyttleton scanned the whole heap of letters testimonials and references sorting them into two heaps manstons missive after a mere glance was thrown amongst the summarily rejected ones  miss aldclyffe read or pretended to read after the lawyer when he had finished five lay in the group he had selected would you like to add to the number he said turning to the lady  no she said carelessly well two or three additional ones rather took my fancy she added searching for some in the larger collection  she drew out three one was manstons  these eight then shall be communicated with said the lawyer taking up the eight letters and placing them by themselves  they stood up if i myself miss aldclyffe were only concerned personally he said in an offhand way and holding up a letter singly i should choose this man unhesitatingly he writes honestly is not afraid to name what he does not consider himself well acquainted witha rare thing to find in answers to advertisements he is well recommended and possesses some qualities rarely found in combination oddly enough he is not really a steward he was bred a farmer studied building affairs served on an estate for some time then went with an architect and is now well qualified as architect estate agent and surveyor that man is sure to have a fine head for a manor like yours he tapped the letter as he spoke yes i should choose him without hesitationspeaking personally  and i think she said artificially i should choose this one as a matter of mere personal whim which of course cant be given way to when practical questions have to be considered  cytherea after looking out of the window and then at the newspapers had become interested in the proceedings between the clever miss aldclyffe and the keen old lawyer which reminded her of a game at cards she looked inquiringly at the two lettersone in miss aldclyffes hand the other in mr nyttletons  what is the name of your man said miss aldclyffe  his name said the lawyer looking down the page what is his nameit is edward springrove  miss aldclyffe glanced towards cytherea who was getting red and pale by turns she looked imploringly at miss aldclyffe  the name of my man said miss aldclyffe looking at her letter in turn is i thinkyesaeneas manston  5 september the third  the next morning but one was appointed for the interviews which were to be at the lawyers offices mr nyttleton and mr tayling were both in town for the day and the candidates were admitted one by one into a private room in the window recess was seated miss aldclyffe wearing her veil down  the lawyer had in his letters to the selected number timed each candidate at an interval of ten or fifteen minutes from those preceding and following they were shown in as they arrived and had short conversations with mr nyttletonterse and to the point miss aldclyffe neither moved nor spoke during this proceeding it might have been supposed that she was quite unmindful of it had it not been for what was revealed by a keen penetration of the veil covering her countenancethe rays from two bright black eyes directed towards the lawyer and his interlocutor  springrove came fifth manston seventh when the examination of all was ended and the last man had retired nyttleton again as at the former time blandly asked his client which of the eight she personally preferred i still think the fifth we spoke to springrove the man whose letter i pounced upon at first to be by far the best qualified in short most suitable generally  i am sorry to say that i differ from you i lean to my first notion stillthat mrmr manston is most desirable in tone and bearing and even specifically i think he would suit me best in the longrun  mr nyttleton looked out of the window at the whitened wall of the court  of course madam your opinion may be perfectly sound and reliable a sort of instinct i know often leads ladies by a short cut to conclusions truer than those come to by men after laborious roundabout calculations based on long experience i must say i shouldnt recommend him  why pray  well let us look first at his letter of answer to the advertisement he didnt reply till the last insertion thats one thing his letter is bold and frank in tone so bold and frank that the second thought after reading it is that not honesty but unscrupulousness of conscience dictated it it is written in an indifferent mood as if he felt that he was humbugging us in his statement that he was the right man for such an office that he tried hard to get it only as a matter of form which required that he should neglect no opportunity that came in his way  you may be right mr nyttleton but i dont quite see the grounds of your reasoning  he has been as you perceive almost entirely used to the office duties of a city architect the experience we dont want you want a man whose acquaintance with rural landed properties is more practical and closersomebody who if he has not filled exactly such an office before has lived a country life knows the ins and outs of country tenancies building farming and so on  hes by far the most intellectual looking of them all  yes he may beyour opinion miss aldclyffe is worth more than mine in that matter and more than you say he is a man of partshis brain power would soon enable him to master details and fit him for the post i dont much doubt that but to speak clearly here his words started off at a jogtrot i wouldnt run the risk of placing the management of an estate of mine in his hands on any account whatever there thats flat and plain madam  but definitely she said with a show of impatience what is your reason  he is a voluptuary with activity which is a very bad form of manas bad as it is rare  oh thank you for your explicit statement mr nyttleton said miss aldclyffe starting a little and flushing with displeasure  mr nyttleton nodded slightly as a sort of neutral motion simply signifying a receipt of the information good or bad  and i really think it is hardly worth while to trouble you further in this continued the lady hes quite good enough for a little insignificant place like mine at knapwater and i know that i could not get on with one of the others for a single month well try him  certainly miss aldclyffe said the lawyer and mr manston was written to to the effect that he was the successful competitor  did you see how unmistakably her temper was getting the better of her that minute you were in the room said nyttleton to tayling when their client had left the house nyttleton was a man who surveyed everybodys character in a sunless and shadowless northern light a culpable slyness which marked him as a boy had been moulded by time the improver into honourable circumspection  we frequently find that the quality which conjoined with the simplicity of the child is vice is virtue when it pervades the knowledge of the man  she was as near as damnit to boiling over when i added up her man continued nyttleton his handsome face is his qualification in her eyes they have met before i saw that  he didnt seem conscious of it said the junior  he didnt that was rather puzzling to me but still if ever a womans face spoke out plainly that she was in love with a man hers did that she was with him poor old maid shes almost old enough to be his mother if that manstons a schemer hell marry her as sure as i am nyttleton lets hope hes honest however  i dont think shes in love with him said tayling he had seen but little of the pair and yet he could not reconcile what he had noticed in miss aldclyffes behaviour with the idea that it was the bearing of a woman towards her lover  well your experience of the fiery phenomenon is more recent than mine rejoined nyttleton carelessly and you may remember the nature of it best     viii the events of eighteen days  1 from the third to the nineteenth of september  miss aldclyffes tenderness towards cytherea between the hours of her irascibility increased till it became no less than doting fondness like nature in the tropics with her hurricanes and the subsequent luxuriant vegetation effacing their ravages miss aldclyffe compensated for her outbursts by excess of generosity afterwards she seemed to be completely won out of herself by close contact with a young woman whose modesty was absolutely unimpaired and whose artlessness was as perfect as was compatible with the complexity necessary to produce the due charm of womanhood cytherea on her part perceived with honest satisfaction that her influence for good over miss aldclyffe was considerable ideas and habits peculiar to the younger which the elder lady had originally imitated as a mere whim she grew in course of time to take a positive delight in among others were evening and morning prayers dreaming over outdoor scenes learning a verse from some poem whilst dressing  yet try to force her sympathies as much as she would cytherea could feel no more than thankful for this even if she always felt as much as thankful the mysterious cloud hanging over the past life of her companion of which the uncertain light already thrown upon it only seemed to render still darker the unpenetrated remainder nourished in her a feeling which was scarcely too slight to be called dread she would have infinitely preferred to be treated distantly as the mere dependent by such a changeable naturelike a fountain always herself yet always another that a crime of any deep dye had ever been perpetrated or participated in by her namesake she would not believe but the reckless adventuring of the ladys youth seemed connected with deeds of darkness rather than of light  sometimes miss aldclyffe appeared to be on the point of making some absorbing confidence but reflection invariably restrained her cytherea hoped that such a confidence would come with time and that she might thus be a means of soothing a mind which had obviously known extreme suffering  but miss aldclyffes reticence concerning her past was not imitated by cytherea though she never disclosed the one fact of her knowledge that the lovesuit between miss aldclyffe and her father terminated abnormally the maidens natural ingenuousness on subjects not set down for special guard had enabled miss aldclyffe to worm from her fragment by fragment every detail of her fathers history cytherea saw how deeply miss aldclyffe sympathizedand it compensated her to some extent for the hasty resentments of other times  thus uncertainly she lived on it was perceived by the servants of the house that some secret bond of connection existed between miss aldclyffe and her companion but they were woman and woman not woman and man the facts were ethereal and refined and so they could not be worked up into a taking story whether as old critics disputed a supernatural machinery be necessary to an epic or no an ungodly machinery is decidedly necessary to a scandal  another letter had come to her from edwardvery short but full of entreaty asking why she would not write just one linejust one line of cold friendship at least she then allowed herself to think little by little whether she had not perhaps been too harsh with him and at last wondered if he were really much to blame for being engaged to another woman ah brain there is one in me stronger than you she said the young maid now continually pulled out his letter read it and reread it almost crying with pity the while to think what wretched suspense he must be enduring at her silence till her heart chid her for her cruelty she felt that she must send him a lineone little linejust a wee line to keep him alive poor thing sighing like donna clara        ah were he now before me         in spite of injured pride       i fear my eyes would pardon         before my tongue could chide   2 september the twentieth three to four pm  it was the third week in september about five weeks after cythereas arrival when miss aldclyffe requested her one day to go through the village of carriford and assist herself in collecting the subscriptions made by some of the inhabitants of the parish to a religious society she patronized miss aldclyffe formed one of what was called a ladies association each member of which collected tributary streams of shillings from her inferiors to add to her own pound at the end  miss aldclyffe took particular interest in cythereas appearance that afternoon and the object of her attention was indeed gratifying to look at the sight of the lithe girl set off by an airy dress coquettish jacket flexible hat a ray of starlight in each eye and a war of lilies and roses in each cheek was a palpable pleasure to the mistress of the mansion yet a pleasure which appeared to partake less of the nature of affectionate satisfaction than of mental gratification  eight names were printed in the report as belonging to miss aldclyffes list with the amount of subscriptionmoney attached to each  i will collect the first four whilst you do the same with the last four said miss aldclyffe  the names of two tradespeople stood first in cythereas share then came a miss hinton last of all in the printed list was mr springrove the elder underneath his name was pencilled in miss aldclyffes handwriting mr manston  manston had arrived on the estate in the capacity of steward three or four days previously and occupied the old manorhouse which had been altered and repaired for his reception  call on mr manston said the lady impressively looking at the name written under cythereas portion of the list  but he does not subscribe yet  i know it but call and leave him a report dont forget it  say you would be pleased if he would subscribe  yessay i should be pleased if he would repeated miss aldclyffe smiling goodbye dont hurry in your walk if you cant get easily through your task today put off some of it till tomorrow  each then started on her rounds cytherea going in the first place to the old manorhouse mr manston was not indoors which was a relief to her she called then on the two gentlemanfarmers wives who soon transacted their business with her frigidly indifferent to her personality a person who socially is nothing is thought less of by people who are not much than by those who are a great deal  she then turned towards peakhill cottage the residence of miss hinton who lived there happily enough with an elderly servant and a housedog as companions her father and last remaining parent had retired thither four years before this time after having filled the post of editor to the casterbridge chronicle for eighteen or twenty years there he died soon after and though comparatively a poor man he left his daughter sufficiently well provided for as a modest fundholder and claimant of sundry small sums in dividends to maintain herself as mistress at peakhill  at cythereas knock an inner door was heard to open and close and footsteps crossed the passage hesitatingly the next minute cytherea stood face to face with the lady herself  adelaide hinton was about nineandtwenty years of age her hair was plentiful like cythereas own her teeth equalled cythereas in regularity and whiteness but she was much paler and had features too transparent to be in place among household surroundings her mouth expressed love less forcibly than cythereas and as a natural result of her greater maturity her tread was less elastic and she was more selfpossessed  she had been a girl of that kind which mothers praise as not forward by way of contrast when disparaging those warmer ones with whom loving is an end and not a means men of forty too said of her a good sensible wife for any man if she cares to marry the caring to marry being thrown in as the vaguest hypothesis because she was so practical yet it would be singular if in such cases the important subject of marriage should be excluded from manipulation by hands that are ready for practical performance in every domestic concern besides  cytherea was an acquisition and the greeting was hearty  good afternoon o yesmiss graye from miss aldclyffes i have seen you at church and i am so glad you have called come in i wonder if i have change enough to pay my subscription she spoke girlishly  adelaide when in the company of a younger woman always levelled herself down to that younger womans age from a sense of justice to herselfas if though not her own age at common law it was in equity  it doesnt matter ill come again  yes do at any time not only on this errand but you must step in for a minute do  i have been wanting to come for several weeks  thats right now you must see my houselonely isnt it for a single person people said it was odd for a young woman like me to keep on a house but what did i care if you knew the pleasure of locking up your own door with the sensation that you reigned supreme inside it you would say it was worth the risk of being called odd mr springrove attends to my gardening the dog attends to robbers and whenever there is a snake or toad to kill jane does it  how nice it is better than living in a town  far better a town makes a cynic of me  the remark recalled somewhat startlingly to cythereas mind that edward had used those very words to herself one evening at budmouth  miss hinton opened an interior door and led her visitor into a small drawingroom commanding a view of the country for miles  the missionary business was soon settled but the chat continued  how lonely it must be here at night said cytherea arent you afraid  at first i was slightly but i got used to the solitude and you know a sort of commonsense will creep even into timidity i say to myself sometimes at night if i were anybody but a harmless woman not worth the trouble of a worms ghost to appear to me i should think that every sound i hear was a spirit but you must see all over my house  cytherea was highly interested in seeing  i say you must do this and you must do that as if you were a child remarked adelaide a privileged friend of mine tells me this use of the imperative comes of being so constantly in nobodys society but my own  ah yes i suppose she is right  cytherea called the friend she by a rule of ladylike practice for a womans friend is delicately assumed by another friend to be of their own sex in the absence of knowledge to the contrary just as cats are called shes until they prove themselves hes  miss hinton laughed mysteriously  i get a humorous reproof for it now and then i assure you she continued  humorous reproof thats not from a woman who can reprove humorously but a man was the groove of cythereas thought at the remark your brother reproves you i expect said that innocent young lady  no said miss hinton with a candid air tis only a professional man i am acquainted with she looked out of the window  women are persistently imitative no sooner did a thought flash through cythereas mind that the man was a lover than she became a miss aldclyffe in a mild form  i imagine hes a lover she said  miss hinton smiled a smile of experience in that line  few women if taxed with having an admirer are so free from vanity as to deny the impeachment even if it is utterly untrue when it does happen to be true they look pityingly away from the person who is so benighted as to have got no further than suspecting it  there nowmiss hinton you are engaged to be married said cytherea accusingly  adelaide nodded her head practically well yes i am she said  the word engaged had no sooner passed cythereas lips than the sound of itthe mere sound of her own lipscarried her mind to the time and circumstances under which miss aldclyffe had used it towards herself a sickening thought followedbased but on a mere surmise yet its presence took every other idea away from cythereas mind miss hinton had used edwards words about towns she mentioned mr springrove as attending to her garden it could not be that edward was the man that miss aldclyffe had planned to reveal her rival thus  are you going to be married soon she inquired with a steadiness the result of a sort of fascination but apparently of indifference  not very soonstill soon  ahha in less than three months said cytherea  two  now that the subject was well in hand adelaide wanted no more prompting you wont tell anybody if i show you something she said with eager mystery  o no nobody but does he live in this parish  no  nothing proved yet  whats his name said cytherea flatly her breath and heart had begun their old tricks and came and went hotly miss hinton could not see her face  what do you think said miss hinton  george said cytherea with deceitful agony  no said adelaide but now you shall see him first come here and she led the way upstairs into her bedroom there standing on the dressing table in a little frame was the unconscious portrait of edward springrove  there he is miss hinton said and a silence ensued  are you very fond of him continued the miserable cytherea at length  yes of course i am her companion replied but in the tone of one who lived in abrahams bosom all the year and was therefore untouched by solemn thought at the fact hes my cousina native of this village we were engaged before my fathers death left me so lonely i was only twenty and a much greater belle than i am now we know each other thoroughly as you may imagine i give him a little sermonizing now and then  why  o its only in fun hes very naughty sometimesnot really you knowbut he will look at any pretty face when he sees it  storing up this statement of his susceptibility as another item to be miserable upon when she had time how do you know that cytherea asked with a swelling heart  well you know how things do come to womens ears he used to live at budmouth as an assistantarchitect and i found out that a young giddy thing of a girl who lives there somewhere took his fancy for a day or two but i dont feel jealous at allour engagement is so matteroffact that neither of us can be jealous and it was a mere flirtationshe was too silly for him hes fond of rowing and kindly gave her an airing for an evening or two ill warrant they talked the most unmitigated rubbish under the sunall shallowness and pastime just as everything is at watering placesneither of them caring a bit for the othershe giggling like a goose all the time  concentrated essence of woman pervaded the room rather than air she didnt and it wasnt shallowness cytherea burst out with brimming eyes twas deep deceit on one side and entire confidence on the otheryes it was the pentup emotion had swollen and swollen inside the young thing till the dam could no longer embay it the instant the words were out she would have given worlds to have been able to recall them  do you know heror him said miss hinton starting with suspicion at the warmth shown  the two rivals had now lost their personality quite there was the same keen brightness of eye the same movement of the mouth the same mind in both as they looked doubtingly and excitedly at each other as is invariably the case with women when a man they care for is the subject of an excitement among them the situation abstracted the differences which distinguished them as individuals and left only the properties common to them as atoms of a sex  cytherea caught at the chance afforded her of not betraying herself yes i know her she said  well said miss hinton i am really vexed if my speaking so lightly of any friend of yours has hurt your feelings but  o never mind cytherea returned it doesnt matter miss hinton i think i must leave you now i have to call at other places yesi must go  miss hinton in a perplexed state of mind showed her visitor politely downstairs to the door here cytherea bade her a hurried adieu and flitted down the garden into the lane  she persevered in her duties with a wayward pleasure in giving herself misery as was her wont mr springroves name was next on the list and she turned towards his dwelling the three tranters inn  3 four to five pm  the cottages along carriford village street were not so close but that on one side or other of the road was always a hedge of hawthorn or privet over or through which could be seen gardens or orchards rich with produce it was about the middle of the early appleharvest and the laden trees were shaken at intervals by the gatherers the soft pattering of the falling crop upon the grassy ground being diversified by the loud rattle of vagrant ones upon a rail hencoop basket or leanto roof or upon the rounded and stooping backs of the collectorsmostly children who would have cried bitterly at receiving such a smart blow from any other quarter but smilingly assumed it to be but fun in apples  the three tranters inn a manygabled mediaeval building constructed almost entirely of timber plaster and thatch stood close to the line of the roadside almost opposite the churchyard and was connected with a row of cottages on the left by thatched outbuildings it was an uncommonly characteristic and handsome specimen of the genuine roadside inn of bygone times and standing on one of the great highways in this part of england had in its time been the scene of as much of what is now looked upon as the romantic and genial experience of stagecoach travelling as any haltingplace in the country the railway had absorbed the whole stream of traffic which formerly flowed through the village and along by the ancient door of the inn reducing the emptyhanded landlord who used only to farm a few fields at the back of the house to the necessity of eking out his attenuated income by increasing the extent of his agricultural business if he would still maintain his social standing next to the general stillness pervading the spot the long line of outbuildings adjoining the house was the most striking and saddening witness to the passedaway fortunes of the three tranters inn it was the bulk of the original stabling and where once the hoofs of twoscore horses had daily rattled over the stony yard to and from the stalls within thick grass now grew whilst the line of roofsonce so straightover the decayed stalls had sunk into vast hollows till they seemed like the cheeks of toothless age  on a green plot at the other end of the building grew two or three large widespreading elmtrees from which the sign was suspendedrepresenting the three men called tranters irregular carriers standing side by side and exactly alike to a hairsbreadth the grain of the wood and joints of the boards being visible through the thin paint depicting their forms which were still further disfigured by red stains running downwards from the rusty nails above  under the trees now stood a cidermill and press and upon the spot sheltered by the boughs were gathered mr springrove himself his men the parish clerk two or three other men grinders and supernumeraries a woman with an infant in her arms a flock of pigeons and some little boys with straws in their mouths endeavouring whenever the mens backs were turned to get a sip of the sweet juice issuing from the vat  edward springrove the elder the landlord now more particularly a farmer and for two months in the year a cidermaker was an employer of labour of the old school who worked himself among his men he was now engaged in packing the pomace into horsehair bags with a rammer and gad weedy his man was occupied in shovelling up more from a tub at his side the shovel shone like silver from the action of the juice and ever and anon in its motion to and fro caught the rays of the declining sun and reflected them in bristling stars of light  mr springrove had been too young a man when the pristine days of the three tranters had departed for ever to have much of the host left in him now he was a poet with a rough skin one whose sturdiness was more the result of external circumstances than of intrinsic nature too kindly constituted to be very provident he was yet not imprudent he had a quiet humorousness of disposition not out of keeping with a frequent melancholy the general expression of his countenance being one of abstraction like walt whitman he felt as his years increased       i foresee too much it means more than i thought  on the present occasion he wore gaiters and a leathern apron and worked with his shirtsleeves rolled up beyond his elbows disclosing solid and fleshy rather than muscular arms they were stained by the cider and two or three brown applepips from the pomace he was handling were to be seen sticking on them here and there  the other prominent figure was that of richard crickett the parish clerk a kind of bowdlerized rake who ate only as much as a woman and had the rheumatism in his left hand the remainder of the group brownfaced peasants wore smockfrocks embroidered on the shoulders with hearts and diamonds and were girt round their middle with a strap another being worn round the right wrist  and have you seen the steward mr springrove said the clerk  just a glimpse of him but twas just enough to show me that hes not here for long  why mid that be  hell never stand the vagaries of the female figure holden the reinsnot he  she d pay en well said a grinder and moneys money  ahtis very much so the clerk replied  yes yes naibour crickett said springrove but shell vlee in a passionall the fat will be in the fireand theres an end ot yes she is a one continued the farmer resting raising his eyes and reading the features of a distant apple  she is said gad resting too it is wonderful how prompt a journeyman is in following his masters initiative to rest and reflectively regarding the ground in front of him  true a one is she the clerk chimed in shaking his head ominously  she has such a temper said the farmer and is so wilful too you may as well try to stop a footpath as stop her when she has taken anything into her head id as soon grind little green crabs all day as live wi her  tis a temper she hev tis the clerk replied though i be a servant of the church that say it but she isnt goen to flee in a passion this time  the audience waited for the continuation of the speech as if they knew from experience the exact distance off it lay in the future  the clerk swallowed nothing as if it were a great deal and then went on theres someat between em mark my words naibourstheres someat between em  dye mean it  i d know it he came last saturday didnt he  a did truly said gad weedy at the same time taking an apple from the hopper of the mill eating a piece and flinging back the remainder to be ground up for cider  he went to church asunday said the clerk again  a did  and she kept her eye upon en all the service her face flickeren between red and white but never stoppen at either  mr springrove nodded and went to the press  well said the clerk you dont call her the kind o woman to make mistakes in just trotten through the weekly service o god why as a rule shes as right as i be myself  mr springrove nodded again and gave a twist to the screw of the press followed in the movement by gad at the other side the two grinders expressing by looks of the greatest concern that if miss aldclyffe were as right at church as the clerk she must be right indeed  yes as right in the service o god as i be myself repeated the clerk but last sunday when we were in the tenth commandment says she incline our hearts to keep this law says she when twas laws in our hearts we beseech thee all the church through her eye was upon himshe was quite losthearts to keep this law says she she was no more than a mere shadder at that tenth timea mere shadder you mit ha mouthed across to her laws in our hearts we beseech thee fifty times overshed never ha noticed ye shes in love wi the man thats what she is  then shes a bigger stunpoll than i took her for said mr springrove why shes old enough to be his mother  the rowll be between her and that young curlywig youll see she wont run the risk of that pretty face been near  clerk crickett i d fancy you d know everything about everybody said gad  well sos said the clerk modestly i do know a little it comes to me  and i d know where from  ah  that wife o thine shes an entertainen woman not to speak disrespectful  she is and a winnen one look at the husbands sheve hadgod bless her  i wonder you could stand third in that list clerk crickett said mr springrove  well t has been a power o marvel to myself oftentimes yes matrimony do begin wi dearly beloved and ends wi amazement as the prayerbook says but what could i do naibour springrove twas ordained to be well do i call to mind what your poor lady said to me when i had just married ah mr crickett says she your wife will soon settle you as she did her other two heres a glass o rum for i shant see your poor face this time next year i swallered the rum called again next year and said mrs springrove you gave me a glass o rum last year because i was going to diehere i be alive still you see well said clerk heres two glasses for you now then says she thank you mem i said and swallered the rum well dang my old sides next year i thought id call again and get three and call i did but she wouldnt give me a drop o the commonest no clerk says she you be too tough for a womans pity ah poor soul twas true enough here be i that was expected to die alive and hard as a nail you see and theres she moulderen in her grave  i used to think twas your wifes fate not to have a liven husband when i zid em die off so said gad  fate bless thy simplicity so twas her fate but she struggled to have one and would and did fates nothen beside a womans schemen  i suppose then that fate is a he like us and the lord and the rest o em up above there said gad lifting his eyes to the sky  hullo heres the young woman comen that we were atalken about bynow said a grinder suddenly interrupting shes comen up here as i be alive  the two grinders stood and regarded cytherea as if she had been a ship tacking into a harbour nearly stopping the mill in their new interest  stylish accoutrements about the head and shoulders to my thinken said the clerk sheenen curls and plenty o em  if theres one kind of pride more excusable than another in a young woman tis being proud of her hair said mr springrove  dear manthe pride there is only a small piece o the whole i warrant now though she can show such a figure she hant a stick o furniture to call her own  come clerk crickett let the maid be a maid while she is a maid said farmer springrove chivalrously  o replied the servant of the church ive nothen to say against ito no       the chimneysweepers daughter sue          as i have heard declare o        although shes neither sock nor shoe          will curl and deck her hair o  cytherea was rather disconcerted at finding that the gradual cessation of the chopping of the mill was on her account and still more when she saw all the cidermakers eyes fixed upon her except mr springroves whose natural delicacy restrained him she neared the plot of grass but instead of advancing further hesitated on its border  mr springrove perceived her embarrassment which was relieved when she saw his oldestablished figure coming across to her wiping his hands in his apron  i know your errand missie he said and am glad to see you and attend to it ill step indoors  if you are busy i am in no hurry for a minute or two said cytherea  then if so be you really wouldnt mind well wring down this last filling to let it drain all night  not at all i like to see you  we are only just grinding down the early pickthongs and griffins continued the farmer in a halfapologetic tone for detaining by his cidermaking any welldressed woman they rot as black as a chimneycrook if we keep em till the regulars turn in as he spoke he went back to the press cytherea keeping at his elbow im later than i should have been by rights he continued taking up a lever for propelling the screw and beckoning to the men to come forward the truth is my son edward had promised to come today and i made preparations but instead of him comes a letter london september the eighteenth dear father says he and went on to tell me he couldnt it threw me out a bit  of course said cytherea  hes got a place a blieve said the clerk drawing near  no poor mortal fellow no he tried for this one here you know but couldnt manage to get it i dont know the rights o the matter but willynilly they wouldnt have him for steward now mates form in line  springrove the clerk the grinders and gad all ranged themselves behind the lever of the screw and walked round like soldiers wheeling  the man that the old quean hev got is a man you can hardly get upon your tongue to gainsay by the look o en rejoined clerk crickett  one o them people that can contrive to be thought no worse o for stealen a horse than another man for looken over hedge at en said a grinder  well hes all there as steward and is quite the gentlemanno doubt about that  so would my ted ha been for the matter o that the farmer said  thats true a would sir  i said ill give ted a good education if it do cost me my eyes and i would have done it  ay that you would so said the chorus of assistants solemnly  but he took to books and drawing naturally and cost very little and as a windup the womenfolk hatched up a match between him and his cousin  whens the wedden to be mr springrove  uncertainbut soon i suppose edward you see can do anything pretty nearly and yet cant get a straightforward living i wish sometimes i had kept him here and let professions go but he was such a one for the pencil  he dropped the lever in the hedge and turned to his visitor  now then missie if youll come indoors please  gad weedy looked with a placid criticism at cytherea as she withdrew with the farmer  i could tell by the tongue o her that she didnt take her degrees in our county he said in an undertone   the railways have left you lonely here she observed when they were indoors  save the withered old flies which were quite tame from the solitude not a being was in the house nobody seemed to have entered it since the last passenger had been called out to mount the last stagecoach that had run by  yes the inn and i seem almost a pair of fossils the farmer replied looking at the room and then at himself  o mr springrove said cytherea suddenly recollecting herself i am much obliged to you for recommending me to miss aldclyffe she began to warm towards the old man there was in him a gentleness of disposition which reminded her of her own father  recommending not at all miss tedthats my sonted said a fellowdraughtsman of his had a sister who wanted to be doing something in the world and i mentioned it to the housekeeper thats all ay i miss my son very much  she kept her back to the window that he might not see her rising colour  yes he continued sometimes i cant help feeling uneasy about him you know he seems not made for a town life exactly he gets very queer over it sometimes i think perhaps hell be better when hes married to adelaide  a halfimpatient feeling arose in her like that which possesses a sick person when he hears a recentlystruck hour struck again by a slow clock she had lived further on  everything depends upon whether he loves her she said tremulously  he used tohe doesnt show it so much now but thats because hes older you see it was several years ago they first walked together as young man and young woman shes altered too from what she was when he first courted her  how sir  o shes more sensible by half when he used to write to her shed creep up the lane and look back over her shoulder and slide out the letter and read a word and stand in thought looking at the hills and seeing none then the cuckoo would cryaway the letter would slip and shed start wi fright at the mere bird and have a red skin before the quickest man among ye could say blood rush up  he came forward with the money and dropped it into her hand his thoughts were still with edward and he absently took her little fingers in his as he said earnestly and ingenuously  tis so seldom i get a gentlewoman to speak to that i cant help speaking to you miss graye on my fears for edward i sometimes am afraid that hell never get onthat hell die poor and despised under the worst mental conditions a keen sense of having been passed in the race by men whose brains are nothing to his own all through his seeing too far into thingsbeing discontented with makeshiftsthinking o perfection in things and then sickened that theres no such thing as perfection i shant be sorry to see him marry since it may settle him down and do him good ay well hope for the best  he let go her hand and accompanied her to the door saying if you should care to walk this way and talk to an old man once now and then it will be a great delight to him miss graye goodevening to ye ah look a thunderstorm is brewingbe quick home or shall i step up with you  no thank you mr springrove good evening she said in a low voice and hurried away one thought still possessed her edward had trifled with her love  4 five to six pm  she followed the road into a bower of trees overhanging it so densely that the pass appeared like a rabbits burrow and presently reached a side entrance to the park the clouds rose more rapidly than the farmer had anticipated the sheep moved in a trail and complained incoherently livid grey shades like those of the modern french painters made a mystery of the remote and dark parts of the vista and seemed to insist upon a suspension of breath before she was halfway across the park the thunder rumbled distinctly  the direction in which she had to go would take her close by the old manorhouse the air was perfectly still and between each low rumble of the thunder behind she could hear the roar of the waterfall before her and the creak of the engine among the bushes hard by it hurrying on with a growing dread of the gloom and of the approaching storm she drew near the old house now rising before her against the dark foliage and sky in tones of strange whiteness  on the flight of steps which descended from a terrace in front to the level of the park stood a man he appeared partly from the relief the position gave to his figure and partly from fact to be of towering height he was dark in outline and was looking at the sky with his hands behind him  it was necessary for cytherea to pass directly across the line of his front she felt so reluctant to do this that she was about to turn under the trees out of the path and enter it again at a point beyond the old house but he had seen her and she came on mechanically unconsciously averting her face a little and dropping her glance to the ground  her eyes unswervingly lingered along the path until they fell upon another path branching in a right line from the path she was pursuing it came from the steps of the old house i am exactly opposite him now she thought and his eyes are going through me  a clear masculine voice said at the same instant  are you afraid  she interpreting his question by her feelings at the moment assumed himself to be the object of fear if any i dont think i am she stammered  he seemed to know that she thought in that sense  of the thunder i mean he said not of myself  she must turn to him now i think it is going to rain she remarked for the sake of saying something  he could not conceal his surprise and admiration of her face and bearing he said courteously it may possibly not rain before you reach the house if you are going there  yes i am  may i walk up with you it is lonely under the trees  no fearing his courtesy arose from a belief that he was addressing a woman of higher station than was hers she added i am miss aldclyffes companion i dont mind the loneliness  o miss aldclyffes companion then will you be kind enough to take a subscription to her she sent to me this afternoon to ask me to become a subscriber to her society and i was out of course ill subscribe if she wishes it i take a great interest in the society  miss aldclyffe will be glad to hear that i know  yes let me seewhat society did she say it was i am afraid i havent enough money in my pocket and yet it would be a satisfaction to her to have practical proof of my willingness ill get it and be out in one minute  he entered the house and was at her side again within the time he had named this is it he said pleasantly  she held up her hand the soft tips of his fingers brushed the palm of her glove as he placed the money within it she wondered why his fingers should have touched her  i think after all he continued that the rain is upon us and will drench you before you reach the house yes see there  he pointed to a round wet spot as large as a nasturtium leaf which had suddenly appeared upon the white surface of the step  you had better come into the porch it is not nearly night yet the clouds make it seem later than it really is  heavy drops of rain followed immediately by a forked flash of lightning and sharp rattling thunder compelled her willingly or no to accept his invitation she ascended the steps stood beside him just within the porch and for the first time obtained a series of short views of his person as they waited there in silence  he was an extremely handsome man wellformed and welldressed of an age which seemed to be two or three years less than thirty the most striking point in his appearance was the wonderful almost preternatural clearness of his complexion there was not a blemish or speck of any kind to mar the smoothness of its surface or the beauty of its hue next his forehead was square and broad his brows straight and firm his eyes penetrating and clear by collecting the round of expressions they gave forth a person who theorized on such matters would have imbibed the notion that their owner was of a nature to kick against the pricks the last man in the world to put up with a position because it seemed to be his destiny to do so one who took upon himself to resist fate with the vindictive determination of a theomachist eyes and forehead both would have expressed keenness of intellect too severely to be pleasing had their force not been counteracted by the lines and tone of the lips these were full and luscious to a surprising degree possessing a womanlike softness of curve and a ruby redness so intense as to testify strongly to much susceptibility of heart where feminine beauty was concerneda susceptibility that might require all the ballast of brain with which he had previously been credited to confine within reasonable channels  his manner was rather elegant than good his speech wellfinished and unconstrained  the pause in their discourse which had been caused by the peal of thunder was unbroken by either for a minute or two during which the ears of both seemed to be absently following the low roar of the waterfall as it became gradually rivalled by the increasing rush of rain upon the trees and herbage of the grove after her short looks at him cytherea had turned her head towards the avenue for a while and now glancing back again for an instant she discovered that his eyes were engaged in a steady though delicate regard of her face and form  at this moment by reason of the narrowness of the porch their dresses touched and remained in contact  his clothes are something exterior to every man but to a woman her dress is part of her body its motions are all present to her intelligence if not to her eyes no man knows how his coattails swing by the slightest hyperbole it may be said that her dress has sensation crease but the very ultima thule of fringe or flounce and it hurts her as much as pinching her delicate antennae or feelers bristle on every outlying frill go to the uppermost she is there tread on the lowest the fair creature is there almost before you  thus the touch of clothes which was nothing to manston sent a thrill through cytherea seeing moreover that he was of the nature of a mysterious stranger she looked out again at the storm but still felt him at last to escape the sensation she moved away though by so doing it was necessary to advance a little into the rain  look the rain is coming into the porch upon you he said step inside the door  cytherea hesitated  perfectly safe i assure you he added laughing and holding the door open you shall see what a state of disorganization i am inboxes on boxes furniture straw crockery in every form of transposition an old woman is in the back quarters somewhere beginning to put things to rights you know the inside of the house i dare say  i have never been in  o well come along here you see they have made a door through here they have put a partition dividing the old hall into two one part is now my parlour there they have put a plaster ceiling hiding the old chestnutcarved roof because it was too high and would have been chilly for me you see being the original hall it was open right up to the top and here the lord of the manor and his retainers used to meet and be merry by the light from the monstrous fire which shone out from that monstrous fireplace now narrowed to a mere nothing for my grate though you can see the old outline still i almost wish i could have had it in its original state  with more romance and less comfort  yes exactly well perhaps the wish is not deepseated you will see how the things are tumbled in anyhow packingcases and all the only piece of ornamental furniture yet unpacked is this one  an organ  yes an organ i made it myself except the pipes i opened the case this afternoon to commence soothing myself at once it is not a very large one but quite big enough for a private house you play i dare say  the piano i am not at all used to an organ  you would soon acquire the touch for an organ though it would spoil your touch for the piano not that that matters a great deal a piano isnt much as an instrument  it is the fashion to say so now i think it is quite good enough  that isnt altogether a right sentiment about things being good enough  nono what i mean is that the men who despise pianos do it as a rule from their teeth merely for fashions sake because cleverer men have said it before themnot from the experience of their ears  now cytherea all at once broke into a blush at the consciousness of a great snub she had been guilty of in her eagerness to explain herself he charitably expressed by a look that he did not in the least mind her blunder if it were one and this attitude forced him into a position of mental superiority which vexed her  i play for my private amusement only he said i have never learned scientifically all i know is what i taught myself  the thunder lightning and rain had now increased to a terrific force the clouds from which darts forks zigzags and balls of fire continually sprang did not appear to be more than a hundred yards above their heads and every now and then a flash and a peal made gaps in the stewards descriptions he went towards the organ in the midst of a volley which seemed to shake the aged house from foundations to chimney  you are not going to play now are you said cytherea uneasily  o yes why not now he said you cant go home and therefore we may as well be amused if you dont mind sitting on this box the few chairs i have unpacked are in the other room  without waiting to see whether she sat down or not he turned to the organ and began extemporizing a harmony which meandered through every variety of expression of which the instrument was capable presently he ceased and began searching for some musicbook  what a splendid flash he said as the lightning again shone in through the mullioned window which of a proportion to suit the whole extent of the original hall was much too large for the present room the thunder pealed again cytherea in spite of herself was frightened not only at the weather but at the general unearthly weirdness which seemed to surround her there  i wish ithe lightning wasnt so bright do you think it will last long she said timidly  it cant last much longer he murmured without turning running his fingers again over the keys but this is nothing he continued suddenly stopping and regarding her it seems brighter because of the deep shadow under those trees yonder dont mind it now look at melook in my facenow  he had faced the window looking fixedly at the sky with his dark strong eyes she seemed compelled to do as she was bidden and looked in the toodelicately beautiful face  the flash came but he did not turn or blink keeping his eyes fixed as firmly as before there he said turning to her thats the way to look at lightning  o it might have blinded you she exclaimed  nonsensenot lightning of this sorti shouldnt have stared at it if there had been danger it is only sheetlightning now now will you have another piece something from an oratorio this time  no thank youi dont want to hear it whilst it thunders so but he had begun without heeding her answer and she stood motionless again marvelling at the wonderful indifference to all external circumstance which was now evinced by his complete absorption in the music before him  why do you play such saddening chords she said when he next paused  hmbecause i like them i suppose said he lightly dont you like sad impressions sometimes  yes sometimes perhaps  when you are full of trouble  yes  well why shouldnt i when i am full of trouble  are you troubled  i am troubled he said this thoughtfully and abruptlyso abruptly that she did not push the dialogue further  he now played more powerfully cytherea had never heard music in the completeness of full orchestral power and the tones of the organ which reverberated with considerable effect in the comparatively small space of the room heightened by the elemental strife of light and sound outside moved her to a degree out of proportion to the actual power of the mere notes practised as was the hand that produced them the varying strainsnow loud now soft simple complicated weird touching grand boisterous subdued each phase distinct yet modulating into the next with a graceful and easy flowshook and bent her to themselves as a gushing brook shakes and bends a shadow cast across its surface the power of the music did not show itself so much by attracting her attention to the subject of the piece as by taking up and developing as its libretto the poem of her own life and soul shifting her deeds and intentions from the hands of her judgment and holding them in its own  she was swayed into emotional opinions concerning the strange man before her new impulses of thought came with new harmonies and entered into her with a gnawing thrill a dreadful flash of lightning then and the thunder close upon it she found herself involuntarily shrinking up beside him and looking with parted lips at his face  he turned his eyes and saw her emotion which greatly increased the ideal element in her expressive face she was in the state in which womans instinct to conceal has lost its power over her impulse to tell and he saw it bending his handsome face over her till his lips almost touched her ear he murmured without breaking the harmonies  do you very much like this piece  very much indeed she said  i could see you were affected by it i will copy it for you  thank you much  i will bring it to the house to you tomorrow who shall i ask for  o not for me dont bring it she said hastily i shouldnt like you to  let me seetomorrow evening at seven or a few minutes past i shall be passing the waterfall on my way home i could conveniently give it you there and i should like you to have it  he modulated into the pastoral symphony still looking in her eyes  very well she said to get rid of the look  the storm had by this time considerably decreased in violence and in seven or ten minutes the sky partially cleared the clouds around the western horizon becoming lighted up with the rays of the sinking sun  cytherea drew a long breath of relief and prepared to go away she was full of a distressing sense that her detention in the old manorhouse and the acquaintanceship it had set on foot was not a thing she wished it was such a foolish thing to have been excited and dragged into frankness by the wiles of a stranger  allow me to come with you he said accompanying her to the door and again showing by his behaviour how much he was impressed with her his influence over her had vanished with the musical chords and she turned her back upon him may i come he repeated  no no the distance is not a quarter of a mileit is really not necessary thank you she said quietly and wishing him goodevening without meeting his eyes she went down the steps leaving him standing at the door  o how is it that man has so fascinated me was all she could think her own self as she had sat spellbound before him was all she could see her gait was constrained from the knowledge that his eyes were upon her until she had passed the hollow by the waterfall and by ascending the rise had become hidden from his view by the boughs of the overhanging trees  5 six to seven pm  the wet shining road threw the western glare into her eyes with an invidious lustre which rendered the restlessness of her mood more wearying her thoughts flew from idea to idea without asking for the slightest link of connection between one and another one moment she was full of the wild music and stirring scene with manstonthe next edwards image rose before her like a shadowy ghost then manstons black eyes seemed piercing her again and the reckless voluptuous mouth appeared bending to the curves of his special words what could be those troubles to which he had alluded perhaps miss aldclyffe was at the bottom of them sad at heart she paced on her life was bewildering her  on coming into miss aldclyffes presence cytherea told her of the incident not without a fear that she would burst into one of her ungovernable fits of temper at learning cythereas slight departure from the programme but strangely to cytherea miss aldclyffe looked delighted the usual crossexamination followed  and so you were with him all that time said the lady with assumed severity  yes i was  i did not tell you to call at the old house twice  i didnt call as i have said he made me come into the porch  what remarks did he make do you say  that the lightning was not so bad as i thought  a very important remark that did he she turned her glance full upon the girl and eyeing her searchingly said  did he say anything about me  nothing said cytherea returning her gaze calmly except that i was to give you the subscription  you are quite sure  quite  i believe you did he say anything striking or strange about himself  only one thingthat he was troubled  troubled  after saying the word miss aldclyffe relapsed into silence such behaviour as this had ended on most previous occasions by her making a confession and cytherea expected one now but for once she was mistaken nothing more was said  when she had returned to her room she sat down and penned a farewell letter to edward springrove as little able as any other excitable and brimming young woman of nineteen to feel that the wisest and only dignified course at that juncture was to do nothing at all she told him that to her painful surprise she had learnt that his engagement to another woman was a matter of notoriety she insisted that all honour bade him marry his early lovea woman far better than her unworthy self who only deserved to be forgotten and begged him to remember that he was not to see her face again she upbraided him for levity and cruelty in meeting her so frequently at budmouth and above all in stealing the kiss from her lips on the last evening of the water excursions i never never can forget it she said and then felt a sensation of having done her duty ostensibly persuading herself that her reproaches and commands were of such a force that no man to whom they were uttered could ever approach her more  yet it was all unconsciously said in words which betrayed a lingering tenderness of love at every unguarded turn like beatrice accusing dante from the chariot try as she might to play the superior being who contemned such mere eyesensuousness she betrayed at every point a pretty womans jealousy of a rival and covertly gave her old lover hints for excusing himself at each fresh indictment  this done cytherea still in a practical mood upbraided herself with weakness in allowing a stranger like mr manston to influence her as he had done that evening what right on earth had he to suggest so suddenly that she might meet him at the waterfall to receive his music she would have given much to be able to annihilate the ascendency he had obtained over her during that extraordinary interval of melodious sound not being able to endure the notion of his living a minute longer in the belief he was then holding she took her pen and wrote to him also                         knapwater house                          september 20th    i find i cannot meet you at seven oclock by the waterfall as i   promised the emotion i felt made me forgetful of realities                            c graye   a great statesman thinks several times and acts a young lady acts and thinks several times when a few minutes later she saw the postman carry off the bag containing one of the letters and a messenger with the other she for the first time asked herself the question whether she had acted very wisely in writing to either of the two men who had so influenced her     ix the events of ten weeks  1 from september the twentyfirst to the middle of november  the foremost figure within cythereas horizon exclusive of the inmates of knapwater house was now the steward mr manston it was impossible that they should live within a quarter of a mile of each other be engaged in the same service and attend the same church without meeting at some spot or another twice or thrice a week on sundays in her pew when by chance she turned her head cytherea found his eyes waiting desirously for a glimpse of hers and at first more strangely the eyes of miss aldclyffe furtively resting on him on coming out of church he frequently walked beside cytherea till she reached the gate at which residents in the house turned into the shrubbery by degrees a conjecture grew to a certainty she knew that he loved her  but a strange fact was connected with the development of his love he was palpably making the strongest efforts to subdue or at least to hide the weakness and as it sometimes seemed rather from his own conscience than from surrounding eyes hence she found that not one of his encounters with her was anything more than the result of pure accident he made no advances whatever without avoiding her he never sought her the words he had whispered at their first interview now proved themselves to be quite as much the result of unguarded impulse as was her answer something held him back bound his impulse down but she saw that it was neither pride of his person nor fear that she would refuse hima course she unhesitatingly resolved to take should he think fit to declare himself she was interested in him and his marvellous beauty as she might have been in some fascinating panther or leopardfor some undefinable reason she shrank from him even whilst she admired the keynote of her nature a warm precipitance of soul as coleridge happily writes it which manston had so directly pounced upon at their very first interview gave her now a tremulous sense of being in some way in his power  the state of mind was on the whole a dangerous one for a young and inexperienced woman and perhaps the circumstance which more than any other led her to cherish edwards image now was that he had taken no notice of the receipt of her letter stating that she discarded him it was plain then she said that he did not care deeply for her and she thereupon could not quite leave off caring deeply for him                    ingenium mulierum               nolunt ubi velis ubi nolis cupiunt ultro  the month of october passed and november began its course the inhabitants of the village of carriford grew weary of supposing that miss aldclyffe was going to marry her steward new whispers arose and became very distinct though they did not reach miss aldclyffes ears to the effect that the steward was deeply in love with cytherea graye indeed the fact became so obvious that there was nothing left to say about it except that their marriage would be an excellent one for bothfor her in point of comfortand for him in point of love  as circles in a pond grow wider and wider the next fact which at first had been patent only to cytherea herself in due time spread to her neighbours and they too wondered that he made no overt advances by the middle of november a theory made up of a combination of the other two was received with general favour its substance being that a guilty intrigue had been commenced between manston and miss aldclyffe some years before when he was a very young man and she still in the enjoyment of some womanly beauty but now that her seniority began to grow emphatic she was becoming distasteful to him his fear of the effect of the ladys jealousy would they said thus lead him to conceal from her his new attachment to cytherea almost the only woman who did not believe this was cytherea herself on unmistakable grounds which were hidden from all besides it was not only in public but even more markedly in secluded places on occasions when gallantry would have been safe from all discovery that this guarded course of action was pursued all the strength of a consuming passion burning in his eyes the while  2 november the eighteenth  it was on a friday in this month of november that owen graye paid a visit to his sister  his zealous integrity still retained for him the situation at budmouth and in order that there should be as little interruption as possible to his duties there he had decided not to come to knapwater till late in the afternoon and to return to budmouth by the first train the next morning miss aldclyffe having made a point of frequently offering him lodging for an unlimited period to the great pleasure of cytherea  he reached the house about four oclock and ringing the bell asked of the page who answered it for miss graye  when graye spoke the name of his sister manston who was just coming out from an interview with miss aldclyffe passed him in the vestibule and heard the question the stewards face grew hot and he secretly clenched his hands he half crossed the court then turned his head and saw that the lad still stood at the door though owen had been shown into the house manston went back to him  who was that man he said  i dont know sir  has he ever been here before  yes sir  how many times  three  you are sure you dont know him  i think he is miss grayes brother sir  then why the devil didnt you say so before manston exclaimed and again went on his way  of course that was not the man of my dreamsof course it couldnt be he said to himself that i should be such a foolsuch an utter fool good god to allow a girl to influence me like this day after day till i am jealous of her very brother a ladys dependent a waif a helpless thing entirely at the mercy of the world yes curse it that is just why it is that fact of her being so helpless against the blows of circumstances which renders her so deliciously sweet  he paused opposite his house should he get his horse saddled no  he went down the drive and out of the park having started to proceed to an outlying spot on the estate concerning some draining and to call at the potters yard to make an arrangement for the supply of pipes but a remark which miss aldclyffe had dropped in relation to cytherea was what still occupied his mind and had been the immediate cause of his excitement at the sight of her brother miss aldclyffe had meaningly remarked during their intercourse that cytherea was wildly in love with edward springrove in spite of his engagement to his cousin adelaide  how i am harassed he said aloud after deep thought for halfanhour while still continuing his walk with the greatest vehemence how i am harassed by these emotions of mine he calmed himself by an effort well duty after all it shall be as nearly as i can effect it honesty is the best policy with which vigorously uttered resolve he once more attempted to turn his attention to the prosy object of his journey  the evening had closed in to a dark and dreary night when the steward came from the potters door to proceed homewards again the gloom did not tend to raise his spirits and in the total lack of objects to attract his eye he soon fell to introspection as before it was along the margin of turnip fields that his path lay and the large leaves of the crop struck flatly against his feet at every step pouring upon them the rolling drops of moisture gathered upon their broad surfaces but the annoyance was unheeded next reaching a fir plantation he mounted the stile and followed the path into the midst of the darkness produced by the overhanging trees  after walking under the dense shade of the inky boughs for a few minutes he fancied he had mistaken the path which as yet was scarcely familiar to him this was proved directly afterwards by his coming at right angles upon some obstruction which careful feeling with outstretched hands soon told him to be a rail fence however as the wood was not large he experienced no alarm about finding the path again and with some sense of pleasure halted awhile against the rails to listen to the intensely melancholy yet musical wail of the firtops and as the wind passed on the prompt moan of an adjacent plantation in reply he could just dimly discern the airy summits of the two or three trees nearest him waving restlessly backwards and forwards and stretching out their boughs like hairy arms into the dull sky the scene from its striking and emphatic loneliness began to grow congenial to his mood all of human kind seemed at the antipodes  a sudden rattle on his right hand caused him to start from his reverie and turn in that direction there before him he saw rise up from among the trees a fountain of sparks and smoke then a red glare of light coming forward towards him then a flashing panorama of illuminated oblong pictures then the old darkness more impressive than ever  the surprise which had owed its origin to his imperfect acquaintance with the topographical features of that end of the estate had been but momentary the disturbance a wellknown one to dwellers by a railway being caused by the 650 downtrain passing along a shallow cutting in the midst of the wood immediately below where he stood the driver having the firedoor of the engine open at the minute of going by the train had when passing him already considerably slackened speed and now a whistle was heard announcing that carriford road station was not far in its van  but contrary to the natural order of things the discovery that it was only a commonplace train had not caused manston to stir from his position of facing the railway  if the 650 downtrain had been a flash of forked lightning transfixing him to the earth he could scarcely have remained in a more trancelike state he still leant against the railings his right hand still continued pressing on his walkingstick his weight on one foot his other heel raised his eyes wide open towards the blackness of the cutting the only movement in him was a slight dropping of the lower jaw separating his previously closed lips a little way as when a strange conviction rushes home suddenly upon a man a new surprise not nearly so trivial as the first had taken possession of him  it was on this account at one of the illuminated windows of a secondclass carriage in the series gone by he had seen a pale face reclining upon one hand the light from the lamp falling full upon it the face was a womans  at last manston moved gave a whispering kind of whistle adjusted his hat and walked on again crossquestioning himself in every direction as to how a piece of knowledge he had carefully concealed had found its way to another persons intelligence how can my address have become known he said at length audibly well it is a blessing i have been circumspect and honourable in relation to thatyes i will say it for once even if the words choke me that darling of mine cytherea never to be my own never i suppose all will come out now all the great sadness of his utterance proved that no mean force had been exercised upon himself to sustain the circumspection he had just claimed  he wheeled to the left pursued the ditch beside the railway fence and presently emerged from the wood stepping into a road which crossed the railway by a bridge  as he neared home the anxiety lately written in his face merged by degrees into a grimly humorous smile which hung long upon his lips and he quoted aloud a line from the book of jeremiah       a woman shall compass a man  3 november the nineteenth daybreak  before it was light the next morning two little naked feet pattered along the passage in knapwater house from which owen grayes bedroom opened and a tap was given upon his door  owen owen are you awake said cytherea in a whisper through the keyhole you must get up directly or youll miss the train  when he descended to his sisters little room he found her there already waiting with a cup of cocoa and a grilled rasher on the table for him a hasty meal was despatched in the intervals of putting on his overcoat and finding his hat and they then went softly through the long deserted passages the kitchenmaid who had prepared their breakfast walking before them with a lamp held high above her head which cast long wheeling shadows down corridors intersecting the one they followed their remoter ends being lost in darkness the door was unbolted and they stepped out  owen had preferred walking to the station to accepting the ponycarriage which miss aldclyffe had placed at his disposal having a morbid horror of giving trouble to people richer than himself and especially to their menservants who looked down upon him as a hybrid monster in social position cytherea proposed to walk a little way with him  i want to talk to you as long as i can she said tenderly  brother and sister then emerged by the heavy door into the drive the feeling and aspect of the hour were precisely similar to those under which the steward had left the house the evening previous excepting that apparently unearthly reversal of natural sequence which is caused by the world getting lighter instead of darker the tearful glimmer of the languid dawn was just sufficient to reveal to them the melancholy red leaves lying thickly in the channels by the roadside ever and anon loudly tapped on by heavy drops of water which the boughs above had collected from the foggy air  they passed the old house engaged in a deep conversation and had proceeded about twenty yards by a cross route in the direction of the turnpike road when the form of a woman emerged from the porch of the building  she was wrapped in a grey waterproof cloak the hood of which was drawn over her head and closely round her faceso closely that her eyes were the sole features uncovered  with this one exception of her appearance there the most perfect stillness and silence pervaded the stewards residence from basement to chimney not a shutter was open not a twine of smoke came forth  underneath the ivycovered gateway she stood still and listened for two or possibly three minutes till she became conscious of others in the park seeing the pair she stepped back with the apparent intention of letting them pass out of sight and evidently wishing to avoid observation but looking at her watch and returning it rapidly to her pocket as if surprised at the lateness of the hour she hurried out again and across the park by a still more oblique line than that traced by owen and his sister  these in the meantime had got into the road and were walking along it as the woman came up on the other side of the boundary hedge looking for a gate or stile by which she too might get off the grass upon the hard ground  their conversation of which every word was clear and distinct in the still air of the dawn to the distance of a quarter of a mile reached her ears and withdrew her attention from all other matters and sights whatsoever thus arrested she stood for an instant as precisely in the attitude of imogen by the cave of belarius as if she had studied the position from the play when they had advanced a few steps she followed them in some doubt still screened by the hedge  do you believe in such odd coincidences said cytherea  how do you mean believe in them they occur sometimes  yes one will occur often enoughthat is two disconnected events will fall strangely together by chance and people scarcely notice the fact beyond saying oddly enough it happened that so and so were the same and so on but when three such events coincide without any apparent reason for the coincidence it seems as if there must be invisible means at work you see three things falling together in that manner are ten times as singular as two cases of coincidence which are distinct  well of course what a mathematical head you have cytherea but i dont see so much to marvel at in our case that the man who kept the publichouse in which miss aldclyffe fainted and who found out her name and position lives in this neighbourhood is accounted for by the fact that she got him the berth to stop his tongue that you came here was simply owing to springrove  ah but look at this miss aldclyffe is the woman our father first loved and i have come to miss aldclyffes you cant get over that  from these premises she proceeded to argue like an elderly divine on the designs of providence which were apparent in such conjunctures and went into a variety of details connected with miss aldclyffes history  had i better tell miss aldclyffe that i know all this she inquired at last  whats the use he said your possessing the knowledge does no harm you are at any rate comfortable here and a confession to miss aldclyffe might only irritate her no hold your tongue cytherea  i fancy i should have been tempted to tell her too cytherea went on had i not found out that there exists a very odd almost imperceptible and yet real connection of some kind between her and mr manston which is more than that of a mutual interest in the estate  she is in love with him exclaimed owen fancy that  ahthats what everybody says who has been keen enough to notice anything i said so at first and yet now i cannot persuade myself that she is in love with him at all  why cant you  she doesnt act as if she were she isntyou will know i dont say it from any vanity owenshe isnt the least jealous of me  perhaps she is in some way in his power  noshe is not he was openly advertised for and chosen from forty or fifty who answered the advertisement without knowing whose it was and since he has been here she has certainly done nothing to compromise herself in any way besides why should she have brought an enemy here at all  then she must have fallen in love with him you know as well as i do cyth that with women theres nothing between the two poles of emotion towards an interesting male acquaintance tis either love or aversion  they walked for a few minutes in silence when cythereas eyes accidentally fell upon her brothers feet  owen she said do you know that there is something unusual in your manner of walking  what is it like he asked  i cant quite say except that you dont walk so regularly as you used to  the woman behind the hedge who had still continued to dog their footsteps made an impatient movement at this change in their conversation and looked at her watch again yet she seemed reluctant to give over listening to them  yes owen returned with assumed carelessness i do know it i think the cause of it is that mysterious pain which comes just above my ankle sometimes you remember the first time i had it that day we went by steampacket to lulstead cove when it hindered me from coming back to you and compelled me to sleep with the gateman we have been talking about  but is it anything serious dear owen cytherea exclaimed with some alarm  o nothing at all it is sure to go off again i never find a sign of it when i sit in the office  again their unperceived companion made a gesture of vexation and looked at her watch as if time were precious but the dialogue still flowed on upon this new subject and showed no sign of returning to its old channel  gathering up her skirt decisively she renounced all further hope and hurried along the ditch till she had dropped into a valley and came to a gate which was beyond the view of those coming behind this she softly opened and came out upon the road following it in the direction of the railway station  presently she heard owen grayes footsteps in her rear his quickened pace implying that he had parted from his sister the woman thereupon increased her rapid walk to a run and in a few minutes safely distanced her fellowtraveller  the railway at carriford road consisted only of a single line of rails and the short local downtrain by which owen was going to budmouth was shunted on to a siding whilst the first uptrain passed graye entered the waitingroom and the door being open he listlessly observed the movements of a woman wearing a long grey cloak and closely hooded who had asked for a ticket for london  he followed her with his eyes on to the platform saw her waiting there and afterwards stepping into the train his recollection of her ceasing with the perception  4 eight to ten oclock am  mrs crickett twice a widow and now the parish clerks wife a fineframed scandalloving woman with a peculiar corner to her eye by which without turning her head she could see what people were doing almost behind her lived in a cottage standing nearer to the old manorhouse than any other in the village of carriford and she had on that account been temporarily engaged by the steward as a respectable kind of charwoman and general servant until a settled arrangement could be made with some person as permanent domestic  every morning therefore mrs crickett immediately she had lighted the fire in her own cottage and prepared the breakfast for herself and husband paced her way to the old house to do the same for mr manston then she went home to breakfast and when the steward had eaten his and had gone out on his rounds she returned again to clear away make his bed and put the house in order for the day  on the morning of owen grayes departure she went through the operations of her first visit as usualproceeded home to breakfast and went back again to perform those of the second  entering manstons empty bedroom with her hands on her hips she indifferently cast her eyes upon the bed previously to dismantling it  whilst she looked she thought in an inattentive manner what a remarkably quiet sleeper mr manston must be the upper bedclothes were flung back certainly but the bed was scarcely disarranged anybody would almost fancy she thought that he had made it himself after rising  but these evanescent thoughts vanished as they had come and mrs crickett set to work she dragged off the counterpane blankets and sheets and stooped to lift the pillows thus stooping something arrested her attention she looked closelymore closelyvery closely well to be sure was all she could say the clerks wife stood as if the air had suddenly set to amber and held her fixed like a fly in it  the object of her wonder was a trailing brown hair very little less than a yard long which proved it clearly to be a hair from some womans head she drew it off the pillow and took it to the window there holding it out she looked fixedly at it and became utterly lost in meditation her gaze which had at first actively settled on the hair involuntarily dropped past its object by degrees and was lost on the floor as the inner vision obscured the outer one  she at length moistened her lips returned her eyes to the hair wound it round her fingers put it in some paper and secreted the whole in her pocket mrs cricketts thoughts were with her work no more that morning  she searched the house from rooftree to cellar for some other trace of feminine existence or appurtenance but none was to be found  she went out into the yard coalhole stable hayloft greenhouse fowlhouse and piggery and still there was no sign coming in again she saw a bonnet eagerly pounced upon it and found it to be her own  hastily completing her arrangements in the other rooms she entered the village again and called at once on the postmistress elizabeth leat an intimate friend of hers and a female who sported several unique diseases and afflictions  mrs crickett unfolded the paper took out the hair and waved it on high before the perplexed eyes of elizabeth which immediately mooned and wandered after it like a cats  what is it said mrs leat contracting her eyelids and stretching out towards the invisible object a narrow bony hand that would have been an unmitigated delight to the pencil of carlo crivelli  you shall hear said mrs crickett complacently gathering up the treasure into her own fat hand and the secret was then solemnly imparted together with the accident of its discovery  a shavingglass was taken down from a nail laid on its back in the middle of a table by the window and the hair spread carefully out upon it the pair then bent over the table from opposite sides their elbows on the edge their hands supporting their heads their foreheads nearly touching and their eyes upon the hair  he ha been mad ater my lady cytherea said mrs crickett and tis my very belief the hair is  no tidn hers idn so dark as that said elizabeth  elizabeth you know that as the faithful wife of a servant of the church i should be glad to think as you do about the girl mind i dont wish to say anything against miss graye but this i do say that i believe her to be a nameless thing and shes no right to stick a moral clock in her face and deceive the country in such a way if she wasnt of a bad stock at the outset she was bad in the planten and if she wasnt bad in the planten she was bad in the growen and if not in the growen shes made bad by what shes gone through since  but i have another reason for knowing it idn hers said mrs leat  ah i know whose it is thenmiss aldclyffes upon my song  tis the colour of hers but i dont believe it to be hers either  dont you believe what they d say about her and him  i say nothen about that but you dont know what i know about his letters  what about em  he d post all his letters here except those for one person and they he d take to budmouth my son is in budmouth post office as you know and as he d sit at desk he can see over the blind of the window all the people who d post letters mr manston d unvariably go there wi letters for that person my boy d know em by sight well enough now  is it a she  tis a she  whats her name  the little stunpoll of a fellow couldnt call to mind more than that tis miss somebody of london however thats the woman who ha been here depend uponta wicked onesome poor streetwench escaped from sodom i warrant ye  only to find herself in gomorrah seemingly  that may be  no no mrs leat this is clear to me tis no miss who came here to see our steward last nightwhenever she came or wherever she vanished do you think he would ha let a miss get here how she could go away how she would without breakfast or help of any kind  elizabeth shook her headmrs crickett looked at her solemnly  i say i know she had no help of any kind i know it was so for the grate was quite cold when i touched it this morning with these fingers and he was still in bed no he wouldnt take the trouble to write letters to a girl and then treat her so offhand as that theres a tie between em stronger than feelen shes his wife  he married the lord so s what shall we hear next do he look married now his are not the abashed eyes and lips of a married man  perhaps shes a tame onebut shes his wife still  no no hes not a married man  yes yes he is ive had three and i ought to know  well well said mrs leat giving way whatever may be the truth ont i trust providence will settle it all for the best as he always do  ay ay elizabeth rejoined mrs crickett with a satirical sigh as she turned on her foot to go home good people like you may say so but i have always found providence a different sort of feller  5 november the twentieth  it was miss aldclyffes custom a custom originated by her father and nourished by her own exclusiveness to unlock the postbag herself every morning instead of allowing the duty to devolve on the butler as was the case in most of the neighbouring county families the bag was brought upstairs each morning to her dressingroom where she took out the contents mostly in the presence of her maid and cytherea who had the entree of the chamber at all hours and attended there in the morning at a kind of reception on a small scale which was held by miss aldclyffe of her namesake only  here she read her letters before the glass whilst undergoing the operation of being brushed and dressed  what woman can this be i wonder she said on the morning succeeding that of the last section london n it is the first time in my life i ever had a letter from that outlandish place the north side of london  cytherea had just come into her presence to learn if there was anything for herself and on being thus addressed walked up to miss aldclyffes corner of the room to look at the curiosity which had raised such an exclamation but the lady having opened the envelope and read a few lines put it quickly in her pocket before cytherea could reach her side  o tis nothing she said she proceeded to make general remarks in a noticeably forced tone of sangfroid from which she soon lapsed into silence not another word was said about the letter she seemed very anxious to get her dressing done and the room cleared thereupon cytherea went away to the other window and a few minutes later left the room to follow her own pursuits  it was late when miss aldclyffe descended to the breakfasttable and then she seemed there to no purpose tea coffee eggs cutlets and all their accessories were left absolutely untasted the next that was seen of her was when walking up and down the south terrace and round the flowerbeds her face was pale and her tread was fitful and she crumpled a letter in her hand  dinnertime came round as usual she did not speak ten words or indeed seem conscious of the meal for all that miss aldclyffe did in the way of eating dinner might have been taken out as intact as it was taken in  in her own private apartment miss aldclyffe again pulled out the letter of the morning one passage in it ran thus   of course being his wife i could publish the fact and compel him to acknowledge me at any moment notwithstanding his threats and reasonings that it will be better to wait i have waited and waited again and the time for such acknowledgment seems no nearer than at first to show you how patiently i have waited i can tell you that not till a fortnight ago when by stress of circumstances i had been driven to new lodgings have i ever assumed my married name solely on account of its having been his request all along that i should not do it this writing to you madam is my first disobedience and i am justified in it a woman who is driven to visit her husband like a thief in the night and then sent away like a street dogleft to get up unbolt unbar and find her way out of the house as she best mayis justified in doing anything  but should i demand of him a restitution of rights there would be involved a publicity which i could not endure and a noisy scandal flinging my name the length and breadth of the country  what i still prefer to any such violent means is that you reason with him privately and compel him to bring me home to your parish in a decent and careful manner in the way that would be adopted by any respectable man whose wife had been living away from him for some time by reason say of peculiar family circumstances which had caused disunion but not enmity and who at length was enabled to reinstate her in his house  you will i know oblige me in this especially as knowledge of a peculiar transaction of your own which took place some years ago has lately come to me in a singular way i will not at present trouble you by describing how it is enough that i alone of all people living know all the sides of the story those from whom i collected it having each only a partial knowledge which confuses them and points to nothing one person knows of your early engagement and its sudden termination another of the reason of those strange meetings at inns and coffeehouses another of what was sufficient to cause all this and so on i know what fits one and all the circumstances like a key and shows them to be the natural outcrop of a rational though rather rash line of conduct for a young lady you will at once perceive how it was that some at least of these things were revealed to me  this knowledge then common to and secretly treasured by us both is the ground upon which i beg for your friendship and help with a feeling that you will be too generous to refuse it to me  i may add that as yet my husband knows nothing of this neither need he if you remember my request   a threata flat stinging threat as delicately wrapped up in words as the woman could do it a threat from a miserable unknown creature to an aldclyffe and not the least proud member of the family either a threat on his accounto o shall it be  presently this humour of defiance vanished and the members of her body became supple again her proceedings proving that it was absolutely necessary to give way aldclyffe as she was she wrote a short answer to mrs manston saying civilly that mr manstons possession of such a near relation was a fact quite new to herself and that she would see what could be done in such an unfortunate affair  6 november the twentyfirst  manston received a message the next day requesting his attendance at the house punctually at eight oclock the ensuing evening miss aldclyffe was brave and imperious but with the purpose she had in view she could not look him in the face whilst daylight shone upon her  the steward was shown into the library on entering it he was immediately struck with the unusual gloom which pervaded the apartment the fire was dead and dull one lamp and that a comparatively small one was burning at the extreme end leaving the main proportion of the lofty and sombre room in an artificial twilight scarcely powerful enough to render visible the titles of the folio and quarto volumes which were jammed into the lower tiers of the bookshelves  after keeping him waiting for more than twenty minutes miss aldclyffe knew that excellent recipe for taking the stiffness out of human flesh and for extracting all prearrangement from human speech she entered the room  manston sought her eye directly the hue of her features was not discernible but the calm glance she flung at him from which all attempt at returning his scrutiny was absent awoke him to the perception that probably his secret was by some means or other known to her how it had become known he could not tell  she drew forth the letter unfolded it and held it up to him letting it hang by one corner from between her finger and thumb so that the light from the lamp though remote fell directly upon its surface  you know whose writing this is she said  he saw the strokes plainly instantly resolving to burn his ships and hazard all on an advance  my wifes he said calmly  his quiet answer threw her off her balance she had no more expected an answer than does a preacher when he exclaims from the pulpit do you feel your sin she had clearly expected a sudden alarm  and why all this concealment she said again her voice rising as she vainly endeavoured to control her feelings whatever they were  it doesnt follow that because a man is married he must tell every stranger of it madam he answered just as calmly as before  stranger well perhaps not but mr manston why did you choose to conceal it i ask again i have a perfect right to ask this question as you will perceive if you consider the terms of my advertisement  i will tell you there were two simple reasons the first was this practical one you advertised for an unmarried man if you remember  of course i remember  well an incident suggested to me that i should try for the situation i was married but knowing that in getting an office where there is a restriction of this kind leaving ones wife behind is always accepted as a fulfilment of the condition i left her behind for awhile the other reason is that these terms of yours afforded me a plausible excuse for escaping for a short time the company of a woman i had been mistaken in marrying  mistaken what was she the lady inquired  a thirdrate actress whom i met with during my stay in liverpool last summer where i had gone to fulfil a short engagement with an architect  where did she come from  she is an american by birth and i grew to dislike her when we had been married a week  she was ugly i imagine  she is not an ugly woman by any means  up to the ordinary standard  quite up to the ordinary standardindeed handsome after a while we quarrelled and separated  you did not illuse her of course said miss aldclyffe with a little sarcasm  i did not  but at any rate you got thoroughly tired of her  manston looked as if he began to think her questions out of place however he said quietly i did get tired of her i never told her so but we separated i to come here bringing her with me as far as london and leaving her there in perfectly comfortable quarters and though your advertisement expressed a single man i have always intended to tell you the whole truth and this was when i was going to tell it when your satisfaction with my careful management of your affairs should have proved the risk to be a safe one to run  she bowed  then i saw that you were good enough to be interested in my welfare to a greater extent than i could have anticipated or hoped judging you by the frigidity of other employers and this caused me to hesitate i was vexed at the complication of affairs so matters stood till three nights ago i was then walking home from the pottery and came up to the railway the downtrain came along close to me and there sitting at a carriage window i saw my wife she had found out my address and had thereupon determined to follow me here i had not been home many minutes before she came in next morning early she left again  because you treated her so cavalierly  and as i suppose wrote to you directly thats the whole story of her madam whatever were manstons real feelings towards the lady who had received his explanation in these supercilious tones they remained locked within him as within a casket of steel  did your friends know of your marriage mr manston she continued  nobody at all we kept it a secret for various reasons  it is true then that as your wife tells me in this letter she has not passed as mrs manston till within these last few days  it is quite true i was in receipt of a very small and uncertain income when we married and so she continued playing at the theatre as before our marriage and in her maiden name  has she any friends  i have never heard that she has any in england she came over here on some theatrical speculation as one of a company who were going to do much but who never did anything and here she has remained  a pause ensued which was terminated by miss aldclyffe  i understand she said now though i have no direct right to concern myself with your private affairs beyond those which arise from your misleading me and getting the office you hold  as to that madam he interrupted rather hotly as to coming here i am vexed as much as you somebody a member of the institute of architectswho i could never tellsent to my old address in london your advertisement cut from the paper it was forwarded to me i wanted to get away from liverpool and it seemed as if this was put in my way on purpose by some old friend or other i answered the advertisement certainly but i was not particularly anxious to come here nor am i anxious to stay  miss aldclyffe descended from haughty superiority to womanly persuasion with a haste which was almost ludicrous indeed the quos ego of the whole lecture had been less the genuine menace of the imperious ruler of knapwater than an artificial utterance to hide a failing heart  now now mr manston you wrong me dont suppose i wish to be overbearing or anything of the kind and you will allow me to say this much at any rate that i have become interested in your wife as well as in yourself  certainly madam he said slowly like a man feeling his way in the dark manston was utterly at fault now his previous experience of the effect of his form and features upon womankind en masse had taught him to flatter himself that he could account by the same law of natural selection for the extraordinary interest miss aldclyffe had hitherto taken in him as an unmarried man an interest he did not at all object to seeing that it kept him near cytherea and enabled him a man of no wealth to rule on the estate as if he were its lawful owner like curius at his sabine farm he had counted it his glory not to possess gold himself but to have power over her who did but at this hint of the ladys wish to take his wife under her wing also he was perplexed could she have any sinister motive in doing so but he did not allow himself to be troubled with these doubts which only concerned his wifes happiness  she tells me continued miss aldclyffe how utterly alone in the world she stands and that is an additional reason why i should sympathize with her instead then of requesting the favour of your retirement from the post and dismissing your interests altogether i will retain you as my steward still on condition that you bring home your wife and live with her respectably in short as if you loved her you understand i wish you to stay here if you grant that everything shall flow smoothly between yourself and her  the breast and shoulders of the steward rose as if an expression of defiance was about to be poured forth before it took form he controlled himself and said in his natural voice  my part of the performance shall be carried out madam  and her anxiety to obtain a standing in the world ensures that hers will replied miss aldclyffe that will be satisfactory then  after a few additional remarks she gently signified that she wished to put an end to the interview the steward took the hint and retired  he felt vexed and mortified yet in walking homeward he was convinced that telling the whole truth as he had done with the single exception of his love for cytherea which he tried to hide even from himself had never served him in better stead than it had done that night  manston went to his desk and thought of cythereas beauty with the bitterest wildest regret after the lapse of a few minutes he calmed himself by a stoical effort and wrote the subjoined letter to his wife                                           knapwater                                          november 21 1864  dear eunicei hope you reached london safely after your flighty visit to me  as i promised i have thought over our conversation that night and your wish that your coming here should be no longer delayed after all it was perfectly natural that you should have spoken unkindly as you did ignorant as you were of the circumstances which bound me  so i have made arrangements to fetch you home at once it is hardly worth while for you to attempt to bring with you any luggage you may have gathered about you beyond mere clothing dispose of superfluous things at a brokers your bringing them would only make a talk in this parish and lead people to believe we had long been keeping house separately  will next monday suit you for coming you have nothing to do that can occupy you for more than a day or two as far as i can see and the remainder of this week will afford ample time i can be in london the night before and we will come down together by the midday trainyour very affectionate husband                                         aeneas manston  now of course i shall no longer write to you as mrs rondley   the address on the envelope was  mrs manston   41 charles square      hoxton         london n  he took the letter to the house and it being too late for the country post sent one of the stablemen with it to casterbridge instead of troubling to go to budmouth with it himself as heretofore he had no longer any necessity to keep his condition a secret  7 from the twentysecond to the twentyseventh of november  but the next morning manston found that he had been forgetful of another matter in naming the following monday to his wife for the journey  the fact was this a letter had just come reminding him that he had left the whole of the succeeding week open for an important business engagement with a neighbouring landagent at that gentlemans residence thirteen miles off the particular day he had suggested to his wife had in the interim been appropriated by his correspondent the meeting could not now be put off  so he wrote again to his wife stating that business which could not be postponed called him away from home on monday and would entirely prevent him coming all the way to fetch her on sunday night as he had intended but that he would meet her at the carriford road station with a conveyance when she arrived there in the evening  the next day came his wifes answer to his first letter in which she said that she would be ready to be fetched at the time named having already written his second letter which was by that time in her hands he made no further reply  the week passed away the steward had in the meantime let it become generally known in the village that he was a married man and by a little judicious management sound family reasons for his past secrecy upon the subject which were floated as adjuncts to the story were placidly received they seemed so natural and justifiable to the unsophisticated minds of ninetenths of his neighbours that curiosity in the matter beyond a strong curiosity to see the ladys face was wellnigh extinguished     x the events of a day and night  1 november the twentyeighth until ten pm  monday came the day named for mrs manstons journey from london to her husbands house a day of singular and great events influencing the present and future of nearly all the personages whose actions in a complex drama form the subject of this record  the proceedings of the steward demand the first notice whilst taking his breakfast on this particular morning the clock pointing to eight the horseandgig that was to take him to chettlewood waiting ready at the door manston hurriedly cast his eyes down the column of bradshaw which showed the details and duration of the selected trains journey  the inspection was carelessly made the leaf being kept open by the aid of one hand whilst the other still held his cup of coffee much more carelessly than would have been the case had the expected newcomer been cytherea graye instead of his lawful wife  he did not perceive branching from the column down which his finger ran a small twist called a shuntingline inserted at a particular place to imply that at that point the train was divided into two by this oversight he understood that the arrival of his wife at carriford road station would not be till late in the evening by the second half of the train containing the thirdclass passengers and passing two hours and threequarters later than the previous one by which the lady as a secondclass passenger would really be brought  he then considered that there would be plenty of time for him to return from his days engagement to meet this train he finished his breakfast gave proper and precise directions to his servant on the preparations that were to be made for the ladys reception jumped into his gig and drove off to lord claydonfields at chettlewood  he went along by the front of knapwater house he could not help turning to look at what he knew to be the window of cythereas room whilst he looked a hopeless expression of passionate love and sensuous anguish came upon his face and lingered there for a few seconds then as on previous occasions it was resolutely repressed and he trotted along the smooth white road again endeavouring to banish all thought of the young girl whose beauty and grace had so enslaved him  thus it was that when in the evening of the same day mrs manston reached carriford road station her husband was still at chettlewood ignorant of her arrival and on looking up and down the platform dreary with autumn gloom and wind she could see no sign that any preparation whatever had been made for her reception and conduct home  the train went on she waited fidgeted with the handle of her umbrella walked about strained her eyes into the gloom of the chilly night listened for wheels tapped with her foot and showed all the usual signs of annoyance and irritation she was the more irritated in that this seemed a second and culminating instance of her husbands neglectthe first having been shown in his not fetching her  reflecting awhile upon the course it would be best to take in order to secure a passage to knapwater she decided to leave all her luggage except a dressingbag in the cloakroom and walk to her husbands house as she had done on her first visit she asked one of the porters if he could find a lad to go with her and carry her bag he offered to do it himself  the porter was a goodtempered shallowminded ignorant man mrs manston being apparently in very gloomy spirits would probably have preferred walking beside him without saying a word but her companion would not allow silence to continue between them for a longer period than two or three minutes together  he had volunteered several remarks upon her arrival chiefly to the effect that it was very unfortunate mr manston had not come to the station for her when she suddenly asked him concerning the inhabitants of the parish  he told her categorically the names of the chieffirst the chief possessors of property then of brains then of good looks as first among the latter he mentioned miss cytherea graye  after getting him to describe her appearance as completely as lay in his power she wormed out of him the statement that everybody had been sayingbefore mrs manstons existence was heard ofhow well the handsome mr manston and the beautiful miss graye were suited for each other as man and wife and that miss aldclyffe was the only one in the parish who took no interest in bringing about the match  he rather liked her you think  the porter began to think he had been too explicit and hastened to correct the error  o no he dont care a bit about her maam he said solemnly  not more than he does about me  not a bit  then that must be little indeed mrs manston murmured she stood still as if reflecting upon the painful neglect her words had recalled to her mind then with a sudden impulse turned round and walked petulantly a few steps back again in the direction of the station  the porter stood still and looked surprised  ill go back again yes indeed ill go back again she said plaintively then she paused and looked anxiously up and down the deserted road  no i mustnt go back now she continued in a tone of resignation seeing that the porter was watching her she turned about and came on as before giving vent to a slight laugh  it was a laugh full of character the low forced laugh which seeks to hide the painful perception of a humiliating position under the mask of indifference  altogether her conduct had shown her to be what in fact she was a weak though a calculating woman one clever to conceive weak to execute one whose bestlaid schemes were for ever liable to be frustrated by the ineradicable blight of vacillation at the critical hour of action  o if i had only known that all this was going to happen she murmured again as they paced along upon the rustling leaves  what did you say maam said the porter  o nothing particular we are getting near the old manorhouse by this time i imagine  very near now maam  they soon reached manstons residence round which the wind blew mournfully and chill  passing under the detached gateway they entered the porch the porter stepped forward knocked heavily and waited  nobody came  mrs manston then advanced to the door and gave a different series of rappingsless forcible but more sustained  there was not a movement of any kind inside not a ray of light visible nothing but the echo of her own knocks through the passages and the dry scratching of the withered leaves blown about her feet upon the floor of the porch  the steward of course was not at home mrs crickett not expecting that anybody would arrive till the time of the later train had set the place in order laid the suppertable and then locked the door to go into the village and converse with her friends  is there an inn in the village said mrs manston after the fourth and loudest rapping upon the ironstudded old door had resulted only in the fourth and loudest echo from the passages inside  yes maam  who keeps it  farmer springrove  i will go there tonight she said decisively it is too cold and altogether too bad for a woman to wait in the open road on anybodys account gentle or simple  they went down the park and through the gate into the village of carriford by the time they reached the three tranters it was verging upon ten oclock there on the spot where two months earlier in the season the sunny and lively group of villagers making cider under the trees had greeted cythereas eyes was nothing now intelligible but a vast cloak of darkness from which came the low sough of the elms and the occasional creak of the swinging sign  they went to the door mrs manston shivering but less from the cold than from the dreariness of her emotions neglect is the coldest of winter winds  it so happened that edward springrove was expected to arrive from london either on that evening or the next and at the sound of voices his father came to the door fully expecting to see him a picture of disappointment seldom witnessed in a mans face was visible in old mr springroves when he saw that the comer was a stranger  mrs manston asked for a room and one that had been prepared for edward was immediately named as being ready for her another being adaptable for edward should he come in  without taking any refreshment or entering any room downstairs or even lifting her veil she walked straight along the passage and up to her apartment the chambermaid preceding her  if mr manston comes tonight she said sitting on the bed as she had come in and addressing the woman tell him i cannot see him  yes maam  the woman left the room and mrs manston locked the door before the servant had gone down more than two or three stairs mrs manston unfastened the door again and held it ajar  bring me some brandy she said  the chambermaid went down to the bar and brought up the spirit in a tumbler when she came into the room mrs manston had not removed a single article of apparel and was walking up and down as if still quite undecided upon the course it was best to adopt  outside the door when it was closed upon her the maid paused to listen for an instant she heard mrs manston talking to herself  this is welcome home she said  2 from ten to halfpast eleven pm  a strange concurrence of phenomena now confronts us  during the autumn in which the past scenes were enacted mr springrove had ploughed harrowed and cleaned a narrow and shaded piece of ground lying at the back of his house which for many years had been looked upon as irreclaimable waste  the couchgrass extracted from the soil had been left to wither in the sun afterwards it was raked together lighted in the customary way and now lay smouldering in a large heap in the middle of the plot  it had been kindled three days previous to mrs manstons arrival and one or two villagers of a more cautious and less sanguine temperament than springrove had suggested that the fire was almost too near the back of the house for its continuance to be unattended with risk for though no danger could be apprehended whilst the air remained moderately still a brisk breeze blowing towards the house might possibly carry a spark across  ay thats true enough said springrove i must look round before going to bed and see that everythings safe but to tell the truth i am anxious to get the rubbish burnt up before the rain comes to wash it into ground again as to carrying the couch into the back field to burn and bringing it back again why tis more than the ashes would be worth  well thats very true said the neighbours and passed on  two or three times during the first evening after the heap was lit he went to the back door to take a survey before bolting and barring up for the night he made a final and more careful examination the slowlysmoking pile showed not the slightest signs of activity springroves perfectly sound conclusion was that as long as the heap was not stirred and the wind continued in the quarter it blew from then the couch would not flame and that there could be no shadow of danger to anything even a combustible substance though it were no more than a yard off  the next morning the burning couch was discovered in precisely the same state as when he had gone to bed the preceding night the heap smoked in the same manner the whole of that day at bedtime the farmer looked towards it but less carefully than on the first night  the morning and the whole of the third day still saw the heap in its old smouldering condition indeed the smoke was less and there seemed a probability that it might have to be rekindled on the morrow  after admitting mrs manston to his house in the evening and hearing her retire mr springrove returned to the front door to listen for a sound of his son and inquired concerning him of the railwayporter who sat for a while in the kitchen the porter had not noticed young mr springrove get out of the train at which intelligence the old man concluded that he would probably not see his son till the next day as edward had hitherto made a point of coming by the train which had brought mrs manston  halfanhour later the porter left the inn springrove at the same time going to the door to listen again an instant then he walked round and in at the back of the house  the farmer glanced at the heap casually and indifferently in passing two nights of safety seemed to ensure the third and he was about to bolt and bar as usual when the idea struck him that there was just a possibility of his sons return by the latest train unlikely as it was that he would be so delayed the old man thereupon left the door unfastened looked to his usual matters indoors and went to bed it being then halfpast ten oclock  farmers and horticulturists well know that it is in the nature of a heap of couchgrass when kindled in calm weather to smoulder for many days and even weeks until the whole mass is reduced to a powdery charcoal ash displaying the while scarcely a sign of combustion beyond the volcanolike smoke from its summit but the continuance of this quiet process is throughout its length at the mercy of one particular whim of nature that is a sudden breeze by which the heap is liable to be fanned into a flame so brisk as to consume the whole in an hour or two  had the farmer narrowly watched the pile when he went to close the door he would have seen besides the familiar twine of smoke from its summit a quivering of the air around the mass showing that a considerable heat had arisen inside  as the railwayporter turned the corner of the row of houses adjoining the three tranters a brisk new wind greeted his face and spread past him into the village he walked along the highroad till he came to a gate about three hundred yards from the inn over the gate could be discerned the situation of the building he had just quitted he carelessly turned his head in passing and saw behind him a clear red glow indicating the position of the couchheap a glow without a flame increasing and diminishing in brightness as the breeze quickened or fell like the coal of a newly lighted cigar if those cottages had been his he thought he should not care to have a fire so near them as thatand the wind rising but the cottages not being his he went on his way to the station where he was about to resume duty for the night the road was now quite deserted till four oclock the next morning when the carters would go by to the stables there was little probability of any human being passing the three tranters inn  by eleven everybody in the house was asleep it truly seemed as if the treacherous element knew there had arisen a grand opportunity for devastation  at a quarter past eleven a slight stealthy crackle made itself heard amid the increasing moans of the night wind the heap glowed brighter still and burst into a flame the flame sank another breeze entered it sustained it and it grew to be first continuous and weak then continuous and strong  at twenty minutes past eleven a blast of wind carried an airy bit of ignited fern several yards forward in a direction parallel to the houses and inn and there deposited it on the ground  five minutes later another puff of wind carried a similar piece to a distance of fiveandtwenty yards where it also was dropped softly on the ground  still the wind did not blow in the direction of the houses and even now to a casual observer they would have appeared safe but nature does few things directly a minute later yet an ignited fragment fell upon the straw covering of a long thatched heap or grave of mangelwurzel lying in a direction at right angles to the house and down toward the hedge there the fragment faded to darkness  a short time subsequent to this after many intermediate deposits and seemingly baffled attempts another fragment fell on the mangelwurzel grave and continued to glow the glow was increased by the wind the straw caught fire and burst into flame it was inevitable that the flame should run along the ridge of the thatch towards a piggery at the end yet had the piggery been tiled the timehonoured hostel would even now at this last moment have been safe but it was constructed as piggeries are mostly constructed of wood and thatch the hurdles and straw roof of the frail erection became ignited in their turn and abutting as the shed did on the back of the inn flamed up to the eaves of the main roof in less than thirty seconds  3 halfpast eleven to twelve pm  a hazardous length of time elapsed before the inmates of the three tranters knew of their danger when at length the discovery was made the rush was a rush for bare life  a mans voice calling then screams then loud stamping and shouts were heard  mr springrove ran out first two minutes later appeared the ostler and chambermaid who were man and wife the inn as has been stated was a quaint old building and as inflammable as a beehive it overhung the base at the level of the first floor and again overhung at the eaves which were finished with heavy oak bargeboards every atom in its substance every feature in its construction favoured the fire  the forked flames lurid and smoky became nearly lost to view bursting forth again with a bound and loud crackle increased tenfold in power and brightness the crackling grew sharper long quivering shadows began to be flung from the stately trees at the end of the house the square outline of the church tower on the other side of the way which had hitherto been a dark mass against a sky comparatively light now began to appear as a light object against a sky of darkness and even the narrow surface of the flagstaff at the top could be seen in its dark surrounding brought out from its obscurity by the rays from the dancing light  shouts and other noises increased in loudness and frequency the lapse of ten minutes brought most of the inhabitants of that end of the village into the street followed in a short time by the rector mr raunham  casting a hasty glance up and down he beckoned to one or two of the men and vanished again in a short time wheels were heard and mr raunham and the men reappeared with the garden engine the only one in the village except that at knapwater house after some little trouble the hose was connected with a tank in the old stableyard and the puny instrument began to play  several seemed paralyzed at first and stood transfixed their rigid faces looking like redhot iron in the glaring light in the confusion a woman cried ring the bells backwards and three or four of the old and superstitious entered the belfry and jangled them indescribably some were only half dressed and to add to the horror among them was clerk crickett running up and down with a face streaming with blood ghastly and pitiful to see his excitement being so great that he had not the slightest conception of how when or where he came by the wound  the crowd was now busy at work and tried to save a little of the furniture of the inn the only room they could enter was the parlour from which they managed to bring out the bureau a few chairs some old silver candlesticks and halfadozen light articles but these were all  fiery mats of thatch slid off the roof and fell into the road with a deadened thud whilst white flakes of straw and woodash were flying in the wind like feathers at the same time two of the cottages adjoining upon which a little water had been brought to play from the rectors engine were seen to be on fire the attenuated spirt of water was as nothing upon the heated and dry surface of the thatched roof the fire prevailed without a minutes hindrance and dived through to the rafters  suddenly arose a cry wheres mr springrove  he had vanished from the spot by the churchyard wall where he had been standing a few minutes earlier  i fancy hes gone inside said a voice  madness and folly what can he save said another good god find him help here  a wild rush was made at the door which had fallen to and in defiance of the scorching flame that burst forth three men forced themselves through it immediately inside the threshold they found the object of their search lying senseless on the floor of the passage  to bring him out and lay him on a bank was the work of an instant a basin of cold water was dashed in his face and he began to recover consciousness but very slowly he had been saved by a miracle no sooner were his preservers out of the building than the windowframes lit up as if by magic with deep and waving fringes of flames simultaneously the joints of the boards forming the front door started into view as glowing bars of fire a star of red light penetrated the centre gradually increasing in size till the flames rushed forth  then the staircase fell  everybody is out safe said a voice  yes thank god said three or four others  o we forgot that a stranger came i think she is safe  i hope she is said the weak voice of some one coming up from behind it was the chambermaids  springrove at that moment aroused himself he staggered to his feet and threw his hands up wildly  everybody no no the lady who came by train mrs manston i tried to fetch her out but i fell  an exclamation of horror burst from the crowd it was caused partly by this disclosure of springrove more by the added perception which followed his words  an average interval of about three minutes had elapsed between one intensely fierce gust of wind and the next and now another poured over them the roof swayed and a moment afterwards fell in with a crash pulling the gable after it and thrusting outwards the front wall of woodwork which fell into the road with a rumbling echo a cloud of black dust myriads of sparks and a great outburst of flame followed the uproar of the fall  who is she what is she burst from every lip again and again incoherently and without leaving a sufficient pause for a reply had a reply been volunteered  the autumn wind tameless and swift and proud still blew upon the dying old house which was constructed so entirely of combustible materials that it burnt almost as fiercely as a cornrick the heat in the road increased and now for an instant at the height of the conflagration all stood still and gazed silently awestruck and helpless in the presence of so irresistible an enemy then with minds full of the tragedy unfolded to them they rushed forward again with the obtuse directness of waves to their labour of saving goods from the houses adjoining which it was evident were all doomed to destruction  the minutes passed by the three tranters inn sank into a mere heap of redhot charcoal the fire pushed its way down the row as the church clock opposite slowly struck the hour of midnight and the bewildered chimes scarcely heard amid the crackling of the flames wandered through the wayward air of the old hundredandthirteenth psalm  4 nine to eleven pm  manston mounted his gig and set out from chettlewood that evening in no very enviable frame of mind the thought of domestic life in knapwater old house with the now eclipsed wife of the past was more than disagreeable was positively distasteful to him  yet he knew that the influential position which from whatever fortunate cause he held on miss aldclyffes manor would never again fall to his lot on any other and he tacitly assented to this dilemma hoping that some consolation or other would soon suggest itself to him married as he was he was near cytherea  he occasionally looked at his watch as he drove along the lanes timing the pace of his horse by the hour that he might reach carriford road station just soon enough to meet the last london train  he soon began to notice in the sky a slight yellow halo near the horizon it rapidly increased it changed colour and grew redder then the glare visibly brightened and dimmed at intervals showing that its origin was affected by the strong wind prevailing  manston reined in his horse on the summit of a hill and considered  it is a rickyard on fire he thought no house could produce such a raging flame so suddenly  he trotted on again attempting to particularize the local features in the neighbourhood of the fire but this it was too dark to do and the excessive winding of the roads misled him as to its direction not being an old inhabitant of the district or a countryman used to forming such judgments whilst the brilliancy of the light shortened its real remoteness to an apparent distance of not more than half it seemed so near that he again stopped his horse this time to listen but he could hear no sound  entering now a narrow valley the sides of which obscured the sky to an angle of perhaps thirty or forty degrees above the mathematical horizon he was obliged to suspend his judgment till he was in possession of further knowledge having however assumed in the interim that the fire was somewhere between carriford road station and the village  the selfsame glare had just arrested the eyes of another man he was at that minute gliding along several miles to the east of the stewards position but nearing the same point as that to which manston tended the younger edward springrove was returning from london to his fathers house by the identical train which the steward was expecting to bring his wife the truth being that edwards lateness was owing to the simplest of all causes his temporary want of money which led him to make a slow journey for the sake of travelling at thirdclass fare  springrove had received cythereas bitter and admonitory letter and he was clearly awakened to a perception of the false position in which he had placed himself by keeping silence at budmouth on his long engagement an increasing reluctance to put an end to those few days of ecstasy with cytherea had overruled his conscience and tied his tongue till speaking was too late  why did i do it how could i dream of loving her he asked himself as he walked by day as he tossed on his bed by night miserable folly  an impressionable heart had for yearsperhaps as many as six or seven yearsbeen distracting him by unconsciously setting itself to yearn for somebody wanting he scarcely knew whom echoes of himself though rarely he now and then found sometimes they were men sometimes women his cousin adelaide being one of these for in spite of a fashion which pervades the whole community at the present daythe habit of exclaiming that woman is not undeveloped man but diverse the fact remains that after all women are mankind and that in many of the sentiments of life the difference of sex is but a difference of degree  but the indefinable helpmate to the remoter sides of himself still continued invisible he grew older and concluded that the ideas or rather emotions which possessed him on the subject were probably too unreal ever to be found embodied in the flesh of a woman thereupon he developed a plan of satisfying his dreams by wandering away to the heroines of poetical imagination and took no further thought on the earthly realization of his formless desire in more homely matters satisfying himself with his cousin  cytherea appeared in the sky his heart started up and spoke       tis she and here      lo i unclothe and clear      my wishes cloudy character  some women kindle emotion so rapidly in a mans heart that the judgment cannot keep pace with its rise and finds on comprehending the situation that faithfulness to the old love is already treachery to the new such women are not necessarily the greatest of their sex but there are very few of them cytherea was one  on receiving the letter from her he had taken to thinking over these things and had not answered it at all but hungry generations soon tread down the muser in a city at length he thought of the strong necessity of living after a dreary search the negligence of which was ultimately overcome by mere conscientiousness he obtained a situation as assistant to an architect in the neighbourhood of charing cross the duties would not begin till after the lapse of a month  he could not at first decide whither he should go to spend the intervening time but in the midst of his reasonings he found himself on the road homeward impelled by a secret and unowned hope of getting a last glimpse of cytherea there  5 midnight  it was a quarter to twelve when manston drove into the stationyard the train was punctual and the bell announcing its arrival rang as he crossed the bookingoffice to go out upon the platform  the porter who had accompanied mrs manston to carriford and had returned to the station on his night duty recognized the steward as he entered and immediately came towards him  mrs manston came by the nine oclock train sir he said  the steward gave vent to an expression of vexation  her luggage is here sir the porter said  put it up behind me in the gig if it is not too much said manston  directly this train is in and gone sir  the man vanished and crossed the line to meet the entering train  where is that fire manston said to the bookingclerk  before the clerk could speak another man ran in and answered the question without having heard it  half carriford is burnt down or will be he exclaimed you cant see the flames from this station on account of the trees but step on the bridgetis tremendous  he also crossed the line to assist at the entry of the train which came in the next minute  the steward stood in the office one passenger alighted gave up his ticket and crossed the room in front of manston a young man with a black bag and umbrella in his hand he passed out of the door down the steps and struck out into the darkness  who was that young man said manston when the porter had returned the young man by a kind of magnetism had drawn the stewards thoughts after him  hes an architect  my own old profession i could have sworn it by the cut of him manston murmured whats his name he said again  springrovefarmer springroves son edward  farmer springroves son edward the steward repeated to himself and considered a matter to which the words had painfully recalled his mind  the matter was miss aldclyffes mention of the young man as cythereas lover which indeed had scarcely ever been absent from his thoughts  but for the existence of my wife that man might have been my rival he pondered following the porter who had now come back to him into the luggageroom and whilst the man was carrying out and putting in one box which was sufficiently portable for the gig manston still thought as his eyes watched the process  but for my wife springrove might have been my rival  he examined the lamps of his gig carefully laid out the reins mounted the seat and drove along the turnpikeroad towards knapwater park  the exact locality of the fire was plain to him as he neared home he soon could hear the shout of men the flapping of the flames the crackling of burning wood and could smell the smoke from the conflagration  of a sudden a few yards ahead within the compass of the rays from the righthand lamp burst forward the figure of a man having been walking in darkness the newcomer raised his hands to his eyes on approaching nearer to screen them from the glare of the reflector  manston saw that he was one of the villagers a small farmer originally who had drunk himself down to a daylabourer and reputed poacher  hoy cried manston aloud that the man might step aside out of the way  is that mr manston said the man  yes  somebody ha come to carriford and the rest of it may concern you sir  well well  did you expect mrs manston tonight sir  yes unfortunately shes come i know and asleep long before this time i suppose  the labourer leant his elbow upon the shaft of the gig and turned his face pale and sweating from his late work at the fire up to manstons  yes she did come he said i beg pardon sir but i should be glad ofof  what  glad of a trifle for bringen ye the news  not a farthing i didnt want your news i knew she was come  wont you give me a shillen sir  certainly not  then will you lend me a shillen sir i be tired out and dont know what to do if i dont pay you back some day ill be dd  the devil is so cheated that perdition isnt worth a penny as a security  oh  let me go on said manston  thy wife is dead thats the rest o the news said the labourer slowly he waited for a reply none came  she went to the three tranters because she couldnt get into thy house the burnen roof fell in upon her before she could be called up and shes a cinder as thoult be some day  that will do let me drive on said the steward calmly  expectation of a concussion may be so intense that its failure strikes the brain with more force than its fulfilment the labourer sank back into the ditch such a cushi could not realize the possibility of such an unmoved david as this  manston drove hastily to the turning of the road tied his horse and ran on foot to the site of the fire  the stagnation caused by the awful accident had been passed through and all hands were helping to remove from the remaining cottage what furniture they could lay hold of the thatch of the roofs being already on fire the knapwater fireengine had arrived on the spot but it was small and ineffectual a group was collected round the rector who in a coat which had become bespattered scorched and torn in his exertions was directing on one hand the proceedings relative to the removal of goods into the church and with the other was pointing out the spot on which it was most desirable that the puny engines at their disposal should be made to play every tongue was instantly silent at the sight of manstons pale and clear countenance which contrasted strangely with the grimy and streaming faces of the toiling villagers  was she burnt he said in a firm though husky voice and stepping into the illuminated area the rector came to him and took him aside is she burnt repeated manston  she is dead but thank god she was spared the horrid agony of burning the rector said solemnly the roof and gable fell in upon her and crushed her instant death must have followed  why was she here said manston  from what we can hurriedly collect it seems that she found the door of your house locked and concluded that you had retired the fact being that your servant mrs crickett had gone out to supper she then came back to the inn and went to bed  wheres the landlord said manston  mr springrove came up walking feebly and wrapped in a cloak and corroborated the evidence given by the rector  did she look ill or annoyed when she came said the steward  i cant say i didnt see but i think  what do you think  she was much put out about something  my not meeting her naturally murmured the other lost in reverie he turned his back on springrove and the rector and retired from the shining light  everything had been done that could be done with the limited means at their disposal the whole row of houses was destroyed and each presented itself as one stage of a series progressing from smoking ruins at the end where the inn had stood to a partly flaming massglowing as none but wood embers will glowat the other  a feature in the decline of town fires was noticeably absent heresteam there was present what is not observable in townsincandescence  the heat and the smarting effect upon their eyes of the strong smoke from the burning oak and deal had at last driven the villagers back from the road in front of the houses and they now stood in groups in the churchyard the surface of which raised by the interments of generations stood four or five feet above the level of the road and almost even with the top of the low wall dividing one from the other the headstones stood forth whitely against the dark grass and yews their brightness being repeated on the white smockfrocks of some of the labourers and in a mellower ruddier form on their faces and hands on those of the grinning gargoyles and on other salient stonework of the weatherbeaten church in the background  the rector had decided that under the distressing circumstances of the case there would be no sacrilege in placing in the church for the night the pieces of furniture and utensils which had been saved from the several houses there was no other place of safety for them and they accordingly were gathered there  6 halfpast twelve to one am  manston when he retired to meditate had walked round the churchyard and now entered the opened door of the building  he mechanically pursued his way round the piers into his own seat in the north aisle the lower atmosphere of this spot was shaded by its own wall from the shine which streamed in over the windowsills on the same side the only light burning inside the church was a small tallow candle standing in the font in the opposite aisle of the building to that in which manston had sat down and near where the furniture was piled the candles mild rays were overpowered by the ruddier light from the ruins making the weak flame to appear like the moon by day  sitting there he saw farmer springrove enter the door followed by his son edward still carrying his travellingbag in his hand they were speaking of the sad death of mrs manston but the subject was relinquished for that of the houses burnt  this row of houses running from the inn eastward had been built under the following circumstances  fifty years before this date the spot upon which the cottages afterwards stood was a blank strip along the side of the village street difficult to cultivate on account of the outcrop thereon of a large bed of flints called locally a lanch or lanchet  the aldclyffe then in possession of the estate conceived the idea that a row of cottages would be an improvement to the spot and accordingly granted leases of portions to several respectable inhabitants each lessee was to be subject to the payment of a merely nominal rent for the whole term of lives on condition that he built his own cottage and delivered it up intact at the end of the term  those who had built had one by one relinquished their indentures either by sale or barter to farmer springroves father new lives were added in some cases by payment of a sum to the lord of the manor etc and all the leases were now held by the farmer himself as one of the chief provisions for his old age  the steward had become interested in the following conversation  try not to be so depressed father they are all insured  the words came from edward in an anxious tone  you mistake edward they are not insured returned the old man gloomily  not the son asked  not one said the farmer  in the helmet fire office surely  they were insured there every one six months ago the office which had been raising the premiums on thatched premises higher for some years gave up insuring them altogether as two or three other fireoffices had done previously on account they said of the uncertainty and greatness of the risk of thatch undetached ever since then i have been continually intending to go to another office but have never gone who expects a fire  do you remember the terms of the leases said edward still more uneasily  no not particularly said his father absently  where are they  in the bureau there thats why i tried to save it first among other things  well we must see to that at once  what do you want  the key  they went into the south aisle took the candle from the font and then proceeded to open the bureau which had been placed in a corner under the gallery both leant over upon the flap edward holding the candle whilst his father took the pieces of parchment from one of the drawers and spread the first out before him  you read it ted i cant see without my glasses this one will be sufficient the terms of all are the same  edward took the parchment and read quickly and indistinctly for some time then aloud and slowly as follows   and the said john springrove for himself his heirs executors and administrators doth covenant and agree with the said gerald fellcourt aldclyffe his heirs and assigns that he the said john springrove his heirs and assigns during the said term shall pay unto the said gerald fellcourt aldclyffe his heirs and assigns the clear yearly rent of ten shillings and sixpence at the several times hereinbefore appointed for the payment thereof respectively and also shall and at all times during the said term well and sufficiently repair and keep the said cottage or dwellinghouse and all other the premises and all houses or buildings erected or to be erected thereupon in good and proper repair in every respect without exception and the said premises in such good repair upon the determination of this demise shall yield up unto the said gerald fellcourt aldclyffe his heirs and assigns   they closed the bureau and turned towards the door of the church without speaking  manston also had come forward out of the gloom notwithstanding the farmers own troubles an instinctive respect and generous sense of sympathy with the steward for his awful loss caused the old man to step aside that manston might pass out without speaking to them if he chose to do so  who is he whispered edward to his father as manston approached  mr manston the steward  manston came near and passed down the aisle on the side of the younger man their faces came almost close together one large flame which still lingered upon the ruins outside threw long dancing shadows of each across the nave till they bent upwards against the aisle wall and also illuminated their eyes as each met those of the other edward had learnt by a letter from home of the stewards passion for cytherea and his mysterious repression of it afterwards explained by his marriage that marriage was now nought edward realized the mans newly acquired freedom and felt an instinctive enmity towards himhe would hardly own to himself why the steward too knew cythereas attachment to edward and looked keenly and inscrutably at him  7 one to two am  manston went homeward alone his heart full of strange emotions entering the house and dismissing the woman to her own home he at once proceeded upstairs to his bedroom  reasoning worldliness especially when allied with sensuousness cannot repress on some extreme occasions the human instinct to pour out the soul to some being or personality who in frigid moments is dismissed with the title of chance or at most law manston was selfishly and inhumanly but honestly and unutterably thankful for the recent catastrophe beside his bed for that first time during a period of nearly twenty years he fell down upon his knees in a passionate outburst of feeling  many minutes passed before he arose he walked to the window and then seemed to remember for the first time that some action on his part was necessary in connection with the sad circumstance of the night  leaving the house at once he went to the scene of the fire arriving there in time to hear the rector making an arrangement with a certain number of men to watch the spot till morning the ashes were still redhot and flaming manston found that nothing could be done towards searching them at that hour of the night he turned homeward again in the company of the rector who had considerately persuaded him to retire from the scene for a while and promised that as soon as a man could live amid the embers of the three tranters inn they should be carefully searched for the remains of his unfortunate wife  manston then went indoors to wait for morning     xi the events of five days  1 november the twentyninth  the search began at dawn but a quarter past nine oclock came without bringing any result manston ate a little breakfast and crossed the hollow of the park which intervened between the old and modern manorhouses to ask for an interview with miss aldclyffe  he met her midway she was about to pay him a visit of condolence and to place every man on the estate at his disposal that the search for any relic of his dead and destroyed wife might not be delayed an instant  he accompanied her back to the house at first they conversed as if the death of the poor woman was an event which the husband must of necessity deeply lament and when all under this head that social form seemed to require had been uttered they spoke of the material damage done and of the steps which had better be taken to remedy it  it was not till both were shut inside her private room that she spoke to him in her blunt and cynical manner a certain newness of bearing in him peculiar to the present morning had hitherto forbidden her this tone the demeanour of the subject of her favouritism had altered she could not tell in what way he was entirely a changed man  are you really sorry for your poor wife mr manston she said  well i am he answered shortly  but only as for any human being who has met with a violent death  he confessed itfor she was not a good woman he added  i should be sorry to say such a thing now the poor creature is dead miss aldclyffe returned reproachfully  why he asked why should i praise her if she doesnt deserve it i say exactly what i have often admired sterne for saying in one of his lettersthat neither reason nor scripture asks us to speak nothing but good of the dead and now madam he continued after a short interval of thought i may perhaps hope that you will assist me or rather not thwart me in endeavouring to win the love of a young lady living about you one in whom i am much interested already  cytherea  yes cytherea  you have been loving cytherea all the while  yes  surprise was a preface to much agitation in her which caused her to rise from her seat and pace to the side of the room the steward quietly looked on and added i have been loving and still love her  she came close up to him wistfully contemplating his face one hand moving indecisively at her side  and your secret marriage was then the true and only reason for that backwardness regarding the courtship of cytherea which they tell me has been the talk of the village not your indifference to her attractions her voice had a tone of conviction in it as well as of inquiry but none of jealousy  yes he said and not a dishonourable one what held me back was just that one thinga sense of morality that perhaps madam you did not give me credit for the latter words were spoken with a mien and tone of pride  miss aldclyffe preserved silence  and now he went on i may as well say a word in vindication of my conduct lately at the risk too of offending you my actual motive in submitting to your order that i should send for my late wife and live with her was not the mercenary policy of wishing to retain an office which brings me greater comforts than any i have enjoyed before but this unquenchable passion for cytherea though i saw the weakness folly and even wickedness of it continually it still forced me to try to continue near her even as the husband of another woman  he waited for her to speak she did not  theres a great obstacle to my making any way in winning miss grayes love he went on  yes edward springrove she said quietly i know it i did once want to see them married they have had a slight quarrel and it will soon be made up again unless she spoke as if she had only half attended to manstons last statement  he is already engaged to be married to somebody else said the steward  pooh said she you mean to his cousin at peakhill thats nothing to help us hes now come home to break it off  he must not break it off said manston firmly and calmly  his tone attracted her startled her recovering herself she said haughtily well thats your affair not mine though my wish has been to see her your wife i cant do anything dishonourable to bring about such a result  but it must be made your affair he said in a hard steady voice looking into her eyes as if he saw there the whole panorama of her past  one of the most difficult things to portray by written words is that peculiar mixture of moods expressed in a womans countenance when after having been sedulously engaged in establishing anothers position she suddenly suspects him of undermining her own it was thus that miss aldclyffe looked at the steward  youknowsomethingof me she faltered  i know all he said  then curse that wife of yours she wrote and said she wouldnt tell you she burst out couldnt she keep her word for a day she reflected and then said but no more as to a stranger i will not yield i have committed no crime i yielded to her threats in a moment of weakness though i felt inclined to defy her at the time it was chiefly because i was mystified as to how she got to know of it pooh i will put up with threats no more o can you threaten me she added softly as if she had for the moment forgotten to whom she had been speaking  my love must be made your affair he repeated without taking his eyes from her  an agony which was not the agony of being discovered in a secret obstructed her utterance for a time how can you turn upon me so when i schemed to get you hereschemed that you might win her till i found you were married o how can you o o she wept and the weeping of such a nature was as harrowing as the weeping of a man  your getting me here was bad policy as to your secretthe most absurd thing in the world he said not heeding her distress i knew all except the identity of the individual long ago directly i found that my coming here was a contrived thing and not a matter of chance it fixed my attention upon you at once all that was required was the mere spark of life to make of a bundle of perceptions an organic whole  policy how can you talk of policy think do think and how can you threaten me when you knowyou knowthat i would befriend you readily without a threat  yes yes i think you would he said more kindly but your indifference for so many many years has made me doubt it  no not indifferencetwas enforced silence my father lived  he took her hand and held it gently                                      now listen he said more quietly and humanly when she had become calmer springrove must marry the woman hes engaged to you may make him but only in one way  well but dont speak sternly aeneas  do you know that his father has not been particularly thriving for the last two or three years  i have heard something of it once or twice though his rents have been promptly paid havent they  o yes and do you know the terms of the leases of the houses which are burnt he said explaining to her that by those terms she might compel him even to rebuild every house the case is the clearest case of fire by negligence that i have ever known in addition to that he continued  i dont want them rebuilt you know it was intended by my father directly they fell in to clear the site for a new entrance to the park  yes but that doesnt affect the position which is that farmer springrove is in your power to an extent which is very serious for him  i wont do ittis a conspiracy  wont you for me he said eagerly  miss aldclyffe changed colour  i dont threaten now i implore he said  because you might threaten if you chose she mournfully answered but why be sowhen your marriage with her was my own pet idea long before it was yours what must i do  scarcely anything simply this when i have seen old mr springrove which i shall do in a day or two and told him that he will be expected to rebuild the houses do you see the young man see him yourself in order that the proposals made may not appear to be anything more than an impulse of your own you or he will bring up the subject of the houses to rebuild them would be a matter of at least six hundred pounds and he will almost surely say that we are hard in insisting upon the extreme letter of the leases then tell him that scarcely can you yourself think of compelling an old tenant like his father to any such painful extremethere shall be no compulsion to build simply a surrender of the leases then speak feelingly of his cousin as a woman whom you respect and love and whose secret you have learnt to be that she is heartsick with hope deferred beg him to marry her his betrothed and your friend as some return for your consideration towards his father dont suggest too early a day for their marriage or he will suspect you of some motive beyond womanly sympathy coax him to make a promise to her that she shall be his wife at the end of a twelvemonth and get him on assenting to this to write to cytherea entirely renouncing her  she has already asked him to do that  so much the betterand telling her too that he is about to fulfil his longstanding promise to marry his cousin if you think it worth while you may say cytherea was not indisposed to think of me before she knew i was married i have at home a note she wrote me the first evening i saw her which looks rather warm and which i could show you trust me he will give her up when he is married to adelaide hinton cytherea will be induced to marry meperhaps before a womans pride is soon wounded  and hadnt i better write to mr nyttleton and inquire more particularly whats the law upon the houses  o no theres no hurry for that we know well enough how the case standsquite well enough to talk in general terms about it and i want the pressure to be put upon young springrove before he goes away from home again  she looked at him furtively long and sadly as after speaking he became lost in thought his eyes listlessly tracing the pattern of the carpet yes yes she will be mine he whispered careless of cytherea aldclyffes presence at last he raised his eyes inquiringly  i will do my best aeneas she answered  talibus incusat manston then left the house and again went towards the blackened ruins where men were still raking and probing  2 from november the twentyninth to december the second  the smouldering remnants of the three tranters inn seemed to promise that even when the searchers should light upon the remains of the unfortunate mrs manston very little would be discoverable  consisting so largely of the charcoal and ashes of hard dry oak and chestnut intermingled with thatch the interior of the heap was one glowing mass of embers which on being stirred about emitted sparks and flame long after it was dead and black on the outside it was persistently hoped however that some traces of the body would survive the effect of the hot coals and after a search pursued uninterruptedly for thirty hours under the direction of manston himself enough was found to set at rest any doubts of her fate  the melancholy gleanings consisted of her watch bunch of keys a few coins and two charred and blackened bones  two days later the official inquiry into the cause of her death was held at the rising sun inn before mr floy the coroner and a jury of the chief inhabitants of the district the little tavernthe only remaining one in the villagewas crowded to excess by the neighbouring peasantry as well as their richer employers all who could by any possibility obtain an hours release from their duties being present as listeners  the jury viewed the sad and infinitesimal remains which were folded in a white cambric cloth and laid in the middle of a wellfinished coffin lined with white silk by manstons order which stood in an adjoining room the bulk of the coffin being completely filled in with carefully arranged flowers and evergreensalso the stewards own doing  abraham brown of hoxton londonan old whiteheaded man without the ruddiness which makes white hairs so pleasingwas sworn and deposed that he kept a lodginghouse at an address he named on a saturday evening less than a month before the fire a lady came to him with very little luggage and took the front room on the second floor he did not inquire where she came from as she paid a week in advance but she gave her name as mrs manston referring him if he wished for any guarantee of her respectability to mr manston knapwater park here she lived for three weeks rarely going out she slept away from her lodgings one night during the time at the end of that time on the twentyeighth of november she left his house in a fourwheeled cab about twelve oclock in the day telling the driver to take her to the waterloo station she paid all her lodging expenses and not having given notice the full week previous to her going away offered to pay for the next but he only took half she wore a thick black veil and grey waterproof cloak when she left him and her luggage was two boxes one of plain deal with black japanned clamps the other sewn up in canvas  joseph chinney porter at the carriford road station deposed that he saw mrs manston dressed as the last witness had described get out of a secondclass carriage on the night of the twentyeighth she stood beside him whilst her luggage was taken from the van the luggage consisting of the clamped deal box and another covered with canvas was placed in the cloakroom she seemed at a loss at finding nobody there to meet her she asked him for some person to accompany her and carry her bag to mr manstons house knapwater park he was just off duty at that time and offered to go himself the witness here repeated the conversation he had had with mrs manston during their walk and testified to having left her at the door of the three tranters inn mr manstons house being closed  next farmer springrove was called a murmur of surprise and commiseration passed round the crowded room when he stepped forward  the events of the few preceding days had so worked upon his nervously thoughtful nature that the blue orbits of his eyes and the mere spot of scarlet to which the ruddiness of his cheeks had contracted seemed the result of a heavy sickness a perfect silence pervaded the assembly when he spoke  his statement was that he received mrs manston at the threshold and asked her to enter the parlour she would not do so and stood in the passage whilst the maid went upstairs to see that the room was in order the maid came down to the middle landing of the staircase when mrs manston followed her up to the room he did not speak ten words with her altogether  afterwards whilst he was standing at the door listening for his son edwards return he saw her light extinguished having first caught sight of her shadow moving about the room  the coroner did her shadow appear to be that of a woman undressing  springrove i cannot say as i didnt take particular notice it moved backwards and forwards she might have been undressing or merely pacing up and down the room  mrs fitler the ostlers wife and chambermaid said that she preceded mrs manston into the room put down the candle and went out mrs manston scarcely spoke to her except to ask her to bring a little brandy witness went and fetched it from the bar brought it up and put it on the dressingtable  the coroner had mrs manston begun to undress when you came back  no sir she was sitting on the bed with everything on as when she came in  did she begin to undress before you left  not exactly before i had left but when i had closed the door and was on the landing i heard her boot drop on the floor as it does sometimes when pulled off  had her face appeared worn and sleepy  i cannot say as her bonnet and veil were still on when i left for she seemed rather shy and ashamed to be seen at the three tranters at all  and did you hear or see any more of her  no more sir  mrs crickett temporary servant to mr manston said that in accordance with mr manstons orders everything had been made comfortable in the house for mrs manstons expected return on monday night mr manston told her that himself and mrs manston would be home late not till between eleven and twelve oclock and that supper was to be ready not expecting mrs manston so early she had gone out on a very important errand to mrs leat the postmistress  mr manston deposed that in looking down the columns of bradshaw he had mistaken the time of the trains arrival and hence was not at the station when she came the broken watch produced was his wifeshe knew it by a scratch on the inner plate and by other signs the bunch of keys belonged to her two of them fitted the locks of her two boxes  mr flooks agent to lord claydonfield at chettlewood said that mr manston had pleaded as his excuse for leaving him rather early in the evening after their days business had been settled that he was going to meet his wife at carriford road station where she was coming by the last train that night  the surgeon said that the remains were those of a human being the small fragment seemed a portion of one of the lumbar vertebraethe other the head of the os femorisbut they were both so far gone that it was impossible to say definitely whether they belonged to the body of a male or female there was no moral doubt that they were a womans he did not believe that death resulted from burning by fire he thought she was crushed by the fall of the west gable which being of wood as well as the floor burnt after it had fallen and consumed the body with it  two or three additional witnesses gave unimportant testimony  the coroner summed up and the jury without hesitation found that the deceased mrs manston came by her death accidentally through the burning of the three tranters inn  3 december the second afternoon  when mr springrove came from the door of the rising sun at the end of the inquiry manston walked by his side as far as the stile to the park a distance of about a stonesthrow  ah mr springrove this is a sad affair for everybody concerned  everybody said the old farmer with deep sadness tis quite a misery to me i hardly know how i shall live through each day as it breaks i think of the words in the morning thou shalt say would god it were even and at even thou shalt say would god it were morning for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see his voice became broken  ahtrue i read deuteronomy myself said manston  but my loss is as nothing to yours the farmer continued  nothing but i can commiserate you i should be worse than unfeeling if i didnt although my own affliction is of so sad and solemn a kind indeed my own loss makes me more keenly alive to yours different in nature as it is  what sum do you think would be required of me to put the houses in place again  i have roughly thought six or seven hundred pounds  if the letter of the law is to be acted up to said the old man with more agitation in his voice  yes exactly  do you know enough of miss aldclyffes mind to give me an idea of how she means to treat me  well i am afraid i must tell you that though i know very little of her mind as a rule in this matter i believe she will be rather peremptory she might share to the extent of a sixth or an eighth perhaps in consideration of her getting new lamps for old but i should hardly think more  the steward stepped upon the stile and mr springrove went along the road with a bowed head and heavy footsteps towards his nieces cottage in which rather against the wish of edward they had temporarily taken refuge  the additional weight of this knowledge soon made itself perceptible though indoors with edward or adelaide nearly the whole of the afternoon nothing more than monosyllabic replies could be drawn from him edward continually discovered him looking fixedly at the wall or floor quite unconscious of anothers presence at supper he ate just as usual but quite mechanically and with the same abstraction  4 december the third  the next morning he was in no better spirits afternoon came his son was alarmed and managed to draw from him an account of the conversation with the steward  nonsense he knows nothing about it said edward vehemently ill see miss aldclyffe myself now promise me father that youll not believe till i come back and tell you to believe it that miss aldclyffe will do any such unjust thing  edward started at once for knapwater house he strode rapidly along the highroad till he reached a wicket where a footpath allowed of a short cut to the mansion here he leant down upon the bars for a few minutes meditating as to the best manner of opening his speech and surveying the scene before him in that absent mood which takes cognizance of little things without being conscious of them at the time though they appear in the eye afterwards as vivid impressions it was a yellow lustrous late autumn day one of those days of the quarter when morning and evening seem to meet together without the intervention of a noon the clear yellow sunlight had tempted forth miss aldclyffe herself who was at this same time taking a walk in the direction of the village as springrove lingered he heard behind the plantation a womans dress brushing along amid the prickly husks and leaves which had fallen into the path from the boughs of the chestnut trees in another minute she stood in front of him  he answered her casual greeting respectfully and was about to request a few minutes conversation with her when she directly addressed him on the subject of the fire it is a sad misfortune for your father she said and i hear that he has lately let his insurances expire  he has madam and you are probably aware that either by the general terms of his holding or the same coupled with the origin of the fire the disaster may involve the necessity of his rebuilding the whole row of houses or else of becoming a debtor to the estate to the extent of some hundreds of pounds  she assented i have been thinking of it she went on and then repeated in substance the words put into her mouth by the steward some disturbance of thought might have been fancied as taking place in springroves mind during her statement but before she had reached the end his eyes were clear and directed upon her  i dont accept your conditions of release he said  they are not conditions exactly  well whatever they are not they are very uncalledfor remarks  not at allthe houses have been burnt by your familys negligence  i dont refer to the housesyou have of course the best of all rights to speak of that matter but you a stranger to me comparatively have no right at all to volunteer opinions and wishes upon a very delicate subject which concerns no living beings but miss graye miss hinton and myself  miss aldclyffe like a good many others in her position had plainly not realized that a son of her tenant and inferior could have become an educated man who had learnt to feel his individuality to view society from a bohemian standpoint far outside the farming grade in carriford parish and that hence he had all a developed mans unorthodox opinion about the subordination of classes and fully conscious of the labyrinth into which he had wandered between his wish to behave honourably in the dilemma of his engagement to his cousin adelaide and the intensity of his love for cytherea springrove was additionally sensitive to any allusion to the case he had spoken to miss aldclyffe with considerable warmth  and miss aldclyffe was not a woman likely to be far behind any second person in warming to a mood of defiance it seemed as if she were prepared to put up with a cold refusal but that her haughtiness resented a criticism of her conduct ending in a rebuke by this manstons discreditable object which had been made hers by compulsion only was now adopted by choice she flung herself into the work  a fiery man in such a case would have relinquished persuasion and tried palpable force a fiery woman added unscrupulousness and evolved daring strategy and in her obstinacy and to sustain herself as mistress she descended to an action the meanness of which haunted her conscience to her dying hour  i dont quite see mr springrove she said that i am altogether what you are pleased to call a stranger i have known your family at any rate for a good many years and i know miss graye particularly well and her state of mind with regard to this matter  perplexed love makes us credulous and curious as old women edward was willing he owned it to himself to get at cythereas state of mind even through so dangerous a medium  a letter i received from her he said with assumed coldness tells me clearly enough what miss grayes mind is  you think she still loves you o yes of course you doall men are like that  i have reason to he could feign no further than the first speech  i should be interested in knowing what reason she said with sarcastic archness  edward felt he was allowing her to do in fractional parts what he rebelled against when regarding it as a whole but the fact that his antagonist had the presence of a queen and features only in the early evening of their beauty was not without its influence upon a keenly conscious man her bearing had charmed him into toleration as mary stuarts charmed the indignant puritan visitors he again answered her honestly  the best of reasonsthe tone of her letter  pooh mr springrove  not at all miss aldclyffe miss graye desired that we should be strangers to each other for the simple practical reason that intimacy could only make wretched complications worse not from lack of lovelove is only suppressed  dont you know yet that in thus putting aside a man a womans pity for the pain she inflicts gives her a kindness of tone which is often mistaken for suppressed love said miss aldclyffe with soft insidiousness  this was a translation of the ambiguity of cythereas tone which he had certainly never thought of and he was too ingenuous not to own it  i had never thought of it he said  and dont believe it  not unless there was some other evidence to support the view  she paused a minute and then began hesitatingly  my intention waswhat i did not dream of owning to youmy intention was to try to induce you to fulfil your promise to miss hinton not solely on her account and yours though partly i love cytherea graye with all my soul and i want to see her happy even more than i do you i did not mean to drag her name into the affair at all but i am driven to say that she wrote that letter of dismissal to youfor it was a most pronounced dismissalnot on account of your engagement she is old enough to know that engagements can be broken as easily as they can be made she wrote it because she loved another man very suddenly and not with any idea or hope of marrying him but none the less deeply  who  mr manston  good i cant listen to you for an instant madam why she hadnt seen him  she had he came here the day before she wrote to you and i could prove to you if it were worth while that on that day she went voluntarily to his house though not artfully or blamably stayed for two hours playing and singing that no sooner did she leave him than she went straight home and wrote the letter saying she should not see you again entirely because she had seen him and fallen desperately in love with hima perfectly natural thing for a young girl to do considering that hes the handsomest man in the county why else should she not have written to you before  because i was such abecause she did not know of the connection between me and my cousin until then  i must think she did  on what ground  on the strong ground of my having told her so distinctly the very first day she came to live with me  well what do you seek to impress upon me after all thisthat the day miss graye wrote to me saying it was better that we should part coincided with the day she had seen a certain man  a remarkably handsome and talented man  yes i admit that  and that it coincided with the hour just subsequent to her seeing him  yes just when she had seen him  and been to his house alone with him  it is nothing  and stayed there playing and singing with him  admit that too he said an accident might have caused it  and at the same instant that she wrote your dismissal she wrote a letter referring to a secret appointment with him  never by god madam never  what do you say sir  never  she sneered  theres no accounting for beliefs and the whole history is a very trivial matter but i am resolved to prove that a ladys word is truthful though upon a matter which concerns neither you nor herself you shall learn that she did write him a letter concerning an assignationthat is if mr manston still has it and will be considerate enough to lend it me  but besides continued edward a married man to do what would cause a young girl to write a note of the kind you mention  she flushed a little  that i dont know anything about she stammered but cytherea didnt of course dream any more than i did or others in the parish that he was married  of course she didnt  and i have reason to believe that he told her of the fact directly afterwards that she might not compromise herself or allow him to it is notorious that he struggled honestly and hard against her attractions and succeeded in hiding his feelings if not in quenching them  well hope that he did  but circumstances are changed now  very greatly changed he murmured abstractedly  you must remember she added more suasively that miss graye has a perfect right to do what she likes with her ownher heart that is to say  her descent from irritation was caused by perceiving that edwards faith was really disturbed by her strong assertions and it gratified her  edwards thoughts flew to his father and the object of his interview with her tonguefencing was utterly distasteful to him  i will not trouble you by remaining longer madam he remarked gloomily our conversation has ended sadly for me  dont think so she said and dont be mistaken i am older than you are many years older and i know many things   full of miserable doubt and bitterly regretting that he had raised his fathers expectations by anticipations impossible of fulfilment edward slowly went his way into the village and approached his cousins house the farmer was at the door looking eagerly for him he had been waiting there for more than halfanhour his eye kindled quickly  well ted what does she say he asked in the intensely sanguine tones which fall sadly upon a listeners ear because antecedently they raise pictures of inevitable disappointment for the speaker in some direction or another  nothing for us to be alarmed at said edward with a forced cheerfulness  but must we rebuild  it seems we must father  the old mans eyes swept the horizon then he turned to go in without making another observation all light seemed extinguished in him again when edward went in he found his father with the bureau open unfolding the leases with a shaking hand folding them up again without reading them then putting them in their niche only to remove them again  adelaide was in the room she said thoughtfully to edward as she watched the farmer  i hope it wont kill poor uncle edward what should we do if anything were to happen to him he is the only near relative you and i have in the world it was perfectly true and somehow edward felt more bound up with her after that remark  she continued and he was only saying so hopefully the day before the fire that he wouldnt for the world let any one else give me away to you when we are married  for the first time a conscientious doubt arose in edwards mind as to the justice of the course he was pursuing in resolving to refuse the alternative offered by miss aldclyffe could it be selfishness as well as independence how much he had thought of his own heart how little he had thought of his fathers peace of mind  the old man did not speak again till suppertime when he began asking his son an endless number of hypothetical questions on what might induce miss aldclyffe to listen to kinder terms speaking of her now not as an unfair woman but as a lachesis or fate whose course it behoved nobody to condemn in his earnestness he once turned his eyes on edwards face their expression was woful the pupils were dilated and strange in aspect  if she will only agree to that he reiterated for the hundredth time increasing the sadness of his listeners  an aristocratic knocking came to the door and jane entered with a letter addressed                  mr edward springrove junior  charles from knapwater house brought it she said  miss aldclyffes writing said mr springrove before edward had recognized it himself now tis all right shes going to make an offer she doesnt want the houses there not she they are going to make that the way into the park  edward opened the seal and glanced at the inside he said with a supreme effort of selfcommand  it is only directed by miss aldclyffe and refers to nothing connected with the fire i wonder at her taking the trouble to send it tonight  his father looked absently at him and turned away again shortly afterwards they retired for the night alone in his bedroom edward opened and read what he had not dared to refer to in their presence  the envelope contained another envelope in cythereas handwriting addressed to  manston esq old manor house inside this was the note she had written to the steward after her detention in his house by the thunderstorm                        knapwater house                           september 20th  i find i cannot meet you at seven oclock by the waterfall as i promised the emotion i felt made me forgetful of realities                                             c graye   miss aldclyffe had not written a line and by the unvarying rule observable when words are not an absolute necessity her silence seemed ten times as convincing as any expression of opinion could have been  he then step by step recalled all the conversation on the subject of cythereas feelings that had passed between himself and miss aldclyffe in the afternoon and by a confusion of thought natural enough under the trying experience concluded that because the lady was truthful in her portraiture of effects she must necessarily be right in her assumption of causes that is he was convinced that cythereathe hithertobelieved faithful cythereahad at any rate looked with something more than indifference upon the extremely handsome face and form of manston  did he blame her as guilty of the impropriety of allowing herself to love the newcomer in the face of his not being free to return her love no never for a moment did he doubt that all had occurred in her old innocent impulsive way that her heart was gone before she knew itbefore she knew anything beyond his existence of the man to whom it had flown perhaps the very note enclosed to him was the result of first reflection manston he would unhesitatingly have called a scoundrel but for one strikingly redeeming fact it had been patent to the whole parish and had come to edwards own knowledge by that indirect channel that manston as a married man conscientiously avoided cytherea after those first few days of his arrival during which her irresistibly beautiful and fatal glances had rested upon himhis upon her  taking from his coat a creased and pocketworn envelope containing cythereas letter to himself springrove opened it and read it through he was upbraided therein and he was dismissed it bore the date of the letter sent to manston and by containing within it the phrase all the day long i have been thinking afforded justifiable ground for assuming that it was written subsequently to the other and in edwards sight far sweeter one to the steward  but though he accused her of fickleness he would not doubt the genuineness in its kind of her partiality for him at budmouth it was a short and shallow feelingnot perfect love            love is not love    which alters when it alteration finds  but it was not flirtation a feeling had been born in her and had died it would be well for his peace of mind if his love for her could flit away so softly and leave so few traces behind  miss aldclyffe had shown herself desperately concerned in the whole matter by the alacrity with which she had obtained the letter from manston and her labours to induce himself to marry his cousin taken in connection with her apparent interest in if not love for cytherea her eagerness too could only be accounted for on the ground that cytherea indeed loved the steward  5 december the fourth  edward passed the night he scarcely knew how tossing feverishly from side to side the blood throbbing in his temples and singing in his ears  before the day began to break he dressed himself on going out upon the landing he found his fathers bedroom door already open edward concluded that the old man had risen softly as was his wont and gone out into the fields to start the labourers but neither of the outer doors was unfastened he entered the front room and found it empty then animated by a new idea he went round to the little back parlour in which the few wrecks saved from the fire were deposited and looked in at the door here near the window the shutters of which had been opened half way he saw his father leaning on the bureau his elbows resting on the flap his body nearly doubled his hands clasping his forehead beside him were ghostlylooking square folds of parchmentthe leases of the houses destroyed  his father looked up when edward entered and wearily spoke to the young man as his face came into the faint light  edward why did you get up so early  i was uneasy and could not sleep  the farmer turned again to the leases on the bureau and seemed to become lost in reflection in a minute or two without lifting his eyes he said  this is more than we can bear tedmore than we can bear ted this will kill me not the loss onlythe sense of my neglect about the insurance and everything borrow i never will tis all misery now god help usall misery now  edward did not answer continuing to look fixedly at the dreary daylight outside  ted the farmer went on this upset of been burnt out o home makes me very nervous and doubtful about everything theres this troubles me besidesour liven here with your cousin and fillen up her house it must be very awkward for her but she says she doesnt mind have you said anything to her lately about when you are going to marry her  nothing at all lately  well perhaps you may as well now we are so mixed in together you know no time has ever been mentioned to her at all first or last and i think it right that now since she has waited so patiently and so longyou are almost called upon to say you are ready it would simplify matters very much if you were to walk up to church wi her one of these mornings get the thing done and go on liven here as we are if you dont i must get a house all the sooner it would lighten my mind too about the two little freeholds over the hillnot a morsel apiece divided as they were between her mother and me but a tidy bit tied together again just think about it will ye ted  he stopped from exhaustion produced by the intense concentration of his mind upon the weary subject and looked anxiously at his son  yes i will said edward  but i am going to see her of the great house this morning the farmer went on his thoughts reverting to the old subject i must know the rights of the matter the when and the where i dont like seeing her but id rather talk to her than the steward i wonder what shell say to me  the younger man knew exactly what she would say if his father asked her what he was to do and when she would simply refer him to manston her character was not that of a woman who shrank from a proposition she had once laid down if his father were to say to her that his son had at last resolved to marry his cousin within the year and had given her a promise to that effect she would say mr springrove the houses are burnt well let them go trouble no more about them  his mind was already made up he said calmly father when you are talking to miss aldclyffe mention to her that i have asked adelaide if she is willing to marry me next christmas she is interested in my union with adelaide and the news will be welcome to her  and yet she can be iron with reference to me and her property the farmer murmured very well ted ill tell her  6 december the fifth  of the many contradictory particulars constituting a womans heart two had shown their vigorous contrast in cythereas bosom just at this time  it was a dark morning the morning after old mr springroves visit to miss aldclyffe which had terminated as edward had intended having risen an hour earlier than was usual with her cytherea sat at the window of an elegant little sittingroom on the ground floor which had been appropriated to her by the kindness or whim of miss aldclyffe that she might not be driven into that ladys presence against her will she leant with her face on her hand looking out into the gloomy grey air a yellow glimmer from the flapping flame of the newlylit fire fluttered on one side of her face and neck like a butterfly about to settle there contrasting warmly with the other side of the same fair face which received from the window the faint cold morning light so weak that her shadow from the fire had a distinct outline on the windowshutter in spite of it there the shadow danced like a demon blue and grim  the contradiction alluded to was that in spite of the decisive mood which two months earlier in the year had caused her to write a peremptory and final letter to edward she was now hoping for some answer other than the only possible one a man who as she held did not love her wildly could send to such a communication for a lover who did love wildly she had left one little loophole in her otherwise straightforward epistle why she expected the letter on some morning of this particular week was that hearing of his return to carriford she fondly assumed that he meant to ask for an interview before he left hence it was too that for the last few days she had not been able to keep in bed later than the time of the postmans arrival  the clock pointed to halfpast seven she saw the postman emerge from beneath the bare boughs of the park trees come through the wicket dive through the shrubbery reappear on the lawn stalk across it without reference to pathsas country postmen doand come to the porch she heard him fling the bag down on the seat and turn away towards the village without hindering himself for a single pace  then the butler opened the door took up the bag brought it in and carried it up the staircase to place it on the slab by miss aldclyffes dressingroom door the whole proceeding had been depicted by sounds  she had a presentiment that her letter was in the bag at last she thought then in diminishing pulsations of confidence he asks to see me perhaps he asks to see me i hope he asks to see me  a quarter to eight miss aldclyffes bellrather earlier than usual she must have heard the postbag brought said the maiden as tired of the chilly prospect outside she turned to the fire and drew imaginative pictures of her future therein  a tap came to the door and the ladysmaid entered  miss aldclyffe is awake she said and she asked if you were moving yet miss  ill run up to her said cytherea and flitted off with the utterance of the words very fortunate this she thought i shall see what is in the bag this morning all the sooner  she took it up from the side table went into miss aldclyffes bedroom pulled up the blinds and looked round upon the lady in bed calculating the minutes that must elapse before she looked at her letters  well darling how are you i am glad you have come in to see me said miss aldclyffe you can unlock the bag this morning child if you like she continued yawning factitiously  strange cytherea thought it seems as if she knew there was likely to be a letter for me  from her bed miss aldclyffe watched the girls face as she tremblingly opened the postbag and found there an envelope addressed to her in edwards handwriting one he had written the day before after the decision he had come to on an impartial and on that account torturing survey of his own his fathers his cousin adelaides and what he believed to be cythereas position  the haughty mistresss soul sickened remorsefully within her when she saw suddenly appear upon the speaking countenance of the young lady before her a wan desolate look of agony  the mastersentences of edwards letter were these you speak truly that we never meet again is the wisest and only proper course that i regret the past as much as you do yourself it is hardly necessary for me to say     xii the events of ten months  1 december to april  week after week month after month the time had flown by christmas had passed dreary winter with dark evenings had given place to more dreary winter with light evenings thaws had ended in rain rain in wind wind in dust showery days had comethe period of pink dawns and white sunsets with the third week in april the cuckoo had appeared with the fourth the nightingale  edward springrove was in london attending to the duties of his new office and it had become known throughout the neighbourhood of carriford that the engagement between himself and miss adelaide hinton would terminate in marriage at the end of the year  the only occasion on which her lover of the idle delicious days at budmouth wateringplace had been seen by cytherea after the time of the decisive correspondence was once in church when he sat in front of her and beside miss hinton  the rencounter was quite an accident springrove had come there in the full belief that cytherea was away from home with miss aldclyffe and he continued ignorant of her presence throughout the service  it is at such moments as these when a sensitive nature writhes under the conception that its most cherished emotions have been treated with contumely that the spheredescended maid music friend of pleasure at other times becomes a positive enemyracking bewildering unrelenting the congregation sang the first psalm and came to the verse       like some fair tree which fed by streams        with timely fruit doth bend      he still shall flourish and success        all his designs attend  cythereas lips did not move nor did any sound escape her but could she help singing the words in the depths of her being although the man to whom she applied them sat at her rivals side  perhaps the moral compensation for all a womans petty cleverness under thriving conditions is the real nobility that lies in her extreme foolishness at these other times her sheer inability to be simply just her exercise of an illogical power entirely denied to men in generalthe power not only of kissing but of delighting to kiss the rod by a punctilious observance of the selfimmolating doctrines in the sermon on the mount  as for edwarda little like other men of his temperament to whom it is somewhat humiliating to think the aberrancy of a given love is in itself a recommendationhis sentiment as he looked over his cousins book was of a lower rank horatian rather than psalmodic       o what hast thou of her of her      whose every look did love inspire      whose every breathing fanned my fire      and stole me from myself away  then without letting him see her cytherea slipt out of church early and went home the tones of the organ still lingering in her ears as she tried bravely to kill a jealous thought that would nevertheless live my nature is one capable of more far more intense feeling than hers she cant appreciate all the sides of himshe never will he is more tangible to me even now as a thought than his presence itself is to her she was less noble then  but she continually repressed her misery and bitterness of heart till the effort to do so showed signs of lessening at length she even tried to hope that her lost lover and her rival would love one another very dearly  the scene and the sentiment dropped into the past meanwhile manston continued visibly before her he though quiet and subdued in his bearing for a long time after the calamity of november had not simulated a grief that he did not feel at first his loss seemed so to absorb himthough as a startling change rather than as a heavy sorrowthat he paid cytherea no attention whatever his conduct was uniformly kind and respectful but little more then as the date of the catastrophe grew remoter he began to wear a different aspect towards her he always contrived to obliterate by his manner all recollection on her side that she was comparatively more dependent than himselfmaking much of her womanhood nothing of her situation prompt to aid her whenever occasion offered and full of delightful petits soins at all times he was not officious in this way he irresistibly won for himself a position as her friend and the more easily in that he allowed not the faintest symptom of the old love to be apparent  matters stood thus in the middle of the spring when the next move on his behalf was made by miss aldclyffe  2 the third of may  she led cytherea to a summerhouse called the fane built in the private grounds about the mansion in the form of a grecian temple it overlooked the lake the island on it the trees and their undisturbed reflection in the smooth still water here the old and young maid halted here they stood side by side mentally imbibing the scene  the month was maythe time morning cuckoos thrushes blackbirds and sparrows gave forth a perfect confusion of song and twitter the road was spotted white with the fallen leaves of appleblossoms and the sparkling grey dew still lingered on the grass and flowers two swans floated into view in front of the women and then crossed the water towards them  they seem to come to us without any will of their ownquite involuntarilydont they said cytherea looking at the birds graceful advance  yes but if you look narrowly you can see their hips just beneath the water working with the greatest energy  id rather not see that it spoils the idea of proud indifference to direction which we associate with a swan  it does well have involuntarily ah now this reminds me of something  of what  of a human being who involuntarily comes towards yourself  cytherea looked into miss aldclyffes face her eyes grew round as circles and lines of wonderment came visibly upon her countenance she had not once regarded manston as a lover since his wifes sudden appearance and subsequent death the death of a wife and such a death was an overwhelming matter in her ideas of things  is it a man or woman she said quite innocently  mr manston said miss aldclyffe quietly  mr manston attracted by me now said cytherea standing at gaze  didnt you know it  certainly i did not why his poor wife has only been dead six months  of course he knows that but loving is not done by months or method or rule or nobody would ever have invented such a phrase as falling in love he does not want his love to be observed just yet on the very account you mention but conceal it as he may from himself and us it exists definitelyand very intensely i assure you  i suppose then that if he cant help it it is no harm of him said cytherea naively and beginning to ponder  of course it isntyou know that well enough she was a great burden and trouble to him this may become a great good to you both  a rush of feeling at remembering that the same woman before manstons arrival had just as frankly advocated edwards claims checked cythereas utterance for awhile  there dont look at me like that for heavens sake said miss aldclyffe you could almost kill a person by the force of reproach you can put into those eyes of yours i verily believe  edward once in the young ladys thoughts there was no getting rid of him she wanted to be alone  do you want me here she said  now there there you want to be off and have a good cry said miss aldclyffe taking her hand but you mustnt my dear theres nothing in the past for you to regret compare mr manstons honourable conduct towards his wife and yourself with springrove towards his betrothed and yourself and then see which appears the more worthy of your thoughts  3 from the fourth of may to the twentyfirst of june  the next stage in manstons advances towards her hand was a clearly defined courtship she was sadly perplexed and some contrivance was necessary on his part in order to meet with her but it is next to impossible for an appreciative woman to have a positive repugnance towards an unusually handsome and gifted man even though she may not be inclined to love him hence cytherea was not so alarmed at the sight of him as to render a meeting and conversation with her more than a matter of difficulty  coming and going from church was his grand opportunity manston was very religious now it is commonly said that no man was ever converted by argument but there is a single one which will make any laodicean in england let him be once lovesick wear prayerbooks and become a zealous episcopalianthe argument that his sweetheart can be seen from his pew  manston introduced into his method a system of bewitching flattery everywhere pervasive yet too so transitory and intangible that as in the case of the poet wordsworth and the wandering voice though she felt it present she could never find it as a foil to heighten its effect he occasionally spoke philosophically of the evanescence of female beautythe worthlessness of mere appearance handsome is that handsome does he considered a proverb which should be written on the lookingglass of every woman in the land your form your motions your heart have won me he said in a tone of playful sadness they are beautiful but i see these things and it comes into my mind that they are doomed they are gliding to nothing as i look poor eyes poor mouth poor face poor maiden where will her glories be in twenty years i say where will all of her be in a hundred then i think it is cruel that you should bloom a day and fade for ever and ever it seems hard and sad that you will die as ordinarily as i and be buried be food for roots and worms be forgotten and come to earth and grow up a mere blade of churchyardgrass and an ivy leaf then miss graye when i see you are a lovely nothing i pity you and the love i feel then is better and sounder larger and more lasting than that i felt at the beginning again an ardent flash of his handsome eyes  it was by this route that he ventured on an indirect declaration and offer of his hand  she implied in the same indirect manner that she did not love him enough to accept it  an actual refusal was more than he had expected cursing himself for what he called his egregious folly in making himself the slave of a mere ladys attendant and for having given the parish should they know of her refusal a chance of sneering at himcertainly a ground for thinking less of his standing than beforehe went home to the old house and walked indecisively up and down his backyard turning aside he leant his arms upon the edge of the rainwaterbutt standing in the corner and looked into it the reflection from the smooth stagnant surface tinged his face with the greenish shades of correggios nudes staves of sunlight slanted down through the still pool lighting it up with wonderful distinctness hundreds of thousands of minute living creatures sported and tumbled in its depth with every contortion that gaiety could suggest perfectly happy though consisting only of a head or a tail or at most a head and a tail and all doomed to die within the twentyfour hours  damn my position why shouldnt i be happy through my little day too let the parish sneer at my repulses let it ill get her if i move heaven and earth to do it  indeed the inexperienced cytherea had towards edward in the first place and manston afterwards unconsciously adopted bearings that would have been the very tactics of a professional fisher of men who wished to have them each successively dangling at her heels for if any rule at all can be laid down in a matter which for men collectively is notoriously beyond regulation it is that to snub a petted man and to pet a snubbed man is the way to win in suits of both kinds manston with springroves encouragement would have become indifferent edward with manstons repulses would have sheered off at the outset as he did afterwards her supreme indifference added fuel to manstons ardourit completely disarmed his pride the invulnerable nobody seemed greater to him than a susceptible princess  4 from the twentyfirst of june to the end of july  cytherea had in the meantime received the following letter from her brother it was the first definite notification of the enlargement of that cloud no bigger than a mans hand which had for nearly a twelvemonth hung before them in the distance and which was soon to give a colour to their whole sky from horizon to horizon                                                  budmouth regis  saturday  darling sisi have delayed telling you for a long time of a little matter which though not one to be seriously alarmed about is sufficiently vexing and it would be unfair in me to keep it from you any longer it is that for some time past i have again been distressed by that lameness which i first distinctly felt when we went to lulstead cove and again when i left knapwater that morning early it is an unusual pain in my left leg between the knee and the ankle i had just found fresh symptoms of it when you were here for that halfhour about a month agowhen you said in fun that i began to move like an old man i had a good mind to tell you then but fancying it would go off in a few days i thought it was not worth while since that time it has increased but i am still able to work in the office sitting on the stool my great fear is that mr g will have some outdoor measuring work for me to do soon and that i shall be obliged to decline it however we will hope for the best how it came what was its origin or what it tends to i cannot think you shall hear again in a day or two if it is no betteryour loving brother owen   this she answered begging to know the worst which she could bear but suspense and anxiety never in two days came another letter from him of which the subjoined paragraph is a portion   i had quite decided to let you know the worst and to assure you that it was the worst before you wrote to ask it and again i give you my word that i will conceal nothingso that there will be no excuse whatever for your wearing yourself out with fears that i am worse than i say this morning then for the first time i have been obliged to stay away from the office dont be frightened at this dear cytherea rest is all that is wanted and by nursing myself now for a week i may avoid an illness of six months   after a visit from her he wrote again   dr chestman has seen me he said that the ailment was some sort of rheumatism and i am now undergoing proper treatment for its cure my leg and foot have been placed in hot bran liniments have been applied and also severe friction with a pad he says i shall be as right as ever in a very short time directly i am i shall run up by the train to see you dont trouble to come to me if miss aldclyffe grumbles again about your being away for i am going on capitally you shall hear again at the end of the week   at the time mentioned came the following   i am sorry to tell you because i know it will be so disheartening after my last letter that i am not so well as i was then and that there has been a sort of hitch in the proceedings after i had been treated for rheumatism a few days longer in which treatment they pricked the place with a long needle several times i saw that dr chestman was in doubt about something and i requested that he would call in a brother professional man to see me as well they consulted together and then told me that rheumatism was not the disease after all but erysipelas they then began treating it differently as became a different matter blisters flour and starch seem to be the order of the day nowmedicine of course besides  mr gradfield has been in to inquire about me he says he has been obliged to get a designer in my place which grieves me very much though of course it could not be avoided   a month passed away throughout this period cytherea visited him as often as the limited time at her command would allow and wore as cheerful a countenance as the womanly determination to do nothing which might depress him could enable her to wear another letter from him then told her these additional facts   the doctors find they are again on the wrong tack they cannot make out what the disease is o cytherea how i wish they knew this suspense is wearing me out could not miss aldclyffe spare you for a day do come to me we will talk about the best course then i am sorry to complain but i am worn out   cytherea went to miss aldclyffe and told her of the melancholy turn her brothers illness had taken miss aldclyffe at once said that cytherea might go and offered to do anything to assist her which lay in her power cythereas eyes beamed gratitude as she turned to leave the room and hasten to the station  o cytherea said miss aldclyffe calling her back just one word has mr manston spoken to you lately  yes said cytherea blushing timorously  he proposed  yes  and you refused him  yes  tut tut now listen to my advice said miss aldclyffe emphatically and accept him before he changes his mind the chance which he offers you of settling in life is one that may possibly probably not occur again his position is good and secure and the life of his wife would be a happy one you may not be sure that you love him madly but suppose you are not sure my father used to say to me as a child when he was teaching me whist when in doubt win the trick that advice is ten times as valuable to a woman on the subject of matrimony in refusing a man there is always the risk that you may never get another offer  why didnt you win the trick when you were a girl said cytherea  come my lady pert im not the text said miss aldclyffe her face glowing like fire  cytherea laughed stealthily  i was about to say resumed miss aldclyffe severely that here is mr manston waiting with the tenderest solicitude for you and you overlooking it as if it were altogether beneath you think how you might benefit your sick brother if you were mrs manston you will please me very much by giving him some encouragement you understand me cythie dear  cytherea was silent  and said miss aldclyffe still more emphatically on your promising that you will accept him some time this year i will take especial care of your brother you are listening cytherea  yes she whispered leaving the room  she went to budmouth passed the day with her brother and returned to knapwater wretched and full of foreboding owen had looked startlingly thin and palethinner and paler than ever she had seen him before the brother and sister had that day decided that notwithstanding the drain upon their slender resources another surgeon should see him time was everything  owen told her the result in his next letter   the three practitioners between them have at last hit the nail on the head i hope they probed the place and discovered that the secret lay in the bone i underwent an operation for its removal three days ago after taking chloroform thank god it is over though i am so weak my spirits are rather better i wonder when i shall be at work again i asked the surgeons how long it would be first i said a month they shook their heads a year i said not so long they said six months i inquired they would not or could not tell me but never mind  run down when you have half a day to spare for the hours drag on so drearily o cytherea you cant think how drearily   she went immediately on her departure miss aldclyffe sent a note to the old house to manston on the maidens return tired and sick at heart as usual she found manston at the station awaiting her he asked politely if he might accompany her to knapwater she tacitly acquiesced during their walk he inquired the particulars of her brothers illness and with an irresistible desire to pour out her trouble to some one she told him of the length of time which must elapse before he could be strong again and of the lack of comfort in lodgings  manston was silent awhile then he said impetuously miss graye i will not mince mattersi love youyou know it stratagem they say is fair in love and i am compelled to adopt it now forgive me for i cannot help it consent to be my wife at any time that may suit youany remote day you may name will satisfy meand you shall find him well provided for  for the first time in her life she truly dreaded the handsome man at her side who pleaded thus selfishly and shrank from the hot voluptuous nature of his passion for her which disguise it as he might under a quiet and polished exterior at times radiated forth with a scorching white heat she perceived how animal was the love which bargained  i do not love you mr manston she replied coldly  5 from the first to the twentyseventh of august  the long sunny days of the later summertime brought only the same dreary accounts from budmouth and saw cytherea paying the same sad visits  she grew perceptibly weaker in body and mind manston still persisted in his suit but with more of his former indirectness now that he saw how unexpectedly well she stood an open attack his was the system of dares at the sicilian games       he like a captain who beleaguers round       some strongbuilt castle on a rising ground       views all the approaches with observing eyes       this and that other part again he tries       and more on industry than force relies  miss aldclyffe made it appear more clearly than ever that aid to owen from herself depended entirely upon cythereas acceptance of her steward hemmed in and distressed cythereas answers to his importunities grew less uniform they were firm or wavering as owens malady fluctuated had a register of her pitiful oscillations been kept it would have rivalled in pathos the diary wherein de quincey tabulates his combat with opiumperhaps as noticeable an instance as any in which a thrilling dramatic power has been given to mere numerals thus she wearily and monotonously lived through the month listening on sundays to the wellknown round of chapters narrating the history of elijah and elisha in famine and drought on weekdays to buzzing flies in hot sunny rooms so like so very like was day to day extreme lassitude seemed all that the world could show her  her state was in this wise when one afternoon having been with her brother she met the surgeon and begged him to tell the actual truth concerning owens condition  the reply was that he feared that the first operation had not been thorough that although the wound had healed another attempt might still be necessary unless nature were left to effect her own cure but the time such a selfhealing proceeding would occupy might be ruinous  how long would it be she said  it is impossible to say a year or two more or less  and suppose he submitted to another artificial extraction  then he might be well in four or six months  now the remainder of his and her possessions together with a sum he had borrowed would not provide him with necessary comforts for half that time to combat the misfortune there were two courses openher becoming betrothed to manston or the sending owen to the county hospital  thus terrified driven into a corner panting and fluttering about for some loophole of escape yet still shrinking from the idea of being manstons wife the poor little bird endeavoured to find out from miss aldclyffe whether it was likely owen would be well treated in the hospital  county hospital said miss aldclyffe why it is only another name for slaughterhousein surgical cases at any rate certainly if anything about your body is snapt in two they do join you together in a fashion but tis so askew and ugly that you may as well be apart again then she terrified the inquiring and anxious maiden by relating horrid stories of how the legs and arms of poor people were cut off at a moments notice especially in cases where the restorative treatment was likely to be long and tedious  you know how willing i am to help you cytherea she added reproachfully you know it why are you so obstinate then why do you selfishly bar the clear honourable and only sisterly path which leads out of this difficulty i cannot on my conscience countenance you no i cannot  manston once more repeated his offer and once more she refused but this time weakly and with signs of an internal struggle manstons eye sparkled he saw for the hundredth time in his life that perseverance if only systematic was irresistible by womankind  6 the twentyseventh of august  on going to budmouth three days later she found to her surprise that the steward had been there had introduced himself and had seen her brother a few delicacies had been brought him also by the same hand owen spoke in warm terms of manston and his free and unceremonious call as he could not have refrained from doing of any person of any kind whose presence had served to help away the tedious hours of a long day and who had moreover shown that sort of consideration for him which the accompanying basket impliedantecedent consideration so telling upon all invalidsand which he so seldom experienced except from the hands of his sister  how should he perceive amid this tithepaying of mint and anise and cummin the weightier matters which were left undone  again the steward met her at carriford road station on her return journey instead of being frigid as at the former meeting at the same place she was embarrassed by a strife of thought and murmured brokenly her thanks for what he had done the same request that he might see her home was made  he had perceived his error in making his kindness to owen a conditional kindness and had hastened to efface all recollection of it though i let my offer on her brothersmy friendsbehalf seem dependent on my ladys graciousness to me he whispered wooingly in the course of their walk i could not conscientiously adhere to my statement it was said with all the impulsive selfishness of love whether you choose to have me or whether you dont i love you too devotedly to be anything but kind to your brother miss graye cytherea i will do anything he continued earnestly to give you pleasureindeed i will  she saw on the one hand her poor and muchloved owen recovering from his illness and troubles by the disinterested kindness of the man beside her on the other she drew him dying wholly by reason of her selfenforced poverty to marry this man was obviously the course of common sense to refuse him was impolitic temerity there was reason in this but there was more behind than a hundred reasonsa womans gratitude and her impulse to be kind  the wavering of her mind was visible in her telltale face he noticed it and caught at the opportunity  they were standing by the ruinous foundations of an old mill in the midst of a meadow between grey and halfovergrown stoneworkthe only signs of masonry remainingthe water gurgled down from the old millpond to a lower level under the cloak of rank broad leavesthe sensuous natures of the vegetable world on the right hand the sun resting on the horizonline streamed across the ground from below coppercoloured and lilac clouds stretched out in flats beneath a sky of pale soft green all dark objects on the earth that lay towards the sun were overspread by a purple haze against which a swarm of wailing gnats shone forth luminously rising upward and floating away like sparks of fire  the stillness oppressed and reduced her to mere passivity the only wish the humidity of the place left in her was to stand motionless the helpless flatness of the landscape gave her as it gives all such temperaments a sense of bare equality with and no superiority to a single entity under the sky  he came so close that their clothes touched will you try to love me do try to love me he said in a whisper taking her hand he had never taken it before she could feel his hand trembling exceedingly as it held hers in its clasp  considering his kindness to her brother his love for herself and edwards fickleness ought she to forbid him to do this how truly pitiful it was to feel his hand tremble soall for her should she withdraw her hand she would think whether she would thinking and hesitating she looked as far as the autumnal haze on the marshy ground would allow her to see distinctly there was the fragment of a hedgeall that remained of a wet old gardenstanding in the middle of the mead without a definite beginning or ending purposeless and valueless it was overgrown and choked with mandrakes and she could almost fancy she heard their shrieks should she withdraw her hand no she could not withdraw it now it was too late the act would not imply refusal she felt as one in a boat without oars drifting with closed eyes down a rivershe knew not whither  he gave her hand a gentle pressure and relinquished it  then it seemed as if he were coming to the point again no he was not going to urge his suit that evening another respite  7 the early part of september  saturday came and she went on some trivial errand to the village postoffice it was a little grey cottage with a luxuriant jasmine encircling the doorway and before going in cytherea paused to admire this pleasing feature of the exterior hearing a step on the gravel behind the corner of the house she resigned the jasmine and entered nobody was in the room she could hear mrs leat the widow who acted as postmistress walking about over her head cytherea was going to the foot of the stairs to call mrs leat but before she had accomplished her object another form stood at the halfopen door manston came in  both on the same errand he said gracefully  i will call her said cytherea moving in haste to the foot of the stairs  one moment he glided to her side dont call her for a moment he repeated  but she had said mrs leat  he seized cythereas hand kissed it tenderly and carefully replaced it by her side  she had that morning determined to check his further advances until she had thoroughly considered her position the remonstrance was now on her tongue but as accident would have it before the word could be spoken mrs leat was stepping from the last stair to the floor and no remonstrance came  with the subtlety which characterized him in all his dealings with her he quickly concluded his own errand bade her a goodbye in the tones of which love was so garnished with pure politeness that it only showed its presence to herself and left the houseputting it out of her power to refuse him her companionship homeward or to object to his late action of kissing her hand  the friday of the next week brought another letter from her brother in this he informed her that in absolute grief lest he should distress her unnecessarily he had some time earlier borrowed a few pounds a week ago he said his creditor became importunate but that on the day on which he wrote the creditor had told him there was no hurry for a settlement that his sisters suitor had guaranteed the sum is he mr manston tell me cytherea said owen  he also mentioned that a wheeled chair had been anonymously hired for his especial use though as yet he was hardly far enough advanced towards convalescence to avail himself of the luxury is this mr manstons doing he inquired  she could dally with her perplexity evade it trust to time for guidance no longer the matter had come to a crisis she must once and for all choose between the dictates of her understanding and those of her heart she longed till her soul seemed nigh to bursting for her lost mothers return to earth but for one minute that she might have tender counsel to guide her through this her great difficulty  as for her heart she half fancied that it was not edwards to quite the extent that it once had been she thought him cruel in conducting himself towards her as he did at budmouth cruel afterwards in making so light of her she knew he had stifled his love for herwas utterly lost to her but for all that she could not help indulging in a womans pleasure of recreating defunct agonies and lacerating herself with them now and then  if i were rich she thought i would give way to the luxury of being morbidly faithful to him for ever without his knowledge  but she considered in the first place she was a homeless dependent and what did practical wisdom tell her to do under such desperate circumstances to provide herself with some place of refuge from poverty and with means to aid her brother owen this was to be mr manstons wife  she did not love him  but what was love without a home misery what was a home without love alas not much but still a kind of home  yes she thought i am urged by my common sense to marry mr manston  did anything nobler in her say so too  with the death to her of edward her hearts occupation was gone was it necessary or even right for her to tend it and take care of it as she used to in the old time when it was still a capable minister  by a slight sacrifice here she could give happiness to at least two hearts whose emotional activities were still unwounded she would do good to two men whose lives were far more important than hers  yes she said again even christianity urges me to marry mr manston  directly cytherea had persuaded herself that a kind of heroic selfabnegation had to do with the matter she became much more content in the consideration of it a wilful indifference to the future was what really prevailed in her ill and worn out as she was by the perpetual harassments of her sad fortune and she regarded this indifference as gushing natures will do under such circumstances as genuine resignation and devotedness  manston met her again the following day indeed there was no escaping him now at the end of a short conversation between them which took place in the hollow of the park by the waterfall obscured on the outer side by the low hanging branches of the limes she tacitly assented to his assumption of a privilege greater than any that had preceded it he stooped and kissed her brow  before going to bed she wrote to owen explaining the whole matter it was too late in the evening for the postmans visit and she placed the letter on the mantelpiece to send it the next day  the morning sunday brought a hurried postscript to owens letter of the day before                                                 september 9 1865  dear cythereai have received a frank and friendly letter from mr manston explaining the position in which he stands now and also that in which he hopes to stand towards you cant you love him why not try for he is a good and not only that but a cultured man think of the weary and laborious future that awaits you if you continue for life in your present position and do you see any way of escape from it except by marriage i dont dont go against your heart cytherea but be wiseever affectionately yours owen   she thought that probably he had replied to mr manston in the same favouring mood she had a conviction that that day would settle her doom yet       so true a fool is love  that even now she nourished a halfhope that something would happen at the last moment to thwart her deliberatelyformed intentions and favour the old emotion she was using all her strength to thrust down  8 the tenth of september  the sunday was the thirteenth after trinity and the afternoon service at carriford was nearly over the people were singing the evening hymn  manston was at church as usual in his accustomed place two seats forward from the large square pew occupied by miss aldclyffe and cytherea  the ordinary sadness of an autumnal eveningservice seemed in cythereas eyes to be doubled on this particular occasion she looked at all the people as they stood and sang waving backwards and forwards like a forest of pines swayed by a gentle breeze then at the village children singing too their heads inclined to one side their eyes listlessly tracing some crack in the old walls or following the movement of a distant bough or bird with features petrified almost to painfulness then she looked at manston he was already regarding her with some purpose in his glance  it is coming this evening she said in her mind a minute later at the end of the hymn when the congregation began to move out manston came down the aisle he was opposite the end of her seat as she stepped from it the remainder of their progress to the door being in contact with each other miss aldclyffe had lingered behind  dont lets hurry he said when cytherea was about to enter the private path to the house as usual would you mind turning down this way for a minute till miss aldclyffe has passed  she could not very well refuse now they turned into a secluded path on their left leading round through a thicket of laurels to the other gate of the churchyard walking very slowly by the time the further gate was reached the church was closed they met the sexton with the keys in his hand  we are going inside for a minute said manston to him taking the keys unceremoniously i will bring them to you when we return  the sexton nodded his assent and cytherea and manston walked into the porch and up the nave  they did not speak a word during their progress or in any way interfere with the stillness and silence that prevailed everywhere around them everything in the place was the embodiment of decay the fading red glare from the setting sun which came in at the west window emphasizing the end of the day and all its cheerful doings the mildewed walls the uneven pavingstones the wormy pews the sense of recent occupation and the dank air of death which had gathered with the evening would have made grave a lighter mood than cythereas was then  what sensations does the place impress you with she said at last very sadly  i feel imperatively called upon to be honest from very despair of achieving anything by stratagem in a world where the materials are such as these he too spoke in a depressed voice purposely or otherwise  i feel as if i were almost ashamed to be seen walking such a world she murmured thats the effect it has upon me but it does not induce me to be honest particularly  he took her hand in both his and looked down upon the lids of her eyes  i pity you sometimes he said more emphatically  i am pitiable perhaps so are many people why do you pity me  i think that you make yourself needlessly sad  not needlessly  yes needlessly why should you be separated from your brother so much when you might have him to stay with you till he is well  that cant be she said turning away  he went on i think the real and only good thing that can be done for him is to get him away from budmouth awhile and i have been wondering whether it could not be managed for him to come to my house to live for a few weeks only a quarter of a mile from you how pleasant it would be  it would  he moved himself round immediately to the front of her and held her hand more firmly as he continued cytherea why do you say it would so entirely in the tone of abstract supposition i want him there i want him to be my brother too then make him so and be my wife i cannot live without you o cytherea my darling my love come and be my wife  his face bent closer and closer to hers and the last words sank to a whisper as weak as the emotion inspiring it was strong  she said firmly and distinctly yes i will  next month he said on the instant before taking breath  no not next month  the next  no  december christmas day say  i dont mind  o you darling he was about to imprint a kiss upon her pale cold mouth but she hastily covered it with her hand  dont kiss meat least where we are now she whispered imploringly  why  we are too near god  he gave a sudden start and his face flushed she had spoken so emphatically that the words near god echoed back again through the hollow building from the far end of the chancel  what a thing to say he exclaimed surely a pure kiss is not inappropriate to the place  no she replied with a swelling heart i dont know why i burst out soi cant tell what has come over me will you forgive me  how shall i say yes without judging you how shall i say no without losing the pleasure of saying yes he was himself again  i dont know she absently murmured  ill say yes he answered daintily it is sweeter to fancy we are forgiven than to think we have not sinned and you shall have the sweetness without the need  she did not reply and they moved away the church was nearly dark now and melancholy in the extreme she stood beside him while he locked the door then took the arm he gave her and wound her way out of the churchyard with him then they walked to the house together but the great matter having been set at rest she persisted in talking only on indifferent subjects  christmas day then he said as they were parting at the end of the shrubbery  i meant old christmas day she said evasively  hm people do not usually attach that meaning to the words  no but i should like it best if it could not be till then it seemed to be still her instinct to delay the marriage to the utmost  very well love he said gently tis a fortnight longer still but never mind old christmas day  9 the eleventh of september  there it will be on a friday  she sat upon a little footstool gazing intently into the fire it was the afternoon of the day following that of the stewards successful solicitation of her hand  i wonder if it would be proper in me to run across the park and tell him it is a friday she said to herself rising to her feet looking at her hat lying near and then out of the window towards the old house proper or not she felt that she must at all hazards remove the disagreeable though as she herself owned unfounded impression the coincidence had occasioned she left the house directly and went to search for him  manston was in the timberyard looking at the sawyers as they worked cytherea came up to him hesitatingly till within a distance of a few yards she had hurried forward with alacritynow that the practical expression of his face became visible she wished almost she had never sought him on such an errand in his businessmood he was perhaps very stern  it will be on a friday she said confusedly and without any preface  come this way said manston in the tone he used for workmen not being able to alter at an instants notice he gave her his arm and led her back into the avenue by which time he was lover again on a friday will it dearest you do not mind fridays surely thats nonsense  not seriously mind them exactlybut if it could be any other day  well let us say old christmas eve then shall it be old christmas eve  yes old christmas eve  your word is solemn and irrevocable now  certainly i have solemnly pledged my word i should not have promised to marry you if i had not meant it dont think i should she spoke the words with a dignified impressiveness  you must not be vexed at my remark dearest can you think the worse of an ardent man cytherea for showing some anxiety in love  no no she could not say more she was always ill at ease when he spoke of himself as a piece of human nature in that analytical way and wanted to be out of his presence the time of day and the proximity of the house afforded her a means of escape i must be with miss aldclyffe nowwill you excuse my hasty coming and going she said prettily before he had replied she had parted from him  cytherea was it mr manston i saw you scudding away from in the avenue just now said miss aldclyffe when cytherea joined her  yes  yes come why dont you say more than that i hate those taciturn yesses of yours i tell you everything and yet you are as close as wax with me  i parted from him because i wanted to come in  what a novel and important announcement well is the day fixed  yes  miss aldclyffes face kindled into intense interest at once is it indeed when is it to be  on old christmas eve  old christmas eve miss aldclyffe drew cytherea round to her front and took a hand in each of her own and then you will be a bride she said slowly looking with critical thoughtfulness upon the maidens delicately rounded cheeks  the normal area of the colour upon each of them decreased perceptibly after that slow and emphatic utterance by the elder lady  miss aldclyffe continued impressively you did not say old christmas eve as a fiancee should have said the words and you dont receive my remark with the warm excitement that foreshadows a bright future how many weeks are there to the time  i have not reckoned them  not fancy a girl not counting the weeks i find i must take the lead in this matteryou are so childish or frightened or stupid or something about it bring me my diary and we will count them at once  cytherea silently fetched the book  miss aldclyffe opened the diary at the page containing the almanac and counted sixteen weeks which brought her to the thirtyfirst of decembera sunday cytherea stood by looking on as if she had no appetite for the scene  sixteen to the thirtyfirst then let me see monday will be the first of january tuesday the second wednesday third thursday fourth friday fifthyou have chosen a friday as i declare  a thursday surely said cytherea  no old christmas day comes on a saturday  the perturbed little brain had reckoned wrong well it must be a friday she murmured in a reverie  no have it altered of course said miss aldclyffe cheerfully theres nothing bad in friday but such a creature as you will be thinking about its being unluckyin fact i wouldnt choose a friday myself to be married on since all the other days are equally available  i shall not have it altered said cytherea firmly it has been altered once already i shall let it be     xiii the events of one day  1 the fifth of january before dawn  we pass over the intervening weeks the time of the story is thus advanced more than a quarter of a year  on the midnight preceding the morning which would make her the wife of a man whose presence fascinated her into involuntariness of bearing and whom in absence she almost dreaded cytherea lay in her little bed vainly endeavouring to sleep  she had been looking back amid the years of her short though varied past and thinking of the threshold upon which she stood days and months had dimmed the form of edward springrove like the gauzes of a vanishing stagescene but his dying voice could still be heard faintly behind that a soft small chord in her still vibrated true to his memory she would not admit that she did not approach manston with feelings which could by any stretch of words be called hymeneal she calmly owned  why do i marry him she said to herself because owen dear owen my brother wishes me to marry him because mr manston is and has been uniformly kind to owen and to me act in obedience to the dictates of commonsense owen said and dread the sharp sting of poverty how many thousands of women like you marry every year for the same reason to secure a home and mere ordinary material comforts which after all go far to make life endurable even if not supremely happy  tis right i suppose for him to say that o if people only knew what a timidity and melancholy upon the subject of her future grows up in the heart of a friendless woman who is blown about like a reed shaken with the wind as i am they would not call this resignation of ones self by the name of scheming to get a husband scheme to marry id rather scheme to die i know i am not pleasing my heart i know that if i only were concerned i should like risking a single future but why should i please my useless self overmuch when by doing otherwise i please those who are more valuable than i  in the midst of desultory reflections like these which alternated with surmises as to the inexplicable connection that appeared to exist between her intended husband and miss aldclyffe she heard dull noises outside the walls of the house which she could not quite fancy to be caused by the wind she seemed doomed to such disturbances at critical periods of her existence it is strange she pondered that this my last night in knapwater house should be disturbed precisely as my first was no occurrence of the kind having intervened  as the minutes glided by the noise increased sounding as if some one were beating the wall below her window with a bunch of switches she would gladly have left her room and gone to stay with one of the maids but they were without doubt all asleep  the only person in the house likely to be awake or who would have brains enough to comprehend her nervousness was miss aldclyffe but cytherea never cared to go to miss aldclyffes room though she was always welcome there and was often almost compelled to go against her will  the oftrepeated noise of switches grew heavier upon the wall and was now intermingled with creaks and a rattling like the rattling of dice the wind blew stronger there came first a snapping then a crash and some portion of the mystery was revealed it was the breaking off and fall of a branch from one of the large trees outside the smacking against the wall and the intermediate rattling ceased from that time  well it was the tree which had caused the noises the unexplained matter was that neither of the trees ever touched the walls of the house during the highest wind and that trees could not rattle like a man playing castanets or shaking dice  she thought is it the intention of fate that something connected with these noises shall influence my future as in the last case of the kind  during the dilemma she fell into a troubled sleep and dreamt that she was being whipped with dry bones suspended on strings which rattled at every blow like those of a malefactor on a gibbet that she shifted and shrank and avoided every blow and they fell then upon the wall to which she was tied she could not see the face of the executioner for his mask but his form was like manstons  thank heaven she said when she awoke and saw a faint light struggling through her blind now what were those noises to settle that question seemed more to her than the event of the day  she pulled the blind aside and looked out all was plain the evening previous had closed in with a grey drizzle borne upon a piercing air from the north and now its effects were visible the hoary drizzle still continued but the trees and shrubs were laden with icicles to an extent such as she had never before witnessed a shoot of the diameter of a pins head was iced as thick as her finger all the boughs in the park were bent almost to the earth with the immense weight of the glistening incumbrance the walks were like a lookingglass many boughs had snapped beneath their burden and lay in heaps upon the icy grass opposite her eye on the nearest tree was a fresh yellow scar showing where the branch that had terrified her had been splintered from the trunk  i never could have believed it possible she thought surveying the boweddown branches that trees would bend so far out of their true positions without breaking by watching a twig she could see a drop collect upon it from the hoary fog sink to the lowest point and there become coagulated as the others had done  or that i could so exactly have imitated them she continued on this morning i am to be marriedunless this is a scheme of the great mother to hinder a union of which she does not approve is it possible for my wedding to take place in the face of such weather as this  2 morning  her brother owen was staying with manston at the old house contrary to the opinion of the doctors the wound had healed after the first surgical operation and his leg was gradually acquiring strength though he could only as yet get about on crutches or ride or be dragged in a chair  miss aldclyffe had arranged that cytherea should be married from knapwater house and not from her brothers lodgings at budmouth which was cythereas first idea owen too seemed to prefer the plan the capricious old maid had latterly taken to the contemplation of the wedding with even greater warmth than had at first inspired her and appeared determined to do everything in her power consistent with her dignity to render the adjuncts of the ceremony pleasing and complete  but the weather seemed in flat contradiction of the whole proceeding at eight oclock the coachman crept up to the house almost upon his hands and knees entered the kitchen and stood with his back to the fire panting from his exertions in pedestrianism  the kitchen was by far the pleasantest apartment in knapwater house on such a morning as this the vast fire was the centre of the whole system like a sun and threw its warm rays upon the figures of the domestics wheeling about it in true planetary style a nervouslyfeeble imitation of its flicker was continually attempted by a family of polished metallic utensils standing in rows and groups against the walls opposite the whole collection of shines nearly annihilating the weak daylight from outside a step further in and the nostrils were greeted by the scent of green herbs just gathered and the eye by the plump form of the cook wholesome whiteaproned and flourylooking as edible as the food she manipulatedher movements being supported and assisted by her satellites the kitchen and scullery maids minute recurrent sounds prevailedthe click of the smokejack the flap of the flames and the light touches of the womens slippers upon the stone floor  the coachman hemmed spread his feet more firmly upon the hearthstone and looked hard at a small plate in the extreme corner of the dresser  no wedden this mornenthats my opinion in fact there cant be he said abruptly as if the words were the mere torso of a manymembered thought that had existed complete in his head  the kitchenmaid was toasting a slice of bread at the end of a very long toastingfork which she held at arms length towards the unapproachable fire travestying the flanconnade in fencing  bad out of doors isnt it she said with a look of commiseration for things in general  bad not even a liven soul gentle or simple can stand on level ground as to getten up hill to the church tis perfect lunacy and i speak of footpassengers as to horses and carriage tis murder to think of em i am going to send straight as a line into the breakfastroom and say tis a closer hulloheres clerk crickett and john day acomen now just look at em and picture a wedden if you can  all eyes were turned to the window from which the clerk and gardener were seen crossing the court bowed and stooping like bel and nebo  youll have to go if it breaks all the horses legs in the county said the cook turning from the spectacle knocking open the ovendoor with the tongs glancing critically in and slamming it together with a clang  o o why shall i asked the coachman including in his auditory by a glance the clerk and gardener who had just entered  because mr manston is in the business did you ever know him to give up for weather of any kind or for any other mortal thing in heaven or earth  mornen sossuch as it is interrupted mr crickett cheerily coming forward to the blaze and warming one hand without looking at the fire mr manston gie up for anything in heaven or earth did you say you might ha cut it short by sayen to miss aldclyffe and leaven out heaven and earth as trifles but it might be put off putten off a thing isnt getten rid of a thing if that thing is a woman o no no  the coachman and gardener now naturally subsided into secondaries the cook went on rather sharply as she dribbled milk into the exact centre of a little crater of flour in a platter  it might be in this case shes so indifferent  dang my old sides and so it might be i have a bit of newsi thought there was something upon my tongue but tis a secret not a word mind not a word why miss hinton took a holiday yesterday  yes inquired the cook looking up with perplexed curiosity  dye think thats all  dont be so threecunningif it is all deliver you from the evil of raising a womans expectations wrongfully ill skimmer your pate as sure as you cry amen  well it isnt all when i got home last night my wife said miss adelaide took a holiday this mornen says she my wife that is walked over to nether mynton met the comen man and got married says she  got married what lordamercy did springrove come  springrove nonospringroves nothen to do wi ittwas farmer bollens theyve been playing bopeep for these two or three months seemingly whilst master teddy springrove has been daddlen and hawken and spetten about having her shes quietly left him all forsook serve him right i dont blame the little woman a bit  farmer bollens is old enough to be her father  ay quite and rich enough to be ten fathers they say hes so rich that he has business in every bank and measures his money in halfpint cups  lord i wish it was me dont i wish twas me said the scullerymaid  yes twas as neat a bit of stitching as ever i heard of continued the clerk with a fixed eye as if he were watching the process from a distance not a soul knew anything about it and my wife is the only one in our parish who knows it yet miss hinton came back from the wedden went to mr manston puffed herself out large and said she was mrs bollens but that if he wished she had no objection to keep on the house till the regular time of giving notice had expired or till he could get another tenant  just like her independence said the cook  well independent or no shes mrs bollens now ah i shall never forget once when i went by farmer bollenss gardenyears ago nowyears when he was taking up ashleaf taties a merry feller i was at that time a very merry fellerfor twas before i took holy orders and it didnt prick my conscience as twould now farmer says i little taties seem to turn out small this year dont em o no crickett says he some be fairsized hes a dull manfarmer bollens ishe always was however thats neither here nor there hes amarried to a sharp woman and if i dont make a mistake shell bring him a pretty good family gie her time  well it dont matter theres a

hintons reason for chosen yesterday to sicknessorhealthit your young miss and that one had crossed one anothers path in regard to young master springrove and i expect that when addy hinton found miss graye wasnt caren to have en she thought shed be beforehand with her old enemy in marrying somebody else too thats maids logic all over and maids malice likewise  women who are bad enough to divide against themselves under a mans partiality are good enough to instantly unite in a common cause against his attack ill just tell you one thing then said the cook shaking out her words to the time of a whisk she was beating eggs with whatever maids logic is and maids malice too if cytherea graye even now knows that young springrove is free again shell fling over the steward as soon as look at him  no no not now the coachman broke in like a moderator theres honour in that maid if ever there was in one no miss hintons tricks in her shell stick to manston  pifh  dont let a word be said till the wedden is over for heavens sake the clerk continued miss aldclyffe would fairly hang and quarter me if my news broke off that there wedden at a last minute like this  then you had better get your wife to bolt you in the closet for an hour or two for youll chatter it yourself to the whole boiling parish if she dont tis a poor womanly feller  you shouldnt ha begun it clerk i knew how twould be said the gardener soothingly in a whisper to the clerks mangled remains  the clerk turned and smiled at the fire and warmed his other hand  3 noon  the weather gave way in halfanhour there began a rapid thaw by ten oclock the roads though still dangerous were practicable to the extent of the halfmile required by the people of knapwater park one mass of heavy leaden cloud spread over the whole sky the air began to feel damp and mild out of doors though still cold and frosty within  they reached the church and passed up the nave the deepcoloured glass of the narrow windows rendering the gloom of the morning almost night itself inside the building then the ceremony began the only warmth or spirit imported into it came from the bridegroom who retained a vigorouseven spenserianbridalmood throughout the morning  cytherea was as firm as he at this critical moment but as cold as the air surrounding her the few persons forming the weddingparty were constrained in movement and tone and from the nave of the church came occasional coughs emitted by those who in spite of the weather had assembled to see the termination of cythereas existence as a single woman many poor people loved her they pitied her success why they could not tell except that it was because she seemed to stand more like a statue than cytherea graye  yet she was prettily and carefully dressed a strange contradiction in a mans idea of thingsa saddening perplexing contradiction are there any points in which a difference of sex amounts to a difference of nature then this is surely one not so much as it is commonly put in regard to the amount of consideration given but in the conception of the thing considered a man emasculated by coxcombry may spend more time upon the arrangement of his clothes than any woman but even then there is no fetichism in his idea of themthey are still only a covering he uses for a time but here was cytherea in the bottom of her heart almost indifferent to life yet possessing an instinct with which her heart had nothing to do the instinct to be particularly regardful of those sorry trifles her robe her flowers her veil and her gloves  the irrevocable words were soon spokenthe indelible writing soon writtenand they came out of the vestry candles had been necessary here to enable them to sign their names and on their return to the church the light from the candles streamed from the small open door and across the chancel to a black chestnut screen on the south side dividing it from a small chapel or chantry erected for the souls peace of some aldclyffe of the past through the openwork of this screen could now be seen illuminated inside the chantry the reclining figures of crosslegged knights damp and green with age and above them a huge classic monument also inscribed to the aldclyffe family heavily sculptured in cadaverous marble  leaning herealmost hanging to the monumentwas edward springrove or his spirit  the weak daylight would never have revealed him shaded as he was by the screen but the unexpected rays of candlelight in the front showed him forth in startling relief to any and all of those whose eyes wandered in that direction the sight was a sad onesad beyond all description his eyes were wild their orbits leaden his face was of a sickly paleness his hair dry and disordered his lips parted as if he could get no breath his figure was spectrethin his actions seemed beyond his own control  manston did not see him cytherea did the healing effect upon her heart of a years silencea year and a halfs separationwas undone in an instant one of those strange revivals of passion by mere sightcommoner in women than in men and in oppressed women commonest of allhad taken place in herso transcendently that even to herself it seemed more like a new creation than a revival  marrying for a homewhat a mockery it was  it may be said that the means most potent for rekindling old love in a maidens heart are to see her lover in laughter and good spirits in her despite when the breach has been owing to a slight from herself when owing to a slight from him to see him suffering for his own fault if he is happy in a clear conscience she blames him if he is miserable because deeply to blame she blames herself the latter was cythereas case now  first an agony of face told of the suppressed misery within her which presently could be suppressed no longer when they were coming out of the porch there broke from her in a low plaintive scream the words hes dyingdying o god save us she began to sink down and would have fallen had not manston caught her the chief bridesmaid applied her vinaigrette  what did she say inquired manston  owen was the only one to whom the words were intelligible and he was far too deeply impressed or rather alarmed to reply she did not faint and soon began to recover her selfcommand owen took advantage of the hindrance to step back to where the apparition had been seen he was enraged with springrove for what he considered an unwarrantable intrusion  but edward was not in the chantry as he had come so he had gone nobody could tell how or whither  4 afternoon  it might almost have been believed that a transmutation had taken place in cythereas idiosyncrasy that her moral nature had fled  the weddingparty returned to the house as soon as he could find an opportunity owen took his sister aside to speak privately with her on what had happened the expression of her face was hard wild and unrealan expression he had never seen there before and it disturbed him he spoke to her severely and sadly  cytherea he said i know the cause of this emotion of yours but remember this there was no excuse for it you should have been woman enough to control yourself remember whose wife you are and dont think anything more of a meanspirited fellow like springrove he had no business to come there as he did you are altogether wrong cytherea and i am vexed with you more than i can sayvery vexed  say ashamed of me at once she bitterly answered  i am ashamed of you he retorted angrily the mood has not left you yet then  owen she said and paused her lip trembled her eye told of sensations too deep for tears no owen it has not left me and i will be honest i own now to you without any disguise of words what last night i did not own to myself because i hardly knew of it i love edward springrove with all my strength and heart and soul you call me a wanton for it dont you i dont care i have gone beyond caring for anything she looked stonily into his face and made the speech calmly  well poor cytherea dont talk like that he said alarmed at her manner  i thought that i did not love him at all she went on hysterically a year and a half had passed since we met i could go by the gate of his garden without thinking of himlook at his seat in church and not care but i saw him this morningdying because he loves me soi know it is that can i help loving him too no i cannot and i will love him and i dont care we have been separated somehow by some contrivancei know we have o if i could only die  he held her in his arms many a woman has gone to ruin herself he said and brought those who love her into disgrace by acting upon such impulses as possess you now i have a reputation to lose as well as you it seems that do what i will by way of remedying the stains which fell upon us it is all doomed to be undone again his voice grew husky as he made the reply  the right and only effective chord had been touched since she had seen edward she had thought only of herself and him owenher namepositionfuturehad been as if they did not exist  i wont give way and become a disgrace to you at any rate she said  besides your duty to society and those about you requires that you should live with at any rate all the appearance of a good wife and try to love your husband  yesmy duty to society she murmured but ah owen it is difficult to adjust our outer and inner life with perfect honesty to all though it may be right to care more for the benefit of the many than for the indulgence of your own single self when you consider that the many and duty to them only exist to you through your own existence what can be said what do our own acquaintances care about us not much i think of mine mine will now do they learn all the wicked frailty of my heart in this affair look at me smile sickly and condemn me and perhaps far in time to come when i am dead and gone some others accent or some others song or thought like an old one of mine will carry them back to what i used to say and hurt their hearts a little that they blamed me so soon and they will pause just for an instant and give a sigh to me and think poor girl believing they do great justice to my memory by this but they will never never realize that it was my single opportunity of existence as well as of doing my duty which they are regarding they will not feel that what to them is but a thought easily held in those two words of pity poor girl was a whole life to me as full of hours minutes and peculiar minutes of hopes and dreads smiles whisperings tears as theirs that it was my world what is to them their world and they in that life of mine however much i cared for them only as the thought i seem to them to be nobody can enter into anothers nature truly thats what is so grievous  well it cannot be helped said owen  but we must not stay here she continued starting up and going we shall be missed ill do my best oweni will indeed  it had been decided that on account of the wretched state of the roads the newlymarried pair should not drive to the station till the latest hour in the afternoon at which they could get a train to take them to southampton their destination that night by a reasonable time in the evening they intended the next morning to cross to havre and thence to parisa place cytherea had never visitedfor their wedding tour  the afternoon drew on the packing was done cytherea was so restless that she could stay still nowhere miss aldclyffe who though she took little part in the days proceedings was as it were instinctively conscious of all their movements put down her charges agitation for once as the natural result of the novel event and manston himself was as indulgent as could be wished  at length cytherea wandered alone into the conservatory when in it she thought she would run across to the hothouse in the outer garden having in her heart a whimsical desire that she should also like to take a last look at the familiar flowers and luxuriant leaves collected there she pulled on a pair of overshoes and thither she went not a soul was in or around the place the gardener was making merry on manstons and her account  the happiness that a generous spirit derives from the belief that it exists in others is often greater than the primary happiness itself the gardener thought how happy they are and the thought made him happier than they  coming out of the forcinghouse again she was on the point of returning indoors when a feeling that these moments of solitude would be her last of freedom induced her to prolong them a little and she stood still unheeding the wintry aspect of the curlyleaved plants the strawcovered beds and the bare fruittrees around her the garden no part of which was visible from the house sloped down to a narrow river at the foot dividing it from the meadows without  a man was lingering along the public path on the other side of the river she fancied she knew the form her resolutions taken in the presence of owen did not fail her now she hoped and prayed that it might not be one who had stolen her heart away and still kept it why should he have reappeared at all when he had declared that he went out of her sight for ever  she hastily hid herself in the lowest corner of the garden close to the river a large dead tree thickly robed in ivy had been considerably depressed by its icy load of the morning and hung low over the stream which here ran slow and deep the tree screened her from the eyes of any passer on the other side  she waited timidly and her timidity increased she would not allow herself to see himshe would hear him pass and then look to see if it had been edward  but before she heard anything she became aware of an object reflected in the water from under the tree which hung over the river in such a way that though hiding the actual path and objects upon it it permitted their reflected images to pass beneath its boughs the reflected form was that of the man she had seen further off but being inverted she could not definitely characterize him  he was looking at the upper windows of the houseat herswas it edward indeed if so he was probably thinking he would like to say one parting word he came closer gazed into the stream and walked very slowly she was almost certain that it was edward she kept more safely hidden conscience told her that she ought not to see him but she suddenly asked herself a question can it be possible that he sees my reflected image as i see his of course he does  he was looking at her in the water  she could not help herself now she stepped forward just as he emerged from the other side of the tree and appeared erect before her it was edward springrovetill the inverted vision met his eye dreaming no more of seeing his cytherea there than of seeing the dead themselves  cytherea  mr springrove she returned in a low voice across the stream  he was the first to speak again  since we have met i want to tell you something before we become quite as strangers to each other  nonot nowi did not mean to speakit is not right edward she spoke hurriedly and turned away from him beating the air with her hand  not one common word of explanation he implored dont think i am bad enough to try to lead you astray well goit is better  their eyes met again she was nearly choked o how she longedand dreadedto hear his explanation  what is it she said desperately  it is that i did not come to the church this morning in order to distress you i did not cytherea it was to try to speak to you before you weremarried  he stepped closer and went on you know what has taken place surely you domy cousin is married and i am free  marriedand not to you cytherea faltered in a weak whisper  yes she was married yesterday a rich man had appeared and she jilted me she said she never would have jilted a stranger but that by jilting me she only exercised the right everybody has of snubbing their own relations but thats nothing now i came to you to ask once more if but i was too late  but edward whats that whats that she cried in an agony of reproach why did you leave me to return to her why did you write me that cruel cruel letter that nearly killed me  cytherea why you had grown to lovelikemr manston and how could you be anything to meor care for me surely i acted naturally  o nonever i loved youonly younot himalways youtill lately i try to love him now  but that cant be correct miss aldclyffe told me that you wanted to hear no more of meproved it to me said edward  never she couldnt  she did cytherea and she sent me a lettera loveletter you wrote to mr manston  a loveletter i wrote  yes a loveletteryou could not meet him just then you said you were sorry but the emotion you had felt with him made you forgetful of realities  the strife of thought in the unhappy girl who listened to this distortion of her meaning could find no vent in words and then there followed the slow revelation in return bringing with it all the misery of an explanation which comes too late the question whether miss aldclyffe were schemer or dupe was almost passed over by cytherea under the immediate oppressiveness of her despair in the sense that her position was irretrievable  not so springrove he saw through all the cunning halfmisrepresentationsworse than downright lieswhich had just been sufficient to turn the scale both with him and with her and from the bottom of his soul he cursed the woman and man who had brought all this agony upon him and his love but he could not add more misery to the future of the poor child by revealing too much the whole scheme she should never know  i was indifferent to my own future edward said and was urged to promise adherence to my engagement with my cousin adelaide by miss aldclyffe now you are married i cannot tell you how but it was on account of my father being forbidden to think of you what did i care about anything my new thought that you still loved me was first raised by what my father said in the letter announcing my cousins marriage he said that although you were to be married on old christmas daythat is tomorrowhe had noticed your appearance with pity he thought you loved me still it was enough for mei came down by the earliest morning train thinking i could see you some time today the day as i thought before your marriage hoping but hardly daring to hope that you might be induced to marry me i hurried from the station when i reached the village i saw idlers about the church and the private gate leading to the house open i ran into the church by the small door and saw you come out of the vestry i was too late i have now told you i was compelled to tell you o my lost darling now i shall live contentor die content  i am to blame edward i am she said mournfully i was taught to dread pauperism my nights were made sleepless there was continually reiterated in my ears till i believed it       the world and its ways have a certain worth        and to press a point where these oppose        were a simple policy  but i will say nothing about who influencedwho persuaded the act is mine after all edward i married to escape dependence for my bread upon the whim of miss aldclyffe or others like her it was clearly represented to me that dependence is bearable if we have another place which we can call home but to be a dependent and to have no other spot for the heart to anchor upono it is mournful and harassing but that without which all persuasion would have been as air was added by my miserable conviction that you were false that did it that turned me you were to be considered as nobody to me and mr manston was invariably kind well the deed is donei must abide by it i shall never let him know that i do not love himnever if things had only remained as they seemed to be if you had really forgotten me and married another woman i could have borne it better i wish i did not know the truth as i know it now but our life what is it let us be brave edward and live out our few remaining years with dignity they will not be long o i hope they will not be long now goodbye goodbye  i wish i could be near and touch you once just once said springrove in a voice which he vainly endeavoured to keep firm and clear  they looked at the river then into it a shoal of minnows was floating over the sandy bottom like the black dashes on miniver though narrow the stream was deep and there was no bridge  cytherea reach out your hand that i may just touch it with mine  she stepped to the brink and stretched out her hand and fingers towards his but not into them the river was too wide  never mind said cytherea her voice broken by agitation i must be going god bless and keep you my edward god bless you  i must touch you i must press your hand he said  they came nearnearernearer stilltheir fingers met there was a long firm clasp so close and still that each hand could feel the others pulse throbbing beside its own  my cytherea my stolen pet lamb  she glanced a mute farewell from her large perturbed eyes turned and ran up the garden without looking back all was over between them the river flowed on as quietly and obtusely as ever and the minnows gathered again in their favourite spot as if they had never been disturbed  nobody indoors guessed from her countenance and bearing that her heart was near to breaking with the intensity of the misery which gnawed there at these times a woman does not faint or weep or scream as she will in the moment of sudden shocks when lanced by a mental agony of such refined and special torture that it is indescribable by mens words she moves among her acquaintances much as before and contrives so to cast her actions in the old moulds that she is only considered to be rather duller than usual  5 halfpast two to five oclock pm  owen accompanied the newlymarried couple to the railwaystation and in his anxiety to see the last of his sister left the brougham and stood upon his crutches whilst the train was starting  when the husband and wife were about to enter the railwaycarriage they saw one of the porters looking frequently and furtively at them he was pale and apparently very ill  look at that poor sick man said cytherea compassionately surely he ought not to be here  hes been very queer today madam very queer another porter answered he do hardly hear when hes spoken to and d seem giddy or as if something was on his mind hes been like it for this month past but nothing so bad as he is today  poor thing  she could not resist an innate desire to do some just thing on this most deceitful and wretched day of her life going up to him she gave him money and told him to send to the old manorhouse for wine or whatever he wanted  the train moved off as the trembling man was murmuring his incoherent thanks owen waved his hand cytherea smiled back to him as if it were unknown to her that she wept all the while  owen was driven back to the old house but he could not rest in the lonely place his conscience began to reproach him for having forced on the marriage of his sister with a little too much peremptoriness taking up his crutches he went out of doors and wandered about the muddy roads with no object in view save that of getting rid of time  the clouds which had hung so low and densely during the day cleared from the west just now as the sun was setting calling forth a weakly twitter from a few small birds owen crawled down the path to the waterfall and lingered thereabout till the solitude of the place oppressed him when he turned back and into the road to the village he was sad he said to himself  if there is ever any meaning in those heavy feelings which are called presentimentsand i dont believe there isthere will be in mine today poor little cytherea  at that moment the last low rays of the sun touched the head and shoulders of a man who was approaching and showed him up to owens view it was old mr springrove they had grown familiar with each other by reason of owens visits to knapwater during the past year the farmer inquired how owens foot was progressing and was glad to see him so nimble again  how is your son said owen mechanically  he is at home sitting by the fire said the farmer in a sad voice this morning he slipped indoors from god knows where and there he sits and mopes and thinks and thinks and presses his head so hard that i cant help feeling for him  is he married said owen cytherea had feared to tell him of the interview in the garden  no i cant quite understand how the matter rests ah edward too who started with such promise that he should now have become such a careless fellownot a month in one place there mr graye i know what it is mainly owing to if it hadnt been for that heart affair he might have donebut the less said about him the better i dont know what we should have done if miss aldclyffe had insisted upon the conditions of the leases your brotherinlaw the steward had a hand in making it light for us i know and i heartily thank him for it he ceased speaking and looked round at the sky  have you heard o whats happened he said suddenly i was just coming out to learn about it  i havent heard of anything  it is something very serious though i dont know what all i know is what i heard a man call out bynowthat it very much concerns somebody who lives in the parish  it seems singular enough even to minds who have no dim beliefs in adumbration and presentiment that at that moment not the shadow of a thought crossed owens mind that the somebody whom the matter concerned might be himself or any belonging to him the event about to transpire was as portentous to the woman whose welfare was more dear to him than his own as any short of death itself could possibly be and ever afterwards when he considered the effect of the knowledge the next halfhour conveyed to his brain even his practical good sense could not refrain from wonder that he should have walked toward the village after hearing those words of the farmer in so leisurely and unconcerned a way how unutterably mean must my intelligence have appeared to the eye of a foreseeing god he frequently said in aftertime columbus on the eve of his discovery of a world was not so contemptibly unaware  after a few additional words of commonplace the farmer left him and as has been said owen proceeded slowly and indifferently towards the village  the labouring men had just left work and passed the park gate which opened into the street as owen came down towards it they went along in a drift earnestly talking and were finally about to turn in at their respective doorways but upon seeing him they looked significantly at one another and paused he came into the road on that side of the villagegreen which was opposite the row of cottages and turned round to the right when owen turned all eyes turned one or two men went hurriedly indoors and afterwards appeared at the doorstep with their wives who also contemplated him talking as they looked they seemed uncertain how to act in some matter  if they want me surely they will call me he thought wondering more and more he could no longer doubt that he was connected with the subject of their discourse  the first who approached him was a boy  what has occurred said owen  o a man ha got crazyreligious and sent for the pason  is that all  yes sir he wished he was dead he said and hes almost out of his mind wi wishen it so much that was before mr raunham came  who is he said owen  joseph chinney one of the railwayporters he used to be nightporter  ahthe man who was ill this afternoon by the way he was told to come to the old house for something but he hasnt been but has anything else happenedanything that concerns the wedding today  no sir  concluding that the connection which had seemed to be traced between himself and the event must in some way have arisen from cythereas friendliness towards the man owen turned about and went homewards in a much quieter frame of mindyet scarcely satisfied with the solution the route he had chosen led through the dairyyard and he opened the gate  five minutes before this point of time edward springrove was looking over one of his fathers fields at an outlying hamlet of three or four cottages some mile and a half distant a turnpikegate was close by the gate of the field  the carrier to casterbridge came up as edward stepped into the road and jumped down from the van to pay toll he recognized springrove this is a pretty setto in your place sir he said you dont know about it i suppose  what said springrove  the carrier paid his dues came up to edward and spoke ten words in a confidential whisper then sprang upon the shafts of his vehicle gave a clinching nod of significance to springrove and rattled away  edward turned pale with the intelligence his first thought was bring her home  the nextdid owen graye know what had been discovered he probably did by that time but no risks of probability must be run by a woman he loved dearer than all the world besides he would at any rate make perfectly sure that her brother was in possession of the knowledge by telling it him with his own lips  off he ran in the direction of the old manorhouse  the path was across arable land and was ploughed up with the rest of the field every autumn after which it was trodden out afresh the thaw had so loosened the soft earth that lumps of stiff mud were lifted by his feet at every leap he took and flung against him by his rapid motion as it were doggedly impeding him and increasing tenfold the customary effort of running  but he ran onuphill and downhill the same pace alikelike the shadow of a cloud his nearest direction too like owens was through the dairybarton and as owen entered it he saw the figure of edward rapidly descending the opposite hill at a distance of two or three hundred yards owen advanced amid the cows  the dairyman who had hitherto been talking loudly on some absorbing subject to the maids and men milking around him turned his face towards the head of the cow when owen passed and ceased speaking  owen approached him and said  a singular thing has happened i hear the man is not insane i suppose  not hehes sensible enough said the dairyman and paused he was a man noisy with his associatesstolid and taciturn with strangers  is it true that he is chinney the railwayporter  thats the man sir the maids and men sitting under the cows were all attentively listening to this discourse milking irregularly and softly directing the jets against the sides of the pail  owen could contain himself no longer much as his mind dreaded anything of the nature of ridicule the people all seem to look at me as if something seriously concerned me is it this stupid matter or what is it  surely sir you know better than anybody else if such a strange thing concerns you  what strange thing  dont you know his confessing to parson raunham  what did he confess tell me  if you really hant heard tis this he was as usual on duty at the station on the night of the fire last year otherwise he wouldnt ha known it  known what for gods sake tell man  but at this instant the two opposite gates of the dairyyard one on the east the other on the west side slammed almost simultaneously  the rector from one springrove from the other came striding across the barton  edward was nearest and spoke first he said in a low voice your sister is not legally married his first wife is still living how it comes out i dont know  o here you are at last mr graye thank heaven said the rector breathlessly i have been to the old house and then to miss aldclyffes looking for yousomething very extraordinary he beckoned to owen afterwards included springrove in his glance and the three stepped aside together  a porter at the station he was a curious nervous man he had been in a strange state all day but he wouldnt go home your sister was kind to him it seems this afternoon when she and her husband had gone he went on with his work shifting luggagevans well he got in the way as if he were quite lost to what was going on and they sent him home at last then he wished to see me i went directly there was something on his mind he said and told it about the time when the fire of last november twelvemonth was got under whilst he was by himself in the porters room almost asleep somebody came to the station and tried to open the door he went out and found the person to be the lady he had accompanied to carriford earlier in the evening mrs manston she asked when would be another train to london the first the next morning he told her was at a quarterpast six oclock from budmouth but that it was express and didnt stop at carriford roadit didnt stop till it got to anglebury how far is it to anglebury she said he told her and she thanked him and went away up the line in a short time she ran back and took out her purse dont on any account say a word in the village or anywhere that i have been here or a single breath about meim ashamed ever to have come he promised she took out two sovereigns swear it on the testament in the waitingroom she said and ill pay you these he got the book took an oath upon it received the money and she left him he was off duty at halfpast five he has kept silence all through the intervening time till now but lately the knowledge he possessed weighed heavily upon his conscience and weak mind yet the nearer came the weddingday the more he feared to tell the actual marriage filled him with remorse he says your sisters kindness afterwards was like a knife going through his heart he thought he had ruined her  but whatever can be done why didnt he speak sooner cried owen  he actually called at my house twice yesterday the rector continued resolved it seems to unburden his mind i was out both timeshe left no message and they say he looked relieved that his object was defeated then he says he resolved to come to you at the old house last nightstarted reached the door and dreaded to knockand then went home again  here will be a tale for the newsmongers of the county said owen bitterly the idea of his not opening his mouth soonerthe criminality of the thing  ah thats the inconsistency of a weak nature but now that it is put to us in this way how much more probable it seems that she should have escaped than have been burnt  you will of course go straight to mr manston and ask him what it all means edward interrupted  of course i shall manston has no right to carry off my sister unless hes her husband said owen i shall go and separate them  certainly you will said the rector  wheres the man  in his cottage  tis no use going to him either i must go off at once and overtake themlay the case before manston and ask him for additional and certain proofs of his first wifes death an uptrain passes soon i think  where have they gone said edward  to parisas far as southampton this afternoon to proceed tomorrow morning  where in southampton  i really dont knowsome hotel i only have their paris address but i shall find them by making a few inquiries  the rector had in the meantime been taking out his pocketbook and now opened it at the first page whereon it was his custom every month to gum a small railway timetablecut from the local newspaper  the afternoon express is just gone he said holding open the page and the next train to southampton passes at ten minutes to six oclock now it wantslet me seefiveandforty minutes to that time mr graye my advice is that you come with me to the porters cottage where i will shortly write out the substance of what he has said and get him to sign it you will then have far better grounds for interfering between mr and mrs manston than if you went to them with a mere hearsay story  the suggestion seemed a good one yes there will be time before the train starts said owen  edward had been musing restlessly  let me go to southampton in your place on account of your lameness he said suddenly to graye  i am much obliged to you but i think i can scarcely accept the offer returned owen coldly mr manston is an honourable man and i had much better see him myself  there is no doubt said mr raunham that the death of his wife was fully believed in by himself  none whatever said owen and the news must be broken to him and the question of other proofs asked in a friendly way it would not do for mr springrove to appear in the case at all he still spoke rather coldly the recollection of the attachment between his sister and edward was not a pleasant one to him  you will never find them said edward you have never been to southampton and i know every house there  that makes little difference said the rector he will have a cab certainly mr graye is the proper man to go on the errand  stay ill telegraph to ask them to meet me when i arrive at the terminus said owen that is if their train has not already arrived  mr raunham pulled out his pocketbook again the twothirty train reached southampton a quarter of an hour ago he said  it was too late to catch them at the station nevertheless the rector suggested that it would be worth while to direct a message to all the respectable hotels in southampton on the chance of its finding them and thus saving a deal of personal labour to owen in searching about the place  ill go and telegraph whilst you return to the man said edwardan offer which was accepted graye and the rector then turned off in the direction of the porters cottage  edward to despatch the message at once hurriedly followed the road towards the station still restlessly thinking all owens proceedings were based on the assumption natural under the circumstances of manstons good faith and that he would readily acquiesce in any arrangement which should clear up the mystery but thought edward supposeand heaven forgive me i cannot help supposing itthat manston is not that honourable man what will a young and inexperienced fellow like owen do will he not be hoodwinked by some specious story or another framed to last till manston gets tired of poor cytherea and then the disclosure of the truth will ruin and blacken both their futures irremediably  however he proceeded to execute his commission this he put in the form of a simple request from owen to manston that manston would come to the southampton platform and wait for owens arrival as he valued his reputation the message was directed as the rector had suggested edward guaranteeing to the clerk who sent it off that every expense connected with the search would be paid  no sooner had the telegram been despatched than his heart sank within him at the want of foresight shown in sending it had manston all the time a knowledge that his first wife lived the telegram would be a forewarning which might enable him to defeat owen still more signally  whilst the machine was still giving off its multitudinous series of raps edward heard a powerful rush under the shed outside followed by a long sonorous creak it was a train of some sort stealing softly into the station and it was an uptrain there was the ring of a bell it was certainly a passenger train  yet the bookingoffice window was closed  ho ho john seventeen minutes after time and only three stations up the line the incline again the voice was the stationmasters and the reply seemed to come from the guard  yes the other side of the cutting the thaw has made it all in a perfect cloud of fog and the rails are as slippery as glass we had to bring them through the cutting at twice  anybody else for the fourfortyfive express the voice continued the few passengers having crossed over to the other side long before this time had taken their places at once  a conviction suddenly broke in upon edwards mind then a wish overwhelmed him the convictionas startling as it was suddenwas that manston was a villain who at some earlier time had discovered that his wife lived and had bribed her to keep out of sight that he might possess cytherea the wish wasto proceed at once by this very train that was starting find manston before he would expect from the words of the telegram if he got it that anybody from carriford could be with himcharge him boldly with the crime and trust to his consequent confusion if he were guilty for a solution of the extraordinary riddle and the release of cytherea  the ticketoffice had been locked up at the expiration of the time at which the train was due rushing out as the guard blew his whistle edward opened the door of a carriage and leapt in the train moved along and he was soon out of sight  springrove had long since passed that peculiar line which lies across the course of falling in loveif indeed it may not be called the initial itself of the complete passiona longing to cherish when the woman is shifted in a mans mind from the region of mere admiration to the region of warm fellowship at this assumption of her nature she changes to him in tone hue and expression all about the loved one that said she before says we now eyes that were to be subdued become eyes to be feared for a brain that was to be probed by cynicism becomes a brain that is to be tenderly assisted feet that were to be tested in the dance become feet that are not to be distressed the oncecriticized accent manner and dress become the clients of a special pleader  6 five to eight oclock pm  now that he was fairly on the track and had begun to cool down edward remembered that he had nothing to showno legal authority whatever to question manston or interfere between him and cytherea as husband and wife he now saw the wisdom of the rector in obtaining a signed confession from the porter the document would not be a deathbed confessionperhaps not worth anything legallybut it would be held by owen and he alone as cythereas natural guardian could separate them on the mere ground of an unproved probability or what might perhaps be called the hallucination of an idiot edward himself however was as firmly convinced as the rector had been of the truth of the mans story and paced backward and forward the solitary compartment as the train wound through the dark heathery plains the mazy woods and moaning coppices as resolved as ever to pounce on manston and charge him with the crime during the critical interval between the reception of the telegram and the hour at which owens train would arrivetrusting to circumstances for what he should say and do afterwards but making up his mind to be a ready second to owen in any emergency that might arise  at thirtythree minutes past seven he stood on the platform of the station at southamptona clear hour before the train containing owen could possibly arrive  making a few inquiries here but too impatient to pursue his investigation carefully and inductively he went into the town  at the expiration of another halfhour he had visited seven hotels and inns large and small asking the same questions at each and always receiving the same replynobody of that name or answering to that description had been there a boy from the telegraphoffice had called asking for the same persons if they recollected rightly  he reflected awhile struck again by a painful thought that they might possibly have decided to cross the channel by the nightboat then he hastened off to another quarter of the town to pursue his inquiries among hotels of the more oldfashioned and quiet class his stained and weary appearance obtained for him but a modicum of civility wherever he went which made his task yet more difficult he called at three several houses in this neighbourhood with the same result as before he entered the door of the fourth house whilst the clock of the nearest church was striking eight  have a tall gentleman named manston and a young wife arrived here this evening he asked again in words which had grown odd to his ears from very familiarity  a newmarried couple did you say  they are though i didnt say so  they have taken a sittingroom and bedroom number thirteen  are they indoors  i dont know eliza  yes mm  see if number thirteen is inthat gentleman and his wife  yes mm  has any telegram come for them said edward when the maid had gone on her errand  nonothing that i know of  somebody did come and ask if a mr and mrs masters or some such name were here this evening said another voice from the back of the barparlour  and did they get the message  of course they did notthey were not herethey didnt come till halfanhour after that the man who made inquiries left no message i told them when they came that they or a name something like theirs had been asked for but they didnt seem to understand why it should be and so the matter dropped  the chambermaid came back the gentleman is not in but the lady is who shall i say  nobody said edward for it now became necessary to reflect upon his method of proceeding his object in finding their whereaboutsapart from the wish to assist owenhad been to see manston ask him flatly for an explanation and confirm the request of the message in the presence of cythereaso as to prevent the possibility of the stewards palming off a story upon cytherea or eluding her brother when he came but here were two important modifications of the expected condition of affairs the telegram had not been received and cytherea was in the house alone  he hesitated as to the propriety of intruding upon her in manstons absence besides the women at the bottom of the stairs would see himhis intrusion would seem oddand manston might return at any moment he certainly might call and wait for manston with the accusation upon his tongue as he had intended but it was a doubtful course that idea had been based upon the assumption that cytherea was not married if the first wife were really dead after alland he felt sick at the thoughtcytherea as the stewards wife might in afteryearsperhaps at oncebe subjected to indignity and cruelty on account of an old lovers interference now  yes perhaps the announcement would come most properly and safely for her from her brother owen the time of whose arrival had almost expired  but on turning round he saw that the staircase and passage were quite deserted he and his errand had as completely died from the minds of the attendants as if they had never been there was absolutely nothing between him and cythereas presence reason was powerless now he must see herright or wrong fair or unfair to manstonoffensive to her brother or no his lips must be the first to tell the alarming story to her who loved her as he he went back lightly through the hall up the stairs two at a time and followed the corridor till he came to the door numbered thirteen  he knocked softly nobody answered  there was no time to lose if he would speak to cytherea before manston came he turned the handle of the door and looked in the lamp on the table burned low and showed writing materials open beside it the chief light came from the fire the direct rays of which were obscured by a sweet familiar outline of head and shouldersstill as precious to him as ever  7 a quarterpast eight oclock pm  there is an attitudeapproximatively called pensivein which the soul of a human being and especially of a woman dominates outwardly and expresses its presence so strongly that the intangible essence seems more apparent than the body itself this was cythereas expression now what old days and sunny eves at budmouth bay was she picturing her reverie had caused her not to notice his knock  cytherea he said softly  she let drop her hand and turned her head evidently thinking that her visitor could be no other than manston yet puzzled at the voice  there was no preface on springroves tongue he forgot his positionhersthat he had come to ask quietly if manston had other proofs of being a widowereverythingand jumped to a conclusion  you are not his wife cythereacome away he has a wife living he cried in an agitated whisper owen will be here directly  she started up recognized the tidings first the bearer of them afterwards not his wife o what is itwhatwho is living she awoke by degrees what must i do edward it is you why did you come where is owen  what has manston shown you in proof of the death of his other wife tell me quick  nothingwe have never spoken of the subject where is my brother owen i want him i want him  he is coming byandby come to the station to meet himdo implored springrove if mr manston comes he will keep you from me i am nobody he added bitterly feeling the reproach her words had faintly shadowed forth  mr manston is only gone out to post a letter he has just written she said and without being distinctly cognizant of the action she wildly looked for her bonnet and cloak and began putting them on but in the act of fastening them uttered a spasmodic cry  no ill not go out with you she said flinging the articles down again running to the door she flitted along the passage and downstairs  give me a private roomquite private she said breathlessly to some one below  number twelve is a single room madam and unoccupied said some tongue in astonishment  without waiting for any person to show her into it cytherea hurried upstairs again brushed through the corridor entered the room specified and closed the door edward heard her sob out  nobody but owen shall speak to menobody  he will be here directly said springrove close against the panel and then went towards the stairs he had seen her it was enough  he descended stepped into the street and hastened to meet owen at the railwaystation  as for the poor maiden who had received the news she knew not what to think she listened till the echo of edwards footsteps had died away then bowed her face upon the bed her sudden impulse had been to escape from sight her weariness after the unwonted strain mental and bodily which had been put upon her by the scenes she had passed through during the long day rendered her much more timid and shaken by her position than she would naturally have been she thought and thought of that single fact which had been told herthat the first mrs manston was still livingtill her brain seemed ready to burst its confinement with excess of throbbing it was only natural that she should by degrees be unable to separate the discovery which was matter of fact from the suspicion of treachery on her husbands part which was only matter of inference and thus there arose in her a personal fear of him  suppose he should come in now and seize me this at first mere frenzied supposition grew by degrees to a definite horror of his presence and especially of his intense gaze thus she raised herself to a heat of excitement which was none the less real for being vented in no cry of any kind no she could not meet manstons eye alone she would only see him in her brothers company  almost delirious with this idea she ran and locked the door to prevent all possibility of her intentions being nullified or a look or word being flung at her by anybody whilst she knew not what she was  8 halfpast eight oclock pm  then cytherea felt her way amid the darkness of the room till she came to the head of the bed where she searched for the bellrope and gave it a pull her summons was speedily answered by the landlady herself whose curiosity to know the meaning of these strange proceedings knew no bounds the landlady attempted to turn the handle of the door cytherea kept the door locked please tell mr manston when he comes that i am ill she said from the inside and that i cannot see him  certainly i will madam said the landlady wont you have a fire  no thank you  nor a light  i dont want one thank you  nor anything  nothing  the landlady withdrew thinking her visitor half insane  manston came in about five minutes later and went at once up to the sittingroom fully expecting to find his wife there he looked round rang and was told the words cytherea had said that she was too ill to be seen  she is in number twelve room added the maid  manston was alarmed and knocked at the door cytherea  i am unwell i cannot see you she said  are you seriously ill dearest surely not  no not seriously  let me come in i will get a doctor  no he cant see me either  she wont open the door sir not to nobody at all said the chambermaid with wonderwaiting eyes  hold your tongue and be off said manston with a snap  the maid vanished  come cytherea this is foolishindeed it isnot opening the door i cannot comprehend what can be the matter with you nor can a doctor either unless he sees you  her voice had trembled more and more at each answer she gave but nothing could induce her to come out and confront him hating scenes manston went back to the sittingroom greatly irritated and perplexed  and there cytherea from the adjoining room could hear him pacing up and down she thought suppose he insists upon seeing mehe probably mayand will burst open the door this notion increased and she sank into a corner in a halfsomnolent state but with ears alive to the slightest sound reason could not overthrow the delirious fancy that outside her door stood manston and all the people in the hotel waiting to laugh her to scorn  9 halfpast eight to eleven pm  in the meantime springrove was pacing up and down the arrival platform of the railwaystation halfpast eight oclockthe time at which owens train was duehad come and passed but no train appeared  when will the eightthirty train be in he asked of a man who was sweeping the mud from the steps  she is not expected yet this hour  how is that  christmastime you see tis always so people are running about to see their friends the trains have been like it ever since christmas eve and will be for another week yet  edward again went on walking and waiting under the draughty roof he found it utterly impossible to leave the spot his mind was so intent upon the importance of meeting with owen and informing him of cythereas whereabouts that he could not but fancy owen might leave the station unobserved if he turned his back and become lost to him in the streets of the town  the hour expired ten oclock struck when will the train be in said edward to the telegraph clerk  in fiveandthirty minutes shes now at l they have extra passengers and the rails are bad today  at last at a quarter to eleven the train came in  the first to alight from it was owen looking pale and cold he casually glanced round upon the nearly deserted platform and was hurrying to the outlet when his eyes fell upon edward at sight of his friend he was quite bewildered and could not speak  here i am mr graye said edward cheerfully i have seen cytherea and she has been waiting for you these two or three hours  owen took edwards hand pressed it and looked at him in silence such was the concentration of his mind that not till many minutes after did he think of inquiring how springrove had contrived to be there before him  10 eleven oclock pm  on their arrival at the door of the hotel it was arranged between springrove and graye that the latter only should enter edward waiting outside owen had remembered continually what his friend had frequently overlooked that there was yet a possibility of his sister being manstons wife and the recollection taught him to avoid any rashness in his proceedings which might lead to bitterness hereafter  entering the room he found manston sitting in the chair which had been occupied by cytherea on edwards visit three hours earlier before owen had spoken manston arose and stepping past him closed the door his face appeared harassedmuch more troubled than the slight circumstance which had as yet come to his knowledge seemed to account for  manston could form no reason for owens presence but intuitively linked it with cythereas seclusion altogether this is most unseemly he said whatever it may mean  dont think there is meant anything unfriendly by my coming here said owen earnestly but listen to this and think if i could do otherwise than come  he took from his pocket the confession of chinney the porter as hastily written out by the vicar and read it aloud the aspects of manstons face whilst he listened to the opening words were strange dark and mysterious enough to have justified suspicions that no deceit could be too complicated for the possessor of such impulses had there not overridden them all as the reading went on a new and irrepressible expressionone unmistakably honest it was that of unqualified amazement in the stewards mind at the news he heard owen looked up and saw it the sight only confirmed him in the belief he had held throughout in antagonism to edwards suspicions  there could no longer be a shadow of doubt that if the first mrs manston lived her husband was ignorant of the fact what he could have feared by his ghastly look at first and now have ceased to fear it was quite futile to conjecture  now i do not for a moment doubt your complete ignorance of the whole matter you cannot suppose for an instant that i do said owen when he had finished reading but is it not best for both that cytherea should come back with me till the matter is cleared up in fact under the circumstances no other course is left open to me than to request it  whatever manstons original feelings had been all in him now gave way to irritation and irritation to rage he paced up and down the room till he had mastered it then said in ordinary tones  certainly i know no more than you and others knowit was a gratuitous unpleasantness in you to say you did not doubt me why should you or anybody have doubted me  well where is my sister said owen  locked in the next room  his own answer reminded manston that cytherea must by some inscrutable means have had an inkling of the event  owen had gone to the door of cythereas room  cytherea darlingtis owen he said outside the door a rustling of clothes soft footsteps and a voice saying from the inside is it really you owenis it really  it is  o will you take care of me  always  she unlocked the door and retreated again manston came forward from the other room with a candle in his hand as owen pushed open the door  her frightened eyes were unnaturally large and shone like stars in the darkness of the background as the light fell upon them she leapt up to owen in one bound her small taper fingers extended like the leaves of a lupine then she clasped her cold and trembling hands round his neck and shivered  the sight of her again kindled all manstons passions into activity she shall not go with you he said firmly and stepping a pace or two closer unless you prove that she is not my wife and you cant do it  this is proof said owen holding up the paper  no proof at all said manston hotly tis not a deathbed confession and those are the only things of the kind held as good evidence  send for a lawyer owen returned and let him tell us the proper course to adopt  never mind the lawlet me go with owen cried cytherea still holding on to him you will let me go with him wont you sir she said turning appealingly to manston  well have it all right and square said manston with more quietness i have no objection to your brother sending for a lawyer if he wants to  it was getting on for twelve oclock but the proprietor of the hotel had not yet gone to bed on account of the mystery on the first floor which was an occurrence unusual in the quiet family lodging owen looked over the banisters and saw him standing in the hall it struck graye that the wisest course would be to take the landlord to a certain extent into their confidence appeal to his honour as a gentleman and so on in order to acquire the information he wanted and also to prevent the episode of the evening from becoming a public piece of news he called the landlord up to where they stood and told him the main facts of the story  the landlord was fortunately a quiet prejudiced man and a meditative smoker  i know the very man you want to seethe very man he said looking at the general features of the candleflame sharp as a needle and not overrich timms will put you all straight in no timetrust timms for that  hes in bed by this time for certain said owen  never mind thattimms knows me i know him hell oblige me as a personal favour wait here a bit perhaps too hes up at some party or anotherhes a nice jovial fellow sharp as a needle too mind you sharp as a needle too  he went downstairs put on his overcoat and left the house the three persons most concerned entering the room and standing motionless awkward and silent in the midst of it cytherea pictured to herself the long weary minutes she would have to stand there whilst a sleepy man could be prepared for consultation till the constraint between them seemed unendurable to hershe could never last out the time owen was annoyed that manston had not quietly arranged with him at once manston at owens homeliness of idea in proposing to send for an attorney as if he would be a touchstone of infallible proof  reflection was cut short by the approach of footsteps and in a few moments the proprietor of the hotel entered introducing his friend mr timms has not been in bed he said he had just returned from dining with a few friends so theres no trouble given to save time i explained the matter as we came along  it occurred to owen and manston both that they might get a misty exposition of the law from mr timms at that moment of concluding dinner with a few friends  as far as i can see said the lawyer yawning and turning his vision inward by main force it is quite a matter for private arrangement between the parties whoever the parties areat least at present i speak more as a father than as a lawyer it is true but let the young lady stay with her father or guardian safe out of shames way until the mystery is sifted whatever the mystery is should the evidence prove to be false or trumped up by anybody to get her away from you her husband you may sue them for the damages accruing from the delay  yes yes said manston who had completely recovered his selfpossession and commonsense let it all be settled by herself turning to cytherea he whispered so softly that owen did not hear the words  do you wish to go back with your brother dearest and leave me here miserable and lonely or will you stay with me your own husband  ill go back with owen  very well he relinquished his coaxing tone and went on sternly and remember this cytherea i am as innocent of deception in this thing as you are yourself do you believe me  i do she said  i had no shadow of suspicion that my first wife lived i dont think she does even now do you believe me  i believe you she said  and now goodevening he continued opening the door and politely intimating to the three men standing by that there was no further necessity for their remaining in his room in three days i shall claim her  the lawyer and the hotelkeeper retired first owen gathering up as much of his sisters clothing as lay about the room took her upon his arm and followed them edward to whom she owed everything who had been left standing in the street like a dog without a home was utterly forgotten owen paid the landlord and the lawyer for the trouble he had occasioned them looked to the packing and went to the door  a fly which somewhat unaccountably was seen lingering in front of the house was called up and cythereas luggage put upon it  do you know of any hotel near the station that is open for night arrivals owen inquired of the driver  a place has been bespoke for you sir at the white unicornand the gentleman wished me to give you this  bespoken by springrove who ordered the fly of course said owen to himself by the light of the streetlamp he read these lines hurriedly traced in pencil  i have gone home by the mailtrain it is better for all parties that i should be out of the way tell cytherea that i apologize for having caused her such unnecessary pain as it seems i didbut it cannot be helped now es  owen handed his sister into the vehicle and told the flyman to drive on  poor springrovei think we have served him rather badly he said to cytherea repeating the words of the note to her  a thrill of pleasure passed through her bosom as she listened to them they were the genuine reproach of a lover to his mistress the trifling coldness of her answer to him would have been noticed by no man who was only a friend but in entertaining that sweet thought she had forgotten herself and her position for the instant  was she still manstons wifethat was the terrible supposition and her future seemed still a possible misery to her for on account of the late jarring accident a life with manston which would otherwise have been only a sadness must become a burden of unutterable sorrow  then she thought of the misrepresentation and scandal that would ensue if she were no wife one cause for thankfulness accompanied the reflection edward knew the truth  they soon reached the quiet old inn which had been selected for them by the forethought of the man who loved her well here they installed themselves for the night arranging to go to budmouth by the first train the next day  at this hour edward springrove was fast approaching his native county on the wheels of the nightmail     xiv the events of five weeks  1 from the sixth to the thirteenth of january  manston had evidently resolved to do nothing in a hurry  this much was plain that his earnest desire and intention was to raise in cythereas bosom no feelings of permanent aversion to him the instant after the first burst of disappointment had escaped him in the hotel at southampton he had seen how far better it would be to lose her presence for a week than her respect for ever  she shall be mine i will claim the young thing yet he insisted and then he seemed to reason over methods for compassing that object which to all those who were in any degree acquainted with the recent event appeared the least likely of possible contingencies  he returned to knapwater late the next day and was preparing to call on miss aldclyffe when the conclusion forced itself upon him that nothing would be gained by such a step no every action of his should be done openlyeven religiously at least he called on the rector and stated this to be his resolve  certainly said mr raunham it is best to proceed candidly and fairly or undue suspicion may fall on you you should in my opinion take active steps at once  i will do the utmost that lies in my power to clear up the mystery and silence the hubbub of gossip that has been set going about me but what can i do they say that the man who comes first in the chain of inquiry is not to be foundi mean the porter  i am sorry to say that he is not when i returned from the station last night after seeing owen graye off i went again to the cottage where he has been lodging to get more intelligence as i thought he was not there he had gone out at dusk saying he would be back soon but he has not come back yet  i rather doubt if we shall see him again  had i known of this i would have done what in my flurry i did not think of doingset a watch upon him but why not advertise for your missing wife as a preliminary consulting your solicitor in the meantime  advertise ill think about it said manston lingering on the word as he pronounced it yes that seems a right thingquite a right thing  he went home and remained moodily indoors all the next day and the nextfor nearly a week in short then one evening at dusk he went out with an uncertain air as to the direction of his walk which resulted however in leading him again to the rectory  he saw mr raunham have you done anything yet the rector inquired  noi have not said manston absently but i am going to set about it he hesitated as if ashamed of some weakness he was about to betray my object in calling was to ask if you had heard any tidings from budmouth of mycytherea you used to speak of her as one you were interested in  there was at any rate real sadness in manstons tone now and the rector paused to weigh his words ere he replied  i have not heard directly from her he said gently but her brother has communicated with some people in the parish  the springroves i suppose said manston gloomily  yes and they tell me that she is very ill and i am sorry to say likely to be for some days  surely surely i must go and see her manston cried  i would advise you not to go said raunham but do this insteadbe as quick as you can in making a movement towards ascertaining the truth as regards the existence of your wife you see mr manston an outstep place like this is not like a city and there is nobody to busy himself for the good of the community whilst poor cytherea and her brother are socially too dependent to be able to make much stir in the matter which is a greater reason still why you should be disinterestedly prompt  the steward murmured an assent still there was the same indecisionnot the indecision of weaknessthe indecision of conscious perplexity  on manstons return from this interview at the rectory he passed the door of the rising sun inn finding he had no light for his cigar and it being threequarters of a mile to his residence in the park he entered the tavern to get one nobody was in the outer portion of the front room where manston stood but a space round the fire was screened off from the remainder and inside the high oak settle forming a part of the screen he heard voices conversing the speakers had not noticed his footsteps and continued their discourse  one of the two he recognized as a wellknown nightpoacher the man who had met him with tidings of his wifes death on the evening of the conflagration the other seemed to be a stranger following the same mode of life the conversation was carried on in the emphatic and confidential tone of men who are slightly intoxicated its subject being an unaccountable experience that one of them had had on the night of the fire  what the steward heard was enough and more than enough to lead him to forget or to renounce his motive in entering the effect upon him was strange and strong his first object seemed to be to escape from the house again without being seen or heard  having accomplished this he went in at the park gate and strode off under the trees to the old house there sitting down by the fire and burying himself in reflection he allowed the minutes to pass by unheeded first the candle burnt down in its socket and stunk he did not notice it then the fire went out he did not see it his feet grew cold still he thought on  it may be remarked that a lady a year and a quarter before this time had under the same conditionsan unrestricted mental absorptionshown nearly the same peculiarities as this man evinced now the lady was miss aldclyffe  it was halfpast twelve when manston moved as if he had come to a determination  the first thing he did the next morning was to call at knapwater house where he found that miss aldclyffe was not well enough to see him she had been ailing from slight internal haemorrhage ever since the confession of the porter chinney apparently not much aggrieved at the denial he shortly afterwards went to the railwaystation and took his departure for london leaving a letter for miss aldclyffe stating the reason of his journey thitherto recover traces of his missing wife  during the remainder of the week paragraphs appeared in the local and other newspapers drawing attention to the facts of this singular case the writers with scarcely an exception dwelt forcibly upon a feature which had at first escaped the observation of the villagers including mr raunhamthat if the announcement of the man chinney were true it seemed extremely probable that mrs manston left her watch and keys behind on purpose to blind people as to her escape and that therefore she would not now let herself be discovered unless a strong pressure were put upon her the writers added that the police were on the track of the porter who very possibly had absconded in the fear that his reticence was criminal and that mr manston the husband was with praiseworthy energy making every effort to clear the whole matter up  2 from the eighteenth to the end of january  five days from the time of his departure manston returned from london and liverpool looking very fatigued and thoughtful he explained to the rector and other of his acquaintance that all the inquiries he had made at his wifes old lodgings and his own had been totally barren of results  but he seemed inclined to push the affair to a clear conclusion now that he had commenced after the lapse of another day or two he proceeded to fulfil his promise to the rector and advertised for the missing woman in three of the london papers the advertisement was a carefully considered and even attractive effusion calculated to win the heart or at least the understanding of any woman who had a spark of her own nature left in her  there was no answer  three days later he repeated the experiment with the same result as before  i cannot try any further said manston speciously to the rector his sole auditor throughout the proceedings mr raunham ill tell you the truth plainly i dont love her i do love cytherea and the whole of this business of searching for the other woman goes altogether against me i hope to god i shall never see her again  but you will do your duty at least said mr raunham  i have done it said manston if ever a man on the face of this earth has done his duty towards an absent wife i have towards herliving or deadat least he added correcting himself since i have lived at knapwater i neglected her before that timei own that as i have owned it before  i should if i were you adopt other means to get tidings of her if advertising fails in spite of my feelings said the rector emphatically but at any rate try advertising once more theres a satisfaction in having made any attempt three several times  when manston had left the study the rector stood looking at the fire for a considerable length of time lost in profound reflection he went to his private diary and after many pauses which he varied only by dipping his pen letting it dry wiping it on his sleeve and then dipping it again he took the following note of events   january 25mr manston has just seen me for the third time on the subject of his lost wife there have been these peculiarities attending the three interviews  the first my visitor whilst expressing by words his great anxiety to do everything for her recovery showed plainly by his bearing that he was convinced he should never see her again  the second he had left off feigning anxiety to do rightly by his first wife and honestly asked after cythereas welfare  the third and most remarkable he seemed to have lost all consistency whilst expressing his love for cytherea which certainly is strong and evincing the usual indifference to the first mrs manstons fate he was unable to conceal the intensity of his eagerness for me to advise him to advertise again for her   a week after the second the third advertisement was inserted a paragraph was attached which stated that this would be the last time the announcement would appear  3 the first of february  at this the eleventh hour the postman brought a letter for manston directed in a womans hand  a bachelor friend of the stewards mr dickson by name who was somewhat of a chattererplenus rimarumand who boasted of an endless string of acquaintances had come over from casterbridge the preceding day by invitationan invitation which had been a pleasant surprise to dickson himself insomuch that manston as a rule voted him a bore almost to his face he had stayed over the night and was sitting at breakfast with his host when the important missive arrived  manston did not attempt to conceal the subject of the letter or the name of the writer first glancing the pages through he read aloud as follows   my husbandi implore your forgiveness  during the last thirteen months i have repeated to myself a hundred times that you should never discover what i voluntarily tell you now namely that i am alive and in perfect health  i have seen all your advertisements nothing but your persistence has won me round surely i thought he must love me still why else should he try to win back a woman who faithful unto death as she will be can in a social sense aid him towards acquiring nothingrather the reverse indeed  you yourself state my own mindthat the only grounds upon which we can meet and live together with a reasonable hope of happiness must be a mutual consent to bury in oblivion all past differences i heartily and willingly forget everythingand forgive everything you will do the same as your actions show  there will be plenty of opportunity for me to explain the few facts relating to my escape on the night of the fire i will only give the heads in this hurried note i was grieved at your not coming to fetch me more grieved at your absence from the station most of all by your absence from home on my journey to the inn i writhed under a passionate sense of wrong done me when i had been shown to my room i waited and hoped for you till the landlord had gone upstairs to bed i still found that you did not come and then i finally made up my mind to leave i had half undressed but i put on my things again forgetting my watch and i suppose dropping my keys though i am not sure where in my hurry and slipped out of the house the   well thats a rum story said mr dickson interrupting  whats a rum story said manston hastily and flushing in the face  forgetting her watch and dropping her keys in her hurry  i dont see anything particularly wonderful in it any woman might do such a thing  any woman might if escaping from fire or shipwreck or any such immediate danger but it seems incomprehensible to me that any woman in her senses who quietly decides to leave a house should be so forgetful  all that is required to reconcile your seeming with her facts is to assume that she was not in her senses for thats what she did plainly or how could the things have been found there besides shes truthful enough he spoke eagerly and peremptorily  yes yes i know that i merely meant that it seemed rather odd  o yes manston read on   and slipped out of the house the rubbishheap was burning up brightly but the thought that the house was in danger did not strike me i did not consider that it might be thatched  i idled in the lane behind the wood till the last downtrain had come in not being in a mood to face strangers whilst i was there the fire broke out and this perplexed me still more however i was still determined not to stay in the place i went to the railwaystation which was now quiet and inquired of the solitary man on duty there concerning the trains it was not till i had left the man that i saw the effect the fire might have on my history i considered also though not in any detailed manner that the event by attracting the attention of the village to my former abode might set people on my track should they doubt my death and a sudden dread of having to go back again to knapwatera place which had seemed inimical to me from first to lastprompted me to run back and bribe the porter to secrecy i then walked on to anglebury lingering about the outskirts of the town till the morning train came in when i proceeded by it to london and then took these lodgings where i have been supporting myself ever since by needlework endeavouring to save enough money to pay my passage home to america but making melancholy progress in my attempt however all that is changedcan i be otherwise than happy at it of course not i am happy tell me what i am to do and believe me still to be your faithful wife eunice  my name here is as before       mrs rondley and my address           79 addington street                lambeth   the name and address were written on a separate slip of paper  so its to be all right at last then said manstons friend but after all theres another woman in the case you dont seem very sorry for the little thing who is put to such distress by this turn of affairs i wonder you can let her go so coolly the speaker was looking out between the mullions of the windownoticing that some of the lights were glazed in lozenges some in squaresas he said the words otherwise he would have seen the passionate expression of agonized hopelessness that flitted across the stewards countenance when the remark was made he did not see it and manston answered after a short interval the way in which he spoke of the young girl who had believed herself his wife whom a few short days ago he had openly idolized and whom in his secret heart he idolized still as far as such a form of love was compatible with his nature showed that from policy or otherwise he meant to act up to the requirements of the position into which fate appeared determined to drive him  thats neither here nor there he said it is a point of honour to do as i am doing and theres an end of it  yes only i thought you used not to care overmuch about your first bargain  i certainly did not at one time one is apt to feel rather weary of wives when they are so devilish civil under all aspects as she used to be but anything for a changeabigail is lost but michal is recovered you would hardly believe it but she seems in fancy to be quite another bridein fact almost as if she had really risen from the dead instead of having only done so virtually  you let the young pink one know that the other has come or is coming  cui bono the steward meditated critically showing a portion of his intensely wide and regular teeth within the ruby lips  i cannot say anything to her that will do any good he resumed it would be awkwardeither seeing or communicating with her again the best plan to adopt will be to let matters take their courseshell find it all out soon enough  manston found himself alone a few minutes later he buried his face in his hands and murmured o my lost one o my cytherea that it should come to this is hard for me tis now all darknessa land of darkness as darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is as darkness  yes the artificial bearing which this extraordinary man had adopted before strangers ever since he had overheard the conversation at the inn left him now and he mourned for cytherea aloud  4 the twelfth of february  knapwater park is the pictureat eleven oclock on a muddy quiet hazy but bright morninga morning without any blue sky and without any shadows the earth being enlivened and lit up rather by the spirit of an invisible sun than by its bodily presence  the local hunt had met for the days sport on the open space of ground immediately in front of the stewards residencecalled in the list of appointments old house knapwaterthe meet being here once every season for the pleasure of miss aldclyffe and her friends  leaning out from one of the firstfloor windows and surveying with the keenest interest the lively picture of pink and black coats richcoloured horses and sparkling bits and spurs was the returned and longlost woman mrs manston  the eyes of those forming the brilliant group were occasionally turned towards her showing plainly that her adventures were the subject of conversation equally with or more than the chances of the coming day she did not flush beneath their scrutiny on the contrary she seemed rather to enjoy it her eyes being kindled with a light of contented exultation subdued to square with the circumstances of her matronly position  she was at the distance from which they surveyed her an attractive womancomely as the tents of kedar but to a close observer it was palpable enough that god did not do all the picture appearing at least seven years older than cytherea she was probably her senior by double the number the artificial means employed to heighten the natural good appearance of her face being very cleverly applied her form was full and round its voluptuous maturity standing out in strong contrast to the memory of cythereas lissom girlishness  it seems to be an almost universal rule that a woman who once has courted or who eventually will court the society of men on terms dangerous to her honour cannot refrain from flinging the meaning glance whenever the moment arrives in which the glance is strongly asked for even if her life and whole future depended upon that moments abstinence  had a cautious uxorious husband seen in his wifes countenance what might now have been seen in this darkeyed womans as she caught a stray glance of flirtation from one or other of the redcoated gallants outside he would have passed many days in an agony of restless jealousy and doubt but manston was not such a husband and he was moreover calmly attending to his business at the other end of the manor  the steward had fetched home his wife in the most matteroffact way a few days earlier walking round the village with her the very next morningat once putting an end by this simple solution to all the riddling inquiries and surmises that were rank in the village and its neighbourhood some men said that this woman was as far inferior to cytherea as earth to heaven others older and sager thought manston better off with such a wife than he would have been with one of cythereas youthful impulses and inexperience in household management all felt their curiosity dying out of them it was the same in carriford as in other parts of the worldimmediately circumstantial evidence became exchanged for direct the loungers in court yawned gave a final survey and turned away to a subject which would afford more scope for speculation     xv the events of three weeks  1 from the twelfth of february to the second of march  owen grayes recovery from the illness that had incapacitated him for so long a time was professionally the dawn of a brighter prospect for him in every direction though the change was at first very gradual and his movements and efforts were little more than mechanical with the lengthening of the days and the revival of building operations for the forthcoming season he saw himself for the first time on a road which pursued with care would probably lead to a comfortable income at some future day but he was still very low down the hill as yet  the first undertaking entrusted to him in the new year began about a month after his return from southampton mr gradfield had come back to him in the wake of his restored health and offered him the superintendence as clerk of works of a church which was to be nearly rebuilt at the village of tolchurch fifteen or sixteen miles from budmouth and about half that distance from carriford  i am now being paid at the rate of a hundred and fifty pounds a year he said to his sister in a burst of thankfulness and you shall never cytherea be at any tyrannous ladys beck and call again as long as i live never pine or think about what has happened dear its no disgrace to you cheer up youll be somebodys happy wife yet  he did not say edward springroves for greatly to his disappointment a report had reached his ears that the friend to whom cytherea owed so much had been about to pack up his things and sail for australia however this was before the uncertainty concerning mrs manstons existence had been dispersed by her return a phenomenon that altered the cloudy relationship in which cytherea had lately been standing towards her old lover to one of distinctness which result would have been delightful but for circumstances about to be mentioned  cytherea was still pale from her recent illness and still greatly dejected until the news of mrs manstons return had reached them she had kept herself closely shut up during the daytime never venturing forth except at night sleeping and waking she had been in perpetual dread lest she should still be claimed by a man whom only a few weeks earlier she had regarded in the light of a future husband with quiet assent not unmixed with cheerfulness  but the removal of the uneasiness in this directionby mrs manstons arrival and her own consequent freedomhad been the imposition of pain in another utterly fictitious details of the finding of cytherea and manston had been invented and circulated unavoidably reaching her ears in the course of time thus the freedom brought no happiness and it seemed wellnigh impossible that she could ever again show herself the sparkling creature she once had been       apt to entice a deity  on this account and for the first time in his life owen made a point of concealing from her the real state of his feelings with regard to the unhappy transaction he writhed in secret under the humiliation to which they had been subjected till the resentment it gave rise to and for which there was no vent was sometimes beyond endurance it induced a mood that did serious damage to the material and plodding perseverance necessary if he would secure permanently the comforts of a home for them  they gave up their lodgings at budmouth and went to tolchurch as soon as the work commenced  here they were domiciled in one half of an old farmhouse standing not far from the ivycovered church tower which was all that was to remain of the original structure the long steep roof of this picturesque dwelling sloped nearly down to the ground the old tiles that covered it being overgrown with rich olivehued moss new red tiles in twos and threes had been used for patching the holes wrought by decay lighting up the whole harmonious surface with dots of brilliant scarlet  the chief internal features of this snug abode were a wide fireplace enormous cupboards a brown settle and several sketches on the wood mantel done in outline with the point of a hot pokerthe subjects mainly consisting of old men walking painfully erect with a curlytailed dog behind  after a week or two of residence in tolchurch and rambles amid the quaint scenery circumscribing it a tranquillity began to spread itself through the mind of the maiden which graye hoped would be a preface to her complete restoration she felt ready and willing to live the whole remainder of her days in the retirement of their present quarters she began to sing about the house in low tremulous snatches       i said if theres peace to be found in the world        a heart that is humble may hope for it here  2 the third of march  her convalescence had arrived at this point on a certain evening towards the end of the winter when owen had come in from the building hard by and was changing his muddy boots for slippers previously to sitting down to toast and tea  a prolonged though quiet knocking came to the door  the only person who ever knocked at their door in that way was the new vicar the prime mover in the churchbuilding but he was that evening dining with the squire  cytherea was uneasy at the soundshe did not know why unless it was because her nerves were weakened by the sickness she had undergone instead of opening the door she ran out of the room and upstairs  what nonsense cytherea said her brother going to the door  edward springrove stood in the grey light outside  capitalnot gone to australia and not going of course cried owen whats the use of going to such a place as thati never believed that you would  i am going back to london again tomorrow said springrove and i called to say a word before going where is   she has just run upstairs come innever mind scraping your shoeswe are regular cottagers now stone floor yawning chimneycorner and all you see  mrs manston came said edward awkwardly when he had sat down in the chimneycorner by preference  yes at mention of one of his skeletons owen lost his blitheness at once and fell into a reverie  the history of her escape is very simple  very  you know i always had wondered when my father was telling any of the circumstances of the fire to me how it could be that a woman could sleep so soundly as to be unaware of her horrid position till it was too late even to give shout or sound of any kind  well i think that would have been possible considering her long wearisome journey people have often been suffocated in their beds before they awoke but it was hardly likely a body would be completely burnt to ashes as this was assumed to be though nobody seemed to see it at the time and how positive the surgeon was too about those bits of bone why he should have been so nobody can tell i cannot help saying that if it has ever been possible to find pure stupidity incarnate it was in that jury of carriford there existed in the mass the stupidity of twelve and not the penetration of one  is she quite well said springrove  whoo my sister cytherea thank you nearly well now ill call her  wait one minute i have a word to say to you  owen sat down again  you know without my saying it that i love cytherea as dearly as ever i think she loves me toodoes she really  there was in owen enough of that worldly policy on the subject of matchmaking which naturally resides in the breasts of parents and guardians to give him a certain caution in replying and younger as he was by five years than edward it had an odd effect  well she may possibly love you still he said as if rather in doubt as to the truth of his words  springroves countenance instantly saddened he had expected a simple yes at the very least he continued in a tone of greater depression  supposing she does love me would it be fair to you and to her if i made her an offer of marriage with these dreary conditions attachedthat we lived for a few years on the narrowest system till a great debt which all honour and duty require me to pay off shall be paid my father by reason of the misfortune that befell him is under a great obligation to miss aldclyffe he is getting old and losing his energies i am attempting to work free of the burden this makes my prospects gloomy enough at present  but consider again he went on cytherea has been left in a nameless and unsatisfactory though innocent state by this unfortunate and now void marriage with manston a marriage with me though under themateriallyuntoward conditions i have mentioned would make us happy it would give her a locus standi if she wished to be out of the sound of her misfortunes we would go to another part of englandemigratedo anything  ill call cytherea said owen it is a matter which she alone can settle he did not speak warmly his pride could not endure the pity which edwards visit and errand tacitly implied yet in the other affair his heart went with edward he was on the same beat for paying off old debts himself  cythie mr springrove is here he said at the foot of the staircase  his sister descended the creaking old steps with a faltering tread and stood in the firelight from the hearth she extended her hand to springrove welcoming him by a mere motion of the lip her eyes averteda habit which had engendered itself in her since the beginning of her illness and defamation owen opened the door and went outleaving the lovers alone it was the first time they had met since the memorable night at southampton  i will get a light she said with a little embarrassment  nodont please cytherea said edward softly come and sit down with me  o yes i ought to have asked you to she returned timidly everybody sits in the chimneycorner in this parish you sit on that side ill sit here  two recessesone on the right one on the left handwere cut in the inside of the fireplace and here they sat down facing each other on benches fitted to the recesses the fire glowing on the hearth between their feet its ruddy light shone on the underslopes of their faces and spread out over the floor of the room with the low horizontality of the setting sun giving to every grain of sand and tumour in the paving a long shadow towards the door  edward looked at his pale love through the thin azure twines of smoke that went up like ringlets between them and invested her as seen through its medium with the shadowy appearance of a phantom nothing is so potent for coaxing back the lost eyes of a woman as a discreet silence in the man who has so lost themand thus the patient edward coaxed hers after lingering on the hearth for half a minute waiting in vain for another word from him they were lifted into his face  he was ready primed to receive them cytherea will you marry me he said  he could not wait in his original position till the answer came stepping across the front of the fire to her own side of the chimney corner he reclined at her feet and searched for her hand she continued in silence awhile  edward i can never be anybodys wife she then said sadly and with firmness  think of it in every light he pleaded the light of love first then when you have done that see how wise a step it would be i can only offer you poverty as yet but i wanti do so long to secure you from the intrusion of that unpleasant past which will often and always be thrust before you as long as you live the shrinking solitary life you do nowa life which purity chooses it may be but to the outside world it appears like the enforced loneliness of neglect and scornand tongues are busy inventing a reason for it which does not exist  i know all about it she said hastily and those are the grounds of my refusal you and owen know the whole truththe two i love best on earthand i am content but the scandal will be continually repeated and i can never give any one the opportunity of saying to youthatyour wife she utterly broke down and wept  dont my own darling he entreated dont cytherea  please to leave mewe will be friends edwardbut dont press memy mind is made upi cannoti will not marry you or any man under the present ambiguous circumstancesnever will ii have said it never  they were both silent he listlessly regarded the illuminated blackness overhead where long flakes of soot floated from the sides and bars of the chimneythroat like tattered banners in ancient aisles whilst through the square opening in the midst one or two bright stars looked down upon them from the grey march sky the sight seemed to cheer him  at any rate you will love me he murmured to her  yesalwaysfor ever and for ever  he kissed her once twice three times and arose to his feet slowly withdrawing himself from her side towards the door cytherea remained with her gaze fixed on the fire edward went out grieving but hope was not extinguished even now  he smelt the fragrance of a cigar and immediately afterwards saw a small red star of fire against the darkness of the hedge graye was pacing up and down the lane smoking as he walked springrove told him the result of the interview  you are a good fellow edward he said but i think my sister is right  i wish you would believe manston a villain as i do said springrove  it would be absurd of me to say that i like him nowfamily feeling prevents it but i cannot in honesty say deliberately that he is a bad man  edward could keep the secret of manstons coercion of miss aldclyffe in the matter of the houses a secret no longer he told owen the whole story  thats one thing he continued but not all what do you think of thisi have discovered that he went to budmouth postoffice for a letter the day before the first advertisement for his wife appeared in the papers one was there for him and it was directed in his wifes handwriting as i can prove this was not till after the marriage with cytherea it is true but if as it seems to show the advertising was a farce there is a strong presumption that the rest of the piece was  owen was too astounded to speak he dropped his cigar and fixed his eyes upon his companion  collusion  yes  with his first wife  yeswith his wife i am firmly persuaded of it  what did you discover  that he fetched from the postoffice at budmouth a letter from her the day before the first advertisement appeared  graye was lost in a long consideration ah he said it would be difficult to prove anything of that sort now the writing could not be sworn to and if he is guilty the letter is destroyed  i have other suspicions  yesas you said interrupted owen who had not till now been able to form the complicated set of ideas necessary for picturing the position yes there is this to be rememberedcytherea had been taken from him before that letter cameand his knowledge of his wifes existence could not have originated till after the wedding i could have sworn he believed her dead then his manner was unmistakable  well i have other suspicions repeated edward and if i only had the rightif i were her husband or brother he should be convicted of bigamy yet  the reproof was not needed said owen with a little bitterness what can i doa man with neither money nor friendswhilst manston has miss aldclyffe and all her fortune to back him up god only knows what lies between the mistress and her steward but since this has transpiredif it is truei can believe the connection to be even an unworthy onea thing i certainly never so much as owned to myself before  3 the fifth of march  edwards disclosure had the effect of directing owen grayes thoughts into an entirely new and uncommon channel  on the monday after springroves visit owen had walked to the top of a hill in the neighbourhood of tolchurcha wild hill that had no name beside a barren down where it never looked like summer in the intensity of his meditations on the everpresent subject he sat down on a weatherbeaten boundarystone gazing towards the distant valleysseeing only manstons imagined form  had his defenceless sister been trifled with that was the question which affected him her refusal of edward as a husband was he knew dictated solely by a humiliated sense of inadequacy to him in repute and had not been formed till since the slanderous tale accounting for her seclusion had been circulated was it not true as edward had hinted that he her brother was neglecting his duty towards her in allowing manston to thrive unquestioned whilst she was hiding her head for no fault at all  was it possible that manston was sensuous villain enough to have contemplated at any moment before the marriage with cytherea the return of his first wife when he should have grown weary of his new toy had he believed that by a skilful manipulation of such circumstances as chance would throw in his way he could escape all suspicion of having known that she lived only one fact within his own direct knowledge afforded the least ground for such a supposition it was that possessed by a woman only in the humble and unprotected station of a ladys hired companion his sisters beauty might scarcely have been sufficient to induce a selfish man like manston to make her his wife unless he had foreseen the possibility of getting rid of her again  but for that stratagem of manstons in relation to the springroves owen thought cythie might now have been the happy wife of edward true that he influenced miss aldclyffe only rests on edwards suspicions but the grounds are goodthe probability is strong  he went indoors and questioned cytherea  on the night of the fire who first said that mrs manston was burnt he asked  i dont know who started the report  was it manston  it was certainly not he all doubt on the subject was removed before he came to the spotthat i am certain of everybody knew that she did not escape after the house was on fire and thus all overlooked the fact that she might have left beforeof course that would have seemed such an improbable thing for anybody to do  yes until the porters story of her irritation and doubt as to her course made it natural  what settled the matter at the inquest said cytherea was mr manstons evidence that the watch was his wifes  he was sure of that wasnt he  i believe he said he was certain of it  it might have been hersleft behind in her perturbation as they say it wasimpossible as that seems at first sight yeson the whole he might have believed in her death  i know by several proofs that then and at least for some time after he had no other thought than that she was dead i now think that before the porters confession he knew something about herthough not that she lived  why do you  from what he said to me on the evening of the weddingday when i had fastened myself in the room at the hotel after edwards visit he must have suspected that i knew something for he was irritated and in a passion of uneasy doubt he said you dont suppose my first wife is come to light again madam surely directly he had let the remark slip out he seemed anxious to withdraw it  thats odd said owen  i thought it very odd  still we must remember he might only have hit upon the thought by accident in doubt as to your motive yes the great point to discover remains the same as everdid he doubt his first impression of her death before he married you i cant help thinking he did although he was so astounded at our news that night edward swears he did  it was perhaps only a short time before said cytherea when he could hardly recede from having me  seasoning justice with mercy as usual cytherea tis unfair to yourself to talk like that if i could only bring him to ruin as a bigamistsupposing him to be onei should die happy thats what we must find out by fair means or foulwas he a wilful bigamist  it is no use trying owen you would have to employ a solicitor and how can you do that  i cant at alli know that very well but neither do i altogether wish to at presenta lawyer must have a casefacts to go upon that means now they are scarce at presentas scarce as money is with us and till we have found more money there is no hurry for a lawyer perhaps by the time we have the facts we shall have the money the only thing we lose in working alone in this way is timenot the issue for the fruit that one mind matures in a twelvemonth forms a more perfectly organized whole than that of twelve minds in one month especially if the interests of the single one are vitally concerned and those of the twelve are only hired but there is not only my mind availableyou are a shrewd woman cythie and edward is an earnest ally then if we really get a sure footing for a criminal prosecution the crown will take up the case  i dont much care to press on in the matter she murmured what good can it do us owen after all  selfishly speaking it will do this goodthat all the facts of your journey to southampton will become known and the scandal will die besides manston will have to sufferits an act of justice to you and to other women and to edward springrove  he now thought it necessary to tell her of the real nature of the springroves obligation to miss aldclyffeand their nearly certain knowledge that manston was the prime mover in effecting their embarrassment her face flushed as she listened  and now he said our first undertaking is to find out where mrs manston lived during the separation next when the first communications passed between them after the fire  if we only had miss aldclyffes countenance and assistance as i used to have them cytherea returned how strong we should be o what power is it that he exercises over her swaying her just as he wishes she loves me now mrs morris in her letter said that miss aldclyffe prayed for meyes she heard her praying for me and crying miss aldclyffe did not mind an old friend like mrs morris knowing it either yet in opposition to this notice her dead silence and inaction throughout this proceeding  it is a mystery but never mind that now said owen impressively about where mrs manston has been living we must get this part of it firstlearn the place of her stay in the early stage of their separation during the period of manstons arrival here and so on for that was where she was first communicated with on the subject of coming to knapwater before the fire and that address too was her point of departure when she came to her husband by stealth in the nightyou knowthe time i visited you in the evening and went home early in the morning and it was found that he had been visited too ah couldnt we inquire of mrs leat who keeps the postoffice at carriford if she remembers where the letters to mrs manston were directed  he never posted his letters to her in the parishit was remarked at the time i was thinking if something relating to her address might not be found in the report of the inquest in the casterbridge chronicle of the date some facts about the inquest were given in the papers to a certainty  her brother caught eagerly at the suggestion who has a file of the chronicles he said  mr raunham used to file them said cytherea he was rather friendlydisposed towards me too  owen could not on any consideration escape from his attendance at the churchbuilding till saturday evening and thus it became necessary unless they actually wasted time that cytherea herself should assist i act under your orders owen she said     xvi the events of one week  1 march the sixth  the next morning the opening move of the game was made cytherea under cover of a thick veil hired a conveyance and drove to within a mile or so of carriford it was with a renewed sense of depression that she saw again the objects which had become familiar to her eye during her sojourn under miss aldclyffes roofthe outline of the hills the meadow streams the old park trees she hastened by a lonely path to the rectoryhouse and asked if mr raunham was at home  now the rector though a solitary bachelor was as gallant and courteous to womankind as an ancient iberian and moreover he was cythereas friend in particular to an extent far greater than she had ever surmised rarely visiting his relative miss aldclyffe except on parish matters more rarely still being called upon by miss aldclyffe cytherea had learnt very little of him whilst she lived at knapwater the relationship was on the impecunious paternal side and for this branch of her family the lady of the estate had never evinced much sympathy in looking back upon our line of descent it is an instinct with us to feel that all our vitality was drawn from the richer party to any unequal marriage in the chain  since the death of the old captain the rectors bearing in knapwater house had been almost that of a stranger a circumstance which he himself was the last man in the world to regret this polite indifference was so frigid on both sides that the rector did not concern himself to preach at her which was a great deal in a rector and she did not take the trouble to think his sermons poor stuff which in a cynical woman was a great deal more  though barely fifty years of age his hair was as white as snow contrasting strangely with the redness of his skin which was as fresh and healthy as a lads cythereas bright eyes mutely and demurely glancing up at him sunday after sunday had been the means of driving away many of the saturnine humours that creep into an empty heart during the hours of a solitary life in this case however to supplant them when she left his parish by those others of a more aching nature which accompany an overfull one in short he had been on the verge of feeling towards her that passion to which his dignified selfrespect would not give its true name even in the privacy of his own thought  he received her kindly but she was not disposed to be frank with him he saw her wish to be reserved and with genuine good taste and good nature made no comment whatever upon her request to be allowed to see the chronicle for the year before the last he placed the papers before her on his study table with a timidity as great as her own and then left her entirely to herself  she turned them over till she came to the first heading connected with the subject of her searchdisastrous fire and loss of life at carriford  the sight and its calamitous bearing upon her own life made her so dizzy that she could for a while hardly decipher the letters stifling recollection by an effort she nerved herself to her work and carefully read the column the account reminded her of no other fact than was remembered already  she turned on to the following weeks report of the inquest after a miserable perusal she could find no more pertaining to mrs manstons address than this  abraham brown of hoxton london at whose house the deceased woman had been living deposed etc  nobody else from london had attended the inquest she arose to depart first sending a message of thanks to mr raunham who was out of doors gardening  he stuck his spade into the ground and accompanied her to the gate  can i help you in anything cytherea he said using her christian name by an intuition that unpleasant memories might be revived if he called her miss graye after wishing her goodbye as mrs manston at the wedding cytherea saw the motive and appreciated it nevertheless replying evasively  i only guess and fear  he earnestly looked at her again  promise me that if you want assistance and you think i can give it you will come to me  i will she said  the gate closed between them  you dont want me to help you in anything now cytherea he repeated  if he had spoken what he felt i want very much to help you cytherea and have been watching manston on your account she would gladly have accepted his offer as it was she was perplexed and raised her eyes to his not so fearlessly as before her trouble but as modestly and with still enough brightness in them to do fearful execution as she said over the gate  no thank you  she returned to tolchurch weary with her days work owens greeting was anxious  well cytherea  she gave him the words from the report of the inquest pencilled on a slip of paper  now to find out the name of the street and number owen remarked  owen she said will you forgive me for what i am going to say i dont think i canindeed i dont think i cantake any further steps towards disentangling the mystery i still think it a useless task and it does not seem any duty of mine to be revenged upon mr manston in any way she added more gravely it is beneath my dignity as a woman to labour for this i have felt it so all day  very well he said somewhat shortly i shall work without you then theres dignity in justice he caught sight of her pale tired face and the dilated eye which always appeared in her with weariness darling he continued warmly and kissing her you shall not work so hard againyou are worn out quite but you must let me do as i like  2 march the tenth  on saturday evening graye hurried off to casterbridge and called at the house of the reporter to the chronicle the reporter was at home and came out to graye in the passage owen explained who and what he was and asked the man if he would oblige him by turning to his notes of the inquest at carriford in the december of the year preceding the lastjust adding that a family entanglement of which the reporter probably knew something made him anxious to ascertain some additional details of the event if any existed  certainly said the other without hesitation though i am afraid i havent much beyond what we printed at the time let me seemy old notebooks are in my drawer at the office of the paper if you will come with me i can refer to them there his wife and family were at tea inside the room and with the timidity of decent poverty everywhere he seemed glad to get a stranger out of his domestic groove  they crossed the street entered the office and went thence to an inner room here after a short search was found the book required the precise address not given in the condensed report that was printed but written down by the reporter was as follows        abraham brown           lodginghouse keeper               41 charles square                    hoxton   owen copied it and gave the reporter a small fee i want to keep this inquiry private for the present he said hesitatingly you will perhaps understand why and oblige me  the reporter promised news is shop with me he said and to escape from handling it is my greatest social enjoyment  it was evening and the outer room of the publishingoffice was lighted up with flaring jets of gas after making the above remark the reporter came out from the inner apartment in grayes company answering an expression of obligation from owen with the words that it was no trouble at the moment of his speech he closed behind him the door between the two rooms still holding his notebook in his hand  before the counter of the front room stood a tall man who was also speaking when they emerged he said to the youth in attendance i will take my paper for this week now i am here so that you neednt post it to me  the stranger then slightly turned his head saw owen and recognized him owen passed out without recognizing the other as manston  manston then looked at the reporter who after walking to the door with owen had come back again to lock up his books manston did not need to be told that the shabby marblecovered book which he held in his hand opening endways and interleaved with blottingpaper was an old reportingbook he raised his eyes to the reporters face whose experience had not so schooled his features but that they betrayed a consciousness to one half initiated as the other was that his late proceeding had been connected with events in the life of the steward manston said no more but taking his newspaper followed owen from the office and disappeared in the gloom of the street  edward springrove was now in london again and on this same evening before leaving casterbridge owen wrote a careful letter to him stating therein all the facts that had come to his knowledge and begging him as he valued cytherea to make cautious inquiries a tall man was standing under the lamppost about halfadozen yards above the postoffice when he dropped the letter into the box  that same night too for a reason connected with the rencounter with owen graye the steward entertained the idea of rushing off suddenly to london by the mailtrain which left casterbridge at ten oclock but remembering that letters posted after the hour at which owen had obtained his informationwhatever that wascould not be delivered in london till monday morning he changed his mind and went home to knapwater making a confidential explanation to his wife arrangements were set on foot for his departure by the mail on sunday night  3 march the eleventh  starting for church the next morning several minutes earlier than was usual with him the steward intentionally loitered along the road from the village till old mr springrove overtook him manston spoke very civilly of the morning and of the weather asking how the farmers barometer stood and when it was probable that the wind might change it was not in mr springroves naturegoing to church as he was tooto return anything but a civil answer to such civil questions however his feelings might have been biassed by late events the conversation was continued on terms of greater friendliness  you must be feeling settled again by this time mr springrove after the rough turnout you had on that terrible night in november  ay but i dont know about feeling settled either mr manston the old window in the chimneycorner of the old house i shall never forget no window in the chimneycorner where i am now and i had been used to it for more than fifty years ted says tis a great loss to me and he knows exactly what i feel  your son is again in a good situation i believe said manston imitating that inquisitiveness into the private affairs of the natives which passes for high breeding in country villages  yes sir i hope hell keep it or do something else and stick to it  tis to be hoped hell be steady now  hes always been that i assure ee said the old man tartly  yesyesi mean intellectually steady intellectual wild oats will thrive in a soil of the strictest morality  intellectual gingerbread teds steady enoughthats all i know about it  of courseof course has he respectable lodgings my own experience has shown me that thats a great thing to a young man living alone in london  warwick street charing crossthats where he is  well to be surestrange a very dear friend of mine used to live at number fiftytwo in that very same street  edward lives at number fortyninehow very near being the same house said the old farmer pleased in spite of himself  very said manston well i suppose we had better step along a little quicker mr springrove the parsons bell has just begun  number fortynine he murmured  4 march the twelfth  edward received owens letter in due time but on account of his daily engagements he could not attend to any request till the clock had struck five in the afternoon rushing then from his office in westminster he called a hansom and proceeded to hoxton a few minutes later he knocked at the door of number fortyone charles square the old lodging of mrs manston  a tall man who would have looked extremely handsome had he not been clumsily and closely wrapped up in garments that were much too elderly in style for his years stood at the corner of the quiet square at the same instant having too alighted from a cab that had been driven along old street in edwards rear he smiled confidently when springrove knocked  nobody came to the door springrove knocked again  this brought out two peopleone at the door he had been knocking upon the other from the next on the right  is mr brown at home said springrove  no sir  when will he be in  quite uncertain  can you tell me where i may find him  no o here he is coming sir thats mr brown  edward looked down the pavement in the direction pointed out by the woman and saw a man approaching he proceeded a few steps to meet him  edward was impatient and to a certain extent still a countryman who had not after the manner of city men subdued the natural impulse to speak out the ruling thought without preface he said in a quiet tone to the stranger one word with youdo you remember a lady lodger of yours of the name of mrs manston  mr brown half closed his eyes at springrove somewhat as if he were looking into a telescope at the wrong end  i have never let lodgings in my life he said after his survey  didnt you attend an inquest a year and a half ago at carriford  never knew there was such a place in the world sir and as to lodgings i have taken acres first and last during the last thirty years but i have never let an inch  i suppose there is some mistake edward murmured and turned away he and mr brown were now opposite the door next to the one he had knocked at the woman who was still standing there had heard the inquiry and the result of it  i expect it is the other mr brown who used to live there that you want sir she said the mr brown that was inquired for the other day  very likely that is the man said edward his interest reawakening  he couldnt make a do of lodgingletting here and at last he went to cornwall where he came from and where his brother still lived who had often asked him to come home again but there was little luck in the change for after london they say he couldnt stand the rainy west winds they get there and he died in the december following will you step into the passage  thats unfortunate said edward going in but perhaps you remember a mrs manston living next door to you  o yes said the landlady closing the door the lady who was supposed to have met with such a horrible fate and was alive all the time i saw her the other day  since the fire at carriford  yes her husband came to ask if mr brown was still living herejust as you might he seemed anxious about it and then one evening a week or fortnight afterwards when he came again to make further inquiries she was with him but i did not speak to hershe stood back as if she were shy i was interested however for old mr brown had told me all about her when he came back from the inquest  did you know mrs manston before she called the other day  no you see she was only mr browns lodger for two or three weeks and i didnt know she was living there till she was near upon leaving againwe dont notice nextdoor people much here in london i much regretted i had not known her when i heard what had happened it led me and mr brown to talk about her a great deal afterwards i little thought i should see her alive after all  and when do you say they came here together  i dont exactly remember the daythough i remember a very beautiful dream i had that same nightah i shall never forget it shoals of lodgers coming along the square with angels wings and bright golden sovereigns in their hands wanting apartments at west end prices they would not give any less no not if you  yes did mrs manston leave anything such as papers when she left these lodgings originally said edward though his heart sank as he asked he felt that he was outwitted manston and his wife had been there before him clearing the ground of all traces  i have always said no hitherto replied the woman considering i could say no more if put upon my oath as i expected to be but speaking in a common everyday way now the occurrence is past i believe a few things of some kind though i doubt if they were papers were left in a workbox she had because she talked about it to mr brown and was rather angry at what occurredyou see she had a temper by all account and so i didnt like to remind the lady of this workbox when she came the other day with her husband  and about the workbox  well from what was casually dropped i think mrs manston had a few articles of furniture she didnt want and when she was leaving they were put in a sale just by amongst her things were two workboxes very much alike one of these she intended to sell the other she didnt and mr brown who collected the things together took the wrong one to the sale  what was in it  o nothing in particular or of any valuesome accounts and her usual sewing materials i thinknothing more she didnt take much trouble to get it backshe said the bills were worth nothing to her or anybody else but that she should have liked to keep the box because her husband gave it her when they were first married and if he found she had parted with it he would be vexed  did mrs manston when she called recently with her husband allude to this or inquire for it or did mr manston  noand i rather wondered at it but she seemed to have forgotten itindeed she didnt make any inquiry at all only standing behind him listening to his and he probably had never been told anything about it  whose sale were these articles of hers taken to  who was the auctioneer mr halway his place is the third turning from the end of that street you see there anybody will tell you the shophis name is written up  edward went off to follow up his clue with a promptness which was dictated more by a dogged will to do his utmost than by a hope of doing much when he was out of sight the tall and cloaked man who had watched him came up to the womans door with an appearance of being in breathless haste  has a gentleman been here inquiring about mrs manston  yes hes just gone  dear me i want him  hes gone to mr halways  i think i can give him some information upon the subject does he pay pretty liberally  he gave me halfacrown  that scale will do im a poor man and will see what my little contribution to his knowledge will fetch but by the way perhaps you told him all i knowwhere she lived before coming to live here  i didnt know where she lived before coming here o noi only said what mr brown had told me he seemed a nice gentle young man or i shouldnt have been so open as i was  i shall now about catch him at mr halways said the man and went away as hastily as he had come  edward in the meantime had reached the auctionroom he found some difficulty on account of the inertness of those whose only inducement to an action is a mere wish from another in getting the information he stood in need of but it was at last accorded him the auctioneers book gave the name of mrs higgins 3 canley passage as the purchaser of the lot which had included mrs manstons workbox  thither edward went followed by the man four bell pulls one above the other like waistcoatbuttons appeared on the doorpost edward seized the first he came to  who did you woant said a thin voice from somewhere  edward looked above and around him nobody was visible  who did you woant said the thin voice again  he found now that the sound proceeded from below the grating covering the basement window he dropped his glance through the bars and saw a childs white face  who did you woant said the voice the third time with precisely the same languid inflection  mrs higgins said edward  third bell up said the face and disappeared  he pulled the third bell from the bottom and was admitted by another child the daughter of the woman he was in search of he gave the little thing sixpence and asked for her mamma the child led him upstairs  mrs higgins was the wife of a carpenter who from want of employment one winter had decided to marry afterwards they both took to drink and sank into desperate circumstances a few chairs and a table were the chief articles of furniture in the thirdfloor back room which they occupied a roll of babylinen lay on the floor beside it a papclogged spoon and an overturned tin papcup against the wall a dutch clock was fixed out of level and ticked wildly in longs and shorts its entrails hanging down beneath its white face and wiry hands like the faeces of a harpy foedissima ventris proluvies uncaeque manus et pallida semper ora a baby was crying against every chairleg the whole family of six or seven being small enough to be covered by a washingtub mrs higgins sat helpless clothed in a dress which had hooks and eyes in plenty but never one opposite the other thereby rendering the dress almost useless as a screen to the bosom no workbox was visible anywhere  it was a depressing picture of married life among the very poor of a city only for one short hour in the whole twentyfour did husband and wife taste genuine happiness it was in the evening when after the sale of some necessary article of furniture they were under the influence of a quartern of gin  of all the ingenious and cruel satires that from the beginning till now have been stuck like knives into womankind surely there is not one so lacerating to them and to us who love them as the trite old fact that the most wretched of men can in the twinkling of an eye find a wife ready to be more wretched still for the sake of his company  edward hastened to despatch his errand  mrs higgins had lately pawned the workbox with other useless articles of lumber she said edward bought the duplicate of her and went downstairs to the pawnbrokers  in the back division of a musty shop amid the heterogeneous collection of articles and odours invariably crowding such places he produced his ticket and with a sense of satisfaction out of all proportion to the probable worth of his acquisition took the box and carried it off under his arm he attempted to lift the cover as he walked but found it locked  it was dusk when springrove reached his lodging entering his small sittingroom the front apartment on the ground floor he struck a light and proceeded to learn if any scrap or mark within or upon his purchase rendered it of moment to the business in hand breaking open the cover with a small chisel and lifting the tray he glanced eagerly beneath and foundnothing  he next discovered that a pocket or portfolio was formed on the underside of the cover this he unfastened and slipping his hand within found that it really contained some substance first he pulled out about a dozen tangled silk and cotton threads under them were a short household account a dry mossrosebud and an old pair of cartedevisite photographs one of these was a likeness of mrs manstoneunice being written under it in inkthe other of manston himself  he sat down dispirited this was all the fruit of his tasknot a single letter date or address of any kind to help himand was it likely there would be  however thinking he would send the fragments such as they were to graye in order to satisfy him that he had done his best so far he scribbled a line and put all except the silk and cotton into an envelope looking at his watch he found it was then twenty minutes to seven by affixing an extra stamp he would be enabled to despatch them by that evenings post he hastily directed the packet and ran with it at once to the postoffice at charing cross  on his return he took up the workbox again to examine it more leisurely he then found there was also a small cavity in the tray under the pincushion which was movable by a bit of ribbon lifting this he uncovered a flattened sprig of myrtle and a small scrap of crumpled paper the paper contained a verse or two in a mans handwriting he recognized it as manstons having seen notes and bills from him at his fathers house the stanza was of a complimentary character descriptive of the lady who was now manstons wife                           eunice            whoso for hours or lengthy days            shall catch her aspects changeful rays            then turn away can none recall            beyond a galaxy of all                in hazy portraiture            lit by the light of azure eyes            like summer days by summer skies            her sweet transitions seem to be            a kind of pictured melody                and not a set contour                                       ae m   to shake pull and ransack the box till he had almost destroyed it was now his natural action but it contained absolutely nothing more  disappointed again he said flinging down the box the bit of paper and the withered twig that had lain with it  yet valueless as the new acquisition was on second thoughts he considered that it would be worth while to make good the statement in his late note to grayethat he had sent everything the box contained except the sewingthread thereupon he enclosed the verse and myrtletwig in another envelope with a remark that he had overlooked them in his first search and put it on the table for the next days post  in his hurry and concentration upon the matter that occupied him springrove on entering his lodging and obtaining a light had not waited to pull down the blind or close the shutters consequently all that he had done had been visible from the street but as on an average not one person a minute passed along the quiet pavement at this time of the evening the discovery of the omission did not much concern his mind  but the real state of the case was that a tall man had stood against the opposite wall and watched the whole of his proceeding when edward came out and went to the charing cross postoffice the man followed him and saw him drop the letter into the box the stranger did not further trouble himself to follow springrove back to his lodging again  manston now knew that there had been photographs of some kind in his wifes workbox and though he had not been near enough to see them he guessed whose they were the least reflection told him to whom they had been sent  he paused a minute under the portico of the postoffice looking at the two or three omnibuses stopping and starting in front of him then he rushed along the strand through holywell street and on to old boswell court kicking aside the shoeblacks who began to importune him as he passed under the colonnade he turned up the narrow passage to the publishingoffice of the postoffice directory he begged to be allowed to see the directory of the southwest counties of england for a moment  the shopman immediately handed down the volume from a shelf and manston retired with it to the windowbench he turned to the county and then to the parish of tolchurch at the end of the historical and topographical description of the village he read  postmistressmrs hurston letters received at 630 am by footpost from anglebury  returning his thanks he handed back the book and quitted the office thence pursuing his way to an obscure coffeehouse by the strand where he now partook of a light dinner but rest seemed impossible with him some absorbing intention kept his body continually on the move he paid his bill took his bag in his hand and went out to idle about the streets and over the river till the time should have arrived at which the nightmail left the waterloo station by which train he intended to return homeward  there exists as it were an outer chamber to the mind in which when a man is occupied centrally with the most momentous question of his life casual and trifling thoughts are just allowed to wander softly for an interval before being banished altogether thus amid his concentration did manston receive perceptions of the individuals about him in the lively thoroughfare of the strand tall men looking insignificant little men looking great and profound lost women of miserable repute looking as happy as the days are long wives happy by assumption looking careworn and miserable each and all were alike in this one respect that they followed a solitary trail like the inwoven threads which form a banner and all were equally unconscious of the significant whole they collectively showed forth  at ten oclock he turned into lancaster place crossed the river and entered the railwaystation where he took his seat in the down mailtrain which bore him and edward springroves letter to graye far away from london     xvii the events of one day  1 march the thirteenth three to six oclock am  they entered anglebury station in the dead still time of early morning the clock over the bookingoffice pointing to twentyfive minutes to three manston lingered on the platform and saw the mailbags brought out noticing as a pertinent pastime the many shabby blotches of wax from innumerable seals that had been set upon their mouths the guard took them into a fly and was driven down the road to the postoffice  it was a raw damp uncomfortable morning though as yet little rain was falling manston drank a mouthful from his flask and walked at once away from the station pursuing his way through the gloom till he stood on the side of the town adjoining at a distance from the last house in the street of about two hundred yards  the station road was also the turnpikeroad into the country the first part of its course being across a heath having surveyed the highway up and down to make sure of its bearing manston methodically set himself to walk backwards and forwards a stones throw in each direction although the spring was temperate the time of day and the condition of suspense in which the steward found himself caused a sensation of chilliness to pervade his frame in spite of the overcoat he wore the drizzling rain increased and drops from the trees at the wayside fell noisily upon the hard road beneath them which reflected from its glassy surface the faint halo of light hanging over the lamps of the adjacent town  here he walked and lingered for two hours without seeing or hearing a living soul then he heard the markethouse clock strike five and soon afterwards quick hard footsteps smote upon the pavement of the street leading towards him they were those of the postman for the tolchurch beat he reached the bottom of the street gave his bags a final hitchup stepped off the pavement and struck out for the country with a brisk shuffle  manston then turned his back upon the town and walked slowly on in two minutes a flickering light shone upon his form and the postman overtook him  the newcomer was a short stooping individual of above fiveandforty laden on both sides with leather bags large and small and carrying a little lantern strapped to his breast which cast a tiny patch of light upon the road ahead  a tryen mornen for travellers the postman cried in a cheerful voice without turning his head or slackening his trot  it is indeed said manston stepping out abreast of him you have a long walk every day  yesa long walkfor though the distance is only sixteen miles on the straightthat is eight to the furthest place and eight back what with the ins and outs to the gentlemens houses it makes twoandtwenty for my legs twoandtwenty miles a day how many a year i used to reckon it but i never do now i dont care to think o my wear and tear now it do begin to tell upon me  thus the conversation was begun and the postman proceeded to narrate the different strange events that marked his experience manston grew very friendly  postman i dont know what your custom is he said after a while but between you and me i always carry a drop of something warm in my pocket when i am out on such a morning as this try it he handed the bottle of brandy  if youll excuse me please i havent took no stimmilents these five years  tis never too late to mend  against the regulations i be afraid  wholl know it  thats truenobody will know it still honestys the best policy  ahit is certainly but thank god ive been able to get on without it yet youll surely drink with me  really tis amost too early for that sort o thinghowever to oblige a friend i dont object to the faintest shadder of a drop the postman drank and manston did the same to a very slight degree five minutes later when they came to a gate the flask was pulled out again  well done said the postman beginning to feel its effect but guide my soul i be afraid twill hardly do  not unless tis well followed like any other line you take up said manston besides theres a way of liking a drop of liquor and of being goodeven religiousat the same time  ay for some thimbleandbutton inanout fellers but i could never get into the knack o it not i  well you neednt be troubled it isnt necessary for the higher class of mind to be religiousthey have so much commonsense that they can risk playing with fire  that hits me exactly  in fact a man i know who always had no other god but me and devoutly loved his neighbours wife says now that believing is a mistake  well to be sure however believing in god is a mistake made by very few people after all  a true remark  not one christian in our parish would walk half a mile in a rain like this to know whether the scripture had concluded him under sin or grace  nor in mine  ah you may depend upon it theyll do away wi goddymity altogether afore long although weve had him over us so many years  theres no knowing  and i suppose the queen ill be done away wi then a pretty concern thatll be nobodys head to put on your letters and then your honest man who do pay his penny will never be known from your scamp who dont o tis a nation  warm the cockles of your heart however heres the bottle waiting  ill oblige you my friend  the drinking was repeated the postman grew livelier as he went on and at length favoured the steward with a song manston himself joining in the chorus             he flung his mallet against the wall            said the lord make churches and chapels to fall            and therell be work for tradesmen all                when joans ale was new                                my boys                when joans ale was new   you understand friend the postman added i was originally a mason by trade no offence to you if you be a parson  none at all said manston  the rain now came down heavily but they pursued their path with alacrity the produce of the several fields between which the lane wound its way being indicated by the peculiar character of the sound emitted by the falling drops sometimes a soaking hiss proclaimed that they were passing by a pasture then a patter would show that the rain fell upon some largeleafed root crop then a paddling plash announced the naked arable the low sound of the wind in their ears rising and falling with each pace they took  besides the small private bags of the county families which were all locked the postman bore the large general budget for the remaining inhabitants along his beat at each village or hamlet they came to the postman searched for the packet of letters destined for that place and thrust it into an ordinary letterhole cut in the door of the receivers cottagethe village postoffices being mostly kept by old women who had not yet risen though lights moving in other cottage windows showed that such people as carters woodmen and stablemen had long been stirring  the postman had by this time become markedly unsteady but he still continued to be too conscious of his duties to suffer the steward to search the bag manston was perplexed and at lonely points in the road cast his eyes keenly upon the short bowed figure of the man trotting through the mud by his side as if he were half inclined to run a very great risk indeed  it frequently happened that the houses of farmers clergymen etc lay a short distance up or down a lane or path branching from the direct track of the postmans journey to save time and distance at the point of junction of some of these paths with the main road the gatepost was hollowed out to form a letterbox in which the postman deposited his missives in the morning looking in the box again in the evening to collect those placed there for the return post tolchurch vicarage and farmstead lying back from the village street were served on this principle this fact the steward now learnt by conversing with the postman and the discovery relieved manston greatly making his intentions much clearer to himself than they had been in the earlier stages of his journey  they had reached the outskirts of the village manston insisted upon the flask being emptied before they proceeded further this was done and they approached the church the vicarage and the farmhouse in which owen and cytherea were living  the postman paused fumbled in his bag took out by the light of his lantern some halfdozen letters and tried to sort them he could not perform the task  we be crippled disciples a blieve he said with a sigh and a stagger  not drunk but marketmerry said manston cheerfully  well done if i baint so weak that i cant see the cloudsmuch less letters guide my soul if so be anybody should tell the queens postmastergeneral of me the whole story will have to go through parliament house and i shall be hightreasonedas safe as housesand be fined and wholl pay for a poor martel o tis a world  trust in the lordhell pay  he pay a blieve why should he when he didnt drink the drink he pay a blieve dye think the mans a fool  well well i had no intention of hurting your feelingsbut how was i to know you were so sensitive  trueyou were not to know i was so sensitive heres a caddle wi these letters guide my soul what will billy do  manston offered his services  they are to be divided the man said  how said manston  these for the village to be carried on into it any for the vicarage or vicarage farm must be left in the box of the gatepost just here theres none for the vicaragehouse this mornen but i saw when i started there was one for the clerk o works at the new church this is it isnt it  he held up a large envelope directed in edward springroves handwriting       mr o graye           clerk of works                tolchurch                     near anglebury  the letterbox was scooped in an oak gatepost about a foot square there was no slit for inserting the letters by reason of the opportunity such a lonely spot would have afforded mischievous peasantboys of doing damage had such been the case but at the side was a small iron door kept close by an iron reversible strap locked across it one side of this strap was painted black the other white and white or black outwards implied respectively that there were letters inside or none  the postman had taken the key from his pocket and was attempting to insert it in the keyhole of the box he touched one side the other above below but never made a straight hit  let me unlock it said manston taking the key from the postman he opened the box and reached out with his other hand for owens letter  no no o nono the postman said as one ofmajestys servantscaremajestys mailsdutyput lettersown hands he slowly and solemnly placed the letter in the small cavity  now lock it he said closing the door  the steward placed the bar across with the black side outwards signifying empty and turned the key  youve put the wrong side outwards said the postman tisnt empty  and dropped the key in the mud so that i cant alter it said the steward letting something fall  what an awkward thing  it is an awkward thing  they both went searching in the mud which their own trampling had reduced to the consistency of pap the postman unstrapping his little lantern from his breast and thrusting it about close to the ground the rain still drizzling down and the dawn so tardy on account of the heavy clouds that daylight seemed delayed indefinitely the rays of the lantern were rendered individually visible upon the thick mist and seemed almost tangible as they passed off into it after illuminating the faces and knees of the two stooping figures dripping with wet the postmans cape and private bags and the stewards valise glistening as if they had been varnished  it fell on the grass said the postman  no it fell in the mud said manston they searched again  im afraid we shant find it by this light said the steward at length washing his muddy fingers in the wet grass of the bank  im afraid we shant said the other standing up  ill tell you what we had better do said manston i shall be back this way in an hour or so and since it was all my fault ill look again and shall be sure to find it in the daylight and ill hide the key here for you he pointed to a spot behind the post it will be too late to turn the index then as the people will have been here so that the box had better stay as it is the letter will only be delayed a day and that will not be noticed if it is you can say you placed the iron the wrong way without knowing it and all will be well  this was agreed to by the postman as the best thing to be done under the circumstances and the pair went on they had passed the village and come to a crossroad when the steward telling his companion that their paths now diverged turned off to the left towards carriford  no sooner was the postman out of sight and hearing than manston stalked back to the vicarage letterbox by keeping inside a fence and thus avoiding the village arrived here he took the key from his pocket where it had been concealed all the time and abstracted owens letter this done he turned towards home by the help of what he carried in his valise adjusting himself to his ordinary appearance as he neared the quarter in which he was known  an hour and halfs sharp walking brought him to his own door in knapwater park  2 eight oclock am  seated in his private office he wetted the flap of the stolen letter and waited patiently till the adhesive gum could be loosened he took out edwards note the accounts the rosebud and the photographs regarding them with the keenest interest and anxiety  the note the accounts the rosebud and his own photograph he restored to their places again the other photograph he took between his finger and thumb and held it towards the bars of the grate there he held it for halfaminute or more meditating  it is a great risk to run even for such an end he muttered  suddenly impregnated with a bright idea he jumped up and left the office for the front parlour taking up an album of portraits which lay on the table he searched for three or four likenesses of the lady who had so lately displaced cytherea which were interspersed among the rest of the collection and carefully regarded them they were taken in different attitudes and styles and he compared each singly with that he held in his hand one of them the one most resembling that abstracted from the letter in general tone size and attitude he selected from the rest and returned with it to his office  pouring some water into a plate he set the two portraits afloat upon it and sitting down tried to read  at the end of a quarter of an hour after several ineffectual attempts he found that each photograph would peel from the card on which it was mounted this done he threw into the fire the original likeness and the recent card stuck upon the original card the recent likeness from the album dried it before the fire and placed it in the envelope with the other scraps  the result he had obtained then was this in the envelope were now two photographs both having the same photographers name on the back and consecutive numbers attached at the bottom of the one which showed his own likeness his own name was written down on the other his wifes name was written whilst the central feature and whole matter to which this latter card and writing referred the likeness of a lady mounted upon it had been changed  mrs manston entered the room and begged him to come to breakfast he followed her and they sat down during the meal he told her what he had done with scrupulous regard to every detail and showed her the result  it is indeed a great risk to run she said sipping her tea  but it would be a greater not to do it  yes  the envelope was again fastened up as before and manston put it in his pocket and went out shortly afterwards he was seen on horseback riding in a direction towards tolchurch keeping to the fields as well as he could for the greater part of the way he dropped into the road by the vicarage letterbox and looking carefully about to ascertain that no person was near he restored the letter to its nook placed the key in its hidingplace as he had promised the postman and again rode homewards by a roundabout way  3 afternoon  the letter was brought to owen graye the same afternoon by one of the vicars servants who had been to the box with a duplicate key as usual to leave letters for the evening post the man found that the index had told falsely that morning for the first time within his recollection but no particular attention was paid to the mistake as it was considered the contents of the envelope were scrutinized by owen and flung aside as useless  the next morning brought springroves second letter the existence of which was unknown to manston the sight of edwards handwriting again raised the expectations of brother and sister till owen had opened the envelope and pulled out the twig and verse  nothing thats of the slightest use after all he said to her we are as far as ever from the merest shadow of legal proof that would convict him of what i am morally certain he did marry you suspecting if not knowing her to be alive all the time  what has edward sent said cytherea  an old amatory verse in manstons writing fancy he said bitterly this is the strain he addressed her in when they were courtingas he did you i suppose  he handed her the verse and she read                           eunice            whoso for hours or lengthy days            shall catch her aspects changeful rays            then turn away can none recall            beyond a galaxy of all                in hazy portraiture            lit by the light of azure eyes            like summer days by summer skies            her sweet transitions seem to be            a kind of pictured melody                and not a set contour                                       ae m   a strange expression had overspread cythereas countenance it rapidly increased to the most deathlike anguish she flung down the paper seized owens hand tremblingly and covered her face  cytherea what is it for heavens sake  owensupposeo you dont know what i think  what  the light of azure eyes she repeated with ashy lips  well the light of azure eyes he said astounded at her manner  mrs morris said in her letter to me that her eyes are black  hm mrs morris must have made a mistakenothing likelier  she didnt  they might be either in this photograph said owen looking at the card bearing mrs manstons name  blue eyes would scarcely photograph so deep in tone as that said cytherea no they seem black here certainly  well then manston must have blundered in writing his verses  but could he say a man in love may forget his own name but not that he forgets the colour of his mistresss eyes besides she would have seen the mistake when she read them and have had it corrected  thats true she would mused owen then cytherea it comes to thisyou must have been misinformed by mrs morris since there is no other alternative  i suppose i must  her looks belied her words  what makes you so strangeill said owen again  i cant believe mrs morris wrong  but look at this cytherea if it is clear to us that the woman had blue eyes two years ago she must have blue eyes now whatever mrs morris or anybody else may fancy any one would think that manston could change the colour of a womans eyes to hear you  yes she said and paused  you say yes as if he could said owen impatiently  by changing the woman herself she exclaimed owen dont you see the horridwhat i dreadthat the woman he lives with is not mrs manstonthat she was burnt after alland that i am his wife  she tried to support a stoicism under the weight of this new trouble but no the unexpected revulsion of ideas was so overwhelming that she crept to him and leant against his breast  before reflecting any further upon the subject graye led her upstairs and got her to lie down then he went to the window and stared out of it up the lane vainly endeavouring to come to some conclusion upon the fantastic enigma that confronted him cythereas new view seemed incredible yet it had such a hold upon her that it would be necessary to clear it away by positive proof before contemplation of her fear should have preyed too deeply upon her  cytherea he said this will not do you must stay here alone all the afternoon whilst i go to carriford i shall know all when i return  no no dont go she implored  soon then not directly he saw her subtle reasoningthat it was folly to be wise  reflection still convinced him that good would come of persevering in his intention and dispelling his sisters idle fears anything was better than this absurd doubt in her mind but he resolved to wait till sunday the first day on which he might reckon upon seeing mrs manston without suspicion in the meantime he wrote to edward springrove requesting him to go again to mrs manstons former lodgings     xviii the events of three days  1 march the eighteenth  sunday morning had come and owen was trudging over the six miles of hill and dale that lay between tolchurch and carriford  edward springroves answer to the last letter after expressing his amazement at the strange contradiction between the verses and mrs morriss letter had been to the effect that he had again visited the neighbour of the dead mr brown and had received as near a description of mrs manston as it was possible to get at secondhand and by hearsay she was a tall woman wide at the shoulders and fullchested and she had a straight and rather large nose the colour of her eyes the informant did not know for she had only seen the lady in the street as she went in or out this confusing remark was added the woman had almost recognized mrs manston when she had called with her husband lately but she had kept her veil down her residence before she came to hoxton was quite unknown to this nextdoor neighbour and edward could get no manner of clue to it from any other source  owen reached the churchdoor a few minutes before the bells began chiming nobody was yet in the church and he walked round the aisles from cythereas frequent description of how and where herself and others used to sit he knew where to look for manstons seat and after two or three errors of examination he took up a prayerbook in which was written eunice manston the book was nearly new and the date of the writing about a month earlier one point was at any rate established that the woman living with manston was presented to the world as no other than his lawful wife  the quiet villagers of carriford required no pewopener in their place of worship natives and indwellers had their own seats and strangers sat where they could graye took a seat in the nave on the north side close behind a pillar dividing it from the north aisle which was completely allotted to miss aldclyffe her farmers and her retainers manstons pew being in the midst of them owens position on the other side of the passage was a little in advance of manstons seat and so situated that by leaning forward he could look directly into the face of any person sitting there though if he sat upright he was wholly hidden from such a one by the intervening pillar  aiming to keep his presence unknown to manston if possible owen sat without once turning his head during the entrance of the congregation a rustling of silk round by the north passage and into manstons seat told him that some woman had entered there and as it seemed from the accompaniment of heavier footsteps manston was with her  immediately upon rising up he looked intently in that direction and saw a lady standing at the end of the seat nearest himself portions of manstons figure appeared on the other side of her in two glances graye read thus many of her characteristics and in the following order  she was a tall woman  she was broad at the shoulders  she was fullbosomed  she was easily recognizable from the photograph but nothing could be discerned of the colour of her eyes  with a preoccupied mind he withdrew into his nook and heard the service continuedonly conscious of the fact that in opposition to the suspicion which one odd circumstance had bred in his sister concerning this woman all ostensible and ordinary proofs and probabilities tended to the opposite conclusion there sat the genuine original of the portraitcould he wish for more cytherea wished for more eunice manstons eyes were blue and it was necessary that this womans eyes should be blue also  unskilled labour wastes in beating against the bars ten times the energy exerted by the practised hand in the effective direction owen felt this to be the case in his own and edwards attempts to follow up the clue afforded them think as he might he could not think of a crucial test in the matter absorbing him which should possess the indispensable attributea capability of being applied privately that in the event of its proving the lady to be the rightful owner of the name she used he might recede without obloquy from an untenable position  but to see mrs manstons eyes from where he sat was impossible and he could do nothing in the shape of a direct examination at present miss aldclyffe had possibly recognized him but manston had not and feeling that it was indispensable to keep the purport of his visit a secret from the steward he thought it would be as well too to keep his presence in the village a secret from him at any rate till the day was over  at the first opening of the doors graye left the church and wandered away into the fields to ponder on another scheme he could not call on farmer springrove as he had intended until this matter was set at rest two hours intervened between the morning and afternoon services  this time had nearly expired before owen had struck out any method of proceeding or could decide to run the risk of calling at the old house and asking to see mrs manston pointblank but he had drawn near the place and was standing still in the public path from which a partial view of the front of the building could be obtained when the bells began chiming for afternoon service whilst graye paused two persons came from the front door of the halfhidden dwelling whom he presently saw to be manston and his wife manston was wearing his old gardenhat and carried one of the monthly magazines under his arm immediately they had passed the gateway he branched off and went over the hill in a direction away from the church evidently intending to ramble along and read as the humour moved him the lady meanwhile turned in the other direction and went into the church path  owen resolved to make something of this opportunity he hurried along towards the church doubled round a sharp angle and came back upon the other path by which mrs manston must arrive  in about three minutes she appeared in sight without a veil he discovered as she drew nearer a difficulty which had not struck him at firstthat it is not an easy matter to particularize the colour of a strangers eyes in a merely casual encounter on a path out of doors that mrs manston must be brought close to him and not only so but to look closely at him if his purpose were to be accomplished  he shaped a plan it might by chance be effectual if otherwise it would not reveal his intention to her when mrs manston was within speaking distance he went up to her and said  will you kindly tell me which turning will take me to casterbridge  the second on the right said mrs manston  owen put on a blank look he held his hand to his earconveying to the lady the idea that he was deaf  she came closer and said more distinctly  the second turning on the right  owen flushed a little he fancied he had beheld the revelation he was in search of but had his eyes deceived him  once more he used the ruse still drawing nearer and intimating by a glance that the trouble he gave her was very distressing to him  how very deaf she murmured she exclaimed loudly  the second turning to the right  she had advanced her face to within a foot of his own and in speaking mouthed very emphatically fixing her eyes intently upon his and now his first suspicion was indubitably confirmed her eyes were as black as midnight  all this feigning was most distasteful to graye the riddle having been solved he unconsciously assumed his natural look before she had withdrawn her face she found him to be peering at her as if he would read her very soulexpressing with his eyes the notification of which apart from emotion the eyes are more capable than any otherinquiry  her face changed its expressionthen its colour the natural tint of the lighter portions sank to an ashy gray the pink of her cheeks grew purpler it was the precise result which would remain after blood had left the face of one whose skin was dark and artificially coated with pearlpowder and carmine  she turned her head and moved away murmuring a hasty reply to owens farewell remark of goodday and with a kind of nervous twitch lifting her hand and smoothing her hair which was of a lightbrown colour  she wears false hair he thought or has changed its colour artificially her true hair matched her eyes  and now in spite of what mr browns neighbours had said about nearly recognizing mrs manston on her recent visitwhich might have meant anything or nothing in spite of the photograph and in spite of his previous incredulity in consequence of the verse of her silence and backwardness at the visit to hoxton with manston and of her appearance and distress at the present moment graye had a conviction that the woman was an impostor  what could be manstons reason for such an astounding trick he could by no stretch of imagination divine  he changed his direction as soon as the woman was out of sight and plodded along the lanes homeward to tolchurch  one new idea was suggested to him by his desire to allay cythereas dread of being claimed and by the difficulty of believing that the first mrs manston lost her life as supposed notwithstanding the inquest and verdict was it possible that the real mrs manston who was known to be a philadelphian by birth had returned by the train to london as the porter had said and then left the country under an assumed name to escape that worst kind of widowhoodthe misery of being wedded to a fickle faithless and truant husband   in her complicated distress at the news brought by her brother cythereas thoughts at length reverted to her friend the rector of carriford she told owen of mr raunhams warmhearted behaviour towards herself and of his strongly expressed wish to aid her  he is not only a good but a sensible man we seem to want an old head on our side  and he is a magistrate said owen in a tone of concurrence he thought too that no harm could come of confiding in the rector but there was a difficulty in bringing about the confidence he wished that his sister and himself might both be present at an interview with mr raunham yet it would be unwise for them to call on him together in the sight of all the servants and parish of carriford  there could be no objection to their writing him a letter  no sooner was the thought born than it was carried out they wrote to him at once asking him to have the goodness to give them some advice they sadly needed and begging that he would accept their assurance that there was a real justification for the additional request they madethat instead of their calling upon him he would any evening of the week come to their cottage at tolchurch  2 march the twentieth six to nine oclock pm  two evenings later to the total disarrangement of his dinnerhour mr raunham appeared at owens door his arrival was hailed with genuine gratitude the horse was tied to the palings and the rector ushered indoors and put into the easychair  then graye told him the whole story reminding him that their first suspicions had been of a totally different nature and that in endeavouring to obtain proof of their truth they had stumbled upon marks which had surprised them into these new uncertainties thrice as marvellous as the first yet more prominent  cythereas heart was so full of anxiety that it superinduced a manner of confidence which was a deathblow to all formality mr raunham took her hand pityingly  it is a serious charge he said as a sort of original twig on which his thoughts might precipitate themselves  assuming for a moment that such a substitution was rendered an easy matter by fortuitous events he continued there is this consideration to be placed beside itwhat earthly motive can mr manston have had which would be sufficiently powerful to lead him to run such a very great risk the most abandoned roue could not at that particular crisis have taken such a reckless step for the mere pleasure of a new companion  owen had seen that difficulty about the motive cytherea had not  unfortunately for us the rector resumed no more evidence is to be obtained from the porter chinney i suppose you know what became of him he got to liverpool and embarked intending to work his way to america but on the passage he fell overboard and was drowned but there is no doubt of the truth of his confessionin fact his conduct tends to prove it trueand no moral doubt of the fact that the real mrs manston left here to go back by that mornings train this being the case then why if this woman is not she did she take no notice of the advertisementi mean not necessarily a friendly notice but from the information it afforded her have rendered it impossible that she should be personified without her own connivance  i think that argument is overthrown graye said by my earliest assumption of her hatred of him weariness of the chain which bound her to him and a resolve to begin the world anew lets suppose she has married another mansomewhere abroad say she would be silent for her own sake  youve hit the only genuine possibility said mr raunham tapping his finger upon his knee that would decidedly dispose of the second difficulty but his motive would be as mysterious as ever  cythereas pictured dreads would not allow her mind to follow their conversation shes burnt she said o yes i feari fear she is  i dont think we can seriously believe that now after what has happened said the rector  still straining her thought towards the worst then perhaps the first mrs manston was not his wife she returned and then i should be his wife just the same shouldnt i  they were married safely enough said owen there is abundance of circumstantial evidence to prove that  upon the whole said mr raunham i should advise your asking in a straightforward way for legal proof from the steward that the present woman is really his original wifea thing which to my mind you should have done at the outset he turned to cytherea kindly and asked her what made her give up her husband so unceremoniously  she could not tell the rector of her aversion to manston and of her unquenched love for edward  your terrified state no doubt he said answering for her in the manner of those accustomed to the pulpit but into such a solemn compact as marriage allimportant considerations both legally and morally enter it was your duty to have seen everything clearly proved doubtless mr manston is prepared with proofs but as it concerns nobody but yourself that her identity should be publicly established and by your absenteeism you act as if you were satisfied he has not troubled to exhibit them nobody else has taken the trouble to prove what does not affect them in the leastthats the way of the world always you who should have required all things to be made clear ran away  that was partly my doing said owen  the same explanationher want of love for manstonapplied here too but she shunned the revelation  but never mind added the rector it was all the greater credit to your womanhood perhaps i say then get your brother to write a line to mr manston saying you wish to be satisfied that all is legally clear in case you should want to marry again for instance and i have no doubt that you will be or if you would rather ill write myself  o no sir no pleaded cytherea beginning to blanch and breathing quickly please dont say anything let me live here with owen i am so afraid it will turn out that i shall have to go to knapwater and be his wife and i dont want to go do conceal what we have told you let him continue his deceptionit is much the best for me  mr raunham at length divined that her love for manston if it had ever existed had transmuted itself into a very different feeling now  at any rate he said as he took his leave and mounted his mare i will see about it rest content miss graye and depend upon it that i will not lead you into difficulty  conceal it she still pleaded  well seebut of course i must do my duty  nodont do your duty she looked up at him through the gloom illuminating her own face and eyes with the candle she held  i will consider then said mr raunham sensibly moved he turned his horses head bade them a warm adieu and left the door  the rector of carriford trotted homewards under the cold and clear march sky its countless stars fluttering like bright birds he was unconscious of the scene recovering from the effect of cythereas voice and glance of entreaty he laid the subject of the interview clearly before himself  the suspicions of cytherea and owen were honest and had foundationthat he must own was hea clergyman magistrate and conscientious manjustified in yielding to cythereas importunities to keep silence because she dreaded the possibility of a return to manston was she wise in her request holding her present belief and with no definite evidence either way she could for one thing never conscientiously marry any one else suppose that cytherea were manstons wifeie that the first wife was really burnt the adultery of manston would be proved and mr raunham thought cruelty sufficient to bring the case within the meaning of the statute suppose the new woman was as stated mr manstons restored wife cytherea was perfectly safe as a single woman whose marriage had been void and if it turned out that though this woman was not manstons wife his wife was still living as owen had suggested in america or elsewhere cytherea was safe  the first supposition opened up the worst contingency was she really safe as manstons wife doubtful but however that might be the gentle defenceless girl whom it seemed nobodys business to help or defend should be put in a track to proceed against this man she had but one life and the superciliousness with which all the world now regarded her should be compensated in some measure by the man whose carelessnessto set him in the best lighthad caused it  mr raunham felt more and more positively that his duty must be done an inquiry must be made into the matter immediately on reaching home he sat down and wrote a plain and friendly letter to mr manston and despatched it at once to him by hand then he flung himself back in his chair and went on with his meditation was there anything in the suspicion there could be nothing surely nothing is done by a clever man without a motive and what conceivable motive could manston have for such abnormal conduct corinthian that he might be who had preyed on virginity like st georges dragon he would never have been absurd enough to venture on such a course for the possession alone of the womanthere was no reason for itshe was inferior to cytherea in every respect physical and mental  on the other hand it seemed rather odd when he analyzed the action that a woman who deliberately hid herself from her husband for more than a twelvemonth should be brought back by a mere advertisement in fact the whole business had worked almost too smoothly and effectually for unpremeditated sequence it was too much like the indiscriminate righting of everything at the end of an old play and there was that curious business of the keys and watch her way of accounting for their being left behind by forgetfulness had always seemed to him rather forced the only unforced explanation was that suggested by the newspaper writersthat she left them behind on purpose to blind people as to her escape a motive which would have clashed with the possibility of her being fished back by an advertisement as the present woman had been again there were the two charred bones he shuffled the books and papers in his study and walked about the room restlessly musing on the same subject the parlourmaid entered  can young mr springrove from london see you tonight sir  young mr springrove said the rector surprised  yes sir  yes of course he can see me tell him to come in  edward came so impatiently into the room as to show that the few short moments his announcement had occupied had been irksome to him he stood in the doorway with the same black bag in his hand and the same old gray cloak on his shoulders that he had worn fifteen months earlier when returning on the night of the fire this appearance of his conveyed a true impression he had become a stagnant man but he was excited now  i have this moment come from london he said as the door was closed behind him  the prophetic insight which so strangely accompanies critical experiences prompted mr raunhams reply  about the grayes and manston  yes that woman is not mrs manston  prove it  i can prove that she is somebody elsethat her name is anne seaway  and are their suspicions true indeed  and i can do whats more to the purpose at present  suggest manstons motive  only suggest it remember but my assumption fits so perfectly with the facts that have been secretly unearthed and conveyed to me that i can hardly conceive of another  there was in edwards bearing that entire unconsciousness of himself which natural to wild animals only prevails in a sensitive man at moments of extreme intentness the rector saw that he had no trivial story to communicate whatever the story was  sit down said mr raunham my mind has been on the stretch all the evening to form the slightest guess at such an object and all to no purposeentirely to no purpose have you said anything to owen graye  nothingnor to anybody i could not trust to the effect a letter might have upon yourself either the intricacy of the case brings me to this interview  whilst springrove had been speaking the two had sat down together the conversation hitherto distinct to every corner of the room was carried on now in tones so low as to be scarcely audible to the interlocutors and in phrases which hesitated to complete themselves threequarters of an hour passed then edward arose came out of the rectors study and again flung his cloak around him instead of going thence homeward he went first to the carriford road station with a telegram having despatched which he proceeded to his fathers house for the first time since his arrival in the village  3 from nine to ten oclock pm  the next presentation is the interior of the old house on the evening of the preceding section the steward was sitting by his parlour fire and had been reading the letter arrived from the rectory opposite to him sat the woman known to the village and neighbourhood as mrs manston  things are looking desperate with us he said gloomily his gloom was not that of the hypochondriac but the legitimate gloom which has its origin in a syllogism as he uttered the words he handed the letter to her  i almost expected some such news as this she replied in a tone of much greater indifference i knew suspicion lurked in the eyes of that young man who stared at me so in the church path i could have sworn it  manston did not answer for some time his face was worn and haggard latterly his head had not been carried so uprightly as of old if they prove you to bewho you are yes if they do he murmured  they must not find that out she said in a positive voice and looking at him but supposing they do the trick does not seem to me to be so serious as to justify that wretched miserable horrible look of yours it makes my flesh creep it is perfectly deathlike  he did not reply and she continued if they say and prove that eunice is indeed livingand dear you know she isshe is sure to come back  this remark seemed to awaken and irritate him to speech again as he had done a hundred times during their residence together he categorized the events connected with the fire at the three tranters he dwelt on every incident of that nights history and endeavoured with an anxiety which was extraordinary in the apparent circumstances to prove that his wife must by the very nature of things have perished in the flames she arose from her seat crossed the hearthrug and set herself to soothe him then she whispered that she was still as unbelieving as ever come supposing she escapedjust supposing she escapedwhere is she coaxed the lady  why are you so curious continually said manston  because i am a woman and want to know now where is she  in the flying isle of san borandan  witty cruelty is the cruellest of any ah wellif she is in england she will come back  she is not in england  but she will come back  no she wont come madam he said arousing himself i shall not answer any more questions  ahahahshe is not dead the woman murmured again poutingly  she is i tell you  i dont think so love  she was burnt i tell you he exclaimed  now to please me admit the bare possibility of her being alivejust the possibility  o yesto please you i will admit that he said quickly yes i admit the possibility of her being alive to please you  she looked at him in utter perplexity the words could only have been said in jest and yet they seemed to savour of a tone the furthest remove from jesting there was his face plain to her eyes but no information of any kind was to be read there  it is only natural that i should be curious she murmured pettishly if i resemble her as much as you say i do  you are handsomer he said though you are about her own height and size but dont worry yourself you must know that you are body and soul united with me though you are but my housekeeper  she bridled a little at the remark wife she said most certainly wife since you cannot dismiss me without losing your character and position and incurring heavy penalties  i own itit was well said though mistakenlyvery mistakenly  dont riddle to me about mistakenly and such dark things now what was your motive dearest in running the risk of having me here  your beauty he said  she thanks you much for the compliment but will not take it come what was your motive  your wit  no no not my wit wit would have made a wife of me by this time instead of what i am  your virtue  or virtue either  i tell you it was your beautyreally  but i cannot help seeing and hearing and if what people say is true i am not nearly so goodlooking as cytherea and several years older  the aspect of manstons face at these words from her was so confirmatory of her hint that his forced reply of o no tended to develop her chagrin  mere liking or love for me she resumed would not have sprung up all of a sudden as your pretended passion did you had been to london several times between the time of the fire and your marriage with cythereayou had never visited me or thought of my existence or cared that i was out of a situation and poor but the week after you married her and were separated from her off you rush to make love to menot first to me either for you went to several places  no not several places  yes you told me so yourselfthat you went first to the only lodging in which your wife had been known as mrs manston and when you found that the lodginghousekeeper had gone away and died and that nobody else in the street had any definite ideas as to your wifes personal appearance and came and proposed the arrangement we carried outthat i should personate her your taking all this trouble shows that something more serious than love had to do with the matter  humbugwhat trouble after all did i take when i found cytherea would not stay with me after the wedding i was much put out at being left alone again was that unnatural  no  and those favouring accidents you mentionthat nobody knew my first wifeseemed an arrangement of providence for our mutual benefit and merely perfected a halfformed impulsethat i should call you my first wife to escape the scandal that would have arisen if you had come here as anything else  my love that story wont do if mrs manston was burnt cytherea whom you love better than me could have been compelled to live with you as your lawful wife if she was not burnt why should you run the risk of her turning up again at any moment and exposing your substitution of me and ruining your name and prospects  whybecause i might have loved you well enough to run the risk assuming her not to be burnt which i deny  noyou would have run the risk the other way you would rather have risked her finding you with cytherea as a second wife than with me as a personator of herselfthe first one  you came easiest to handremember that  not so very easy either considering the labour you took to teach me your first wifes history all about how she was a native of philadelphia then making me read up the guidebook to philadelphia and details of american life and manners in case the birthplace and history of your wife eunice should ever become known in this neighbourhoodunlikely as it was ah and then about the handwriting of hers that i had to imitate and the dying my hair and rouging to make the transformation complete you mean to say that that was taking less trouble than there would have been in arranging events to make cytherea believe herself your wife and live with you  you were a needy adventuress who would dare anything for a new pleasure and an easy lifeand i was fool enough to give in to you  good heavens abovedid i ask you to insert those advertisements for your old wife and to make me answer it as if i was she did i ask you to send me the letter for me to copy and send back to you when the third advertisement appearedpurporting to come from the longlost wife and giving a detailed history of her escape and subsequent lifeall which you had invented yourself you deluded me into loving you and then enticed me here ah and this is another thing how did you know the real wife wouldnt answer it and upset all your plans  because i knew she was burnt  why didnt you force cytherea to come back then now my love i have caught you and you may just as well tell first as last what was your motive in having me here as your first wife  silence he exclaimed  she was silent for the space of two minutes and then persisted in going on to mutter and why was it that miss aldclyffe allowed her favourite young lady cythie to be overthrown and supplanted without an expostulation or any show of sympathy do you know i often think you exercise a secret power over miss aldclyffe and she always shuns me as if i shared the power a poor illused creature like me sharing power indeed  she thinks you are mrs manston  that wouldnt make her avoid me  yes it would he exclaimed impatiently i wish i was deaddead he had jumped up from his seat in uttering the words and now walked wearily to the end of the room coming back more decisively he looked in her face  we must leave this place if raunham suspects what i think he does he said the request of cytherea and her brother may simply be for a satisfactory proof to make her feel legally freebut it may mean more  what may it mean  how should i know  well well never mind old boy she said approaching him to make up the quarrel dont be so alarmedanybody would think that you were the woman and i the man suppose they do find out what i amwe can go away from here and keep house as usual people will say of you his first wife was burnt to death or ran away to the colonies as the case may be he married a second and deserted her for anne seaway a very everyday casenothing so horrible after all  he made an impatient movement whichever way we do it nobody must know that you are not my wife eunice and now i must think about arranging matters  manston then retired to his office and shut himself up for the remainder of the evening     xix the events of a day and night  1 march the twentyfirst morning  next morning the steward went out as usual he shortly told his companion anne that he had almost matured their scheme and that they would enter upon the details of it when he came home at night the fortunate fact that the rectors letter did not require an immediate answer would give him time to consider  anne seaway then began her duties in the house besides daily superintending the cook and housemaid one of these duties was at rare intervals to dust manstons office with her own hands a servant being supposed to disturb the books and papers unnecessarily she softly wandered from table to shelf with the duster in her hand afterwards standing in the middle of the room and glancing around to discover if any noteworthy collection of dust had still escaped her  her eye fell upon a faint layer which rested upon the ledge of an oldfashioned chestnut cabinet of french renaissance workmanship placed in a recess by the fireplace at a height of about four feet from the floor the upper portion of the front receded forming the ledge alluded to on which opened at each end two small doors the centre space between them being filled out by a panel of similar size making the third of three squares the dust on the ledge was nearly on a level with the womans eye and though insignificant in quantity showed itself distinctly on account of this obliquity of vision now opposite the central panel concentric quartercircles were traced in the deposited film expressing to her that this panel too was a door like the others that it had lately been opened and had skimmed the dust with its lower edge  at last then her curiosity was slightly rewarded for the right of the matter was that anne had been incited to this exploration of manstons office rather by a wish to know the reason of his long seclusion here after the arrival of the rectors letter and their subsequent discourse than by any immediate desire for cleanliness still there would have been nothing remarkable to anne in this sight but for one recollection manston had once casually told her that each of the two sidelockers included half the middle space the panel of which did not open and was only put in for symmetry it was possible that he had opened this compartment by candlelight the preceding night or he would have seen the marks in the dust and effaced them that he might not be proved guilty of telling her an untruth she balanced herself on one foot and stood pondering she considered that it was very vexing and unfair in him to refuse her all knowledge of his remaining secrets under the peculiar circumstances of her connection with him she went close to the cabinet as there was no keyhole the door must be capable of being opened by the unassisted hand the circles in the dust told her at which edge to apply her force here she pulled with the tips of her fingers but the panel would not come forward she fetched a chair and looked over the top of the cabinet but no bolt knob or spring was to be seen  o never mind she said with indifference ill ask him about it and he will tell me down she came and turned away then looking back again she thought it was absurd such a trifle should puzzle her she retraced her steps and opened a drawer beneath the ledge of the cabinet pushing in her hand and feeling about on the underside of the board  here she found a small round sinking and pressed her finger into it nothing came of the pressure she withdrew her hand and looked at the tip of her finger it was marked with the impress of the circle and in addition a line ran across it diametrically  how stupid of me it is the head of a screw whatever mysterious contrivance had originally existed for opening the puny cupboard of the cabinet it had at some time been broken and this rough substitute provided stimulated curiosity would not allow her to recede now she fetched a screwdriver withdrew the screw pulled the door open with a penknife and found inside a cavity about ten inches square the cavity contained  letters from different women with unknown signatures christian names only surnames being despised in paphos letters from his wife eunice letters from anne herself including that she wrote in answer to his advertisement a small pocketbook sundry scraps of paper  the letters from the strange women with pet names she glanced carelessly through and then put them aside they were too similar to her own regretted delusion and curiosity requires contrast to excite it  the letters from his wife were next examined they were dated back as far as eunices first meeting with manston and the early ones before their marriage contained the usual pretty effusions of women at such a period of their existence some little time after he had made her his wife and when he had come to knapwater the series began again and now their contents arrested her attention more forcibly she closed the cabinet carried the letters into the parlour reclined herself on the sofa and carefully perused them in the order of their dates                                               john street                                                    october 17 1864  my dearest husbandi received your hurried line of yesterday and was of course content with it but why dont you tell me your exact address instead of that postoffice budmouth this matter is all a mystery to me and i ought to be told every detail i cannot fancy it is the same kind of occupation you have been used to hitherto your command that i am to stay here awhile until you can see how things look and can arrange to send for me i must necessarily abide by but if as you say a married man would have been rejected by the person who engaged you and that hence my existence must be kept a secret until you have secured your position why did you think of going at all  the truth is this keeping our marriage a secret is troublesome vexing and wearisome to me i see the poorest woman in the street bearing her husbands name openlyliving with him in the most matteroffact ease and why shouldnt i i wish i was back again in liverpool  today i bought a grey waterproof cloak i think it is a little too long for me but it was cheap for one of such a quality the weather is gusty and dreary and till this morning i had hardly set foot outside the door since you left please do tell me when i am to comevery affectionately yours eunice                                                john street                                                     october 25 1864  my dear husbandwhy dont you write do you hate me i have not had the heart to do anything this last week that i your wife should be in this strait and my husband well to do i have been obliged to leave my first lodging for debtamong other things they charged me for a lot of brandy which i am quite sure i did not taste then i went to camberwell and was found out by them i went away privately from thence and changed my name the second time i am now mrs rondley but the new lodging was the wretchedest and dearest i ever set foot in and i left it after being there only a day i am now at no 20 in the same street that you left me in originally all last night the sash of my window rattled so dreadfully that i could not sleep but i had not energy enough to get out of bed to stop it this morning i have been walkingi dont know how farbut far enough to make my feet ache i have been looking at the outside of two or three of the theatres but they seem forbidding if i regard them with the eye of an actress in search of an engagement though you said i was to think no more of the stage i believe you would not care if you found me there but i am not an actress by nature and art will never make me one i am too timid and retiring i was intended for a cottagers wife i certainly shall not try to go on the boards again whilst i am in this strange place the idea of being brought on as far as london and then left here alone why didnt you leave me in liverpool perhaps you thought i might have told somebody that my real name was mrs manston as if i had a living friend to whom i could impart itno such good fortune in fact my nearest friend is no nearer than what most people would call a stranger but perhaps i ought to tell you that a week before i wrote my last letter to you after wishing that my uncle and aunt in philadelphia the only near relatives i had were still alive i suddenly resolved to send a line to my cousin james who i believe is still living in that neighbourhood he has never seen me since we were babies together i did not tell him of my marriage because i thought you might not like it and i gave my real maiden name and an address at the postoffice here but god knows if the letter will ever reach him  do write me an answer and send somethingyour affectionate wife eunice                                                   friday october 28  my dear husbandthe order for ten pounds has just come and i am truly glad to get it but why will you write so bitterly ahwell if i had only had the money i should have been on my way to america by this time so dont think i want to bore you of my own freewill who can you have met with at that new place remember i say this in no malignant tone but certainly the facts go to prove that you have deserted me you are inconstanti know it o why are you so now i have lost you i love you in spite of your neglect i am weakly fondthats my nature i fear that upon the whole my life has been wasted i know there is another woman supplanting me in your heartyes i know it come to medo come eunice                                         41 charles square hoxton                                                    november 19  dear aeneashere i am back again after my visit why should you have been so enraged at my finding your exact address any woman would have tried to do ityou know she would have and no woman would have lived under assumed names so long as i did i repeat that i did not call myself mrs manston until i came to this lodging at the beginning of this monthwhat could you expect  a helpless creature i had not fortune favoured me unexpectedly banished as i was from your house at dawn i did not suppose the indignity was about to lead to important results but in crossing the park i overheard the conversation of a young man and woman who had also risen early i believe her to be the girl who has won you away from me well their conversation concerned you and miss aldclyffe very peculiarly the remarkable thing is that you yourself without knowing it told me of what added to their conversation completely reveals a secret to me that neither of you understand two negatives never made such a telling positive before one clue more and you would see it a single consideration prevents my revealing itjust one doubt as to whether your ignorance was real and was not feigned to deceive me civility now please eunice                                             41 charles square                                                tuesday november 22  my darling husbandmonday will suit me excellently for coming i have acted exactly up to your instructions and have sold my rubbish at the brokers in the next street all this movement and bustle is delightful to me after the weeks of monotony i have endured it is a relief to wish the place goodbyelondon always has seemed so much more foreign to me than liverpool the midday train on monday will do nicely for me i shall be anxiously looking out for you on sunday night  i hope so much that you are not angry with me for writing to miss aldclyffe you are not dear are you forgive meyour loving wife eunice   this was the last of the letters from the wife to the husband one other in mrs manstons handwriting and in the same packet was differently addressed                                       three tranters inn carriford                                                   november 28 1864  dear cousin jamesthank you indeed for answering my letter so promptly when i called at the postoffice yesterday i did not in the least think there would be one but i must leave this subject i write again at once under the strangest and saddest conditions it is possible to conceive  i did not tell you in my last that i was a married woman dont blame meit was my husbands influence i hardly know where to begin my story i had been living apart from him for a timethen he sent for me this was last week and i was glad to go to him then this is what he did he promised to fetch me and did notleaving me to do the journey alone he promised to meet me at the station herehe did not i went on through the darkness to his house and found his door locked and himself away from home i have been obliged to come here and i write to you in a strange room in a strange village inn i choose the present moment to write to drive away my misery sorrow seems a sort of pleasure when you detail it on paperpoor pleasure though  but this is what i want to knowand i am ashamed to tell it i would gladly do as you say and come to you as a housekeeper but i have not the money even for a steerage passage james do you want me badly enoughdo you pity me enough to send it i could manage to subsist in london upon the proceeds of my sale for another month or six weeks will you send it to the same address at the postoffice but how do i know that you  thus the letter ended from creases in the paper it was plain that the writer having got so far had become dissatisfied with her production and had crumpled it in her hand was it to write another or not to write at all  the next thing anne seaway perceived was that the fragmentary story she had coaxed out of manston to the effect that his wife had left england for america might be truthful according to two of these letters corroborated by the evidence of the railwayporter and yet at first he had sworn in a passion that his wife was most certainly consumed in the fire  if she had been burnt this letter written in her bedroom and probably thrust into her pocket when she relinquished it would have been burnt with her nothing was surer than that why then did he say she was burnt and never show anne herself this letter  the question suddenly raised a new and much stranger onekindling a burst of amazement in her how did manston become possessed of this letter  that fact of possession was certainly the most remarkable revelation of all in connection with this epistle and perhaps had something to do with his reason for never showing it to her  she knew by several proofs that before his marriage with cytherea and up to the time of the porters confession manston believedhonestly believedthat cytherea would be his lawful wife and hence of course that his wife eunice was dead so that no communication could possibly have passed between his wife and himself from the first moment that he believed her dead on the night of the fire to the day of his wedding and yet he had that letter how soon afterwards could they have communicated with each other  the existence of the letteras much as or more than its contentsimplying that mrs manston was not burnt his belief in that calamity must have terminated at the moment he obtained possession of the letter if no earlier was then the only solution to the riddle that anne could discern the true onethat he had communicated with his wife somewhere about the commencement of annes residence with him or at any time since  it was the most unlikely thing on earth that a woman who had forsaken her husband should countenance his scheme to personify herwhether she were in america in london or in the neighbourhood of knapwater  then came the old and harassing question what was manstons real motive in risking his name on the deception he was practising as regarded anne it could not be as he had always pretended mere passion her thoughts had reverted to mr raunhams letter asking for proofs of her identity with the original mrs manston she could see no loophole of escape for the man who supported her true in her own estimation his worst alternative was not so very bad after allthe getting the name of libertine a possible appearance in the divorce or some other court of law and a question of damages such an exposure might hinder his worldly progress for some time yet to him this alternative was apparently terrible as death itself  she restored the letters to their hidingplace scanned anew the other letters and memoranda from which she could gain no fresh information fastened up the cabinet and left everything in its former condition  her mind was ill at ease more than ever she wished that she had never seen manston where the person suspected of mysterious moral obliquity is the possessor of great physical and intellectual attractions the mere sense of incongruity adds an extra shudder to dread the mans strange bearing terrified anne as it had terrified cytherea for with all the woman annes faults she had not descended to such depths of depravity as to willingly participate in crime she had not even known that a living wife was being displaced till her arrival at knapwater put retreat out of the question and had looked upon personation simply as a mode of subsistence a degree better than toiling in poverty and alone after a bustling and somewhat pampered life as housekeeper in a gay mansion                non illa colo calathisve minervae       foemineas assueta manus  2 afternoon  mr raunham and edward springrove had by this time set in motion a machinery which they hoped to find working out important results  the rector was restless and full of meditation all the following morning it was plain even to the servants about him that springroves communication wore a deeper complexion than any that had been made to the old magistrate for many months or years past the fact was that having arrived at the stage of existence in which the difficult intellectual feat of suspending ones judgment becomes possible he was now putting it in practice though not without the penalty of watchful effort  it was not till the afternoon that he determined to call on his relative miss aldclyffe and cautiously probe her knowledge of the subject occupying him so thoroughly cytherea he knew was still beloved by this solitary woman miss aldclyffe had made several private inquiries concerning her former companion and there was ever a sadness in her tone when the young ladys name was mentioned which showed that from whatever cause the elder cythereas renunciation of her favourite and namesake proceeded it was not from indifference to her fate  have you ever had any reason for supposing your steward anything but an upright man he said to the lady  never the slightest have you said she reservedly  welli have  what is it  i can say nothing plainly because nothing is proved but my suspicions are very strong  do you mean that he was rather cool towards his wife when they were first married and that it was unfair in him to leave her i know he was but i think his recent conduct towards her has amply atoned for the neglect  he looked miss aldclyffe full in the face it was plain that she spoke honestly she had not the slightest notion that the woman who lived with the steward might be other than mrs manstonmuch less that a greater matter might be behind  thats not iti wish it was no more my suspicion is first that the woman living at the old house is not mr manstons wife  notmr manstons wife  that is it  miss aldclyffe looked blankly at the rector not mr manstons wifewho else can she be she said simply  an improper woman of the name of anne seaway  mr raunham had in common with other people noticed the extraordinary interest of miss aldclyffe in the wellbeing of her steward and had endeavoured to account for it in various ways the extent to which she was shaken by his information whilst it proved that the understanding between herself and manston did not make her a sharer of his secrets also showed that the tie which bound her to him was still unbroken mr raunham had lately begun to doubt the latter fact and now on finding himself mistaken regretted that he had not kept his own counsel in the matter this it was too late to do and he pushed on with his proofs he gave miss aldclyffe in detail the grounds of his belief  before he had done she recovered the cloak of reserve that she had adopted on his opening the subject  i might possibly be convinced that you were in the right after such an elaborate argument she replied were it not for one fact which bears in the contrary direction so pointedly that nothing but absolute proof can turn it it is that there is no conceivable motive which could induce any sane manleaving alone a man of mr manstons clearheadedness and integrityto venture upon such an extraordinary course of conductno motive on earth  that was my own opinion till after the visit of a friend last nighta friend of mine and poor little cythereas  ahand cytherea said miss aldclyffe catching at the idea raised by the name that he loved cythereayes and loves her now wildly and devotedly i am as positive as that i breathe cytherea is years younger than mrs manstonas i shall call hertwice as sweet in disposition three times as beautiful would he have given her up quietly and suddenly for a commonmr raunham your story is monstrous and i dont believe it she glowed in her earnestness  the rector might now have advanced his second propositionthe possible motivebut for reasons of his own he did not  very well madam i only hope that facts will sustain you in your belief ask him the question to his face whether the woman is his wife or no and see how he receives it  i will tomorrow most certainly she said i always let these things die of wholesome ventilation as every fungus does  but no sooner had the rector left her presence than the grain of mustardseed he had sown grew to a tree her impatience to set her mind at rest could not brook a nights delay it was with the utmost difficulty that she could wait till evening arrived to screen her movements immediately the sun had dropped behind the horizon and before it was quite dark she wrapped her cloak around her softly left the house and walked erect through the gloomy park in the direction of the old manorhouse  the same minute saw two persons sit down in the rectoryhouse to share the rectors usually solitary dinner one was a man of official appearance commonplace in all except his eyes the other was edward springrove   the discovery of the carefullyconcealed letters rankled in the mind of anne seaway her womans nature insisted that manston had no right to keep all matters connected with his lost wife a secret from herself perplexity had bred vexation vexation resentment curiosity had been continuous the whole morning this resentment and curiosity increased  the steward said very little to his companion during their luncheon at midday he seemed reckless of appearancesalmost indifferent to whatever fate awaited him all his actions betrayed that something portentous was impending and still he explained nothing by carefully observing every trifling action as only a woman can observe them the thought at length dawned upon her that he was going to run away secretly she feared for herself her knowledge of law and justice was vague and she fancied she might in some way be made responsible for him  in the afternoon he went out of the house again and she watched him drive away in the direction of the countytown she felt a desire to go there herself and after an interval of halfanhour followed him on foot notwithstanding the distanceostensibly to do some shopping  one among her several trivial errands was to make a small purchase at the druggists near the druggists stood the county bank looking out of the shop window between the coloured bottles she saw manston come down the steps of the bank in the act of withdrawing his hand from his pocket and pulling his coat close over its mouth  it is an almost universal habit with people when leaving a bank to be carefully adjusting their pockets if they have been receiving money if they have been paying it in their hands swing laxly the steward had in all likelihood been taking moneypossibly on miss aldclyffes accountthat was continual with him and he might have been removing his own as a man would do who was intending to leave the country  3 from five to eight oclock pm  anne reached home again in time to preside over preparations for dinner manston came in halfanhour later the lamp was lighted the shutters were closed and they sat down together he was pale and wornalmost haggard  the meal passed off in almost unbroken silence when preoccupation withstands the influence of a social meal with one pleasant companion the mental scene must be surpassingly vivid just as she was rising a tap came to the door  before a maid could attend to the knock manston crossed the room and answered it himself the visitor was miss aldclyffe  manston instantly came back and spoke to anne in an undertone i should be glad if you could retire to your room for a short time  it is a dry starlight evening she replied i will go for a little walk if your object is merely a private conversation with miss aldclyffe  very well do theres no accounting for tastes he said a few commonplaces then passed between her and miss aldclyffe and anne went upstairs to bonnet and cloak herself she came down opened the front door and went out  she looked around to realize the night it was dark mournful and quiet then she stood still from the moment that manston had requested her absence a strong and burning desire had prevailed in her to know the subject of miss aldclyffes conversation with him simple curiosity was not entirely what inspired her her suspicions had been thoroughly aroused by the discovery of the morning a conviction that her future depended on her power to combat a man who in desperate circumstances would be far from a friend to her prompted a strategic movement to acquire the important secret that was in handling now the woman thought and thought and regarded the dull dark trees anxiously debating how the thing could be done  stealthily reopening the front door she entered the hall and advancing and pausing alternately came close to the door of the room in which miss aldclyffe and manston conversed nothing could be heard through the keyhole or panels at a great risk she softly turned the knob and opened the door to a width of about halfaninch performing the act so delicately that three minutes at least were occupied in completing it at that instant miss aldclyffe said  theres a draught somewhere the door is ajar i think  anne glided back under the staircase manston came forward and closed the door this chance was now cut off and she considered again the parlour or sittingroom in which the conference took place had the windowshutters fixed on the outside of the window as is usual in the back portions of old countryhouses the shutters were hinged one on each side of the opening and met in the middle where they were fastened by a bolt passing continuously through them and the wood mullion within the bolt being secured on the inside by a pin which was seldom inserted till manston and herself were about to retire for the night sometimes not at all  if she returned to the door of the room she might be discovered at any moment but could she listen at the window which overlooked a part of the garden never visited after nightfall she would be safe from disturbance the idea was worth a trial  she glided round to the window took the head of the bolt between her finger and thumb and softly screwed it round until it was entirely withdrawn from its position the shutters remained as before whilst where the bolt had come out was now a shining hole threequarters of an inch in diameter through which one might see into the middle of the room she applied her eye to the orifice  miss aldclyffe and manston were both standing manston with his back to the window his companion facing it the ladys demeanour was severe condemnatory and haughty no more was to be seen anne then turned sideways leant with her shoulder against the shutters and placed her ear upon the hole  you know where said miss aldclyffe and how could you a man act a double deceit like this  men do strange things sometimes  what was your reasoncome  a mere whim  i might even believe that if the woman were handsomer than cytherea or if you had been married some time to cytherea and had grown tired of her  and cant you believe it too under these conditions that i married cytherea gave her up because i heard that my wife was alive found that my wife would not come to live with me and then not to let any woman i love so well as cytherea run any risk of being displaced and ruined in reputation should my wife ever think fit to return induced this woman to come to me as being better than no companion at all  i cannot believe it your love for cytherea was not of such a kind as that excuse would imply it was cytherea or nobody with you as an object of passion you did not desire the company of this anne seaway at all and certainly not so much as to madly risk your reputation by bringing her here in the way you have done i am sure you didnt aeneas  so am i he said bluntly  miss aldclyffe uttered an exclamation of astonishment the confession was like a blow in its suddenness she began to reproach him bitterly and with tears  how could you overthrow my plans disgrace the only girl i ever had any respect for by such inexplicable doings that woman must leave this placethe country perhaps heavens the truth will leak out in a day or two  she must do no such thing and the truth must be stifled somehownobody knows how if i stay here or on any spot of the civilized globe as aeneas manston this woman must live with me as my wife or i am damned past redemption  i will not countenance your keeping her whatever your motive may be  you must do something he murmured you must yes you must  i never will she said it is a criminal act  he looked at her earnestly will you not support me through this deception if my very life depends upon it will you not  nonsense life it will be a scandal to you but she must leave this place it will out sooner or later and the exposure had better come now  manston repeated gloomily the same words my life depends upon your supporting memy very life  he then came close to her and spoke into her ear whilst he spoke he held her head to his mouth with both his hands strange expressions came over her face the workings of her mouth were painful to observe still he held her and whispered on  the only words that could be caught by anne seaway confused as her hearing frequently was by the moan of the wind and the waterfall in her outer ear were these of miss aldclyffe in tones which absolutely quivered they have no money what can they prove  the listener tasked herself to the utmost to catch his answer but it was in vain of the remainder of the colloquy one fact alone was plain to anne and that only inductivelythat miss aldclyffe from what he had revealed to her was going to scheme body and soul on manstons behalf  miss aldclyffe seemed now to have no further reason for remaining yet she lingered awhile as if loth to leave him when finally the crestfallen and agitated lady made preparations for departure anne quickly inserted the bolt ran round to the entrance archway and down the steps into the park here she stood close to the trunk of a huge limetree which absorbed her dark outline into its own  in a few minutes she saw manston with miss aldclyffe leaning on his arm cross the glade before her and proceed in the direction of the house she watched them ascend the rise and advance as two black spots towards the mansion the appearance of an oblong space of light in the dark mass of walls denoted that the door was opened miss aldclyffes outline became visible upon it the door shut her in and all was darkness again the form of manston returning alone arose from the gloom and passed by anne in her hidingplace  waiting outside a quarter of an hour longer that no suspicion of any kind might be excited anne returned to the old manorhouse  4 from eight to eleven oclock pm  manston was very friendly that evening it was evident to her now that she was behind the scenes that he was making desperate efforts to disguise the real state of his mind  her terror of him did not decrease they sat down to supper manston still talking cheerfully but what is keener than the eye of a mistrustful woman a mans cunning is to it as was the armour of sisera to the thin tentnail she found in spite of his adroitness that he was attempting something more than a disguise of his feeling he was trying to distract her attention that he might be unobserved in some special movement of his hands  what a moment it was for her then the whole surface of her body became attentive she allowed him no chance whatever we know the duplicated condition at such timeswhen the existence divides itself into two and the ostensibly innocent chatterer stands in front like another person to hide the timorous spy  manston played the same game but more palpably the meal was nearly over when he seemed possessed of a new idea of how his object might be accomplished he tilted back his chair with a reflective air and looked steadily at the clock standing against the wall opposite to him he said sententiously few faces are capable of expressing more by dumb show than the face of a clock you may see in it every variety of incentivefrom the softest seductions to negligence to the strongest hints for action  well in what way she inquired his drift was as yet quite unintelligible to her  why for instance look at the cold methodical unromantic businesslike air of all the rightangled positions of the hands they make a man set about work in spite of himself then look at the piquant shyness of its face when the two hands are over each other several attitudes imply make ready the make ready of ten minutes to one differs from the make ready of ten minutes to twelve as youth differs from age upward and onward says twentyfive minutes to eleven midday or midnight expresses distinctly it is done you surely have noticed that  yes i have  he continued with affected quaintness  the easy dash of ten minutes past seven the rakish recklessness of a quarter past the drooping weariness of twentyfive minutes past must have been observed by everybody  whatever amount of truth there may be there is a good deal of imagination in your fancy she said  he still contemplated the clock  then again the general finish of the face has a great effect upon the eye this oldfashioned brassfaced one we have here with its arched top halfmoon slit for the day of the month and ship rocking at the upper part impresses me with the notion of its being an old cynic elevating his brows whose thoughts can be seen wavering between good and evil  a thought now enlightened her the clock was behind her and he wanted to get her back turned she dreaded turning yet not to excite his suspicion she was on her guard she quickly looked behind her at the clock as he spoke recovering her old position again instantly the time had not been long enough for any action whatever on his part  ah he casually remarked and at the same minute began to pour her out a glass of wine speaking of the clock has reminded me that it must nearly want winding up remember that it is wound tonight suppose you do it at once my dear  there was no possible way of evading the act she resolutely turned to perform the operation anything was better than that he should suspect her it was an oldfashioned eightday clock of workmanship suited to the rest of the antique furniture that manston had collected there and ground heavily during winding  anne had given up all idea of being able to watch him during the interval and the noise of the wheels prevented her learning anything by her ears but as she wound she caught sight of his shadow on the wall at her right hand  what was he doing he was in the very act of pouring something into her glass of wine  he had completed the manoeuvre before she had done winding she methodically closed the clockcase and turned round again when she faced him he was sitting in his chair as before she had risen  in a familiar scene which has hitherto been pleasant it is difficult to realize that an added condition which does not alter its aspect can have made it terrible the woman thought that his action must have been prompted by no other intent than that of poisoning her and yet she could not instantly put on a fear of her position  and before she had grasped these consequences another supposition served to make her regard the first as unlikely if not absurd it was the act of a madman to take her life in a manner so easy of discovery unless there were far more reason for the crime than any that manston could possibly have  was it not merely his intention in tampering with her wine to make her sleep soundly that night this was in harmony with her original suspicion that he intended secretly to abscond at any rate he was going to set about some stealthy proceeding as to which she was to be kept in utter darkness the difficulty now was to avoid drinking the wine  by means of one pretext and another she put off taking her glass for nearly five minutes but he eyed her too frequently to allow her to throw the potion under the grate it became necessary to take one sip this she did and found an opportunity of absorbing it in her handkerchief  plainly he had no idea of her countermoves the scheme seemed to him in proper train and he turned to poke out the fire she instantly seized the glass and poured its contents down her bosom when he faced round again she was holding the glass to her lips empty  in due course he locked the doors and saw that the shutters were fastened she attended to a few closing details of housewifery and a few minutes later they retired for the night  5 from eleven oclock to midnight  when manston was persuaded by the feigned heaviness of her breathing that anne seaway was asleep he softly arose and dressed himself in the gloom with ears strained to their utmost she heard him complete this operation then he took something from his pocket put it in the drawer of the dressingtable went to the door and down the stairs she glided out of bed and looked in the drawer he had only restored to its place a small phial she had seen there before it was labelled battleys solution of opium she felt relieved that her life had not been attempted that was to have been her sleepingdraught no time was to be lost if she meant to be a match for him she followed him in her nightdress when she reached the foot of the staircase he was in the office and had closed the door under which a faint gleam showed that he had obtained a light she crept to the door but could not venture to open it however slightly placing her ear to the panel she could hear him tearing up papers of some sort and a brighter and quivering ray of light coming from the threshold an instant later implied that he was burning them by the slight noise of his footsteps on the uncarpeted floor she at length imagined that he was approaching the door she flitted upstairs again and crept into bed  manston returned to the bedroom close upon her heels and entered itagain without a light standing motionless for an instant to assure himself that she still slept he went to the drawer in which their readymoney was kept and removed the casket that contained it annes ear distinctly caught the rustle of notes and the chink of the gold as he handled it some he placed in his pocket some he returned to its place he stood thinking as it were weighing a possibility while lingering thus he noticed the reflected image of his own face in the glasspale and spectrelike in its indistinctness the sight seemed to be the feather which turned the balance of indecision he drew a heavy breath retired from the room and passed downstairs she heard him unbar the backdoor and go out into the yard  feeling safe in a conclusion that he did not intend to return to the bedroom again she arose and hastily dressed herself on going to the door of the apartment she found that he had locked it behind him a precautionit can be no more she muttered yet she was all the more perplexed and excited on this account had he been going to leave home immediately he would scarcely have taken the trouble to lock her in holding the belief that she was in a drugged sleep the lock shot into a mortice so that there was no possibility of her pushing back the bolt how should she follow him easily an inner closet opened from the bedroom it was large and had some time heretofore been used as a dressing or bath room but had been found inconvenient from having no other outlet to the landing the window of this little room looked out upon the roof of the porch which was flat and covered with lead anne took a pillow from the bed gently opened the casement of the inner room and stepped forth on the flat there leaning over the edge of the small parapet that ornamented the porch she dropped the pillow upon the gravel path and let herself down over the parapet by her hands till her toes swung about two feet from the ground from this position she adroitly alighted upon the pillow and stood in the path  since she had come indoors from her walk in the early part of the evening the moon had risen but the thick clouds overspreading the whole landscape rendered the dim light pervasive and grey it appeared as an attribute of the air anne crept round to the back of the house listening intently the steward had had at least ten minutes start of her she had waited here whilst one might count fifty when she heard a movement in the outhousea fragment once attached to the main building this outhouse was partitioned into an outer and an inner room which had been a kitchen and a scullery before the connecting erections were pulled down but they were now used respectively as a brewhouse and workshop the only means of access to the latter being through the brewhouse the outer door of this first apartment was usually fastened by a padlock on the exterior it was now closed but not fastened manston was evidently in the outhouse  she slightly moved the door the interior of the brewhouse was wrapped in gloom but a streak of light fell towards her in a line across the floor from the inner or workshop door which was not quite closed this light was unexpected none having been visible through hole or crevice glancing in the woman found that he had placed cloths and mats at the various apertures and hung a sack at the window to prevent the egress of a single ray she could also perceive from where she stood that the bar of light fell across the brewingcopper just outside the inner door and that upon it lay the key of her bedroom the illuminated interior of the workshop was also partly visible from her position through the two halfopen doors manston was engaged in emptying a large cupboard of the tools gallipots and old iron it contained when it was quite cleared he took a chisel and with it began to withdraw the hooks and shouldernails holding the cupboard to the wall all these being loosened he extended his arms lifted the cupboard bodily from the brackets under it and deposited it on the floor beside him  that portion of the wall which had been screened by the cupboard was now laid bare this it appeared had been plastered more recently than the bulk of the outhouse manston loosened the plaster with some kind of tool flinging the pieces into a basket as they fell having now stripped clear about two feet area of wall he inserted a crowbar between the joints of the bricks beneath softly wriggling it until several were loosened there was now disclosed the mouth of an old oven which was apparently contrived in the thickness of the wall and having fallen into disuse had been closed up with bricks in this manner it was formed after the simple oldfashioned plan of ovenbuildinga mere oblate cavity without a flue  manston now stretched his arm into the oven dragged forth a heavy weight of great bulk and let it slide to the ground the woman who watched him could see the object plainly it was a common cornsack nearly full and was tied at the mouth in the usual way  the steward had once or twice started up as if he had heard sounds and his motions now became more catlike still on a sudden he put out the light anne had made no noise yet a foreign noise of some kind had certainly been made in the intervening portion of the house she heard it one of the rats she thought  he seemed soon to recover from his alarm but changed his tactics completely he did not light his candlegoing on with his work in the dark she had only sounds to go by now and judging as well as she could from these he was piling up the bricks which closed the ovens mouth as they had been before he disturbed them the query that had not left her brain all the interval of her inspectionhow should she get back into her bedroom againnow received a solution whilst he was replacing the cupboard she would glide across the brewhouse take the key from the top of the copper run upstairs unlock the door and bring back the key again if he returned to bed which was unlikely he would think the lock had failed to catch in the staple this thought and intention occupying such length of words flashed upon her in an instant and hardly disturbed her strong curiosity to stay and learn the meaning of his actions in the workshop  slipping sideways through the first door and closing it behind her she advanced into the darkness towards the second making every individual footfall with the greatest care lest the fragments of rubbish on the floor should crackle beneath her tread she soon stood close by the copper and not more than a foot from the door of the room occupied by manston himself from which position she could distinctly hear him breathe between each exertion although it was far too dark to discern anything of him  to secure the key of her chamber was her first anxiety and accordingly she cautiously reached out with her hand to where it lay instead of touching it her fingers came in contact with the boot of a human being  she drooped faint in a cold sweat it was the foot either of a man or woman standing on the brewingcopper where the key had lain a warm foot covered with a polished boot  the startling discovery so terrified her that she could hardly repress a sound she withdrew her hand with a motion like the flight of an arrow her touch was so light that the leather seemed to have been thick enough to keep the owner of the foot in entire ignorance of it and the noise of manstons scraping might have been quite sufficient to drown the slight rustle of her dress  the person was obviously not the steward he was still busy it was somebody who since the light had been extinguished had taken advantage of the gloom to come from some dark recess in the brewhouse and stand upon the brickwork of the copper the fear which had at first paralyzed her lessened with the birth of a sense that fear now was utter failure she was in a desperate position and must abide by the consequences the motionless person on the copper was equally with manston quite unconscious of her proximity and she ventured to advance her hand again feeling behind the feet till she found the key on its return to her side her fingertip skimmed the lower verge of a trousersleg  it was a man then who stood there to go to the door just at this time was impolitic and she shrank back into an inner corner to wait the comparative security from discovery that her new position ensured resuscitated reason a little and empowered her to form some logical inferences  1 the man who stood on the copper had taken advantage of the darkness to get there as she had to enter  2 the man must have been hidden in the outhouse before she had reached the door  3 he must be watching manston with much calculation and system and for purposes of his own  she could now tell by the noises that manston had completed his reerection of the cupboard she heard him replacing the articles it had containedbottle by bottle tool by toolafter which he came into the brewhouse went to the window and pulled down the cloths covering it but the window being rather small this unveiling scarcely relieved the darkness of the interior he returned to the workshop hoisted something to his back by a jerk and felt about the room for some other article having found it he emerged from the inner door crossed the brewhouse and went into the yard directly he stepped out she could see his outline by the light of the clouded and weakly moon the sack was slung at his back and in his hand he carried a spade  anne now waited in her corner in breathless suspense for the proceedings of the other man in about halfaminute she heard him descend from the copper and then the square opening of the doorway showed the outline of this other watcher passing through it likewise the form was that of a broadshouldered man enveloped in a long coat he vanished after the steward  the woman vented a sigh of relief and moved forward to follow simultaneously she discovered that the watcher whose foot she had touched was in his turn watched and followed also  it was by one of her own sex anne seaway shrank backward again the unknown woman came forward from the further side of the yard and pondered awhile in hesitation tall dark and closely wrapped she stood up from the earth like a cypress she moved crossed the yard without producing the slightest disturbance by her footsteps and went in the direction the others had taken  anne waited yet another minutethen in her turn noiselessly followed the last woman  but so impressed was she with the sensation of people in hiding that in coming out of the yard she turned her head to see if any person were following her in the same way nobody was visible but she discerned standing behind the angle of the stable manstons horse and gig ready harnessed  he did intend to fly after all then she thought he must have placed the horse in readiness in the interval between his leaving the house and her exit by the window however there was not time to weigh this branch of the nights events she turned about again and continued on the trail of the other three  6 from midnight to halfpast one am  intentness pervaded everything night herself seemed to have become a watcher  the four persons proceeded across the glade and into the park plantation at equidistances of about seventy yards here the ground completely overhung by the foliage was coated with a thick moss which was as soft as velvet beneath their feet the first watcher that is the man walking immediately behind manston now fell back when manstons housekeeper knowing the ground pretty well dived circuitously among the trees and got directly behind the steward who encumbered with his load had proceeded but slowly the other woman seemed now to be about opposite to anne or a little in advance but on manstons other hand  he reached a pit midway between the waterfall and the enginehouse there he stopped wiped his face and listened  into this pit had drifted uncounted generations of withered leaves half filling it oak beech and chestnut rotten and brown alike mingled themselves in one fibrous mass manston descended into the midst of them placed his sack on the ground and raking the leaves aside into a large heap began digging anne softly drew nearer crept into a bush and turning her head to survey the rest missed the man who had dropped behind and whom we have called the first watcher concluding that he too had hidden himself she turned her attention to the second watcher the other woman who had meanwhile advanced near to where anne lay in hiding and now seated herself behind a tree still closer to the steward than was anne seaway  here and thus anne remained concealed the crunch of the stewards spade as it cut into the soft vegetable mould was plainly perceptible to her ears when the periodic cessations between the creaks of the engine concurred with a lull in the breeze which otherwise brought the subdued roar of the cascade from the further side of the bank that screened it a large holesome four or five feet deephad been excavated by manston in about twenty minutes into this he immediately placed the sack and then began filling in the earth and treading it down lastly he carefully raked the whole mass of dead and dry leaves into the middle of the pit burying the ground with them as they had buried it before  for a hidingplace the spot was unequalled the thick accumulation of leaves which had not been disturbed for centuries might not be disturbed again for centuries to come whilst their lower layers still decayed and added to the mould beneath  by the time this work was ended the sky had grown clearer and anne could now see distinctly the face of the other woman stretching from behind the tree seemingly forgetful of her position in her intense contemplation of the actions of the steward her countenance was white and motionless  it was impossible that manston should not soon notice her at the completion of his labour he turned and did so  hoyou here he exclaimed  dont think i am a spy upon you she said in an imploring whisper anne recognized the voice as miss aldclyffes  the trembling lady added hastily another remark which was drowned in the recurring creak of the engine close at hand the first watcher if he had come no nearer than his original position was too far off to hear any part of this dialogue on account of the roar of the falling water which could reach him unimpeded by the bank  the remark of miss aldclyffe to manston had plainly been concerning the first watcher for manston with his spade in his hand instantly rushed to where the man was concealed and before the latter could disengage himself from the boughs the steward struck him on the head with the blade of the instrument the man fell to the ground  fly said miss aldclyffe to manston manston vanished amidst the trees miss aldclyffe went off in a contrary direction  anne seaway was about to run away likewise when she turned and looked at the fallen man he lay on his face motionless  many of these women who own to no moral code show considerable magnanimity when they see people in trouble to act right simply because it is ones duty is proper but a good action which is the result of no law of reflection shines more than any she went up to him and gently turned him over upon which he began to show signs of life by her assistance he was soon able to stand upright  he looked about him with a bewildered air endeavouring to collect his ideas who are you he said to the woman mechanically  it was bad policy now to attempt disguise i am the supposed mrs manston she said who are you  i am the officer employed by mr raunham to sift this mysterywhich may be criminal he stretched his limbs pressed his head and seemed gradually to awake to a sense of having been incautious in his utterance never you mind who i am he continued well it doesnt matter now eitherit will no longer be a secret  he stooped for his hat and ran in the direction the steward had takencoming back again after the lapse of a minute  its only an aggravated assault after all he said hastily until we have found out for certain whats buried here it may be only a bag of building rubbish but it may be more come and help me dig he seized the spade with the awkwardness of a town man and went into the pit continuing a muttered discourse its no use my running after him singlehanded he said hes ever so far off by this time the best step is to see what is here  it was far easier for the detective to reopen the hole than it had been for manston to form it the leaves were raked away the loam thrown out and the sack dragged forth  hold this he said to anne whose curiosity still kept her standing near he turned on the light of a dark lantern he had brought and gave it into her hand  the string which bound the mouth of the sack was now cut the officer laid the bag on its side seized it by the bottom and jerked forth the contents a large package was disclosed carefully wrapped up in impervious tarpaulin also well tied he was on the point of pulling open the folds at one end when a light coloured thread of something hanging on the outside arrested his eye he put his hand upon it it felt stringy and adhered to his fingers hold the light close he said  she held it close he raised his hand to the glass and they both peered at an almost intangible filament he held between his finger and thumb it was a long hair the hair of a woman  god i couldnt believe itno i couldnt believe it the detective whispered horrorstruck and i have lost the man for the present through my unbelief lets get into a sheltered place now wait a minute whilst i prove it  he thrust his hand into his waistcoat pocket and withdrew thence a minute packet of brown paper spreading it out he disclosed coiled in the middle another long hair it was the hair the clerks wife had found on manstons pillow nine days before the carriford fire he held the two hairs to the light they were both of a palebrown hue he laid them parallel and stretched out his arms they were of the same length to a nicety the detective turned to anne  it is the body of his first wife he said quietly he murdered her as mr springrove and the rector suspectedbut how and when god only knows  and i exclaimed anne seaway a probable and natural sequence of events and motives explanatory of the whole crimeevents and motives shadowed forth by the letter manstons possession of it his renunciation of cytherea and instalment of herselfflashing upon her mind with the rapidity of lightning  ahi see said the detective standing unusually close to her and a handcuff was on her wrist you must come with me madam knowing as much about a secret murder as god knows is a very suspicious thing it doesnt make you a goddessfar from it he directed the bullseye into her face  poohlead on she said scornfully and dont lose your principal actor for the sake of torturing a poor subordinate like me  he loosened her hand gave her his arm and dragged her out of the grovemaking her run beside him till they had reached the rectory a light was burning here and an auxiliary of the detectives awaiting him a horse ready harnessed to a springcart was standing outside  you have comei wish i had known that the detective said to his assistant hurriedly and angrily well weve blunderedhes goneyou should have been here as i said i was sold by that woman miss aldclyffeshe watched me he hastily gave directions in an undertone to this man the concluding words were go in to the rectorhes up detain miss aldclyffe i in the meantime am driving to casterbridge with this one and for help we shall be sure to have him when it gets light  he assisted anne into the vehicle and drove off with her as they went the clear dry road showed before them between the grassy quarters at each side like a white riband and made their progress easy they came to a spot where the highway was overhung by dense firs for some distance on both sides it was totally dark here  there was a smash and a rude shock in the very midst of its length at the point where the road began to drop down a hill the detective drove against something with a jerk which nearly flung them both to the ground  the man recovered himself placed anne on the seat and reached out his hand he found that the offwheel of his gig was locked in that of another conveyance of some kind  hoy said the officer  nobody answered  hoy you man asleep there he said again  no reply  well thats oddthis comes of the folly of travelling without giglamps because you expect the dawn he jumped to the ground and turned on his lantern  there was the gig which had obstructed him standing in the middle of the road a jaded horse harnessed to it but no human being in or near the vehicle  do you know whose gig this is he said to the woman  no she said sullenly but she did recognize it as the stewards  ill swear its manstons come i can hear it by your tone however you neednt say anything which may criminate you what forethought the man must have hadhow carefully he must have considered possible contingencies why he must have got the horse and gig ready before he began shifting the body  he listened for a sound among the trees none was to be heard but the occasional scamper of a rabbit over the withered leaves he threw the light of his lantern through a gap in the hedge but could see nothing beyond an impenetrable thicket it was clear that manston was not many yards off but the question was how to find him nothing could be done by the detective just then encumbered as he was by the horse and anne if he had entered the thicket on a search unaided manston might have stepped unobserved from behind a bush and murdered him with the greatest ease indeed there were such strong reasons for the exploit in manstons circumstances at that moment that without showing cowardice his pursuer felt it hazardous to remain any longer where he stood  he hastily tied the head of manstons horse to the back of his own vehicle that the steward might be deprived of the use of any means of escape other than his own legs and drove on thus with his prisoner to the countytown arrived there he lodged her in the policestation and then took immediate steps for the capture of manston     xx the events of three hours  1 march the twentythird midday  thirtysix hours had elapsed since manstons escape  it was marketday at the countytown the farmers outside and inside the cornexchange looked at their samples of wheat and poured them critically as usual from one palm to another but they thought and spoke of manston grocers serving behind their counters instead of using their constant phrase the next article please substituted have you heard if hes caught dairymen and drovers standing beside the sheep and cattle pens spread their legs firmly readjusted their hats thrust their hands into the lowest depths of their pockets regarded the animals with the utmost keenness of which the eye was capable and said ay ay sos theyll have him avore night  later in the day edward springrove passed along the street hurriedly and anxiously well have you heard any more he said to an acquaintance who accosted him  they tracked him in this way said the other young man a vagrant first told them that manston had passed a rick at daybreak under which this man was lying they followed the track he pointed out and ultimately came to a stile on the other side was a heap of halfhardened mud scraped from the road on the surface of the heap where it had been smoothed by the shovel was distinctly imprinted the form of a mans hand the buttons of his waistcoat and his watchchain showing that he had stumbled in hurrying over the stile and fallen there the pattern of the chain proved the man to have been manston they followed on till they reached a ford crossed by steppingstoneson the further bank were the same footmarks that had shown themselves beside the stile the whole of this course had been in the direction of budmouth on they went and the next clue was furnished them by a shepherd he said that wherever a clear space three or four yards wide ran in a line through a flock of sheep lying about a ewelease it was a proof that somebody had passed there not more than halfanhour earlier at twelve oclock that day he had noticed such a feature in his flock nothing more could be heard of him and they got into budmouth the steampacket to the channel islands was to start at eleven last night and they at once concluded that his hope was to get to france by way of jersey and st malohis only chance all the railwaystations being watched  well they went to the boat he was not on board then they went again at halfpast ten he had not come two men now placed themselves under the lamp immediately beside the gangway another stayed by the office door and one or two more up mary streetthe straight cut to the quay at a quarter to eleven the mailbags were put on board whilst the attention of the idlers was directed to the mails down mary street came a man as boldly as possible the gait was manstons but not the clothes he passed over to the shaded part of the street heads were turned i suppose this warned him for he never emerged from the shadow they watched and waited but the steward did not reappear the alarm was raisedthey searched the town high and lowno manston all this morning they have been searching but theres not a sign of him anywhere however he has lost his last chance of getting across the channel it is reported that he has since changed clothes with a labourer  during this narration edward lost in thought had let his eyes follow a shabby man in a smockfrock but wearing light bootswho was stalking down the street under a bundle of straw which overhung and concealed his head it was a very ordinary circumstance for a man with a bundle of straw on his shoulders and overhanging his head to go down the high street edward saw him cross the bridge which divided the town from the country place his shaggy encumbrance by the side of the road and leave it there  springrove now parted from his acquaintance and went also in the direction of the bridge and some way beyond it as far as he could see stretched the turnpike road and while he was looking he noticed a man to leap from the hedge at a point two hundred or two hundred and fifty yards ahead cross the road and go through a wicket on the other side this figure seemed like that of the man who had been carrying the bundle of straw he looked at the straw it still stood alone  the subjoined facts sprang as it were into juxtaposition in his brain  manston had been seen wearing the clothes of a labouring mana brown smockfrock so had this man who seemed other than a labourer on second thoughts and he had concealed his face by his bundle of straw with the greatest ease and naturalness  the path the man had taken led among other places to tolchurch where cytherea was living  if mrs manston was murdered as some said on the night of the fire cytherea was the stewards lawful wife manston at bay and reckless of results might rush to his wife and harm her  it was a horrible supposition for a man who loved cytherea to entertain but springrove could not resist its influence he started off for tolchurch  2 one to two oclock pm  on that selfsame midday whilst edward was proceeding to tolchurch by the footpath across the fields owen graye had left the village and was riding along the turnpike road to the countytown that he might ascertain the exact truth of the strange rumour which had reached him concerning manston not to disquiet his sister he had said nothing to her of the matter  she sat by the window reading from her position she could see up the lane for a distance of at least a hundred yards passersby were so rare in this retired nook that the eyes of those who dwelt by the wayside were invariably lifted to every one on the road great and small as to a novelty  a man in a brown smockfrock turned the corner and came towards the house it being marketday at casterbridge the village was nearly deserted and more than this the old farmhouse in which owen and his sister were staying stood as has been stated apart from the body of cottages the man did not look respectable cytherea arose and bolted the door  unfortunately he was near enough to see her cross the room he advanced to the door knocked and receiving no answer came to the window he next pressed his face against the glass peering in  cythereas experience at that moment was probably as trying a one as ever fell to the lot of a gentlewoman to endure she recognized in the peering face that of the man she had married  but not a movement was made by her not a sound escaped her her fear was great but had she known the truththat the man outside feeling he had nothing on earth to lose by any act was in the last stage of recklessness terrified nature must have given way  cytherea he said let me come in i am your husband  no she replied still not realizing the magnitude of her peril if you want to speak to us wait till my brother comes  o hes not at home cytherea i cant live without you all my sin has been because i love you so will you fly with me i have money enough for us bothonly come with me  not nownot now  i am your husband i tell you and i must come in  you cannot she said faintly his words began to terrify her  i will i say he exclaimed will you let me in i ask once more  noi will not said cytherea  then i will let myself in he answered resolutely i will if i die for it  the windows were glazed in lattice panes of leadwork hung in casements he broke one of the panes with a stone thrust his hand through the hole unfastened the latch which held the casement close and began opening the window  instantly the shutters flew together with a slam and were barred with desperate quickness by cytherea on the inside  damn you he exclaimed  he ran round to the back of the house his impatience was greater now he thrust his fist through the pantry window at one blow and opened it in the same way as the former one had been opened before the terrorstricken girl was aware that he had gone round in an instant he stood in the pantry advanced to the front room where she was flung back the shutters and held out his arms to embrace her  in extremely trying moments of bodily or mental pain cytherea either flushed hot or faded pale according to the state of her constitution at the moment now she burned like fire from head to foot and this preserved her consciousness  never before had the poor childs natural agility served her in such good stead as now a heavy oblong table stood in the middle of the room round this table she flew keeping it between herself and manston her large eyes wide open with terror their dilated pupils constantly fixed upon manstons to read by his expression whether his next intention was to dart to the right or the left  even he at that heated moment could not endure the expression of unutterable agony which shone from that extraordinary gaze of hers it had surely been given her by god as a means of defence manston continued his pursuit with a lowered eye  the panting and maddened desperadoblind to everything but the capture of his wifewent with a rush under the table she went over it like a bird he went heavily over it she flew under it and was out at the other side       one on her youth and pliant limbs relies       one on his sinews and his giant size  but his superior strength was sure to tire her down in the longrun she felt her weakness increasing with the quickness of her breath she uttered a wild scream which in its heartrending intensity seemed to echo for miles  at the same juncture her hair became unfastened and rolled down about her shoulders the least accident at such critical periods is sufficient to confuse the overwrought intelligence she lost sight of his intended direction for one instant and he immediately outmanoeuvred her  at last my cytherea he cried overturning the table springing over it seizing one of the long brown tresses pulling her towards him and clasping her round she writhed downwards between his arms and breast and fell fainting on the floor for the first time his action was leisurely he lifted her upon the sofa exclaiming rest there for a while my frightened little bird  and then there was an end of his triumph he felt himself clutched by the collar and whizzed backwards with the force of a batteringram against the fireplace springrove wild red and breathless had sprung in at the open window and stood once more between man and wife  manston was on his legs again in an instant a fiery glance on the one side a glance of pitiless justice on the other passed between them it was again the meeting in the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite hast thou found me o mine enemy and he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord  a desperate wrestle now began between the two men manston was the taller but there was in edward much hard tough muscle which the delicate flesh of the steward lacked they flew together like the jaws of a gin in a minute they were both on the floor rolling over and over locked in each others grasp as tightly as if they had been one organic being at war with itselfedward trying to secure manstons arms with a small thong he had drawn from his pocket manston trying to reach his knife  two characteristic noises pervaded the apartment through this momentous space of time one was the sharp panting of the two combatants so similar in each as to be undistinguishable the other was the stroke of their heels and toes as they smote the floor at every contortion of body or limbs  cytherea had not lost consciousness for more than halfaminute she had then leapt up without recognizing that edward was her deliverer unfastened the door and rushed out screaming wildly come help o help  three men stood not twenty yards off looking perplexed they dashed forward at her words have you seen a shabby man with a smockfrock on lately they inquired she pointed to the door and ran on the same as before  manston who had just loosened himself from edwards grasp seemed at this moment to renounce his intention of pushing the conflict to a desperate end i give it all up for lifedear life he cried with a hoarse laugh a reckless man has a dozen livessee how ill baffle you all yet  he rushed out of the house but no further the boast was his last in one halfminute more he was helpless in the hands of his pursuers   edward staggered to his feet and paused to recover breath his thoughts had never forsaken cytherea and his first act now was to hasten up the lane after her she had not gone far he found her leaning upon a bank by the roadside where she had flung herself down in sheer exhaustion he ran up and lifted her in his arms and thus aided she was enabled to stand uprightclinging to him what would springrove have given to imprint a kiss upon her lips then  they walked slowly towards the house the distressing sensation of whose wife she was could not entirely quench the resuscitated pleasure he felt at her grateful recognition of him and her confiding seizure of his arm for support he conveyed her carefully into the house  a quarter of an hour later whilst she was sitting in a partially recovered halfdozing state in an armchair edward beside her waiting anxiously till graye should arrive they saw a springcart pass the door old and dry mudsplashes from longforgotten rains disfigured its wheels and sides the varnish and paint had been scratched and dimmed ornament had long been forgotten in a restless contemplation of use three men sat on the seat the middle one being manston his hands were bound in front of him his eyes were set directly forward his countenance pallid hard and fixed  springrove had told cytherea of manstons crime in a few short words he now said solemnly he is to die  and i cannot mourn for him she replied with a shudder leaning back and covering her face with her hands  in the silence that followed the two short remarks springrove watched the cart round the corner and heard the rattle of its wheels gradually dying away as it rolled in the direction of the countytown     xxi the events of eighteen hours  1 march the twentyninth noon  exactly seven days after edward springrove had seen the man with the bundle of straw walking down the streets of casterbridge old farmer springrove was standing on the edge of the same pavement talking to his friend farmer baker  there was a pause in their discourse mr springrove was looking down the street at some object which had attracted his attention ah tis what we shall all come to he murmured  the other looked in the same direction true neighbour springrove true  two men advancing one behind the other in the middle of the road were what the farmers referred to they were carpenters and bore on their shoulders an empty coffin covered by a thin black cloth  i always feel a satisfaction at being breasted by such a sight as that said springrove still regarding the mens sad burden i call it a sort of medicine  and it is medicine i have not heard of any body being ill up this way lately dseem as if the person died suddenly  may be so ah baker we say sudden death dont we but theres no difference in their nature between sudden death and death of any other sort theres no such thing as a random snapping off of what was laid down to last longer we only suddenly light upon an endthoughtfully formed as any otherwhich has been existing at that very same point from the beginning though unseen by us to be so soon  it is just a discovery to your own mind and not an alteration in the lords  thats it unexpected is not as to the thing but as to our sight  now youll hardly believe me neighbour but this little scene in front of us makes me feel less anxious about pushing on wi that threshing and winnowing next week that i was speaking about why should we not stand still says i to myself and fling a quiet eye upon the whys and the wherefores before the end o it all and we go down into the moulderingplace and are forgotten  tis a feeling that will come but twont bear looking into theres a backard current in the world and we must do our utmost to advance in order just to bide where we be but baker they are turning in here with the coffin look  the two carpenters had borne their load into a narrow way close at hand the farmers in common with others turned and watched them along the way  tis a mans coffin and a tall mans too continued farmer springrove his was a fine frame whoever he was  a very plain box for the poor souljust the rough elm you see the corner of the cloth had blown aside  yes for a very poor man well deaths all the less insult to him i have often thought how much smaller the richer class are made to look than the poor at last pinches like this perhaps the greatest of all the reconcilers of a thoughtful man to povertyand i speak from experienceis the grand quiet it fills him with when the uncertainty of his life shows itself more than usual  as springrove finished speaking the bearers of the coffin went across a gravelled square facing the two men and approached a grim and heavy archway they paused beneath it rang a bell and waited  over the archway was written in egyptian capitals                             county gaol  the small rectangular wicket which was constructed in one of the two ironstudded doors was opened from the inside the men severally stepped over the threshold the coffin dragged its melancholy length through the aperture and both entered the court and were covered from sight  somebody in the gaol then  yes one of the prisoners said a boy scudding by at the moment who passed on whistling  do you know the name of the man who is dead inquired baker of a third bystander  yes tis all over townsurely you know mr springrove why manston miss aldclyffes steward he was found dead the first thing this morning he had hung himself behind the door of his cell in some way by a handkerchief and some strips of his clothes the turnkey says his features were scarcely changed as he looked at em with the early sun ashining in at the grating upon him he has left a full account of the murder and all that led to it so theres an end of him   it was perfectly true manston was dead  the previous day he had been allowed the use of writingmaterials and had occupied himself for nearly seven hours in preparing the following confession                            last words  having found mans life to be a wretchedly conceived scheme i renounce it and to cause no further trouble i write down the facts connected with my past proceedings  after thanking god on first entering my house on the night of the fire at carriford for my release from bondage to a woman i detested i went a second time to the scene of the disaster and finding that nothing could be done by remaining there shortly afterwards i returned home again in the company of mr raunham  he parted from me at the steps of my porch and went back towards the rectory whilst i still stood at the door musing on my strange deliverance i saw a figure advance from beneath the shadow of the park trees it was the figure of a woman  when she came near the twilight was sufficient to show me her attire it was a cloak reaching to the bottom of her dress and a thick veil covering her face these features together with her size and gait aided also by a flash of perception as to the chain of events which had saved her life told me that she was my wife eunice  i gnashed my teeth in a frenzy of despair i had lost cytherea i had gained one whose beauty had departed whose utterance was complaint whose mind was shallow and who drank brandy every day the revulsion of feeling was terrible providence whom i had just thanked seemed a mocking tormentor laughing at me i felt like a madman  she came closestarted at seeing me outsidethen spoke to me her first words were reproof for what i had unintentionally done and sounded as an earnest of what i was to be cursed with as long as we both lived i answered angrily this tone of mine changed her complaints to irritation she taunted me with a secret she had discovered which concerned miss aldclyffe and myself i was surprised to learn itmore surprised that she knew it but concealed my feeling  how could you serve me so she said her breath smelling of spirits even then you love another womanyes you do see how you drive me about i have been to the station intending to leave you for ever and yet i come to try you once more  an indescribable exasperation had sprung up in me as she talkedrage and regret were all in all scarcely knowing what i did i furiously raised my hand and swung it round with my whole force to strike her she turned quicklyand it was the poor creatures end by her movement my hand came edgewise exactly in the nape of the neckas men strike a hare to kill it the effect staggered me with amazement the blow must have disturbed the vertebrae she fell at my feet made a few movements and uttered one low sound  i ran indoors for water and some wine i came out and lanced her arm with my penknife but she lay still and i found that she was dead  it was a long time before i could realize my horrible position for several minutes i had no idea of attempting to escape the consequences of my deed then a light broke upon me had anybody seen her since she left the three tranters had they not she was already believed by the parishioners to be dust and ashes i should never be found out  upon this i acted  the first question was how to dispose of the body the impulse of the moment was to bury her at once in the pit between the enginehouse and waterfall but it struck me that i should not have time it was now four oclock and the workingmen would soon be stirring about the place i would put off burying her till the next night i carried her indoors  in turning the outhouse into a workshop earlier in the season i found when driving a nail into the wall for fixing a cupboard that the wall sounded hollow i examined it and discovered behind the plaster an old oven which had long been disused and was bricked up when the house was prepared for me  to unfix this cupboard and pull out the bricks was the work of a few minutes then bearing in mind that i should have to remove the body again the next night i placed it in a sack pushed it into the oven packed in the bricks and replaced the cupboard  i then went to bed in bed i thought whether there were any very remote possibilities that might lead to the supposition that my wife was not consumed by the flames of the burning house the thing which struck me most forcibly was this that the searchers might think it odd that no remains whatever should be found  the clinching and triumphant deed would be to take the body and place it among the ruins of the destroyed house but i could not do this on account of the men who were watching against an outbreak of the fire one remedy remained  i arose again dressed myself and went down to the outhouse i must take down the cupboard again i did take it down i pulled out the bricks pulled out the sack pulled out the corpse and took her keys from her pocket and the watch from her side  i then replaced everything as before  with these articles in my pocket i went out of the yard and took my way through the withy copse to the churchyard entering it from the back here i felt my way carefully along till i came to the nook where pieces of bones from newlydug graves are sometimes piled behind the laurelbushes i had been earnestly hoping to find a skull among these old bones but though i had frequently seen one or two in the rubbish here there was not one now i then groped in the other corner with the same resultnowhere could i find a skull three or four fragments of leg and backbones were all i could collect and with these i was forced to be content  taking them in my hand i crossed the road and got round behind the inn where the couch heap was still smouldering keeping behind the hedge i could see the heads of the three or four men who watched the spot  standing in this place i took the bones and threw them one by one over the hedge and over the mens heads into the smoking embers when the bones had all been thrown i threw the keys last of all i threw the watch  i then returned home as i had gone and went to bed once more just as the dawn began to break i exultedcytherea is mine again  at breakfasttime i thought suppose the cupboard should by some unlikely chance get moved today  i went to the masons yard hard by while the men were at breakfast and brought away a shovelful of mortar i took it into the outhouse again shifted the cupboard and plastered over the mouth of the oven behind simply pushing the cupboard back into its place i waited for the next night that i might bury the body though upon the whole it was in a tolerably safe hidingplace  when the night came my nerves were in some way weaker than they had been on the previous night i felt reluctant to touch the body i went to the outhouse but instead of opening the oven i firmly drove in the shouldernails that held the cupboard to the wall i will bury her tomorrow night however i thought  but the next night i was still more reluctant to touch her and my reluctance increased and there the body remained the oven was after all never likely to be opened in my time  i married cytherea graye and never did a bridegroom leave the church with a heart more full of love and happiness and a brain more fixed on good intentions than i did on that morning  when cythereas brother made his appearance at the hotel in southampton bearing his strange evidence of the porters disclosure i was staggered beyond expression i thought they had found the body am i to be apprehended and to lose her even now i mourned i saw my error and instantly saw too that i must act externally like an honourable man so at his request i yielded her up to him and meditated on several schemes for enabling me to claim the woman i had a legal right to claim as my wife without disclosing the reason why i knew myself to have it  i went home to knapwater the next day and for nearly a week lived in a state of indecision i could not hit upon a scheme for proving my wife dead without compromising myself  mr raunham hinted that i should take steps to discover her whereabouts by advertising i had no energy for the farce but one evening i chanced to enter the rising sun inn two notorious poachers were sitting in the settle which screened my entrance they were half drunktheir conversation was carried on in the solemn and emphatic tone common to that stage of intoxication and i myself was the subject of it  the following was the substance of their disjointed remarks on the night of the great fire at carriford one of them was sent to meet me and break the news of the death of my wife to me this he did but because i would not pay him for his news he left me in a mood of vindictiveness when the fire was over he joined his comrade the favourable hour of the night suggested to them the possibility of some unlawful gain before daylight came my fowlhouse stood in a tempting position and still resenting his repulse during the evening one of them proposed to operate upon my birds i was believed to have gone to the rectory with mr raunham the other was disinclined to go and the first went off alone  it was now about three oclock he had advanced as far as the shrubbery which grows near the north wall of the house when he fancied he heard above the rush of the waterfall noises on the other side of the building he described them in these words ghostly mouths talkingthen a fallthen a groanthen the rush of the water and creak of the engine as before only one explanation occurred to him the house was haunted and whether those of the living or the dead voices of any kind were inimical to one who had come on such an errand he stealthily crept home  his unlawful purpose in being behind the house led him to conceal his adventure no suspicion of the truth entered his mind till the railwayporter had startled everybody by his strange announcement then he asked himself had the horrifying sounds of that night been really an enactment in the flesh between me and my wife  the words of the other man were  why dont he try to find her if shes alive  true said the first well i dont forget what i heard and if she dont turn up alive my mind will be as sure as a bible upon her murder and the parson shall know it though i do get six months on the treadmill for being where i was  and if she should turn up alive  then i shall know that i am wrong and believing myself a fool as well as a rogue hold my tongue  i glided out of the house in a cold sweat the only pressure in heaven or earth which could have forced me to renounce cytherea was now put upon methe dread of a death upon the gallows  i sat all that night weaving strategy of various kinds the only effectual remedy for my hazardous standing that i could see was a simple one it was to substitute another woman for my wife before the suspicions of that one easilyhoodwinked man extended further  the only difficulty was to find a practicable substitute  the one woman at all available for the purpose was a friendless innocent creature named anne seaway whom i had known in my youth and who had for some time been the housekeeper of a lady in london on account of this ladys sudden death anne stood in rather a precarious position as regarded her future subsistence she was not the best kind of woman for the scheme but there was no alternative one quality of hers was valuable she was not a talker i went to london the very next day called at the hoxton lodging of my wife the only place at which she had been known as mrs manston and found that no great difficulties stood in the way of a personation and thus favouring circumstances determined my course i visited anne seaway made love to her and propounded my plan                                      we lived quietly enough until the sunday before my apprehension anne came home from church that morning and told me of the suspicious way in which a young man had looked at her there nothing could be done beyond waiting the issue of events then the letter came from raunham for the first time in my life i was half indifferent as to what fate awaited me during the succeeding day i thought once or twice of running away but could not quite make up my mind at any rate it would be best to bury the body of my wife i thought for the oven might be opened at any time i went to casterbridge and made some arrangements in the evening miss aldclyffe who is united to me by a common secret which i have no right or wish to disclose came to my house and alarmed me still more she said that she could tell by mr raunhams manner that evening that he kept back from her a suspicion of more importance even than the one he spoke of and that strangers were in his house even then  i guessed what this further suspicion was and resolved to enlighten her to a certain extent and so secure her assistance i said that i killed my wife by an accident on the night of the fire dwelling upon the advantage to her of the death of the only woman who knew her secret  her terror and fears for my fate led her to watch the rectory that evening she saw the detective leave it and followed him to my residence this she told me hurriedly when i perceived her after digging my wifes grave in the plantation she did not suspect what the sack contained  i am now about to enter on my normal condition for people are almost always in their graves when we survey the long race of men it is strange and still more strange to find that they are mainly dead men who have scarcely ever been otherwise                                                aeneas manston   the stewards confession aided by circumstantial evidence of various kinds was the means of freeing both anne seaway and miss aldclyffe from all suspicion of complicity with the murderer  2 six oclock pm  it was eveningjust at sunseton the day of manstons death  in the cottage at tolchurch was gathered a group consisting of cytherea her brother edward springrove and his father they sat by the window conversing of the strange events which had just taken place in cythereas eye there beamed a hopeful ray though her face was as white as a lily  whilst they talked looking out at the yellow evening light that coated the hedges trees and church tower a brougham rolled round the corner of the lane and came in full view it reflected the rays of the sun in a flash from its polished panels as it turned the angle the spokes of the wheels bristling in the same light like bayonets the vehicle came nearer and arrived opposite owens door when the driver pulled the rein and gave a shout and the panting and sweating horses stopped  miss aldclyffes carriage they all exclaimed  owen went out is miss graye at home said the man a note for her and i am to wait for an answer  cytherea read in the handwriting of the rector of carriford   dear miss grayemiss aldclyffe is ill though not dangerously she continually repeats your name and now wishes very much to see you if you possibly can come in the carriagevery sincerely yours john raunham   how comes she ill owen inquired of the coachman  she caught a violent cold by standing out of doors in the damp on the night the steward ran away ever since till this morning she complained of fulness and heat in the chest this morning the maid ran in and told her suddenly that manston had killed himself in gaolshe shriekedbroke a bloodvesseland fell upon the floor severe internal haemorrhage continued for some time and then stopped they say she is sure to get over it but she herself says no she has suffered from it before  cytherea was ready in a few moments and entered the carriage  3 seven oclock pm  soft as was cythereas motion along the corridors of knapwater house the preternaturally keen intelligence of the suffering woman caught the maidens wellknown footfall she entered the sickchamber with suspended breath  in the room everything was so still and sensation was as it were so rarefied by solicitude that thinking seemed acting and the ladys weak act of trying to live a silent wrestling with all the powers of the universe nobody was present but mr raunham the nurse having left the room on cythereas entry and the physician and surgeon being engaged in a whispered conversation in a sidechamber their patient had been pronounced out of danger  cytherea went to the bedside and was instantly recognized o what a changemiss aldclyffe dependent upon pillows and yet not a forbidding change with weakness had come softness of aspect the haughtiness was extracted from the frail thin countenance and a sweeter mild placidity had taken its place  miss aldclyffe signified to mr raunham that she would like to be alone with cytherea  cytherea she faintly whispered the instant the door was closed  cytherea clasped the ladys weak hand and sank beside her  miss aldclyffe whispered again they say i am certain to live but i know that i am certainly going to die  they know i think and hope  i know best but well leave that cythereao cytherea can you forgive me  her companion pressed her hand  but you dont know yetyou dont know yet the invalid murmured it is forgiveness for that misrepresentation to edward springrove that i implore and for putting such force upon himthat which caused all the train of your innumerable ills  i know allall and i do forgive you not in a hasty impulse that is revoked when coolness comes but deliberately and sincerely as i myself hope to be forgiven i accord you my forgiveness now  tears streamed from miss aldclyffes eyes and mingled with those of her young companion who could not restrain hers for sympathy expressions of strong attachment interrupted by emotion burst again and again from the brokenspirited woman  but you dont know my motive o if you only knew it how you would pity me then  cytherea did not break the pause which ensued and the elder woman appeared now to nerve herself by a superhuman effort she spoke on in a voice weak as a summer breeze and full of intermission and yet there pervaded it a steadiness of intention that seemed to demand firm tones to bear it out worthily  cytherea she said listen to me before i die  a long time agomore than thirty years agoa young girl of seventeen was cruelly betrayed by her cousin a wild officer of sixandtwenty he went to india and died  one night when that miserable girl had just arrived home with her parents from germany where her baby had been born she took all the money she possessed pinned it on her infants bosom together with a letter stating among other things what she wished the childs christian name to be wrapped up the little thing and walked with it to clapham here in a retired street she selected a house she placed the child on the doorstep and knocked at the door then ran away and watched they took it up and carried it indoors  now that her poor baby was gone the girl blamed herself bitterly for cruelty towards it and wished she had adopted her parents counsel to secretly hire a nurse she longed to see it she didnt know what to do she wrote in an assumed name to the woman who had taken it in and asked her to meet the writer with the infant at certain places she named these were hotels or coffeehouses in chelsea pimlico or hammersmith the woman being well paid always came and asked no questions at one meetingat an inn in hammersmithshe made her appearance without the child and told the girl it was so ill that it would not live through the night the news and fatigue brought on a faintingfit  miss aldclyffes sobs choked her utterance and she became painfully agitated cytherea pale and amazed at what she heard wept for her bent over her and begged her not to go on speaking  yesi must she cried between her sobs i willi must go on and i must tell yet more plainly you must hear it before i am gone cytherea the sympathizing and astonished girl sat down again  the name of the woman who had taken the child was manston she was the widow of a schoolmaster she said she had adopted the child of a relation  only one man ever found out who the mother was he was the keeper of the inn in which she fainted and his silence she has purchased ever since  a twelvemonth passedfifteen monthsand the saddened girl met a man at her fathers house named grayeyour father cytherea then unmarried ah such a man inexperience now perceived what it was to be loved in spirit and in truth but it was too late had he known her secret he would have cast her out she withdrew from him by an effort and pined  years and years afterwards when she became mistress of a fortune and estates by her fathers death she formed the weak scheme of having near her the son whom in her fathers lifetime she had been forbidden to recognize cytherea you know who that weak woman is                                      by such toilsome labour as this i got him here as my steward and i wanted to see him your husband cythereathe husband of my true lovers child it was a sweet dream to me pity meo pity me to die unloved is more than i can bear i loved your father and i love him now   that was the burden of cytherea aldclyffe  i suppose you must leave me againyou always leave me she said after holding the young womans hand a long while in silence  noindeed ill stay always do you like me to stay  miss aldclyffe in the jaws of death was miss aldclyffe still though the old fire had degenerated to mere phosphorescence now but you are your brothers housekeeper  yes  well of course you cannot stay with me on a sudden like this go home or he will be at a loss for things and tomorrow morning come again wont you dearest come againwell fetch you but you mustnt stay now and put owen out o noit would be absurd the absorbing concern about trifles of daily routine which is so often seen in very sick people was present here  cytherea promised to go home and come the next morning to stay continuously  stay till i die then will you not yes till i diei shant die till tomorrow  we hope for your recoveryall of us  i know best come at six oclock darling  as soon as ever i can returned cytherea tenderly  but six is too earlyyou will have to think of your brothers breakfast leave tolchurch at eight will you  cytherea consented to this miss aldclyffe would never have known had her companion stayed in the house all night but the honesty of cythereas nature rebelled against even the friendly deceit which such a proceeding would have involved  an arrangement was come to whereby she was to be taken home in the ponycarriage instead of the brougham that fetched her the carriage to put up at tolchurch farm for the night and on that account to be in readiness to bring her back earlier  4 march the thirtieth daybreak  the third and last instance of cythereas subjection to those periodic terrors of the night which had emphasized her connection with the aldclyffe name and blood occurred at the present date  it was about four oclock in the morning when cytherea though most probably dreaming seemed to awakeand instantly was transfixed by a sort of spell that had in it more of awe than of affright at the foot of her bed looking her in the face with an expression of entreaty beyond the power of words to portray was the form of miss aldclyffewan and distinct no motion was perceptible in her but longingearnest longingwas written in every feature  cytherea believed she exercised her waking judgment as usual in thinking without a shadow of doubt that miss aldclyffe stood before her in flesh and blood reason was not sufficiently alert to lead cytherea to ask herself how such a thing could have occurred  i would have remained with youwhy would you not allow me to stay cytherea exclaimed the spell was broken she became broadly awake and the figure vanished  it was in the grey time of dawn she trembled in a sweat of disquiet and not being able to endure the thought of her brother being asleep she went and tapped at his door  owen  he was not a heavy sleeper and it was verging upon his time to rise  what do you want cytherea  i ought not to have left knapwater last night i wish i had not i really think i will start at once she wants me i know  what time is it  a few minutes past four  you had better not keep to the time agreed upon consider we should have such a trouble in rousing the driver and other things  upon the whole it seemed wiser not to act on a mere fancy she went to bed again  an hour later when owen was thinking of getting up a knocking came to the front door the next minute something touched the glass of owens window he waitedthe noise was repeated a little gravel had been thrown against it to arouse him  he crossed the room pulled up the blind and looked out a solemn white face was gazing upwards from the road expectantly straining to catch the first glimpse of a person within the panes it was the face of a knapwater man sitting on horseback  owen saw his errand there is an unmistakable look in the face of every man who brings tidings of death graye opened the window  miss aldclyffe said the messenger and paused  ahdead  yesshe is dead  when did she die  at ten minutes past four after another effusion she knew best you see sir i started directly by the rectors orders     sequel  fifteen months have passed and we are brought on to midsummer night 1867  the picture presented is the interior of the old belfry of carriford church at ten oclock in the evening  six carriford men and one stranger are gathered there beneath the light of a flaring candle stuck on a piece of wood against the wall the six carriford men are the wellknown ringers of the finetoned old bells in the key of f which have been music to the ears of carriford parish and the outlying districts for the last four hundred years the stranger is an assistant who has appeared from nobody knows where  the six nativesin their shirtsleeves and without hatspull and catch frantically at the dancing bellropes the locks of their hair waving in the breeze created by their quick motions the stranger who has the treble bell does likewise but in his right mind and coat their everchanging shadows mingle on the wall in an endless variety of kaleidoscopic forms and the eyes of all the seven are religiously fixed on a diagram like a large addition sum which is chalked on the floor  vividly contrasting with the yellow light of the candle upon the four unplastered walls of the tower and upon the faces and clothes of the men is the scene discernible through the screen beneath the tower archway at the extremity of the long mysterious avenue of the nave and chancel can be seen shafts of moonlight streaming in at the east window of the churchblue phosphoric and ghostly  a thorough renovation of the bellringing machinery and accessories had taken place in anticipation of an interesting event new ropes had been provided every bell had been carefully shifted from its carriage and the pivots lubricated bright red sallies of woollen texturesoft to the hands and easily caughtglowed on the ropes in place of the old ragged knots all of which newness in small details only rendered more evident the irrepressible aspect of age in the mass surrounding them  the triplebobmajor was ended and the ringers wiped their faces and rolled down their shirtsleeves previously to tucking away the ropes and leaving the place for the night  piphhhh a good forty minutes said a man with a streaming face and blowing out his breathone of the pair who had taken the tenor bell  our friend here pulled proper wellthat a didseeing hes but a stranger said clerk crickett who had just resigned the second rope and addressing the man in the black coat  a did said the rest  i enjoyed it much said the man modestly  what we should ha done without you words cant tell the man that dbelong by rights to that there bell

the land  i said thou wast one o the devils brood wi thy black clothes replied a sturdy ringer who had not spoken before  no the truth is said the thin man retracting at this horrible translation i came for a walk because it is a fine evening  now lets be off neighbours the clerk interrupted  the candle was inverted in the socket and the whole party stepped out into the churchyard the moon was shining within a day or two of full and just overlooked the three or four vast yews that stood on the southeast side of the church and rose in unvaried and flat darkness against the illuminated atmosphere behind them  goodnight the clerk said to his comrades when the door was locked my nearest way is through the park  i suppose mine is too said the stranger i am going to the railwaystation  of coursecome on  the two men went over a stile to the west the remainder of the party going into the road on the opposite side  and so the romance has ended well the clerks companion remarked as they brushed along through the grass but what is the truth of the story about the property  now look here neighbour said clerk crickett if so be youll tell me what your line o life is and your purpose in comen here today ill tell you the truth about the wedden particulars  very welli will when you have done said the other man  tis a bargain and this is the right o the story when miss aldclyffes will was opened it was found to have been drawn up on the very day that manston her lovechild married miss cytherea graye and this is what that deep woman did deep she was as deep as the north star she bequeathed all her property real and personal to the wife of aeneas manston with one exception failen her life to her husband failen his life to the heirs of his headbody i would say failen them to her absolutely and her heirs for ever failen these to pason raunham and so on to the end o the human race now do you see the depth of her scheme why although upon the surface it appeared her whole property was for miss cytherea by the word wife being used and not cythereas name whoever was the wife o manston would come in fort wasnt that rale depth it was done of course that her son aeneas under any circumstances should be master o the property without folk knowen it was her son or suspecting anything as they would if it had been left to en straightway  a clever arrangement and what was the exception  the payment of a legacy to her relative pason raunham  and miss cytherea was now manstons widow and only relative and inherited all absolutely  true she did well says she i shant have it she didnt like the notion o getten anything through manston naturally enough pretty dear she waived her right in favour o mr raunham now if theres a man in the world that dcare nothen about landi dont say there is but if there istis our pason hes like a snail hes agrowed so to the shape o that there rectory that a wouldn think o leaven it even in name tis yours miss graye says he no tis yours says she tisn mine says he the crown had cast his eyes upon the case thinken o forfeiture by felonybut twas no such thing and a gied it up too did you ever hear such a talethree people a man and a woman and a crownneither o em in a madhouseflingen an estate backwards and forwards like an apple or nut well it ended in this way mr raunham took it young springrove was had as agent and steward and put to live in knapwater house close here at handjust as if twas his own he does just what hed likemr raunham never interferenand hither today hes brought his new wife cytherea and a settlement ha been drawn up this very day whereby their children heirs and cetrer be to inherit after mr raunhams death good fortune came at last her brother too is doen well he came in first man in some architectural competition and is about to move to london heres the house look stap out from these bushes and youll get a clear sight ot  they emerged from the shrubbery breaking off towards the lake and down the south slope when they arrived exactly opposite the centre of the mansion they halted  it was a magnificent picture of the english countryhouse the whole of the severe regular front with its columns and cornices was built of a white smoothlyfaced freestone which appeared in the rays of the moon as pure as pentelic marble the sole objects in the scene rivalling the fairness of the facade were a dozen swans floating upon the lake  at this moment the central door at the top of the steps was opened and two figures advanced into the light two contrasting figures were they a young lithe woman in an airy fairy dresscytherea springrove a young man in black stereotype raimentedward her husband  they stood at the top of the steps together looking at the moon the water and the general loveliness of the prospect  thats the married man and wifethere ive illustrated my story by rale liven specimens the clerk whispered  to be sure how close together they do stand you couldn slip a pennypiece between emthat you couldn beautiful to see it isnt itbeautiful but this is a private path and we wont let em see us as all the ringers be goen there to a supper and dance tomorrow night  the speaker and his companion softly moved on passed through the wicket and into the coachroad arrived at the clerks house at the further boundary of the park they paused to part  now for your half o the bargain said clerk crickett whats your line o life and what dye come here for  im the reporter to the casterbridge chronicle and i come to pick up the news goodnight   meanwhile edward and cytherea after lingering on the steps for several minutes slowly descended the slope to the lake the skiff was lying alongside  o edward said cytherea you must do something that has just come into my head  well dearesti know  yesgive me one halfminutes row on the lake here now just as you did on budmouth bay three years ago  he handed her into the boat and almost noiselessly pulled off from shore when they were halfway between the two margins of the lake he paused and looked at her  ah darling i remember exactly how i kissed you that first time said springrove you were there as you are now i unshipped the sculls in this way then i turned round and sat beside youin this way then i put my hand on the other side of your little neck  i think it was just on my cheek in this way  ah so it was then you moved that soft red mouth round to mine  but dearestyou pressed it round if you remember and of course i couldnt then help letting it come to your mouth without being unkind to you and i wouldnt be that  and then i put my cheek against that cheek and turned my two lips round upon those two lips and kissed themso
