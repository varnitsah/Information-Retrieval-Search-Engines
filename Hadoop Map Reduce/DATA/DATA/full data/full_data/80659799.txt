heights of the bear tooth range is a glittering desolation of snow with a flaming blue sky above nothing moves nothing utters a sound save the cony at the mouth of the spiral shaft which sinks to his deeply buried den in the rocks the peaks are like marble domes set high in the pathway of the sun by day and thrust amid the stars by night the firs seem hopeless under their everincreasing burdens the streams are silencedonly the wind is abroad in the waste the tireless pitiless wind fanged like ingratitude insatiate as fire  but it is beautiful nevertheless especially of a clear dawn when the shadows are vividly purple and each rimewreathed summit is smit with ethereal fire and each eastern slope is resplendent as a highway of powdered diamondsor at sunset when the high crests of the range stand like flaming milestones leading to the celestial city and the lakes are like pools of pure gold caught in a robe of green velvet yet always this land demands youth and strength in its explorer  king frosts dominion was already complete over all the crests over timberline when young captain curtis set out to cross the divide which lay between lake congar and fort shermana trip to test the virtue of a sibley tent and the staying qualities of a mountain horse  bennett the hairy trapper at the head of the lake advised against it the snow is softi reckon you better wait a week  but curtis was a seasoned mountaineer and took pride in assaulting the stern barrier besides my leave of absence is nearly up he said to the trapper  well youre the doctor the old trapper replied good luck to ye cap  it was sunrise of a crisp clear autumn morning when they started and around them the ground was still bare but by noon they were wallowing midleg deep in newfallen snow curtis led the way on foothis own horse having been packed to relieve the burdens of the otherswhile sergeant pierce resolute and uncomplaining brought up the rear  we must camp beside the sulphur spring tonight curtis said as they left timberline and entered upon the bleak windswept slopes of grizzly bear  very well sir pierce cheerily replied and till three oclock they climbed steadily towards the faroff glacial heights the drifts ever deepening the cold ever intensifying they had eaten no food since dawn and the horses were weak with hunger and weariness as they topped the divide and looked down upon the vast eastern slope the world before them seemed even more inhospitable and windswept than the land they had left below them to the west the air was filled with flying frost the sun was weak and pale and the plain was only a paleblue sea far far below to the northeast the wind blew through the pass with terrible force and the cold nipped every limb like a famishing white wolf  there is the sulphur spring sir said pierce pointing towards a delicate strand of steam which rose from a clump of pines in the second basin beneath them  quite right sergeant and we must make that in an hour id like to take an observation here but i reckon wed better slide down to camp before the horses freeze  the dry snow sculptured by the blast in the pass made the threadlike path an exceedingly elusive line to keep and trailing narrowed to a process of feeling with the feet but curtis set his face resolutely into the northeast wind and led the way down the gulch for the first halfmile the little packtrain crawled slowly and hesitatingly like a bewildered worm turning and twisting retracing its way circling huge bowlders edging awful cliffs slipping stumbling but ever moving ever descending and at last while yet the suns light glorified the icy kings behind them the captain drew into the shelter of the clump of pines from which the steam of the warm spring rose like a chimneys cheery greeting  whoa boys called curtis and with a smile at pierce added here we are home again  it was not a cheerful place to spend the night for even at this level the undisturbed snow lay full twelve inches deep and the pines were bowed with the weight of it and as the sun sank the cold deepened to zero point but the sergeant drew off his gloves and began to free the horses from their packs quite as if these were the usual conditions of camping  better leave the blankets on remarked the young officer theyll need em for warmth  the sergeant saluted and continued his work deft and silent while curtis threw up a little tent on a cleared spot and banked it snugly with snow in a very short time a fire was blazing and some coffee boiling the two men seemed not to regard the cold or the falling night except in so far as the wind threatened the horses  its hard luck on them remarked curtis as they were finishing their coffee in the tent but it is unavoidable i dont think it safe to try to go down that slide in the dusk do you  its dangerous at any time sir and with our horses weak as they are it sure would be taking chances  well make tom skinners by noon tomorrow and be out of the snow probably the young soldier put down his tin cup and drew a map from his pocket hold a light sergeant i want to make some notes before i forget them  while the sergeant held a candle for him curtis rapidly traced with a soft pencil a few rough lines upon the map that settles that watershed question he pointed with his pencil here is the dividing wall not over there where lieutenant crombie drew it nothing is more deceptive than the relative heights of ranges well now take a last look at the horses he said putting away his pencil and ill unroll our blankets  as they crawled into their snug sleepingbags curtis said again with a sigh im sorry for the ponies  theyll be all right now captain theyve got something in their stomachs if a cayuse has any fuel in him hes like an enginehell keep warm and so silence fell on them and in the valley the cold deepened till the rocks and the trees cried out in the rigor of their resistance  the sun was filling the sky with an allpervading crimsonandorange mist when the sergeant crawled out of his snug nest and started a fire the air was perfectly still but the frost gripped each limb with benumbing fury the horses with blankets awry stood huddled close together in the shelter of the pines not far away as the sergeant appeared they whinnied to express their dependence upon him and when the sun rose they turned their broadsides to it gratefully  the two men with swift unhesitating action set to work to break camp in half an hour the tent was folded and packed the horses saddled and then lustily singing curtis led the way down upon the floor of the second basin which narrowed towards the north into a deep and wooded valley leading to the plains the grasp of winter weakened as they descended december became october the snow thinned the streams sang clear and considerably before noon the little train of worn and hungry horses came out upon the grassy shore of a small lake to bask in genial sunshine from this point the road to skinners was smooth and easy and quite untouched of snow  as they neared the miners shack a tall young payonnay in the dress of a cowboy came out to meet them smiling broadly  im looking for you captain  are you jack well you see me whats your message  the colonel says you are to come in right off he told me to tell you he had an order for you  a slouching figure supporting a heap of greasy rags drew near and a low voice drawled weakly jacks been here since friday i told him where you was but he thought hed druther lay by my fire than hunt ye  curtis studied the squat figure keenly you werent looking for the job of crossing the range yourself were you  the tramplike miner grinned and sucked at his pipe well noi cant say that i was but i like to rub it into these lazy injuns  jack winked at curtis with humorous appreciation hes a dandy to rub it into an injun dont you think  even skinner laughed at this and curtis said unsaddle the horses and give them a chance at the grass sergeant we cant go into the fort tonight with the packs and skinner i want to hire a horse of you while you help pierce bring my outfit into the fort tomorrow i must hurry on to see whats in the wind  all right captain anything ive got is yours responded the miner heartily  the bugles were sounding retreat as the young officer rode up to the door of colonel quinlans quarters and reported for duty  goodevening major called the colonel with a quizzical smile and a sharp emphasis on the word major  major exclaimed curtis what do you mean  not a wholesale slaughter of your superiors oh no you are major by the grace of the secretary of indian affairs colonel hackett of the war department writes me that you have been detailed as indian agent at fort smith youll find your notification in your mail no doubt  curtis touched his hat in mock courtesy thanks mr secretary your kindness overwhelms me  didnt think the reform administration could get along without you did you asked the colonel with some humor he was standing at his gate come in and well talk it over you seem a little breathless  it does double me up i confess but i cant consistently back out after the stand ive made  back out well not if i can prevent it havent you hammered it into us for two years that the army was the proper instrument for dealing with these redskins no sir you cant turn tail now take your medicine like a man  but how did they drop onto me did you suggest it  the colonel became grave no my boy i did not but i think i know who did you remember the two literary chaps who camped with us on our trial march two years ago  the young officers eyes opened wide ah i see they told me at the time that they were friends of the secretary that explains it  your success with that troop of enlisted cheyennes had something to do with it too added the colonel i told those literary sharps about that experience and also about your crazy interest in the signlanguage and indian songs  you did well then you are responsible after all  the colonel put his hand on his subordinates shoulder go and do the work boy its better than sitting around here waiting promotion if i werent so near retirement id resign i have lived out on these cursed deserts ever since 1868but ill fool em he added with a grim smile im going to hang on to the last and retire on halfpay then ill spend all my time looking after my health and live to be ninetyfive in order to get even  curtis laughed quite right colonel and then becoming serious he added its my duty and i will do it and in this quiet temper he accepted his detail  captain george curtis as the colonel had intimated was already a marked man at fort shermanand indeed throughout the western division of the army he feared no hardship and acknowledged no superior on the trail except pierce who was as invincible to cold and snow as a grizzly bear and his chief diversions were these trips into the wild each outing helped him endure the monotony of barrack life for when it was over he returned to the open fire of his study where he pored over his maps smoking his pipe and writing a little between buglecalls in this way he had been able to put together several articles on the forests the watersheds and the wild animals of the region he had traversed and in this way had made himself known to the smithsonian institution he was considered a crank on trees and indians by his fellowofficers who all drank more whiskey and played a better hand at poker than he but after all curtis is a good soldier they often said in conclusion his voice in command is clear and decisive and his control of his men excellent he was handsome too in a firm brown cleanly outlined way and though not a popular officer he had no enemies in the service  his sister jennie who had devotedly kept house for him during his garrison life was waiting for him at the gate of his little yard and cried out in greeting  how did you cross the range in this weather i was frightened for you george i could see the storm raging up there all day yesterday  oh a little wind and snow dont count he replied carelessly i thought youd given up worrying about me  i haveonly i thought of poor sergeant pierce and the horses theres a stack of mail here do you know whats happened to you  the colonel told me  how do you like it  i dont know yet at this moment im too tired to express an opinion  from the pile of mail on his desk he drew out the order which directed him to proceed at once to fort smith and as secretly as may be you will surprise the agent if possibleintercepting him at his desk so that he will have no opportunity for secreting his private papers you will take entire charge of the agency and at your earliest convenience forward to us a report covering every detail of the conditions there  now that promises well he said as he finished reading the order we start with a fair expectancy of drama siswe are indian agents all this must be given up he looked round the room which glowed in the light of an open grate fire the floor was bright with navajo blankets and warm with fur rugs and on the walls his books waited his hand  i dont like to leave our snug nest jennie he said with a sigh  you neednt take it with you she replied promptly  he glanced ruefully at her i knew id get mighty little sympathy from you  why should you im ready to go i dont want you trailing about over these mountains till the end of time and you know this life is fatal to you or any other man who wants to do anything in the world its all very well to talk about being a soldier but im not so enthusiastic as i used to be i dont think sitting around waiting for some one to die is very noble  he rose and stood before the fire i wish this whole house could be lifted up and set down at fort smith then i might consider the matter  she came over and as he put his arm about her continued earnestly george im serious about this the president is trying to put the indian service into capable hands and i believe you ought to accept in fact you cant refuse there is work for us both there i am heartily tired of garrison life george as the boys say theres nothing in it  but theres danger threatening at smith sis i cant take you into an indian outbreak  thats all newspaper talk mr dudley writes  dudleyis he down there oh you are a masterful sly one your touching solicitude for the tetongs is now explained what is dudley doing at smith besides interfering with my affairs  hes studying the tetong burial customsbut he isnt there at present  these smithsonian sharps are unexpectedly keen hed sacrifice me and my whole military career to have you study skulls with him for a few days do you know i suspect him and osborne lawson of this whole conspiracyand youyou were in it ive a mind to rebel and throw everything out o gear  jennie gave him a shove go dress for dinner the colonel and his wife and mr ross are coming in to congratulate you and you must pretend to be overjoyed  as he sat at the head of his handsome table that night curtis began to appreciate his comforts he forgot the dissensions and jealousies the cynical speculations and the bitter rivalries of the officershe remembered only the pleasant things  his guests were personable and gracious and jennie presided over the coffee with distinction she was a natural hostess and her part in the conversation which followed was notable for its good sense but mr ross the young lieutenant considered her delicate color and shining hair even more remarkable than her humor he liked her voice also and had a desire to kick the shins of the loquacious colonel for absorbing so much of her attention mrs quinlan the colonels wife was by the same token a retiring silent little woman who smiled and nodded her head to all that was said paying special attention to the colonels stories with which all were familiar even mr ross had learned them  at last the colonel turned to curtis youll miss this curtis when youre exiled down there at old fort smith among the tetongs here we are a little oasis of civilization in the midst of a desert of barbarians down there youll be swallowed up  well take civilization with us said jennie but of course we shall miss our friends  well youll have a clear field for experiment at smith you can try all your pet theories on the tetongs god be with themtheir case is desperate he chuckled gracelessly  when do you go asked mrs quinlan  at once as soon as i can make arrangements replied curtis and then added and bytheway i hope you will all refrain from mentioning my appointment till after i reach fort smith  the visitors did not stay late for their host was plainly preoccupied and as they shook hands with him in parting they openly commiserated him im sorry for you again remarked the colonel but its a just punishment  after they were gone curtis turned to his sister i must leave here tomorrow morning sis  why george cant you take time to breathe and pack up  no i must drop down on that agent like a hawk on a junebug before he has a chance to bury his misdeeds the colonel has given out the news of my detail and the quicker i move the better i must reach there before the mail does  but i want to go with you she quickly and resentfully replied  well you can if you are willing to leave our packing in pierces hands  i dont intend to be left behind she replied im going along to see that you dont do anything reckless i never trust a man in a place requiring tact  curtis laughed thats your long suit sis but i reckon well need all the virtues that lie in each of us we are going into battle with strange forces     ii  the streeter gunrack   there is a good wagonroad leading to old fort smith from pinon city but it runs for the most part through an uninteresting country and does not touch the reservation till within a few miles of the agency buildings from the other side however a rough trail crosses a low divide and for more than sixty miles lies within the tetong boundaries a rolling cattle country rising to grassy hills on the west  for these reasons curtis determined to go in on horseback and in civilians dress leaving his sister to follow by rail and buckboard but here again jennie promptly made protest  ill not go that way george i am going to keep with you and you neednt plan for anything elseso there  its a hard ride sissixty miles and more youll be tired out  what of that ill have plenty of time to rest afterwards  very well it is always a pleasure to have you with me you stubborn thing he replied affectionately  it had been hard to leave everything at the fort hard to look back from the threshold upon wellordered books and furniture and harder still to know that rude and careless hands would jostle them into heaps on the morrow but jennie was accustomed to all the hardships involved in being sister to a soldier and after she had turned the key in the lock set her face to the south cheerfully there was something of the missionary in her and she had long burned with a desire to help the red people  they got off at a squalid little cowtown called riddell about noon of the second day and curtis after a swift glance around him said sis our chances for dinner are poor  the hotel a squat battlemented wooden building was trimmed with loafing cowboys on the outside and speckled with flies on the inside but the landlord was unexpectedly attractive a smiling courteous host to whom flies and cowboys were matters of course it was plain he had slipped down to his present low level by insensible declinations  the food is not so bad if it were only served decently said jennie as they sat at the table eying the heavy china chipped and maimed in the savage process of washing  i hope you wont be sorry weve left the army sis  i would if we had to live with these people she replied decisively looking about the room which was filled with uncouth types of men keeneyed slouchy and loudvoiced the presence of a pretty woman had subdued most of them into something like decorum but they were not pleasant to look at they were the unattached males of the town a mob of barkeepers hostlers clerks and railway hands intermixed with a halfdozen cowboys who had ridden in to loaf away a day or two in town  the ragged edge of the cloth of gold said curtis as he glanced round at them civilization has its seamy side  this makes the dear old fort seem beautiful doesnt it the girl sighed well see no more green grass and wellgroomed men  an hour later with a halfbreed indian boy for a guide they rode away over the hills towards the east glad to shake the dust of riddell off their feet  the day was one of flooding sunlight warm and golden winter seemed far away and only the dry grass made it possible to say this is autumn the air was without dust or moisturecrystalline crisp and deliciously invigorating  the girl turned to her brother with radiant face this is living isnt it good to escape that horrid little town  youd suppose in an air like this all life would be clean and sweet he replied but it isnt the trouble is these people have no inner resource they lop down when their accustomed props are removed they come from defective stock  the halfbreed guide had the quality of his indian motherhe knew when to keep silence and when to speak he led the way steadily galloping along on his little gray pony with elbows flapping like a rooster about to take flight  there was a wonderful charm in this treeless land it was so lonely and so sinister it appealed with great power to curtis while it appalled his sister the solitary buttes smooth of slope and grotesque of line the splendid grassy hollows where the cattle fed the burnedup mesas where nothing lived but the horned toad the alkaline flats leprous and ashen the occasional green line of cottonwoodtrees deep sunk in a dry watercourseall these were typical of the whole vast eastern watershed of the continental divide and familiar to the young officer for in such a land he had entered upon active service  it was beautiful but it was an ill place for a woman as jennie soon discovered the air so dry so fierce parched her skin and pinched her red lips the alkali settled in a gray dust upon her pretty hair and entered her throat increasing her thirst to a keen pain  oh george here is a little stream she cried out  courage sis we will soon get above the alkali that water is rank poison  it looks good she replied wistfully  well find some glorious water up there in that clump of willows and a few minutes hard riding brought them to a gurgling little brook of clear cold water and the girl not merely drankshe laved away all traces of the bitter soil of the lower levels  at about four oclock the guide struck into a transverse valley and followed a small stream to its source in a range of pineclad hills which separate the white mans country from the tetong reservation as they topped this divide riding directly over a smooth swell curtis drew rein crying out wait a moment louie  they stood on the edge of a vast dip in the plain a bowl of amethyst and turquoise under the vivid october sun the tawny grass seemed to be transmuted into something that shimmered was translucent and yet was firm while the opposite wall already faintly in shadow rose by two degrees to snowflecked mountains faintly showing in the west and north on the floor of this resplendent amphitheatre a flock of cattle fed irregularly luminous as red and white and deeppurple beads the landscape was silentas silent as the cloudless sky above no bird or beast save the cattle and the horses the three travellers rode was abroad in this dreamworld  oh isnt it beautiful exclaimed jennie  curtis sat in silence till the guide said we must hurry long ways to streeter  then he drew a sigh that scene is typical of the old time nothing could be more moving to me i saw the buffaloes feed like that once whose are the cattle he asked of the boy  thompsons i think  but what are they doing herethats tetong land isnt it  the guide grinned that dont make no difference to thompson all same to him whose grass he eats  well lead on said curtis and the boy galloped away swiftly down the trail as they descended to the east the sun seemed to slide down the sky and the chill dusk rose to meet them from the valley of the elk like an exhalation from some region of icy waters night was near but streeters was in sight a big loghouse surrounded by sheds and corrals of various sorts and sizes  how does mr streeter happen to be so snugly settled on indian land asked jennie  he made his location before the reservation was set aside i believe there are about twenty ranches of the same sort within the lines replied curtis and i think well find in these settlers the chief cause of friction the cattle business is not one that leads to scrupulous regard for the rights of others  as they clattered up to the door of the ranchhouse a tall young fellow in cowboy dress came out to meet them he was plainly amazed to find a pretty girl at his door and for a moment fairly gaped with lax jaws  goodevening said curtis are you the boss here  he recovered himself quickly howdyhowdy yes im cal streeter wont you light off  thank you wed like to take shelter for the night if you can spare us room  why cert mother and the old man are away just now but theres plenty to eat he took a swift stride towards jennie let me help you down miss  thank you im already down said jennie anticipating his service  the young man called shrilly and a mexican appeared at the door of the stable hosy come and take these horses turning to jennie with a grin he said i cant answer for the quality of the grub fer hosy is cooking just now mothers been gone a week and the bread is wiped out if you dont mind slapjacks ill see what we can do for you  jennie didnt know whether she liked this young fellow or not after his first stare of astonishment he was by no means lacking in assurance however she was plainswoman enough to feel the necessity of making the best of any hospitality when night was falling and quickly replied dont take any trouble for us if youll show me your kitchen and pantry ill be glad to do the cooking  will you well now thats a sureenough trade and he led the way into the house which was a twostory building with onestory wings on either side the room into which they entered was large and bare as a guardroom the floor was uneven the log walls merely whitewashed and the beams overhead were rough pine boles some plain wooden chairs a table painted a pale blue and covered with dusty newspapers comprised the visible furniture unless a gunrack which filled one entire wall could be listed among the furnishings curtis brought a keen gaze to bear on this arsenal and estimated that it contained nearly a score of riflesa sinister array  young streeter opened a side door this is where you are to sleep just make yourself to home and ill rub two sticks together and start a fire  after jennie left the room the young fellow turned abruptly stranger what might i call you  my name is curtis im going over to visit the agency  she your wife he pointed his thumb in jennies direction  no my sister  oh well then you can bunk with me in this room he indicated a door on the opposite side of the hall when she gets ready bring her out to the kitchen its hard lines to make her cook her own grub but i tell you right now i think shed better  as jennie met her brother a few moments later she exclaimed isnt he handsome  myes hes goodlooking enough but hes just a little selfimportant it seems to me  are you going to let him know who you are  certainly not i want to draw him out i begin to suspect that this house is a rendezvous for all the interests we have to fight these guns are all loaded and in prime order  what a big house you have here said jennie ingratiatingly as she entered the kitchen and what a nice kitchen  oh purty fair replied the youth busy at the stove our ranch aint what wed make it if these injuns were out o the way now heres the grubif you can dig up anything youre welcome  he showed her the pantry where she found plenty of bacon and flour and some eggs and milk  i thought cattlemen never had milk  well they dont generally but mother makes us milk a cow now ill do this cooking if you want me to but i reckon you wont enjoy seein me do it i cant make biscuits and were all out o bread as i say and hosys sinkers would choke a dog  oh ill cook if youll get some water and keep a good fire going  sure thing he said heartily taking up the waterpail to go to the spring when he came back jennie was dabbling the milk and flour he stood watching her in silence for some minutes as she worked and the sullen lines on his face softened and his lips grew boyish  you sure know your business he said in a tone of conviction when i try to mix dough i get all strung up with it  she replied with a smile is the oven hot these biscuit must come out just right  he stirred up the fire a man aint fitten to cook hes too blame long in the elbows we have an old squaw when mother is home but she dont like me and so she takes a vacation whenever the old lady does that throws us down on hosy and he just about poisons us a mexican cant cook no moren an injun we get springpoor by the time the old lady comes back jennie was rolling at the dough and did not reply to him he held the door open for her when she was ready to put the biscuit in the oven and lit another bracketlamp in order to see her better  do you know youre the first girl i ever saw in this kitchen  am i  thats right after a pause he added im mighty glad i didnt get home to eat hosys supper i want a chance at some of them biscuit  slice this bacon pleasenot too thick she added briskly  he took the knife where do you hail from anyway he asked irrelevantly  from the coast she replied  that so born there  oh no i was born in maryland near washington  theres a place id like to live if i had money enough a feller can have a continuous picnic in washington if hes got the dust to spare so i hear  now you set the table while i make the omelette  the howmany  the omelette which must go directly to the table after it is made  he began to pile dishes on the table which ran across one end of the room but found time to watch her as she broke the eggs  if a feller lives long enough and keeps his mouth shut and his eyes open hell learn a powerful heap wont he ive seen that word in the newspaper a whole lot but ill be shot if i ever knew that it was jest aigs  jennie was amused but too hungry to spend much time listening you may call them in she said after a glance at the biscuit  the young man opened the door and said lazily cap come to grub  curtis was again examining the guns in the rack youre well heeled  haff to be in this country said the young fellow carelessly set down anywherethat is i mean anywhere the cook says  jennie didnt like his growing familiarity but she dissembled sit here george she said indicating a chair at the end i will sit where i can reach the coffee  let me do that said calvin louie i guess youre not in this game he said to the boy looking wistfully in at the door  oh let him comehes as hungry as we are let him sit down protested jennie  young streeter acquiesced its all the same to me if you dont object to a breed he said brutally louie took his seat in silence but it was plain he did not enjoy the insolence of the cowboy  curtis was after information you speak of needing gunsthere isnt any danger i hope  well not right now but we expect to get congress to pass a bill removing these brutes and then there may be trouble even now we find it safer to go armed every little while some injun kills a beef for us and we want to be prepared to skin em if we jump em up in time i wouldnt trust one of em as far as you could throw a yearling bull by the tail  are they as bad as that asked jennie with widely open eyes  theyre treacherous hounds old elk goes around smiling but hed let a knife into me too quick if he saw his chance hark he called with lifted hand  they all listened the swift drumming of hoofs could be heard mingled with the chuckle of a carriage calvin rose thats the old man i reckon and going to the door he raised a peculiar whoop a voice replied faintly and soon the buggy rolled up to the door and the newcomer entered the front room a quick sharp voice cried out  whose hat is that whos here  a feller on his way to visit the agent hes in there eatin supper  a rapid resolute step approached the door and curtis looked up to meet the keen eyes of a big ruddyfaced man of fifty with hair and beard as white as wool his eyes were steelblue and penetrating as fire  goodevening sir goodevening madam dont rise keep your seats ill just drop my coat and sit down with you  he was so distinctly a man of remarkable quality that curtis stared at him in deep surprise he had expected to see a loosejointed slouchy man of middleage but joseph streeter was plainly a man of decision and power his white hair did not betoken weakness or age for he moved like one in the full vigor of his late manhood to his visitors he appeared to be a suspicious irascible and generous man  hello he called jovially biscuit cal you didnt do these nor hosy neither  cal grinned well not by a whole row o dogs thislady did em  streeter turned his vivid blue eyes on jennie i want to know well im much obliged when did you come he asked of curtis  about an hour ago  goin far  over to the agency  friend of the agent  no but i have a letter of introduction to him  streeter seemed to be satisfied youll find him a very accommodating gentleman  so i hear said curtis and some subtle inflection in his tone caused streeter to turn towards him again  what did i understand your name was  curtis  where from  san francisco  oh yes i think i heard sennett speak of you those biscuit are mighty good ill take another couldnt persuade you to stay here could i he turned to jennie  jennie laughed im afraid notits too lonesome  cal seized the chance to say it aint so lonesome as it looks now were a lively lot here sometimes  streeter gave him a glance which stopped him cal you take hosy and go over to the camp and tell the boys to hustle in two hundred steers i want to get em passed on tomorrow afternoon or next day sure  calvins face fell i dont think i need to go hosy can carry the orders just as well as me he said boyishly sullen  i want you to go was the stern answer and it was plain that streeter was commander even of his reckless son  as he rose from the table calvin said in a low voice to jennie ill be here to breakfast all right and ill see that you get over to the agency  streeter the elder upon reflection considered that his guests had not sufficiently accounted for themselves and after calvin left again turned a penetrating glance on curtis saying in a peculiar way where did you say you were from  san francisco replied curtis promptly and cut in ahead with a question of his own you seem to be well supplied with munitions of war do you need all those guns now  need every shell were going to oust these devils pretty soon and they know it and theyre ugly  what do you mean by ousting em  were pushing a bill to have em removed  where to  oh to the red river reservation or the powder valley were not particular so that we get rid of em  jennie tingled with indignation as streeter outlined the plans of the settlers and told of his friction with the redmen but curtis remained calm and smiling  youll miss their market for your beef wont you  oh thats a small item in comparison with the extra range well get and thereupon he entered upon a long statement of what the government ought to do  jennie rose wearily and the old man was all attention  i suppose you are tired and would like to go to bed  we are rather limp confessed curtis glad to escape the searching crossexamination which he knew would follow jennies retirement  when they were alone the two young people looked at each other in silence jennie with big horrified eyes curtis with an amused comprehension of his sisters feeling isnt he a pirate he doesnt know it but his state of mind makes him indictable for murder on the high seas  george i dont like this we are going to have trouble if this old man and his like are not put off this reservation  well now we wont put him off tonight especially as he is a gallant host but this visit here has put me in touch with the cattlemen i feel that i know their plans and their temper very clearly  george i will not sleep here in this room alone you must make up a cotbed or something these people make me nervous with their guns and mexican servants  dont you worry sis ill roll up in a blanket and sleep across your doorsill and this he did acknowledging the reasonableness of her fears     iii  curtis assumes charge of the agent   during the night curtis was quite sure he heard a party of men ride up to the door but in the morning there remained no signs of them  they were early on their feet and calvin true to his promise was present to help get breakfast he had shaved some time during the night and wore a new shirt with a purple silk handkerchief looped about his neck and jennie found it hard to be as cold and severe with him as she had resolved upon he was only a big handsome boy after all  im going to send that halfbreed back and take you over to the fort myself he said to curtis  no i cant have that curtis sharply replied if you care to ride with us over to the fort ive no objection but louie will carry out his contract with us the truth was he did not care to be under any further obligation to the streeters  breakfast was a hurried and rather silent meal as they rose jennie said apologetically i fear i cant stop to do up the dishes it is a long hard ride to the fort  thats right replied calvin its close on thirtyfive miles never you mind about the dishes hosy will swab em out  as they were mounting the elder streeter said hospitably if you return this way mr curtis make my ranch your halfway house he bowed to jennie my wife will be here then miss and you will not be obliged to cook your own meals  oh i didnt mind i rather enjoyed it responded jennie  calvin was delayed at the start and came thundering after with a shrill cowboy yell his horse running close to the ground with ears viciously laid back the boy made a fine figure as he swept past them with the speed of an eagle his was the perfection of range horsemanship he talked gesticulated rolled cigarettes put his coat on or off as he rode without apparent thought of his horse or of the ground he crossed  he knew nothing but the life of a cattleman and spoke quite frankly of his ignorance  the old man tried to send me to school once packed me off to st joe i stayed a week see here old man dont do that again i says i wont stand for it hell you might as well tie up a coyote as shut me in a schoolroom  he made a most picturesque guide as he rode ahead of them always in view completing a thousand typical combinations of man and horse and landscapenow suppling in his saddle to look down and a little backward at some sign now trotting straight towards a dark opening among the pines now wheeling swiftly to mount a sudden ascent on the trail everything he did was as graceful and as selfunconscious as the movements of a panther he was a living illustration of all the cowboy stories the girl had read his horse his saddle his peculiar slouching seat the roll of clothing behind his saddle his spurs his longheeled bootsevery detail was as it should be and jennie was glad of him and of louis too  yes its all here jennie replied curtisthe wild country the indian the gallant scout and the tender maiden  im having a beautiful ride since we left the wagonroad it really seems like the primitive wilderness  it is this little wedge of land is all these brave people have saved from the flood they made their last stand here the reflux from the coast caught them here and here they are waiting extinction  the girls eyes widened its tragic isnt it  yes but so is all life except to calvin streeter and even he wants what he cant get he told me this morning he wanted to go to chicago and take a fall out of a judge who fined him for carrying a gun so even he has his unsatisfied ambition as he told me about it he snarled like a young tiger  at about one oclock calvin who was riding ahead halted on the crest of a timbered ridge and raised a shout  hes topped the divide called curtis to jennie who was riding behind well soon be in  im glad of it im tired  when they reached the spot where calvin waited they could look down into the main valley of the elk and the agency a singular village of ancient barracks sheds corrals and redroofed storehouses was almost beneath them all about on the low hills the crisscrossing trails gave evidence that the tetongs were still a nation of horsemen theirs was a barren land a land of pineclad precipitous hills and deep valleys which opened to the easta region of scant rains and thin discouraged streams  the sight of the officers whitewashed quarters and the paradeground brought a certain sadness to curtis  the old garrison dont look as it did when i was here in 188 he said musingly army days in the west are almost gone the indian war is over what a waste of human life it was on both sides yes louie go ahead  as they alternately slid and trotted down the trail native horsemen could be seen coming and going their gay blankets sparkling in the clear air others on foot were clustered about the central building where the flag hung droopingly on a tall staff as they passed the corral groups of young tetongs smiled and nudged each other but offered no greeting neither did the older men though their keen eyes absorbed every detail of the strangers dress and bearing it was plain that they held every white man in suspicion especially if he came attended by a cowboy  calvin was elaborately free and easy with them all eager to show his wide acquaintanceship hello two horns hello hawk he called to a couple of finelooking men of middle age they did not reply hello gray wolf you old sardine want to try another horserace  gray wolf evidently something of a wag smilingly replied you bet got new ponyheap fast  calvin wheeled and spurred into the bunch of young fellows who scattered with shouts of laughter while the captain and jennie followed louie their guide to the agency gate  they were met at the fence before the office by two men one a middleaged man with a dirtygray beard and fat bloated cheeks who said blandly goodmorning sir goodmorning miss nice day  curtis dismounted are you mr sennett  i amwhat can i do for you he turned to his companion a tall young man with innocent gray eyes and a loose weak mouth this is my son clarence clarence take the ladys horse  thank you said the captain as he stepped inside the gate i am captain curtis of the cavalry detailed to take charge of this agency you have just left the officehave you the keys in your pocket if so please surrender them to me it is an unpleasant duty but i am ordered to assume absolute control at once  the mans red skin faded to a yellowgraythe color of his beard for a moment he seemed about to fall then the blood came surging back his cheeks grew purple with its weight  ill be damned if i submit it is an outrage  you cant afford to make any trouble i am sorry to do this but i am under orders of the department to take you unawares and on no account to let you return to your office  sennett began to bluster show me your authority  my authority is in this paper he drew the order from his pocket if you think a moment you will see that instant acquiescence is best  while sennett stormed the two chiefs elk and two horns drew near and lifting his hand curtis using the sign language swiftly said to them  i am your new agent the great father has heard that the old agent is bad i am here to straighten matters out i am swift eagledont you remember i came with bear robe i was only second lieutenant then  the faces of the old chiefs lit up with pleasure ay we remember we shake your hands we are glad you have come  curtis then asked who is your interpreterone you can trust one who can read this paper  the two men looked at each other for a moment elk said joe  two horns shook his head then catching sight of a man who was regarding the scene from a doorway not very distant he said in english himnawson hay my friend he called come here  this observer at once responded to two horns sign as he came up the chief said my friend here is a paper from washington read it for us  curtis said i am captain curtis of the cavalry detailed to act as agent here this is my commission  the stranger extended his hand im glad to meet you captain curtis very glad indeed as they shook hands he added ive read your articles on the sign language et cetera with great pleasure my name is lawson  curtis smiled are you osborne lawson im mighty glad to meet you this is my sister mr lawson  mr lawson greeted jennie with grace and she liked him at once his manner was direct and his voice pleasing he was tall lean and a little stooping but strong and brown now captain what can i do for you he asked turning briskly  i want you to read this paper to the chiefs here and then i intend to put a guard on the door mr sennett is not to be permitted to reenter his office these are harsh measures but i am not responsible for them  lawson looked thoughtful i see after reading the paper he said to the chiefs it is as this man has said the great father has sent him here to take charge of the office the old agent is cut offhe is not allowed to go back to his office for fear he may hide something have crow put a guard on the door the new agent will try to find out why you have not received your rations this is the secret of this paper and here is the signature of the secretary this is a true thing and you must now obey captain curtis i know him he said looking round him he is my friend you can trust him that is all  good good said the chiefs we understand  a short dark tetong in a frayed captains uniform came up i am chief of the police he signed what shall i do  guard the door of the office and of the issue house let no one but those i bring enter will you do as i say he asked  ay replied the officer whose name was crow  then all is said go guard the door  sennett and his son had withdrawn a little from the scene and were talking in low voices they had placed themselves in the worst possible light and they felt it as curtis reached this point in his orders sennett started to cross the road  wait a moment gentlemen called curtis my orders are very strict i must precede you there is a certain desk in your library mr sennett which i must search  sennett flamed out into wild oaths you shall not search my private papers  silence called curtis another oath and ill put you in the guardhouse  do you suppose im going to submit to this without protest you treat me like a criminal  so far as my orders go thats what you are said curtis i give you the benefit of the doubt so long as you act the gentleman but you must respect the presence of my sister or ill gag you after a pause he added in a gentler tone i dont pretend to judge your case i am merely obeying the orders of the department  i have powerful friends in washington you will regret this snarled sennett but his son was like one smitten dumb his breathing was troubled and his big gray eyes were childish in their wide appeal  lawson then spoke can i do anything further captain command me freely  no i think not except to see that my horses are taken care of and my guide fed i suppose there is a mess or boardinghouse where my sister can get something to eat  wont you come to dinner with me asked lawson mrs wilcox some artist friends and i are messing over in one of the old quarters and our midday dinner is waiting  curtis smiled grimly thank you i am on duty i must dine with mr sennett jennie will accept your invitation thankfully  as curtis walked over to the agency house with sennett and his son jennie looked anxious they may do something to him  lawson smiled oh no they wont they are quite cowed but ill suggest a guard he turned to two horns and said in dakota father the old agent is angry the new agent is a brave man but he is only one against two  i understand said the old man with a smile and a few minutes later a couple of policemen were sitting on the doorstep of the agents house it was a sunny place to sit and they enjoyed being there very much one of them understood english and the other was well able to tell an angry word when he heard it spoken  the drowsy hush of midday again settled down upon the little cluster of buildingsnews even when it passes swiftly among red people makes no noise it walks with velvet foot it speaks in a murmur it hastens but conceals its haste     iv  the beautiful elsie bee bee   as jennie entered the messhouse she uttered a little cry of amazement outwardly it was a rude barrack of whitewashed cottonwood logs but its interior glowed with color and light bright rugs were on the floor and a big divan in one corner displayed a monstrous black bearskin a capacious fireplace which dated back to the first invasion of the army filled one end of the hall which had been enlarged by the removal of a partition oilpaintings without frames were tacked against the walls and the odor of fresh pigments lingered in the air  this is our general meetingplace explained lawson  it smells like a studio jennie replied after a glance around her  a plain quiet little woman with a look of inquiry on her face appeared at the diningroom door and lawson called out  mrs wilcox this is miss curtis who will stay with us for a few days as they greeted each other he added there is a story to tell but we are late and it can wait where is elsie  still at work she never would come to her meals if we didnt call her  im disposed to try it some day will you take charge of miss curtis while i go fetch the delinquent  under mrs wilcoxs direction jennie prepared for luncheon in an adjoining room wondering still at the unexpected refinement of the furnishings and curious to see the artist  as she reentered the sittingroom a tall girl rose languidly to meet her and lawson said miss curtis this is miss brisbane the painter of the pictures you see about  miss brisbane bowed in silence while jennie cried out oh did you do them i think they are beautiful  the sincerity of her voice touched the young artist and she said im glad you like themsometimes i think theyre pretty bum  a slang word on the red lips of the handsome girl seemed wofully out of place to jennie who stared at her with the eager curiosity of a child she was slender and dark with an exquisite chin and her hands though slim and white were strong and capable her eyes were very dark of a velvety brownblack and her hair was abundant and negligently piled upon her small head altogether she had a stately and rather foreign presence which made jennie feel very dowdy and very commonplace  mrs wilcox hurried them all out into the diningroom where a pretty table was spread for six people jennies attention was absorbed by the walls which were also lightened with sketches of small red babies in gay cradles and of glowing bits of tawny plain and purple butte  did you do all of these beautiful things she asked  lawson interposed she did miss curtis be not deceived miss brisbanes languid manner springs from her theory of rest when work is finished she devitalizesi think that is the wordand becomes a rag but shes a horrible example of industry spineless as she now appears  miss brisbane remained quite unmoved by lawsons words smiling dreamily her red lips as serene as those of a child softly shaped themselves to say the strung bow needs relaxation  i think you are right said jennie with sudden conviction  elsie opened her eyes wide and murmured thank you  jennie went on now my trouble is just that im always nerved up i cant relax wont you teach me how  with pleasure are you going to live here asked elsie with faint accession of interest  as long as my brother does  i suppose youve come to teach these ragamuffins  lawson here answered for jennie miss curtis is a sister to captain curtis who has come to displace your uncle  miss brisbane looked up blankly i dont understand  lawson became explicit and as she listened the girls hands clinched  how abominable she cried with eyes aflame  not at all if mr sennett is an honest employé of the government he should be willing to be searchedif he isnt then no measure is too harsh hell get a thorough raking over if my impression of the new agent is correct  my father would not put a dishonest man in this place insisted elsie and i dont believe uncle sennett has done wrong  well now well suspend judgment retorted lawson who knew just when to change his tone captain curtis is an officer of known ability and no one can accuse him of prejudice his living doesnt depend upon pleasing either mr sennett or your father undoubtedly the government has good reasons for sending him here and i for one am willing to accept his judgment  elsie rose in swift resolution i say it is an outrage i am going to see that uncle sennett is not persecuted  lawson laid his hand on her arm and his voice was sternly quiet i think you would better finish your tea whatever protest you feel called upon to make can be made later if you like he added in a gentler voice i will represent you in the matter and go with you to see captain curtis during the afternoon i dont think we should trouble him now  elsie resumed her seat without either accepting or rejecting his offer and the meal continued in some constraint although lawson summoned his best humor to cover elsies passionate outburst  a few minutes later elsie sullenly retired to her studio and lawson said i am going out to see what is going on miss curtis please make yourself at home here  when the door closed behind him jennie turned to mrs wilcox why does mr lawson use that tone with miss brisbaneare they engaged  mrs wilcox laughed thats just what none of us knows sometimes i think they are husband and wifehe lectures her so                                       when curtis joined the mess in the evening he was weary and a little sombre vastly preoccupied with his difficult task at the office he had given but little attention to jennies announcement of having been taken into the bosom of an artistic family messing at the barracks and when elsie met him in a regal gown glittering and changeful he pulled himself up in surprise and admiration  elsie on her part was eager to see him and ready to do battle but as he faced her abrupt vigorous of movement keeneyed and composedalmost stern of countenanceshe was a little daunted he was handsomer than she had expected and older his head was impressive his frame muscular and his movements graceful plainly he was a man of power one it would be politic to treat with respect  as they took up their napkins at the table lawson opened out well captain we dont want to seem inquisitive but we are dying to know what youve been doing this afternoon we feel on the outside of it all  yes elsie quickly added we want to know whether there is to be a revolution or only a riot  curtis turned to her smilingly and replied youll all be disappointed ive been looking over accounts and holding humdrum audience with my clerksa very busy but very quiet afternoonnothing doing as the phrase goes  where is uncle sennett inquired elsie i tried to find him but your men would not let me into the office  you shouldnt have tried interjected lawson  is he your uncle asked curtis  hes my fathers sisters husbandbut that doesnt matter id defend him if he were a stranger i think he has been shamefully treated the idea of searching his private desk  curtis looked at her keenly i am under orders he said mr sennett is nothing to me one way or the other the question for answer ishas he abused his office  he has not exclaimed elsie i know he has not he is not a man to cheat and steal he is not a strong man but he is kind and generous  too kind and too generous muttered lawson  im sorry to say that the records are against him replied curtis and his action is against him he and his son have gone to pinon cityriding very like fugitives i had no orders to hold them indeed i was glad to let them go  elsie bit her lips he has gone to get aid she said at last and when he comes back you will take a different tone with him  curtis laughed i believe he did say hed have my hide or something like that  lawson put in a word hell do it too if the cattle interest can influence the secretary dont tell us any more than is proper captain buthow do you find his accounts  in very bad shape the chiefs say he has been holding back rations and turning in bad beef for some time  youd take the word of a nasty indian against my uncle or any white man i can see that said elsie in withering scorn  curtis turned upon her a most searching glance miss brisbane i dont understand your attitude towards me as a soldier on special duty detailed almost against my will i have no prejudice in this affair it is my duty to see that the treaties of the government are carried out you seem to think i am started on a line of persecution of your uncle he checked himself i beg you will not pursue the subject any further he turned to lawson with an effort to put aside unpleasant conversation please dont ask me disagreeable questions when i am curious to know the meaning of this artistic invasion of my territory who is responsible for these pictures  lawson hastened to explain this plague of artists is due to me entirely captain curtis i am doing some studies of the tetongs and miss brisbane came out to make some illustrations for me in fact she suggested coming here rather than to the upper agencies because of her uncles presence our coming brought others  i am very glad you came said curtis heartily and i will do all in my power to further your work please do not allow my coming to change your plans in the slightest degree  lawson continued intending to stay some months we concluded to set up a mess and be comfortableand permit me to say we hope youll eat with us until your own goods arrive  thank you i accept with pleasure for i dont enjoy camping in the tent of my angry predecessorthis company is more to my mind  elsies red lips were tremulous with indignation you cant blame mr sennett for being angry you would be if treated in the same way there is no justice in it i would never have surrendered those keys to you  curtis patiently repeated my orders were peremptory  you cant take shelter behind that plea your acts are atrocious and i shall write to my father in washington and have you investigated she was beautiful as flame in the glow of her wrath  curtis seemed struck with a new idea are you the daughter of exsenator brisbane  she braced herself well suppose i am  oh nothing at allonly it explains  what does it explain  your attitude it is quite natural for a daughter of andrew brisbane to take sides against these people he was not in a mood to be gallant and his glance quelled the angry girl  with flushed face and quivering lips she sprang to her feet i will not stay to be insulted she said  curtis rose as she swept from the room but checked his instinctive words of apology and returned to his seat in silence  mrs wilcox relieved the painful pause by saying captain curtis you must not misjudge elsie she is a much better girl than she seems  lawson was troubled as he said she has lashed herself into a great rage over this affair but as a matter of fact she dont care a hang for sennett  i cant apologize for doing my duty said curtis even to miss brisbane  certainly not replied lawson though he was deeply hurt by elsies display of unreason  as soon as he decently could he followed her to her studio where he found her lying in sullen dejection on the big divan bee bee you are missing a good dinner he began gently  she was instantly ready to fight i suppose you blame me for this scene  i think you are hasty and a little unreasonable i know curtis by reputation and he is above any petty malice  you are taking his side against me  not at all bee bee i am merely trying to show you  he looked at me as no man ever dared to look before and i hate him he thinks because he has a little authority he can lord it over us all here i shall write to father at once telling him just how this little prig of a lieutenant  captain interrupted lawsonfor distinguished service  his smile made her furious she flung herself back on the divan go away i hate you too  lawson at the end of his patience went out and closed the door behind him what is the matter with the girl he said to mrs wilcox ive seen her in temper but never like this she has taken the most violent antagonism to curtis  shed better let that young man alone replied mrs wilcox sagely he has a very firm mouth     v  caged eagles   the word had gone out among all the red people that the old agent was entirely cut off and that a soldier and a signtalker had come to take his place and so each little camp loaded its tepees on wagons or lashed them to the ponies and came flocking in to sit down before the little father and be inspired of him  the young men came first whirling in on swift ponies looking at a distance like bands of cowboysfor though they hated the cattlemen they formed themselves on calvin streeter as a model each wore a wide white hat and dark trousers and carried a gay kerchief slung round his neck all still wore moccasins of buckskin beautifully beaded and fringed and their braided hair hung low on their breasts  the old men who jogged in later in the day still carried blankets though they too had adopted the trousers and calico shirts of the white man several of the chieftains preserved their precious peacepipes and their fans and tobacco pouches as of old and a few of those who had been in washington came in wrinkled suits of armyblue the women dressed in calico robes cut in their own distinctive style with wide sleeves the loose flow of the garment being confined at the waist with a girdle as this was a time of great formality several of the young girls returned to their buckskin dresses trimmed with elk teeth which they highly prized  as a race they were tall and strong but the men from much riding were thin in the shanks and bowed out at the knee they had lost the fine proportions for which they were famed in the days when they were trailers afoot straight as an indian no longer applied to them but they were all skilled and picturesque horsemen lacking in beauty and strength they possessed other compensating qualities which still made them most interesting to an artist their gestures were unstudiedly graceful and their roughhewn faces were pleasant in expression ill words or dark looks were rare among them  in all external things they were quite obviously halfway from the tepee to the cabin their homes consisted of small hovels of cottonwood logs set round with tall tepees and low lodges of canvas used for dormitories and kitchens in summer a rack for drying meat rations was a part of each familys possessions they owned many minute ponies and their camps abounded in dogs of wolfish breed which they handled not at all for they were as of old merely the campguard  such were the salient characteristics of the tetongs westernmost representatives of a once powerful race of hunters whose home had been far to the east in a land of lakes rivers and forests they were not strangers to the young soldier he knew their history and their habits of thought he now studied them to detect change and found deterioration i am your friend he said to them each and all i come to do you good to lead you in the new road it is a strange road to me also for i too am a soldier and a hunter but together we will learn to make the earth produce meat for our eating put your hand in mine  he was plunged at once into a wilderness of work but in his moments of leisure the face of elsie brisbane came into his thought and her resentment troubled him more than he cared to acknowledge he well knew that her birth and her training put her in hopeless opposition to all he was planning to do for the tetongs and yet he determined to demonstrate to her both the justice and the humanity of his position  he knew her fathers career very well he had once travelled for two days on the same railway train with him and remembered him as a boastful but powerful man whose antagonism no one held in light esteem andrew brisbane had entered the state at a time when its mineral wealth lay undeveloped and free to the taker and having leagued himself with men less masterly than himself but quite as unscrupulous had set to work to grasp and hold the natural resources of the great territoryhe laid strong fists upon the mines and forests and grass of the wild land once grasped nothing was ever surrendered  it mattered nothing to him and his kind that a race of men already lived upon this land and were prepared to die in defence of it by adroit juggling he and his corporation put the unsuspecting settler forward to receive the first shock of the battle and when trouble came loudly called upon the government to send its troops in support of the pioneers in this way without danger to himself the shrewd old yankee had acquired mineral belts cattleranges railway rights and many other good things and at last when the territory was made a state he became one of its senators  naturally he hated the red people they were pestilential because first of all they paid no railway charges and also for the reason that they held the land away from those who would add to his unearned increment and increase the sum total of his tariff receipts his original plan was broadly simple sweep them from the earth he snarled when asked what will we do with the indians but his policy modified by men with hearts and a sense of justice had settled into a process of remorseless removal from point to point from tillable land to grazing land from grazing land to barren waste and from barren waste to arid desert he had no doubts in these matters it was good business and to say a thing was not good business was conclusive the tetong did not payremove him  elsie in her homelife therefore had been well schooled in race hatred tenderhearted where suffering in a dog or even a wolf was concerned she remained indifferent when a tribe was reported to be starving nothing modified her view till as an art student in paris she came into contact with men who placed high value on the redman as material she found herself envied because she had casually looked upon a few of these wonderful chaps as newt penrose called them and was often asked to give her impressions of them when she returned to new york she was deeply impressed by maurice stewarts enormous success in sculpturing certain types of this despised race a little later wilfred j buttes who had been struggling along as a painter of bad portraits suddenly purchased a house in a choice suburb on the strength of two summers work among the mountain utes  thereupon elsie opened her eyes not that money was a lure to her for it was not but she was eager for noticefor the fame that comes quickly and with loud trumpets and gay banners in conversation with lawson one day she learned that he was about to do some penportraits of noted tetong chieftains and at once sprang to her opportunity she admired and trusted lawson his keen judgment his definiteness of speech awed her a little and with him she was noticeably less assertive than with the others of her artist acquaintances so here now she sat painting with rigor and immense satisfaction the picturesque rags and tinsel ornaments of the tetongs to her they were beggars and tramps on a scale with the lazzaroni of rome or naples that they were anything more than troublesome models had not been borne in on her mind  she had never professed special regard for her uncle the agentin fact she covertly despised him for his lack of powerbut now that the issue was drawn she naturally flew to the side of those who would destroy the small peoples of the earth she wrote to her father a passionate letter  cant you stop this she asked no doubt uncle henry will go direct to washington and make complaint this captain curtis is insufferable i would leave here instantly only i am bound to do some work for mr lawson we must all go soon for winter is coming on but i would like to see this upstart humbled he treats me as if i were a schoolgirldeclines to argue the matter oh he is provoking his sister is a nice little thing but she sides with him of courseand so does lawson in a sense so you see i am all alone the settlers are infuriated at uncle sennetts dismissal and will support you and uncle henry  in the days that followed she met curtiss attempts at modifying her resentment with scornful silence and took great credit to herself that she did not literally fly at his head when he spoke of his work or his wards her avoidance of him became so painful that at the end of the third day he said to his sister jennie i think i will go to the school mess after this miss brisbanes hostility shows no signs of relenting and the situation is becoming decidedly unpleasant  george said jennie sternly dont you let that snip drive you away why the thing is ridiculous she is here on sufferanceyour sufferance you could order them all off the reservation at once  i know i could but i wont you know what i meani cant even let miss brisbane know that she has made me uncomfortable shes a very instructive example of the power of environment she has all the prejudices and a good part of the will of her father and represents her class just as a little wildcat represents its species shes a beautiful girl and yet she is to me one of the most unattractive women i ever knew  jennie looked puzzled you are a little hard on her george she is unsympathetic but i think she says a lot of those shocking things just to hurt you  that isnt very nice either he said quietly well our goods are on the way and by thursday well be independent of any one but maybe you are rightit would excite comment if i left the mess i will join you all at meals until we are ready to light our own kitchen fire  thereafter he saw very little of the artists by borrowing a few necessaries of his head farmer he was able to camp down in the house which sennett had so precipitately vacated he was busy very busy during the day but when his work was over and he sat beside his fire pipe in hand elsies haughty face troubled him his life had not taken him much among women and his love fancies had been few his duties as an officer and his researches as a forester and mapbuilder had also aided to keep him a bachelor once or twice he had been disturbed by a fair face at the post only to have it whisked away again into the mysterious world of happy girlhood whence it came  and now at thirtyfour he was obliged to confess that he was as far from marriage as everfarther in fact for an indian reservation offers but slender opportunity in way of courtship for a man of his exacting tastes  he was not quite honest with himself or he would have acknowledged the pleasure he took in watching elsies erect and graceful figure as she rode past his office window of a morning it was pleasant to pause at the open door of her studio for a moment and say goodmorning though he received but a cold and formal bow in return she was more alluring at her easel than in any other place for she had several curious and very pretty tricks in working and seemed like a very intent child with her brown hair loosening over her temples her eyes glowing with excitement while she dabbed at the canvas with a piece of cheesecloth or a crumb of bread she dragged her stool into position with a quick amusing jerk holding her brush in her teeth meanwhile her blouses were marvels of odd grace and rich color  the soldier once or twice lingered in silence at the door after she had forgotten his presence and each time the glow of her disturbing beauty burned deeper into his heart and he went away with drooping head  mrs wilcox took occasion one day to remonstrate with her niece elsie you were very rude to captain curtis again today he was deeply hurt  now aunt dont you try to convert me to a belief in that tin soldier he gets on my nerves  it would serve you right if he ordered us off the reservation your remarks today before that young mr streeter were very wrong and very injudicious and will be used in a bad cause captain curtis is trying to keep the peace here and you are doing a great deal of harm by your hints of his removal  i dont care i intend to have him removed i have taken a frightful dislike to him he is a prig and a hypocrite and has no business to come in here in this way setting his lowdown indians up against the settlers  thats just what he is trying not to do and if you werent so obstinate youd see it and honor him for his good sense  aunt dont you lecture me cried the imperious girl i will not allow it  in truth mrs wilcoxs wellmeant efforts at peacemaking worked out wrongly elsie became insufferably rude to curtis and her letters were filled with the bitterest references to him and his work  lawson continued most friendly and curtis gladly availed himself of the wide knowledge of primitive psychology which the ethnologist had acquired the subject of indian education came up very naturally at a little dinner which jennie gave to the teachers and missionaries soon after she opened house and lawsons remarks were very valuable to curtis lawson was talking to the principal of the central school we should apply to the indian problem the law of inherited aptitudes he said slowly we should follow lines of least resistance fifty thousand years of life proceeding in a certain way results in a certain arrangement of braincells which cant be changed in a day or even in a generation the red hunter for example was trained to endure hunger cold and prolonged exertion when he struck a gametrail he never left it his pertinacity was like that of a wolf these qualities do not make a marketgardener they might not be out of place as a herder we must be patient while the redman makes the change from the hunter to the herdsman it is like mulching a young crabapple and expecting it to bear pippins  patience is an unknown virtue in an indian agent remarked the principal of the central schoolpresent company excepted  do you believe in the allotment asked miss colson one of the missionaries for kindergarten work an eager little woman aflame with religious zeal  not in its present form replied lawson shortly any attempt to make the tetong conform to the isolated dreary lonesome life of the western farmer will fail the redman is a social beinghe is pathetically dependent on his tribe he has always lived a communal life with the voices of his fellows always in his ears he loves to sit at evening and hear the chatter of his neighbors his games his hunting his toil all went on with what our early settlers called a bee he seldom worked or played alone his worst punishment was to be banished from the camping circle now the dawes theorists think they can take this man who has no newspaper no books no letters and set him apart from his fellows in a wretched hovel on the bare plain miles from a neighbor there to improve his farm and become a citizen this mechanical theory has failed in every case nominally the sioux the piegans are living this abhorrent life actually they are always visiting the loneliness is unendurable and so they will not cultivate gardens or keep livestock which would force them to keep at home if they were allowed to settle in groups of four or five they would do better  miss colsons deep seriousness of purpose was evident in the tremulous intensity of her voice if they had the transforming love of christ in their hearts they would feel no loneliness  a silence followed this speech both men mentally shrugged their shoulders but jennie came to the rescue  miss colson did you ever live on a ranch miles from any other stovepipe  no but i am sure that with god as my helper i could live in a dungeon  you should have been a nun said lawson i dont mind your living alone with christ but i think it cruel and unchristian to force your solitary way of life on a sociable redman would christ do that would he insist on shutting the door on their mythology their nature lore their dances and ceremonies would he not go freely among them glad of their joy and condemning only what was hurtful is there any record that he ever condemned an innocent pleasure how do you know but they are as near the creators design as the people of ohio  the teachers pretty face was strained and white and her wideset eyes were painful to see she set her slim hands together oh i cant answer you now but i know you are wrongwickedly wrong  jennie again broke the intensity of the silence by saying two big men against one little woman isnt fair i object to having the indian problem settled over cold coffee mr lawson stop preaching  miss colson is abundantly able to take care of herself said slicer and the other teachers who had handed over their cause to their ablest advocate chorused approval  curtis who sat with deeply meditative eyes fixed on miss colson now said it all depends on what we are trying to do for these people personally i am not concerned about the future life of my wards i want to make them healthy and happy here and now  times up cried jennie and led the woman out into the safe harbor of the sittingroom  after they had lighted their cigars lawson said privately to curtis now theres a girl with too much moral purposejust as elsie is spoiled by too little however i prefer a wholesome pagan to a morbid christian  its rather curious curtis replied miss colson is a pretty girla very pretty girl but i cant quite imagine a man being in love with her what could you do with such inexorable moral purpose you couldnt put your arm round it could you  youd have to hang her up by a string like one of these toy angels the dutch put atop their christmastrees the tetongs fairly dread to see her comingthey think shes deranged  i know itthe children go to her with reluctance she doesnt seem wholesome to them as miss diehl does and yet i cant discharge her  naturally not youd hear from the missionary world think of it i find miss colson too pious please take her away both men laughed at the absurdity of this and lawson went on i wished a dozen times during dinner that elsie bee bee had been present it would have given her a jolt to come in contact with such inartistic unshakable convictions  she would have been here only her resentment towards me is still very strong  she has it in for you sure thing i cant budge her said lawson smiling shes going to have you removed the moment she reaches washington  i have moments when i think id like to be removed said curtis as he turned towards mr slicer and his other guests suppose we go into the library gentlemen     vi  curtis seeks a truce   our artists are going to flit remarked jennie one evening as they were taking seats at luncheon  he looked up quickly are they  yes miss brisbane is going back to washington and mr lawson will follow no doubt  he unfolded his napkin with unmoved countenance well they are wise we are likely to have a norther any day now  the soldier had all the responsibilities and perplexities he could master without the addition of elsie brisbanes disturbing lure the value of her good opinion was enormously enhanced by the news of her intended departure and for a day or two curtis went about his duties with absentminded ineffectiveness he even detected himself once or twice sitting with his pen in his hand creating aimless markings on his blottingpad wilson the clerk on one occasion waited full five minutes for an answer while his chief debated with himself whether to call upon miss brisbane at the studio or at the house he began to find excuses for hera man who is a villain in business may be a very attractive citizen in private lifeand she may have been very fond of sennett from her point of viewanyhow she is a lovely young girl and it is absurd to place her among my enemies the thought of her face set in bitter scorn against him caused his heart to contract painfully ive been too harsh these people are repugnant to one so dainty and superrefined there are excuses for her prejudice i cant let her go away in anger and in this humble mood he stopped at the door of her studio one morning prepared to be very patient and very persuasive  goodmorning miss brisbane may i come in  certainly if my work will interest you she replied youll excuse my going on i want to finish this portrait of little peta today  by all meansi do not intend to interrupt he took a seat to the front and a little to the left of her and sat in silence for a few moments her brown hair piled loosely on her head brought out the exquisite fairness of her complexion and the big loose sleeve of her blouse made her hand seem like a childs but it was strong and steady she was working with her whole mind breathing quickly as she mixed her colors holding her breath as she put her brush against the canvas she used the apparently aimless yet secure movement of the born painter with halfclosed eyes and head a little to one side with small hand lifted to measure and compare she took on a new expression a bewitching intentness which quite transformed her  i hear you are going away said curtis at last speaking with some effort uncertain of her temper  yes we break up and vacate tomorrow  why break up you will want to come back next spring leave the place as it is  she gave him a quick keen glance and put her head again on one side to squint  i have no intention of returning  have you exhausted indian subjects  oh no she exclaimed with sudden artistic enthusiasm i have just begun to see what i want to do  then why not come back she did not reply and he resumed with tender gravity i hope i havent made it so unpleasant for you that you are running away to escape me  she turned with a sharp word on her tongue but he was so frank and so handsome and withal so humble that she instantly relented she was used to this humility in men and knew the meaning thereof and a flush of gratified pride rose to her face the proud soldier had become a suitor like the others  oh noyou have nothing to do with it she replied carelessly  i am glad of that i was afraid you might think me unsympathetic but i am not i am here this morning to offer you my cordial assistance for i am eager to see this people put into art so far as i know they have never been adequately treated in painting or in sculpture  thank you she said i dont think i shall go very far with them they are very pleasant on canvas but there are too many disagreeable things connected with painting them i dont see how you endure the thought of living here among them she shuddered i hate them  i dont understand that hardness in you miss brisbane he replied  im sure it isnt mysterious i hate dirt and rags even when painted now little peta here is quite different she is a dear little thing see her sighshe gets so tired but shes patient  you are making a beautiful picture of her your skill is marvellous his method of approach was more adroit than he realized she softened yet again  thank you i seem to have hit her off very well  will you exhibit in washington this winter he asked with boyish eagerness  i mayi havent quite decided she said quite off guard at last  if you do i wish you would let me know i may be able to visit the exhibition and witness your triumph  she began to suspect his motives oh my little row of paintings couldnt be tortured into a triumph ive stolen the time for them from mr lawson whose illustrations i have neglected she was again cold and repellent  miss brisbane this whole situation has become intolerable to me he rose and faced her very sincere and deeply earnest i do not like to have you go away carrying an unpleasant impression of me what can i do to change it if i have been boorish or presuming in any way i sincerely beg your pardon  she motioned to peta you can go now dear ive done all i can today  curtis took up his hat i hope i have not broken up your sitting it would be unpardonable in me  she squinted back at the picture with professional gravity oh no i only had a few touches to put in under the chinthat luminous shadow is so hard to get im quite finished  she went behind a screen for a few moments and when she reappeared without her brushes and her blouse she was the society young lady in tone and manner  would you like to look at my sketches she asked theyre jolly rubbish the whole lot but they represent a deal of enthusiasm  her tone was friendlytoo friendly considering the point at which he had paused and he was a little hurt by it was she playing with him  his tone was firm and his manner direct as he said miss brisbane i am accustomed to deal directly with friends as well as enemies and i like to have people equally frank with me i know you are angry because of my action in the case of your uncle i do not ask pardon for that i was acting there in line of my duty but if i have spoken harshly or without due regard to your feelings at any time i ask you to forgive me  he made a powerful appeal to her at this moment but she wilfully replied you made no effort to soften my uncles disgrace  i didnt know he was your uncle at that time he said but his face grew grave quickly it would have made no difference if i hadmy orders were to step between him and the records of the office so far as my orders enlightened me he was a man to be watched he turned towards the door is there anything i can do to help you reach the station tomorrow my sister and i would gladly drive you down  she was unrelenting but very lovely as she replied thank you you are very kind but all arrangements are made  goodafternoon miss brisbane  goodbye captain curtis  she is hardhard as iron he said as he walked away her fathers daughter in every fibre  he was ashamed to acknowledge how deeply he felt her rejection of his friendship and the thought of not seeing her again gave him a sudden sense of weakness and loneliness  elsie on her part was surprised to find a new nerve tingling in her brain and this tremor cut into the complete selfsatisfaction she expected to feel over her refusal of the peacepipe several times during the afternoon while superintending her packing she found herself standing in an attitude of meditationher inward eye reverting to the fine manly figure he made while his grave sweet voice vibrated in her ears she began to see herself in an unpleasant light and when at the dinnertable lawson spoke of curtis she listened to him with more real interest than ever before  he is making wonderful changes here lawson was saying everywhere you go you see tetongs working at fencebuilding bridgemaking cabinraising with their eagle feathers fluttering in the winds their small hands chapped with cold they are sawing boards and piling grain in the warehouse and daubing red paint on the roofs they are in a frenzy of work every man has his rations and is happy in some way he has persuaded the chiefs to bring in all the schoolchildren and the benches are full of the little shockheads wild as colts  a new broom etc murmured elsie  his predecessor never was a new broom retorted lawson quickly sennett always had a nasty slaunch to him he never in his life cleaned the dirt from the corners and i dont see exactly why you take such pains in defending him  because he is my uncle she replied  uncle bootjack that is pure fudge bee bee you didnt speak to him once a week you privately despised himanybody could see that you are simply making a cudgel of him now to beat curtis withand to speak plainly i think it petty of you more than this youd better hedge for im not at all sure that sennett has not been peculating  elsie stopped him with an angry gesture ill not have you accusing him behind his back  lawson threw out his hands in a gesture of despair all right but make a note of it youll regret this taking sides with a disreputable old bummer against an officer of captain curtiss reputation  you are not my master she said and her eyes were fiercely bright i do not wish to hear you use that tone to me again i resent it and she struck the floor with her foot henceforth if we are to remain friends you will refrain from lecturing me and she left the room with a feeling of having done two men a wrong by being unjust to herself and this feeling deepened into shame as she lay in her bed that night it was her first serious difference with lawson and she grew unhappy over it but he shouldnt take sides against me like that she said in an attempt to justify her anger  on the second morning thereafter lawson came into the office and said well captain we leave you this morning  curtis looked up into his visitors fine sensitive face and exclaimed abruptlyalmost violently im going to miss you old man  my hearts with you replied lawson and i shall return next spring  bring miss brisbane with you  id like to do so but she is vastly out of keyand i doubt meanwhile if i can be of any use to you in washington let me know  thank you lawson i trust you perfectly curtis replied with a glow of warm liking  as he stood at the gate looking up into elsies face she seemed very much softened and he wished to reach his hand and stay her where she sat but the last word was spoken and the wagon rolled away with no more definite assurance of her growing friendship than was to be read in a polite smile  jennie was tearful as she said after all they were worth while  curtis sighed as he said sis the realities of our position begin to make themselves felt playspells will be fewer now that our artists are gone  they certainly broke our fall replied jennie soberly osborne lawson is fine and i dont believe elsie bee bee is as ferocious as she pretends to be  its her training she has breathed the air of rapacity from childhood i cant blame her for being her fathers child  jennie looked at him as if he were presented from a new angle of vision george there is a queer streak in youfor a soldier youre too softhearted but dont you get too much interested in elsie bee bee shes dangerousand besides mr lawson wears an air of command     vii  elsie relents a little   the feeling against the redmen intensified throughout the state by the removal of sennett beat against curtis like a flood delegations of citizens headed by streeter and johnson proceeded at once to washington laden with briefs affidavits and petitions and there laid siege to congress as soon as the members began to assemble the twenty original homesteaders were taken as the text for most impassioned appeals by local orators and their melancholy situation was skilfully enlarged upon they were described as hardy and industrious patriots hemmed in by sullen savages with no outlet for trade and scant pasturage for their flocksin nightly fear of the torch and the scalpingknife  to curtis these settlers were by no interpretation martyrs in the cause of civilizationthey were quite other his birth his military training and his natural refinement tended to make him critical of them they were to him for the most part poor whites too pitiless to be civilized and too degenerate to have the interest of their primitive red neighbors the best of them he said to jennie are foolhardy pioneers who have exiled their wives and children for no good reason the others are cattlemen who followed the cavalry in order to fatten their stock under the protection of our guidon  the citizens of pinon city wondered why their delegates made so little impression on the department but streeter was not left long in doubt  the secretary interrupted him in the midst of his first presentation of the matter  mr streeter you are a cattleman i believe  streeter looked a little set back i amyes sir mr secretary  the secretary took up a slip of paper are you the streeter located on the reservation itself  yes sir  well you are an interested witness how can you expect me to take your word against that of captain curtis he tells me the tetongs are peaceful and quick to respond to fair treatment the department has absolute confidence in captain curtis and you are wasting time in the effort to discredit him the tribe will not be removed is there any other question you would like to raise  streeter took his dismissal hard he hurried at once to brisbane his face scarlet with rage he turned me down he snarled and hes got to suffer for it theres a way to get at him and you must find it  brisbane was too crafty to promise any definite thing now wait a moment neighbor never try to yank a badger out of his denwait and catch him on the open plain we must sound the committee on indian affairs and then move on the house if we cant put through our removal bill well substitute the plan for buying out the settlers if that dont work ive a little scheme for cutting down the reservation we must keep cooland dont mention my name in the matter what we want to do is to pave the way for my return to the senate next fall then i can be of some real service to you i am now entirely out of it as you can see but ill do what i can  streeter went away with a feeling that brisbane was losing his vigor and a few days later returned to the west very bitter and very inflammatory of speech the bill is lost it will be smothered in committee he said to calvin  brisbane after leaving streeter that day went home to dinner with an awakened curiosity to know more about this young man in whom the department had such confidence lawson was dining at his table that night and it occurred to him to ask a little more fully about curtis  see here lawson you were out there on the fort smith reservation werent you wasnt that where you and elsie camped this summer  elsie replied yes papa we were there when uncle sennett was dismissed  brisbane started a little why of course you were my memory is failing me well what about this man curtishes a crank on the indian question like yourself isnt he  lawson smiled we believe in fair play governor yes hes friendly to the indians  and a man of some ability i take it  a man of unusual ability he is an able forester a wellread ethnologist and has made many valuable surveys for the war department  his word seems to have great weight with the department  justly too for he is as able a man as ever held an agents position a few men like curtis would solve the indian problem  elsie who had been listening in meditative silence now spoke nevertheless his treatment of uncle sennett was brutal he arrested him and searched all his private papersdont you remember  brisbane looked at lawson solemnly and winked the eye farthest from his daughter lawsons lips quivered with his efforts to restrain a smile turning then to elsie brisbane said i recall your story nowyes he was pretty rigorous but im holding up the department for that the agent wasnt to blame he was sent there to do that kind of a job and from all accounts he did it well  elsie lifted her eyebrows does that excuse him he kept repeating to me that he was under orders but i took his saying so to be just a subterfuge  mighty little you know about war my girl to be a soldier means to obey orders from general down to corporal moreover your uncle has given me a whole lot of trouble and i wouldnt insist on a relationship which does us no credit ive held his chin above water about as long as im going to  elsie was getting deeper into the motives and private opinions of her father than ever before and as he spoke her mind reverted to the handsome figure of the young soldier as he stood before her in the studio asking for a kindlier goodbye his head was really beautiful and his eyes were deep and sincere she looked up at her father with frowning brows i thought you liked mr sennett he told me you got him his place  brisbane laughed my dear chicken he was a political choice he was doing work for our side and had to be paid  do you mean you knew the kind of a man he was when you put him there  brisbane pulled himself up short now see here my daughter youre getting out of your bailiwick  but i want to understandif you knew he was stealing  i didnt know it how should i know it i put him there to keep him busy i didnt suppose he was a sot and a petty plunderer now lets have no more of this brisbane was getting old and a trifle irritable but he was still master of himself i dont know why i should be taken to task by my own daughter  elsie said no more but her lips straightened and her eyes grew reflective as the coffee and cigars came in she left the two men at the table and went out into the musicroom it seemed very lonely in the big house that night and she sat down at the piano to play thinking to cure herself of an uneasy conscience she was almost as good a pianist as a painter and the common criticism of her was on this score bee does everything too well penrose said  she played softly musingly and for some reason sadly i wonder if i have done him an injustice she thought and then that brutal leer on her fathers face came to disturb her i wish he hadnt spoken to me like that she said i dont like his political world i wish he would get out of it it isnt nice  in the end she left off playing and went slowly up to her studio half determined to write a letter of apology her workshop which had been added to the house since her return from paris was on a level with her sittingroom which served as a reception hall to the studio itself her artist friends declared it to be too beautiful to work in and so it seemed for it was full of cosey corners and soft divansa glorious loungingplace nevertheless its walls were covered with pictures of her own making costly rugs and a polished floor seemed not to deter her from effort she remained a miracle of industry in spite of the scoffing of her fellows who were stowed about the city in dusty lofts like pigeons  proud and wilful as she seemed elsie had always prided herself on being just and to be placed in the position of doing an honorable man a wrong was intolerable the longer she dwelt upon her action the more uneasy she became her vision clarified all that had been hidden by her absurd prejudice and reasonless dislikethe soldiers frank and manly firmness lawsons reproaches her aunts open reproofall these grew in power and significance as she mused  taking a seat at her desk she began a letter captain curtis dear sir but this seemed so palpably a continuance of her repellent mood that she tore it up and started another in the spirit of friendliness and contrition which had seized upon her       dear captain curtisi have just heard something which      convinces me that i have done you an injustice and i hasten      to beg your pardon i knew my uncle sennett only as a child      knows a man of middle agehe was always kind and good and      amusing to me i had no conception of his real self my present      understanding of him has changed my feeling towards your      action i still think you were harsh and unsympathetic but i      now see that you were simply doing the will of the department      so far i apologize if you come to washington i hope you will      let us know  as she reread this it seemed to be a very great concession indeed but as she recalled the handsome troubled face of the soldier she decided to send it no matter what he might think of her as she sealed the letter her heart grew lighter and she smiled  when she reentered the library her father was saying no i dont expect to get him removed the present administration and its whole policy must be overthrown curtis is only a fly on the rim of the wheel he dont count  any man counts who is a moral force lawson replied with calm sincerity curtis will bother you yet     viii  curtis writes a long letter   the stagedriver and mailcarrier to fort smith was young cranes voice and this was his first trip in december he congratulated himself on having his back to the wind on the fiftymile ride up the valley a norther was abroad over the earth and sweeping down from arctic wildernesses seemingly gathered power as it came it crossed two vast states in a single night and fell upon the fort smith reservation with terrible fury about ten oclock in the morning  cranes voice did not get his mailsack till twelve but his ponies were fed and watered and ready to move when the bag came he did not know that it contained a letter to warm the heart of his hero the captain but he flung the sack into his cart and put stick to his broncos quite as manfully as though the little father waited the road was smooth and hard and quite level for thirty miles and he intended to cover this stretch in five hours darkness would come early and the snow which was hardly more than a frost at noon might thicken into a blizzard so he pushed on steadily fiercely silently till a sinister dusk began to fall over the buttes and then lifting his voice in a deep humming throbbing incantation he sang to keep off spirits of evil  cranes voice was something of an aristocrat as the son of chief elk he had improved his opportunities to learn of the white man and could speak a little english and understand a good deal more than he acknowledged which gave him a startling insight at times into the words and actions of the white people it was his report of the unvarying kindliness and right feeling of captain curtis which had done so much to make the whole tribe trust and obey the new agent  cranes voice was afraid of spirits but he shrank from no hardship he was proud of his blue uniform and of the revolver which he was permitted to wear to guard the mail no storm had ever prevented him from making his trip and his uncomplaining endurance of heat cold snow and rain would have been counted heroic in a military scout his virtues were so evident even to the cowboys that they made him an exception by saying yes crane is purty near white and being besotted in their own vanity they failed to see the humor of such a phrase in the mouth of a drunken obscene lawless son of a missouri emigrant as a matter of fact there were many like crane in the tribe only the settlers never came in personal contact with them  crane found his road heavy with drifts as he left the main valley and began to climb and he did not reach the agency till long after curtis had gone to bed but he found his anxious mother waiting for him together with the captain of police who took the bag of mail to the office as he drove into the big corral out of the wind the boy said in his quaint english me no like um blizzard fleeze ears like buffalo horn  curtis came to the office next morning with a heavy heart he knew how hard the bitter cold pressed upon his helpless wards and suffered acutely for sympathy he spoke to all of those he met with unusual tenderness and asked minutely after the children to be sure that none were ill or hungry  as wilson his clerk laid the big package of letters and papers on his table the paleblue square envelope which bore elsies handwriting was ostentatiously balanced on top wilson the lovelorn clerk sighed to think he had no such missive in his mail that gloomy morning looking in a halfhour later he found curtis writing busily in answer to that letter all the rest of his mail being untouched i thought so said he id neglect any business for a sweet little envelope like that and he sighed again  curtis had opened the letter eagerly but with no expectation of comfort as he read he forgot the storm outside a warm glow crept into his blood loverlike he got from the letter a great deal more than elsie had intended to say he seized his pen to reply at oncejust a few lines to set her mind at rest but his thought ran on so fast so full of energy that his writing became all but illegible       dear miss brisbaneyou have given me a great pleasure by      your letter and i am replying at once to assure you that i did      not lay your words up against you because i felt you did not      fully understand the situation your letter gives me courage to      say that i think you are unjust in your attitude towards these      primitive racesand i also hope that as fuller understanding      comes you will change your views       here they are fenced in on the poorest part of this bleak      reservation on the cold slope of the range exposed to the      heat and drought of summer and the storms of winter this      morning for example the wind is rushing up the converging      walls of this valleywhich opens out to the northeast you      rememberand the cold is intense i am just sending out      messengers to see that no children are freezing everything is      hard as iron and the indians muffled in their blankets are      sitting beside their fires glum as owls waiting the coming of      the sunshine       i must tell you something which happened since you went      awayit may correct your views of the tetongs it is my policy      to give all hauling and wood contracts to the indian instead of      the white man and when i told the white who has been putting      in the wood that i was about to let the contract to the reds he      laughed and said you cant get em to do that work but i      felt sure i could i called them together and gave them fifty      axes and told them how much wood i wanted a few days later i      thought id ride over to see how they were getting along as i      drew near i heard the most astonishing clickclack of      axestrokes shouts laughter the falling of trees and when i      came in sight i trun up both hands they had hundreds of      cords already cuttwice as much it seemed as i could use i      begged them to stop and finally got them to begin to haul in      the end i was obliged to take sixty cords more than i needed       you cannot understand what a pleasure it is for me to see      ancient lies about these people destroyed by such experiences      as this it was pathetic to me to find the two horns the      crawling elk and other proud old warriors toiling awkwardly      with their axes their small hands covered with blisters but      they laughed and joked about it and encouraged each other as      if they were newenglanders at a huskingbee my days and      nights are full of trouble because i can do so little for      them if they were on tillable land i could make them      selfsupporting in two years but this land is arid as a      desert it is fair to look upon but it will not yield a living      to any one but a herder       your attitude towards the socalled savage races troubles me      more than i have any right to mention the older i grow the      less certain i am that any race or people has a monopoly of the      virtues i do not care to see the little peoples of the world      civilized in the sense in which the word is commonly used it      will be a sorrowful time to me when all the tribes of the earth      shall have cottonade trousers and derby hats you as an      artist ought to shrink from the dead level of utilitarian      dress which the englishspeaking race seems determined to      impose on the world if i could i would civilize only to the      extent of making life easier and happierthe religious      beliefs the songs the native dressall these things i would      retain what is life for if not for this       my artist friends as a rule agree with me in these matters      and that is another reason why your unsympathetic attitude      surprises and grieves me i know your homelife has been such      as would prejudice you against the redman but your training in      paris should have changed all that you consider the tetongs      good materialif you come to know them as i do you will find      they are folks just like anybody else with the same rights      to the earth that we have of course they are crude and      unlovelyand sometimes they are cruel but they have an      astonishing power over those who come to know them well       pardon this long letter you may call me a crank or any hard      name you please but i am anxious to have you on the right side      in this struggle for it is a struggle to the death the      tragedy of their certain extinction overwhelms me at times i      found a little scrap of canvas with a sketch of peta on itmay      i keep it my sister is quite well and deep in the work she      often speaks of you and we are both hoping to see you next      year  it was foolish for him to expect an immediate reply to this epistle but he didhe counted the days which lay between its posting and a possible date for return mail perhaps had he been in washington diverted by congress cheered by the army and navy club and entertained by his friends he would not have surrendered so completely to the domination of that imperious girlface but in the dead of winter surrounded by ragged smoky squaws and their impatient complaining husbands with no companionship but his sister and wilson the lovesick clerk his thought in every moment of relaxation went back to the moments he had spent in elsies company nature cried out it is not good for man to be alone but the iron ring of circumstance held him a prisoner in a land where delicate women were as alien as orange blossoms or tearoses  outwardly composed indefatigable stern in discipline and judicial of report he was inwardly filled with a mighty longing to see again that slim young girl with the big black changeful eyes he made careful attempt to conceal his growing unrest from jennie but her sharp eyes accustomed to every change in his face detected a tremor when elsies name was mentioned and her ears discovered a subtle vibration in his voice which instructed her though she did not attain complete realization of his absorbing interest she was sympathetic enough to search out elsies name in the social columns of the washington papers and it was pitiful to see with what joy the busy indian agent listened to the brief item concerning miss brisbanes reception on monday or the description of her dress at the mccartney ball  jennie sighed as she read of these brilliant assemblages george i wonder if we will ever spend another winter in washington  oh i think so sissome time  some time but well both be so old we wont enjoy it sometimes i feel that we are missing everything thats worth while  he did not mention elsies letter and as the weeks passed without any reply he was very glad he had kept silence jennie had her secret also which was that elsie was as good as engaged to lawson no one knew this for a certainty but mrs wilcox was quite free to say she considered it a settled thing  jennie was relieved to know how indifferent her brother was to miss colson the missionary who seemed to be undergoing a subtle transformation with jennie she was always moaning and sighing but in the presence of her lord the agent she relaxed and became quite cheerful and dangerously pretty the other teachersgood commonplace soulswent their mechanical way with very little communication with the agents household but miss colson seized every opportunity to escape her messmates they are so material she said sighfully they make spiritual growth impossible to me  jennie was not deceived youre a cat thats what you area nice little scared cat but youre getting over your scare she added as she watched the devotee in spirited conversation with her brother  elsies reply to curtiss long letter was studiedly cool but polite i feel the force of what you say but the course of civilization lies across the lands of the small peoples it is sorrowful of course but they must go like the wolves and the rattlesnakes in this phrase he recognized the voice of andrew j brisbane and it gave him a twinge to see it written by elsies small hand the letter ended by leaving matters very adroitly at an equipoise it was friendlier than she had ever been in conversation yet not so womanly as he had hoped it might be as he studied it however some subtler sense than sight detected in its carefully compounded phrases something to feed upon and though he did not write in answer to it he had a feeling that she expected him to do so  meanwhile the tone of the opposition grew confident the settlers were convinced that congress would accede to their wishes and remove the tetongs and they began to treat the redmen with a certain goodnatured tolerance as if to say well youll soon be settled for anyway  calvin streeter came often to the agency and not infrequently stayed to dinner with curtis paying timid court to jennie who retained enough of her girlhoods coquetry to enjoy the handsome cowboys openeyed admiration even though she laughed at him afterwards in response to her brothers jesting calvin vastly improved under the stress of his desire to be worthy of her he caught up many of the captains nice mannerisms and handled his fork and napkin with very good grace indeed he usually came galloping across the flat his horse outstretched at full speed his hatrim uprolled by the wind his gay neckerchief fluttering his hands holding the reins higha magnificent picture of powerful young manhood as he reached the gate it was his habit to put his horse on his haunches with one sudden pitiless wrench on the mexican bit and drop to the ground and in dramatic contrast with his approach call out in smooth quiet voice  howdy folks howdy nice day  these affectations pleased jennie very much though she finally complained of his cruelty in reining in his horse so sharply  all right miss i wont do it no more he said instantly  he quite regularly invited them to the dances given round about and jennie was ready to go but curtis being too deeply occupied could not spare the time and that debarred jennie though calvin could see no good reason why it should ill take care of you said he but the girl could not trust herself to his protection  his was not a secretive nature and he kept curtis very well informed as to the feeling of the settlers reporting as he did their conversations as well as their speeches with great freedom and remarkable accuracy  in this way the agent learned that the cattlemen had agreed to use caution in dealing with him hes a bad man to monkey with was the sentiment calvin reported to be current among the settlers on the west fork young cranes voice also circulated this phrase properly translated into dakota to his uncles lame paw and two horns and so the tribe came to understand that they had a redoubtable defender in swift eagle as they called the agent in their own tongue  from every source they heard good things of him and they came to love him and to obey him as they had never loved and obeyed even their bestregarded chief the squaws made excuse to come in and shake hands with him and hear his laughter and the children no longer hid or turned away when he came nearon the contrary they ran to him crying hello hagent and clung to his legs as he walked the old men often laid their arms across his shoulders as they jokingly threatened to pull out the hairs of his face in order to make him a redman his lightest wish was respected the wildest young daredevil would dismount and take a hand at pushing a wagon or lifting a piece of machinery when curtis asked it of him  if i only had the water that flows in these three little streams he often said to jennie id make these people selfsupporting  well have things our own way yet replied jennie always the optimist     ix  called to washington   one day curtis announced with joyful face  sis we are called to washington get on your bonnet  she did not light up as he had expected her to do i cant go george she replied decisively and without marked disappointment  he seemed surprised why not  because i have my plans all laid for giving my little ingines such a christmas as they never had and you must manage to get back in time to be sandy claws  i dont see how i can do it i am to appear before the committee on indian affairs relative to this removal plan and there may be other business requiring me to remain over the holidays  i dont like to have you away i suppose youll see mr lawson and miss brisbane she remarked quietly after a pause  oh yes he replied with an assumption of carelessness i imagine lawson will appear before the committee and i hope to call on miss brisbanei want to see her paintings he did not meet his sisters eyes as squarely as was his wont and her keen glance detected a bit more color in his face than was usual to him you must certainly call she finally said i want to know all about how they live  many things combined to make this trip to washington most pleasurable to the soldier he was weary with six weeks of most intense application to a confused and vexatious situation and besides he had not been east for several years and his pocket was filled with urgent invitations to dinner from fellowofficers and coworkers in science courtesies which he now had opportunity to accept but back of all and above all was the hope of meeting elsie brisbane again he immediately wrote her a note telling her of his order to report at the department and asking permission to call upon her at her convenience  it was a long ride but he enjoyed every moment of it he gave himself up to rest he went regularly to his meals in the diningcar he smoked and dreamed and looked out with impersonal shadowy interest upon the flying fields and the whizzing cities he slept long hours and rose at will such freedom he had known only on the trail here luxury was combined with leisure in chicago a friend met him and they lunched at a luxurious club and afterwards went for a drive that night he left the western metropolis behind and washington seemed very near  as the train drew down out of the snows of the hill country into the sunshine and shelter of the potomac valley his heart leaped this was home here were the little whitewashed cabins the red soil the angular stone housesverandaed and shutteredof his native town it was pleasant to meet the darkies swarming chirping like crickets around the train they shadowed forth a warmer clime a less insistent civilization than that of the west and he was glad of them they brought up in his mind a thousand memories of his boylife in an old maryland village not far from the great city which still retained its supremacy in his mind he loved washington to him it was the centre of national life  the great generals the great political leaders were there and the greatest ethnologic bureau in all the world was there and when the gleaming monument came into view over the wooded hills he had only one regrethe was sorrowful when he thought of jennie far away in the bleak valley of the elk  it was characteristic of him that he took a cab to the smithsonian society rather than to the army and navy club and was made at home at once in the plain but comfortable rooms of the bug sharps he had just time to report by telephone to the department of the interior before the close of the official day several letters awaited him one was from elsie and this he read at once finding it unexpectedly cordial       my father is writing you an invitation to come to us      immediately you said you would arrive in washington on the      17th either on the 11 am train or the one at 3 pm in      either case we will look for you at 630 to dine with us before      you get your calendar filled with engagements i shall wait      impatiently to hear how you are getting on out there it is all      coming to have a strange fascination for me it is almost like      a dream  this letter quickened his pulse in a way which should have brought shame to him but did not the senators letter was ponderously polite i hope my dear captain curtis you will be free to call at once my daughter and lawson  at that word a chill wind blew upon the agents hope lawson i had forgotten the man he said almost aloud ah that explains her frank kindliness she writes as one whose affections are engaged and therefore feels secure from criticism or misapprehension that explained also her feeling for the valleyit was the scene of her surrender to lawson the tremor went out of his nerves his heart resumed its customary beating steady and calm and setting his lips into a straight line he resumed the senators letter which ended with these significant words there are some important matters i want to talk over in private  a note from lawson urged him to take his first breakfast in the city with him i want to post you on the inside meaning of certain legislation now pending i expect to see you at the brisbanes  curtis made his toilet slowly and with great care remitting nothing the absence of which would indicate a letting down of military neatness and discipline he wore the handsome undress uniform of a captain and his powerful figure still youthful in its erectness although the lines were less slender than he wished was dignified and handsomefit to be taken as a type of mature soldier he set forth selfcontained but eager  the brisbane portico of rose granite was immensely imposing to a dweller in tents and cantonments such as curtis had been for ten years but he allowed no sign of his nervousness to appear as he handed his overcoat and cap to the old colored man in the vestibule  as he started down the polished floor of the wide hall stepping over a monstrous tigerskin he saw elsie in the door of the drawingroom her back against the folded portière her slender figure was exquisitely gowned in palegreen and her color was iridescent in youthful sparkle he thought once againevening dress transforms a woman she met him with a smile of welcome  ah captain this is very good of you to come to us so soon  not at all he gallantly replied i would have come sooner had opportunity served  father this is captain curtis she said turning her head towards a tall man who stood within  brisbane came forward greeting curtis most cordially he was grayer than curtis remembered him and a little stooping from age his massive head was covered with a closeclipped bristle of white hair and his beard also neatly trimmed was shaped to a point from the habit he had of stroking it with his closed left hand in moments of deep thought his skin was flushed pink with blood and his urbane manner denoted pride and selfsufficiency he was old but he was still a powerful personality and though he shook hands warmly curtis felt his keen and penetrating glance as palpably as an electric shock  lawsons voice arose well captain i hardly expected to see you so soon  as the two men clasped hands elsie again closely compared them curtis was the handsomer man though lawson was by no means illlooking even by contrast the soldier more nearly approached the admirable male type but there was charm in the characteristic attitudes and gestures of the student who had the assured and humorous manner of the onlooker  a young woman of indeterminate type who was seated in conversation with mrs wilcox received curtis with impassive countenance eying him closely through pinchnose glasses mrs wilcox beamed with pleasure and inquired minutely concerning the people at the agency and especially she wished to know how little johnny and jessie eagle were i quite fell in love with the tots they were so cunning i hope they got the toys i sent  brisbane gave curtis the most studious attention lounging deep in his big chair occasionally he ponderously leaned forward to listen to some remark with his head cocked in keen scrutinyactions which did not escape the captains notice hes sizing me up he thought well let him  elsie also listened curiously like her father in certain inclinations of the headintent absorbed only lawson seemed indifferent to the news the agent guardedly recited  brisbane broke his silence by saying i infer youre on the side of the redskin  decidedly in this connection  quite aside from your duty  entirely so my duty in this case happened to be my inclination i could have declined the detail but being a believer in the armys arrangement of indian affairs i couldnt decently refuse  brisbane settled back into his chair and looked straight at his visitor  you think the white man the aggressor in this land question  curtis definitely pulled himself up i am not at liberty to speak further on that matter  mrs wilcox interrupted smilingly andrew dont start an argument now dinner is served and i know captain curtis is hungry  elsie rose yes papa leave your discussion till some other time when you can bang the furniture  curtis expected to take miss cooke in to dinner but elsie delighted him by saying youre to go in with me captain  i am very glad of the privilege he said with deliberate intent to please her his sincerity was unquestionable  curtis would have been more profoundly impressed with the spaciousness of the hall and the diningroom had they been less like the interior of a hotel the whole house so far as its mural decoration went had the overstuffed quality of a pullman car with the exception of the pictures on the walls which were exceedingly good for brisbane had successfully opposed all of elsies newfangled notions with regard to interior decoration he was of those who insist on being masters in their houses as well as in their business offices and elsies manner was that of an obedient daughter deferring to a sire who had not ceased to consider her a child  seated at elsies right hand with mrs wilcox between himself and the head of the table curtis was fairly out of reach of brisbane who was dangerously eager to open a discussion concerning the bill for the removal of the tetongs  elsie turned to him at once to say do you know captain curtis i begin to long to return to the west all my friends are enthusiastic over the studies i made last year and ive decided to go back next spring how early could one come out  any time after the first of mayin fact that is the most beautiful month in the year the grass is deliciously green then im glad to know you think of returning jennie will also rejoice it seems too good to be true will mr lawson also return  oh yes in fact i go to complete his workto do penance for neglecting him last summer and in her tone he fancied lay a covert warning as though she had said do not mistake me i am not coming out of interest in you  he needed the word for under the spell of her near presence and the charm of her smile new to him the soldier was beginning to glow again and to soften in spite of his resolution to be very calm  she went on i am genuinely remorseful because mr lawson has not been able to bring his paper out as he had planned  i will see that you have every possible aid he replied matteroffactly the work must be done soon  how handsome he is the girl thought as she studied his quiet face his profile is especially fine and the line of his neck and shoulders an impulse seized her and she said  captain id like to make a sketch of you could you find time to sit for me  thats very flattering of you but im afraid my stay in washington is too short and too preoccupied  her face darkened im sorry i know i could make a good thing of you  thank you for the compliment but it is out of the question at present next summer if you come out i will be very glad to give the time for it and that reminds me you promised to show me your pictures when i came and your studio  did i well you shall see them although they are not as good as i shall do next year one has to learn to handle new material your western atmosphere is so different from that of giverney in which we all paint in paris then the feeling of the landscape is so different everything is so firm and crisp in linebut i am going to get it there is the mystery of light as well as of the dark meunnot used to say to us and if i can get that clear shimmer and the vibration of the vivid color of the savage in the midst of it  she broke off as if in contemplation of the problem rapt with question how to solve it  there speaks the artist in you and it is fine but id like you to see the humanitarian side of life too he replied  there is none she instantly replied with a curious blending of defiance and amusement i belong to the world of light and might  and i to the world of rightwhat about that  light and might make right  your team is wrongly harnessedlight and right are coworkers might fears both light and right  mrs wilcox who had been listening fairly clapped her hands im glad to have you refute her arguments captain she is absolutely heartless in her theoriesin practice shes a nice girl  elsie laughed what amuses me is that a soldier the embodiment of might should dare to talk of right  curtis grew grave if i did not think that my profession at bottom guarded the rights of both white men and red id resign instantly our army is only an impartial instrument for preserving justice  that isnt the oldworld notion put in lawson from across the table  it is our notion stoutly replied curtis our little army today stands towards the whole nation as a police force relates itself to a citya power that interferes only to prevent aggression of one interest on the rights of another  brisbanes big flat voice took up the theme  thats a very pretty theory but youll find plenty to claim that the army is an instrument of oppression  ill admit it is sometimes wrongly used curtis replied we who are in the field cant help that however we are under orders of course he added modestly i am only a young soldier i have seen but ten years of service and i have taken part in but one campaigna war i considered unavoidable at that time  you would hold then that an officer of the army has a right to convictions queried brisbane in the tone of the lawyer  most certainly a man does not cease to think upon entering the army  thats dangerous doctrine  its the american idea what people would suffer by having its army intelligent  lawson coughed significantly bring forth the blackswathed axetreason has upreared her head  it was plain that brisbane was lying in wait for him curtis whispered to elsie  rescue me your father is planning to quiz me and i must not talk before i report to the department  i understand we will go to my studio after dinner and with lawsons aid she turned the conversation into safe channels  it was a very great pleasure to the young soldier to sit once more at such a board and in pleasant relation to elsie it was more than he had ever hoped for and he surprised her by his ability to take on her interests he grew younger in the glow of her own youth and beauty and they finished their ices in such goodfellowship that mrs wilcox was amazed  we will slip away now elsie said in a low tone to curtis and they both rose as they were about to leave the room brisbane looked up in surprise where are you going dont you smoke captain stay and have a cigar  elsie answered for him captain curtis can come back but i want him to see my studio now for i know if you get to talking politics he will miss the pictures altogether  she has a notion im growing garrulous brisbane retorted but i deny the charge well let me see you later captain there are some things i want to discuss with you  grace you are to come too elsie said to her girl friend and led the way out into the hall  miss cooke stepped to curtiss side youve been in washington before she asked with an inflection which he hated  oh yes many times in fact i lived here till i was sixteen i was born in maryland not far from here  indeed then you know the city thoroughly  certain sides of it exteriorly and officially i know it socially i am a stranger to it my people were proud and poor a good old family in a fine old house and very little besides  elsie led the way slowly up the big staircase secretly hoping miss cooke would find it too cool for her thin blood she wished to be alone with curtis and this wish obscure as it was grew stronger as she set a chair for him and placed a frame on an easel  you really need daylight to see them properly  am i to make remarks  certainly tell me just what you think  then let me preface my helpful criticisms by saying that i dont know an earthly thing about painting we had drawing of a certain kind at the academy and i used to visit the galleries in new york when occasion served now you know the top and the bottom of my art education  its cold in here elsie broke in miss cooke whom they had quite forgotten is the steam turned on  wrap my slumberrobe around you elsie carelessly replied now here is my completed study of little peta what do you think of that is it like her  very like her indeed i think it excellent he said with unaffected enthusiasm she was a quaint little thing she is about to be married to young two hornsa white mans wedding  elsies eyes glowed oh i wish i could see that but dont let her wear white mans clothing shed be so cunning in her own way of dress i wish she had not learned to chew gum  none of us quite live up to our best intentions he replied laughing peta thinks shes gaining in grace most of the white ladies she knows chew gum  the pictures were an old story to miss cooke who shivered for a time in silence and at last withdrew elsie and curtis were deep in discussion of the effect of white mans clothing on the tetongs but each was aware of a subtle change in the other as the third person was withdrawn a delicious sense of danger of inward impulse warring with outward restraint added zest to their intercourse he instantly recalled the last time he stood in her studio feeling her frank contempt of him i am on a different footing now he thought with a certain exultation it was worth years of hardship and hunger and cold to stand side by side with a woman who had not merely beauty and wealth but talent and a mysterious quality that was more alluring than beauty or intellect what this was he could not tell but it had already made life a new game to him  she on her part exulted with a sudden sense of having him to herself for experiment and every motion of his body every tone of his voice she noted and admired  he resumed naturally i can say nothing of the technique of these pictures my praise of them must be on the score of their likeness to the people they are all admirable portraits exact and spirited and yet he hesitated with wrinkled brows  dont spare me she cried out cut me up if you can  well then they seem to me unsympathetic for example the best of them all is peta because you liked her you comprehended her partly for she was a child gentle and sweet but you have painted old crawling elk as if he were a felonious mendicant youve delineated his rags his wrinkled skin his knotted hands but youve left the light out of his eyes let me tell you something about that old man when i saw him first he was sitting on the high bank of the river motionless as bronze and as silent he was mourning the loss of his little grandchild and had been there two days and two nights wailing till his voice had sunk to a whisper his rags were a sign of his utter despair you didnt know that when you painted him did you  no i did not she replied softly  moreover crawling elk is the annalist and storyteller of his tribe he carries the winter count and the sacred pipe and can tell you of every movement of the tetongs for more than a century and a half his mind is full of poetry and his conceptions of the earth and sky are beautiful he knows little that white men know and cares for very little that the white man fights for but his mind teems with lore of the mysterious universe into which he has been thrust and which he has studied for seventytwo years in the eyes of god i am persuaded there is no very wide difference between old crawling elk and herbert spencer the circle of spencers knowledge is wider but it is as far from including the infinite as the redmans story of creation could you understand the old man as i do you would forget his rags he would loom large in the mysterious gloom of life your painting is as prejudiced in its way as the description which a cowboy would give you of this old man you have given the color the picturesque qualities of your subjects but you have forgotten that they are human souls groping for happiness and light  as he went on elsie stared at the picture fixedly and it changed under her glance till his deeply passionate words seemed written on the canvas the painting ceased to be a human face and became a mechanical setting together of features a clever delineation of the exterior of a ragged old man holding a beaded tobaccopouch and a long red pipe  this old beggar curtis continued never lights that pipe you have put in his hands without blowing a whiff to the great spirits seated at the cardinal points of the compass he makes offerings for the health of his childrenhe hears voices in the noonday haze he sits on the hilltop at dawn to commune with the spirits over his head as a beggar he is picturesque as a man he is bewildered by the changes in his world and sad with the shadow of his childrens future all these things and many more you must learn before you can represent the soul of the redman you cant afford to be unjust  she was deeply affected by his words they held conceptions new to her but his voice pierced her strangely subdued her it quivered with an emotion which she could not understand why should he care so much whether she painted her subjects well or ill she was seized with sudden bitter distrust  i wish i had not shown you my studies she said resentfully  his face became anxious his voice gentle i beg your pardon i have presumed too far i hope miss brisbane you will not take what i say too much to heart indeed you must not mind me at all i am first of all a sort of crank and then as i say i dont know a word about painting please forget my criticisms  she understood his mood now his anxiety to regain her goodwill was within her grasp and she seized the opportunity to make him plead for himself and exonerate her  you have torn my summers work to flinders she said sullenly looking down at a bit of charcoal she was grinding into the rug beneath her feet  he was aghast dont say that i beg of you good heavens dont let my preachment discourage you you see i have two or three hobbies and when i am once mounted im sure to ride right over somebodys garden wall he rose and approached her i shall never forgive myself if i have taken away the smallest degree of your enthusiasm my aimif i had an aimwas to help you to understand my people so that when you come out next summer  all that is ended now she said sombrely i shall attempt no more indian work  this silenced him he took time to consider what this sudden depression on her part meant as he studied her he saw her lip quiver and anxiety suddenly left him his tone was laughterfilled as he called come now miss brisbane youre making game of me by taking my criticisms so solemnly i can see a smile twitching your lips this moment look at me  she looked up and broke into a laugh he joined in with her but a flush rose to his face  you fooled me completely i reckon you should have been an actress instead of a painter  she sobered a little really i was depressed for a moment your tone was so terribly destructive shall we go down  not till you say youll forgive me and forget my harangue  she gave him her hand ill forgive you but im going to remember the harangue irather liked it it made me think strange to say i like people who make me think  again his heart leaped with the blood of exultant youth she is coming to understand me better he thought  you must see my other pictures by daylight she was saying mr lawson likes this one particularly they had moved out into the little receptionroom i did it in giverneywe all go down sooner or later to paint one of monets pollard willows these are my stunts  lawson yes there was the secret of her increasing friendliness as the fiancée of lawson she could afford to lessen her reserve towards his friend  and so it happened that notwithstanding her cordial welcome and her respectful consideration of his criticism he went away with a feeling of disappointment that her beauty was more deeply enthralling than he had hitherto realized made his disquiet all the greater as he stepped out upon the street she seemed as insubstantial as a dream of his imaginative youth far separated from any reality with which he had any durable association     x  curtis at headquarters   curtis was frankly exclamatory at the size and splendor of lawsons apartments he had accepted the invitation to take breakfast with him without much thought as to the quality of the breakfast or where it would be eaten until he found himself entering the hall of a superb apartment hotel  why see here lawson he exclaimed as he looked about his friends suite this is too much for any bachelorits baronial i must revise my judgments i had a notion you were a hardworking ethnologic sharp  so i am replied lawson smiling with frank enjoyment of his visitors amazement ive been at work two hours at my desk if you dont believe it theres the desk  the room was filled with books cases of antique pottery paintings of indians models of pueblo dwellings and other things in keeping and was made rich in color by a halfdozen very choice navajo blankets in the fine old weaves with the vegetable dyes so dear to the collector the long table was heaped with current issues of the latest magazines and dozens of books with markers set to guard some valuable passages were piled within reach it was plainly the library of a student and man of letters  lawsons lean brown face at once assumed a different aspect to curtis it became more refined more scholarly and distinctly less shrewd and quizzical and the soldier began to understand the writers smiling defiance of western politicians and millionaire cattleowners plainly a man of large fortune with high social connections what had lawson to fear of the mountain west the menace of the greedy cattlemen troubled him no more than the howl of the blizzard  in the same measure that lawsons power was revealed to him the heart of the agent sank he could not but acknowledge that here was the fitting husband and proper home for elsiewhile i he thought have only a barrack in a desolate indian country to offer her and he swung deep in the trough of his sea of doubt  a map on the wall lined with red caught his eye and he seized upon it for diversion  what is this he asked  thats my trailmap replied lawson the red lines represent my wanderings  curtis studied it with expert eyes you have ploughed the arizona deserts pretty thoroughly  yes ive spent three summers down in that country studying cliffdwellings its a mighty alluring region last summer i broke away and got back into the north but i am greatly taken with the hot sunshine and loneliness of the desert  curtis turned sharply what i cant understand lawson is this how can you pull up and leave such a homehe indicated the room with a sweep of his handand go out on the painted desert or down the chaco and swelter in the heat like a horned toad  lawson smiled it is absurd isnt it mans an unaccountable beast but come breakfast is waiting and i hope youre hungry  the diningroom was built on a scale with the library and the mahogany table sparsely covered with dishes looked small and lonely in the midst of the shining floor this feature of the beautiful room impressed curtis and as they took seats opposite each other he remarked if i were not here you would be alone  yes quite generally i breakfast alone i entertain less than you would think im a busy man when at home  well the waste of room is criminal lawson thats all i have to saycriminal youll be called upon to answer for it some time  ive begun to think so myself replied the host significantly  they talked mountain ranges and pueblo dwellers and the theoretical relation of the moundbuilders to the small brown races of the rio grande valley touching also on the future of the redman and all the while curtis was struggling with a benumbing sense of his hopeless weakness in the face of a rival like lawson he gave up all thought of seeing elsie again and resolutely set himself to do the work before him eager to return to his duties in the western foothills  lawson accompanied him to the interior department and introduced him to the secretary who had the preoccupied air of a business man rather than the assumed leisure of the politician he shook hands warmly and asked his visitors to be seated while he finished a paper in hand at last he turned and pleasantly began  im glad to meet you captain yours is a distinguished name with us we fully recognize the value of your volunteer service and hope to make the best use of you our mutual friend lawson here threatens to make you secretary in my stead here he looked over his spectacles with a grave and accusing air which amused lawson greatly  not so bad as that mr secretary he laughed i merely suggested that captain curtis would make an excellent president  oh well it all comes to the same thing he then became quite serious now captain i would suggest that you put this whole matter as you see it together with your recommendations into the briefest most telling form possible and be ready to come before the committee tomorrow confer with the commissioner and be ready to meet the queries of the opposition brisbane is behind the cattlemen in this controversy and he is a strong man i agree entirely with you and lawson that the tetongs should remain where they are and be helped in the way you suggest be ready with computations of the cost of satisfying claims of the settlers building ditches etc come and see me again before you return goodmorning and he bent to his desk with instant absorption  lawson again led the way across the square in search of the commissioners office the large bare waitingroom was filled with a dozen or more redmen all wearing new blue suits and wide black hats they were smoking in contemplative silence with only an occasional word spoken in undertone it was plain they were expecting an audience with the great white chief  several of them knew lawson and cried out ho ho coming up one by one to shake hands but they glowed with pleasure as curtis began to signtalk with them  who are you he asked of one oh northern cheyennei thought so and youyou are apache he said to another i can tell that too what are you all waiting for to see the commissioner have you had a good visit yes i see you have nice new suits the government is good to yousometimes they laughed at his sharp hits well dont stay too long here the white man will rob you of your good clothes be careful of firewater  one old man whose gestures were peculiarly flowing and dignified thereupon signed when the white man come to buy our lands we are great chiefsvery tall when we ask for our money to be paid to us then we are small like children this caused a general laugh in which curtis joined they all wanted to know who he was and he told them ah we are glad for the tetongs they have a good man tell the commissioner we are anxious to council and go homewe are weary of this place  lawson meanwhile had entered the office and now reappeared mr brown will see you at once captain  the acting commissioner wore the troubled look of a man sorely overworked and badly badgered he breathed a sigh of ostentatious relief as he faced his two visitors who came neither to complain nor to ask favors he studied curtis contemplatively his pale face set in sad lines  im leaning on you in this tetong business he began i have so many similar fights all over the west i cant give you the attention you deserve it seems as though our settlers were insane over indian lands i honestly believe if we should lay out a reservation on the staked plains thered be a mad rush for it the injun has itlets take it away from him seems to be the universal cry i am pestered to death with schemes for cutting down reservations and removing tribes it would seem as if these poor hunted devils might have a thumbnails breadth of the continent they once entirely owned but no so long as an acre exists they are liable to attack im worn out with the attempt to defend them ill have nervous prostration or something worse if this pressure continues yesterday nearly finished me what kind of pirates do you raise out there anyway  curtis listened with amazement to this frank avowal but lawson only laughed saying in explanation this is one of the commissioners poor days hell fight till the last ditch  irrigating ditch supplemented the commissioner yes theres another nightmare beautiful complication the government puts the indian on a reservation so dry that water wont run down hill and then lawson or some other friend of the indian comes in here and insists on irrigating ditches being put in and then i am besieged by civil engineers for jobs and wildeyed contractors twist my doorknobs off captain curtis keep out of the indian service if you have any conscience  thats exactly why i recommended him said lawsonbecause he has a conscience  itll shorten his life ten years and do no material good well now about this tetong imbroglio  immediately he fell upon the problem with the most intense application and curtis had a feeling that his little season of plain speaking had refreshed him  lawson went his way but curtis spent the remainder of the day in the commissioners office putting together his defence of the tetongs compiling figures and drawing maps to show the location of grass and water he did not rise from his work till the signal for closing came and even then he gathered his papers together and took them home to his room in the club in order to put the finishing touches to them  while dressing for his dinner with lieutenant kirkman a classmate and comrade he began to wonder how soon he could decently make his dinnercall on the brisbanes it was shameful in him of course but he had suddenly lost interest in the kirkmans the day seemed lost because he had not been able to see elsie there was a powerful longing in his heart an impatience which he had not experienced since his early manhood it was a hunger which had lain dormantscotched but not killedfor now it rose from its mysterious lair with augmented power to break his rest and render all other desires of no account  that night after he returned from the kirkmans where he had enjoyed an exquisite little dinner amid a joyous chatter reviving oldtime memories he found himself not merely wideawake but restless his brain seemed determined to reveal itself to him completely pictures of his early life and the faces and homes of his friends in the west came whirling in orderless procession like flights of swift birdsnow a council with the sioux now a dinner of the staff of general miles visions of west point a flock of them came also and the faces of the girls he had loved with a boys fancy and then as if these were but whisks of cloud scattering the walls of great mountain ranges appeared behind stern and majestic sunlit for a moment only to withdraw swiftly into gray night and when he seized upon these sweeping fragments and attempted to arrange them elsies proud face with its dark changeful eyes and beautiful curving lips took central place and in the end obscured all the rest  the kirkman home the cheer the tenderness of the husband towards his dainty little wife the obvious rest and satisfaction of the man betokening that the ultimate of his desires had been reached also came in for consideration by the restless brain of the soldiermountaineer i shall never be at peace till i have wife and child that i now realize he acknowledged to himself in the deep solitary places of his thought  then he rose and took up the papers which he had been preparing and as he went over them again he came to profounder realization than ever before of the mighty tragedy whose final act he seemed about to witness his heart swelled with a great tenderness towards that fragment of a proud and free people who sat in wonder before the coming of an infinite flood of alien races helpless to stay it appalled by the breadth and power of the stream which swept them away he felt himself in some sense their chosen friendtheir moses to lead them out of the desolation in which they sat bewildered and despairing thinking of them and of plans to help them he grew weary at last his brain ceased to grind and he slept     xi  curtis grapples with brisbane   the hearing took place at ten oclock but curtis had opportunity for a little helpful consultation with lawson before the chairman called the committeemen to order the session seemed unimportantperfunctory the members sat for the most part silent ruminating with eyes fixed on the walls or upon slips of paper which they held abstractedly in their hands occasionally some one of them would rouse up to ask a question but in general their attitudes were those of bored and preoccupied business men they came and went carelessly in response to calls of their clerks and curtis perceived that they had very little real interest in the life or death of the redmen he would have been profoundly discouraged had not the chairman been alert and his questions to the point after his formal statement had been taken and the hearing was over the chairman approached curtis informally and showed a very human sympathy for the tetongs  yes i think we can hold this raid in check he said in answer to curtis and added slowly i am very glad to find a man of your quality taking up this branch of service he paused and a smile wrinkled his long scotch face they accuse me of being a weak sentimentalist because i refuse to consider the redman in the light of a reptile i was an abolitionistthe smile faded from his eyes and his thin lips straightenedin days when it meant something to defend the negro and in standing for the rights of the redman i am merely continuing my lifework it isnt a question of whether i know the indian or not though i know him better than most of my critics its a question of his dues under our treaties we considered him a man when we bought his land and i insist he shall be treated the same now i should like to hear from youunofficially of coursewhenever you have anything to say lawsons testimonyhe laid a caressing hand on lawsons shoulderis worth more to me than that of a thousand land speculators hes a comfort to us for we know he is disinterested and has nothing to gain or lose in any question which concerns the reds and we find very much the same about you captain curtis and i am determined that you shall have free hand  curtis shook hands with the old man with a sense of security here at least was a senator of the old school a man to be depended upon in time of trouble he began also to realize lawsons power for he seemed to be the personal friend of every honest official connected with the department  as the two young men stepped out into the hall they came face to face with elsie and her father  are we too late cried the girl is the hearing over  my part of it is answered curtisat least for today they may recall me tomorrow  brisbane was visibly annoyed i didnt suppose you would come on till eleven thats the word i got over the phone i particularly wanted to hear your deposition he added sourly  papa has an idea your opposition to this bill is important elsie said lightly as curtis edged away from brisbane  brisbane followed him up well now that your hearing is over suppose you get into our carriage and go home with us to lunch  please do said elsie with flattering sincerity  curtis hesitated and was made captive it is a great temptation he said looking at lawson  elsie saw him yielding and cried out oh you must comeand you too osborne  lawson was plainly defeated i cant do it i have a couple of new york men to lunch at the club and i couldnt think of putting them off  oh im so sorry we would have made a nice little lunch party  there are other days coming he replied as lightly as possible  as they drove away curtis had a premonition that his impending interview would be disagreeable for brisbane sat in silence his keen eyes full of some sinister resolution he was in fact revolving in his mind a plan of attack he realized the danger of attempting to bribe such a man even indirectly but a poor and ambitious soldier might be removed by gentler means through promotion and friendly pressure might be brought to bear on the war department to that effect having set himself to the task of clearing the reservation of the tetongs a man of brisbanes power did not hesitate long over the morality of methods and having decided upon promotion as his method of approaching curtis the old man distinctly softened and made himself agreeable by extending the drive and affably pointing out the recent improvements in the city our capitol is as good as any now he said our new buildings are up to the standard  the young soldier refused to be drawn into any bloodheating discussions being quite content to sit facing elsie feeling obscurely the soft roll of the wheels beneath him and absorbing the light and color of the streets this is my city he said i spent my boyhood here i went to west point from here  it is beautiful replied elsie and at the moment a spark of some mysterious flame sprang from each to the other they were young and the air was soft and sweet thereafter everything gave the young soldier pleasure the whistling of the darkies the gay garments of the shoppers the glitter of passing carriages the spread of trees against the bright skyeverything assumed a singular grace his courage rose and he felt equal to any task  as they entered the big house elsie said youre to come right up to the studio i want to show you a canvas i finished yesterday i had an inspirationi think you brought it to me  as she led the way up the wide and splendidly carved stairway the soldiers elation sank away for each step emphasized the girls pride and power and by contrast threw the poor indian agent into hopeless shadow he hardly heard what she said till she led him before her easel and said  there is yesterdays work ive been trying for days to get a certain effect of color and behold i caught it flying this morning what puzzles me in your country is the enormously high value of your earth in reference to the sky the sky is so solid  as he took in the significance of the canvas curtis exclaimed  it is very beautiful it is miraculous how do you do it  im glad you like it my problem there was to represent the difference in value between chief elk who is riding in the vivid sunlight and his wife and little peta who are just in the edge of that purple cloudshadow the difference between white in sunlight and white in shadow is something terrific in your dry air contrasts are enough to knock you down this gray eastern studio light makes all my sketches seem false but i know they are not  they are very true it seems to me  when i close my eyes and hark back to the flooding light of the valley of the elk then i can do these things i cant if i dont i have to forget all my other pictures this is nearer my impression than anything else ive done  it has great charm he said after a pause and it also reminds me of my duty i must return at once to the west  when do you goactually  actually i leave tomorrow at three oclock unless i receive word to the contrary tomorrow morning  so soon you are making a very short stay cant you remain over the holidays some friends of mine are coming on from new york id like you to meet them  i think i must return jennie is preparing to give her little ingines a christmastree and i am told that my sandy claws would add greatly to their joy so i am making special effort to reach there on the 23d  she looked at him musingly you really are interested in those ugly creatures i dont understand it  to be really frank i dont understand your lack of sympathy he replied smiling a little it isnt at all feminine  she took a seat on the divan before she spoke again oh women are such posers you think i am quite heartless dont you  no i dont think that but i do think you are a little unjust to these people whose thought you have made very little effort to comprehend  why should i they are not worth while  do you speak now as an artist he asked gravely  but they are so gross and so cruel  i dont deny but they are sometimes both gross and cruel but so are civilized men the scalpdance no more represents them than a bayonet charge represents us it isnt just to condemn all for the faults of a few you wouldnt destroy servantgirls because some of them are ugly and untidy would you  the cases are not precisely similar  ill admit that but the point is here as an artist you cant afford to dispose of a race on the testimony of their hereditary enemies you wouldnt expect a sympathetic study of the greek by the saracen would you  it isnt that so much but they are so perfectly unimportant they have no use in the world what does it matter if they die or dont  perhaps not so much to them but to me if i can help them and fail to do it it matters a great deal we cant afford to be unjust for our own sake the bearer of the torch should not burn he should illumine  i dont understand that she said genuinely searching for his meaning  there is where you disappoint me he retorted most women quiver with altruistic passion the moment they see helpless misery if you saw a kitten fall into a well what would you do  i should certainly try to save it  your heart would bleed to see it drown  she shivered at the thought why of course  and yet you can share in your fathers exterminating vengeance as he sweeps ten thousand redmen into their graves  the case is differentthe kitten never did any harm  the wrong is by no means all on the redmans side but even if it were christ said love them that hate you and as a christian nation we should not go out in vindictive warfare against even those who despitefully use us i havent a very high seat in the synagogue i have a soldiers training for warfare but i acknowledge the splendor of christs precepts and try to live up to them i always liked grants position as regards the soldier but more than thati like these red people they are a good deal more than rude men it is a great pleasure to feel their trust and confidence in me it touches me deeply to have them come and put their palms on me reverently as though i were superhuman in wisdom and say little father we are blind we cannot see the way lead us and we will go at such times i feel that no other work in the world is so important if human souls are valuable anywhere on earth they are valuable here no selfish landlust should blind us to see that  as he spoke the girl again felt something large and sweet and powerful like a current of electrical air which came out of wide spaces of human emotion and covered her like a flood she was humbled by the high purpose and inexplicable enthusiasm of the man before her  i suppose you consider me cruel and heartless she cried out but i am not to blame for being what i am  if you are not free who is you have it allyouth wealth beauty nothing enslaves you but indifference  she was thinking that lawson had never moved her so and wishing curtis were less inexorable in his logic when he checked himself by saying i beg your pardon again i came to see your pictures not to preach forgiveness of sins i here pull myself up short  i think you could make me feel personal interest in brickbats oror spiders she said with a quaint relaxing smile you were born to be a preacher not a soldier  do you think so ive had a notion all along that i was a fairly good commander and a mighty poor persuader what i dont intend to be is a bore he rose and began to walk slowly round the walls studying the paintings under her direction he was struggling with obscure impulses to other and more important speech but after making the circuit of the room he said as though rendering a final verdict  you have great talent that is evident what do you intend to do with it it should help some one  you are oldfashioned she replied in our modern day art is content to add beauty to the world it does not trouble itself to do good it is unmoral  perhaps i am a preacher after all for i like the book or picture that has a motive that stands for something your conception of arts uses is french is it not  i suppose it is clearly it isnt germanic what would you have me dopaint indians to convince the world of their sufferings  wouldnt that be something like the work millet did seems to me i remember something of that sort in some book i have read  she laughed unfortunately i am not millet besides he isnt the god of our present idolatry hes a dead duck we paint skirtdancers and the singers in the cafés now toiling peasants are out  you are a woman and a woman ought  please dont hand me any of that stupid rot about what a woman ought to be and isnt what i am i am and i dont like dirty ragged people no matter whether they are roman beggars or chinese i like clean welldressed wellmannered people and no one can make me believe they are less than a lot of illsmelling indians  miss brisbane you must not do me an injustice he earnestly entreated it was not my intention to instruct you today i am honestly interested in your pictures and had no thought of renewing an appeal i was tempted and fell if you will forgive me this time ill never preach again  i dont say i object to your preachment i think i rather like it i dont think i ever met a man who was so ready to sacrifice his own interest for an idea its rather amusing to meet a soldier who is ready to knock one down with a moral warclub she ended with a mocking inflection of voice  his face lost its eager boyish expression im delighted to think i have amused you he said slowly it makes amends  please dont be angry she pleaded i didnt mean to be flippant  your words were explicit he replied feeling at the moment that she was making a mock of him and this duplicity hurt him  she put forth her sweetest voice please forgive me i think your work very noble only i cant understand how you can exile yourself to do it let us go down it is time for lunch and papa is waiting for you i know  it was unaccountable that a mocking tone a derisive smile from this chance acquaintance should so shake the soldier and so weaken him but he descended the stairway with a humiliating consciousness of having betrayed his heart to a fleering luring daughter of wealth  at the door of the library the girl paused papa are you asleep  the abrupt rustle of a newspaper preceded brisbanes deep utterance not at alljust reading the star come in captain is lunch nearly ready he asked of elsie  i think so they are a little late ill go see  as she left the room brisbane cordially rumbled on sit down captain im sorry i missed your talk today i am curious to know what your notion is about the tetongs of course i understood you couldnt go into the case the other night but now that your testimony is all in i hope you feel free to give me your reasons for opposing our plan for a removal of the tribe  curtis took a seat while brisbane stretched himself out in a big chair and fixed his cold grayblue eyes on the soldier who hesitated a moment before replying i dont think it wise to go into that matter senator  why not  well we differ so radically on the bill and your interests make it exceedingly difficult for you to be just in the case nothing would be gained by argument  you think you know what my interests are there was a veiled sarcasm in the great mans smile  i think i do as a candidate for reelection to the senate you cant afford to antagonize the cattle and mining interests of your state and as i am now officially the representative of the tetongs i sincerely hope you will not insist on a discussion of the motives involved the young officer spoke firmly but with impressive dignity and candor  brisbanes ambiguous manner took a sudden shift to cordiality and leaning forward he said  curtis i like you i admire your frankness let me be equally plain youre too able a man to be shelved out there on a bleak reservation what was your idea of going into the indian service anyway  the young officer remained on guard despite this genial glow i considered it my duty he replied besides i was rusting out in garrison andbut there is no need to go into my motives i am agent and shall stand firmly for the right of my wards so long as i am in position to do so  but youre wasting your life suppose you were offered a chance to go towell say west point as an instructor on a good salary  i would decline the appointment  why  because at this time i am needed where i am and i have started on a plan of action which i have a pride in finishing  brisbane grew distinctively less urbane you are bent on fighting me are you  what do you mean asked curtis though he knew  you are dead set against the removal of the tetongs  most certainly i am  elsie reentered the room during this rapid interchange of phrase but neither of the men heard her so intent were they upon each other  young man do you know who you are fighting asked brisbane bristling like a bear and showing his teeth a little curtis being silent he went on youre lined up against the whole state not only the cattlemen round about the reservation but a majority of the citizens are determined to be rid of those vagabonds anybody that knows anything about em knows theyre a public nuisance why should they be allowed to camp on land which they cant usegraze their mangy ponies on lands rich in minerals  because they are human beings  human beings sneered brisbane they are nothing but a greasy lot of verminworthless from every point of view their rights cant stand in the way of civilization  it is not a question of whether they are clean or dirty it is a question of justice curtis replied hotly they came into the world like the rest of us without any choice in the matter and so far as i can see have the same rights to the earthat least so much of it as they need to sustain life the fact that they make a different use of the soil than you would do isnt a sufficient reason for starving and robbing them  the quicker they die the better replied brisbane flushing with sudden anger the only good injun is a dead injun  at this familiar phrase curtis took fire yes i expected that accursed sentence let me tell you mr brisbane i never knew a redman savage enough to utter such a sentiment as that the most ferocious utterance of geronimo never touched the tigerish malignity of that saying sitting bull was willing to live and let live if your view represents civilization i want none of it the world of the savage is less cruel less selfish  brisbanes face writhed white and a snarling curse choked his utterance for a moment if you werent my guest he said reaching a clutching hand towards curtis id cut your throat  elsie waiting in strained expectancy cried out father what are you saying are you crazy  curtis hastily rose very white and very quiet i will take care not to put myself in your way as guest again sir  you cant leave too quick roared the old man his face twitching with uncontrollable wrath you are a traitor to your race youd sacrifice the settlers to the interests of a greasy red vagabond  father be quiet you are making a scene called elsie and added sadly dont go captain curtis i shall be deeply mortified if you do father will be sorry for this  brisbane also rose shaking with a weakness pitiful to see well sir you can go for i know now the kind of sneak you are let me tell you this young man youll feel my hand before you are a year older you cant come into my house and insult me in the presence of my daughter get out his hands were moving uncontrollably and elsie discovered with a curious pang that she was pitying him and admiring the stern young soldier who stood quietly waiting for an opportunity to speak at last he said  miss brisbane i beg your pardon i should not have said what i did he turned to brisbane i am sorry i spoke so harshly sir you are an older man than i and  never mind my age replied brisbane his heat beginning to cool into selfcontained malice i desire no terms of friendship with you its war nowto the knife and the knife to the hilt you think you are safe from me but the man that lines up against me generally regrets it to the day of his death  very well sir i am not one to waste words i shall do my duty to the tetongs regardless of you or your friends he turned to elsie miss brisbane i ask you to remember that i honestly tried to avoid a controversy  six months before elsie would have remained passive while her father ordered curtis from the door but now she could not even attempt to justify his anger and the tears glistened on her lashes as she said father why cant you accept captain curtiss hand these ragamuffin redmen arent worth quarrelling about no one ever went away from us like this and it breaks my heart to have it so dont go captain curtis father ask his pardon  the old man turned towards her go to your room i will see that this young squirt finds the door  elsie shrank from the glare of his eyes father you are brutal you hurt me  do as i say he snarled  i will not she faced him tall and resolute i am not a child i am the mistress of this house she turned and walked towards the door captain curtis i beg your pardon my father has forgotten himself  brisbane took a step towards curtis get out and you girl leave the room  the girls face whitened have you no sense of decency she said and her voice cut deep down into his heart and he flinched captain curtis is my guest as well as yours she extended her hand please go it is best  it is the most miserable moment of my life he replied as they moved down the hall leaving brisbane at the door of the study i will do any honorable thing to regain your goodwill  you have not lost it she replied i cannot blame youas i should she added and the look on her face mystified him  may i see you again before i leave for the west  perhaps she softly replied remember he is oldand  i will try not to bear anger he replied  and as he turned away it seemed that she had leagued herself with him against her own father and this feeling deepened as she ran up the stairs heedless of the voice whose commands had hitherto been law to her  the young officer walked down the sunny avenue towards the white house with a curious feeling of having just passed through a bitter and degrading dream he was numb and cold around him the little negro newsboys were calling the oneoclock editions of the styah and the pavements were swarming with public servants hastening to lunch punctual as clocks while he having been ordered from the house of his host was mechanically returning to his club  there was something piercingly pathetic in the thought of the good cheer he had anticipated and the lost pleasure of sitting opposite elsie made his heart ache at the moment his feet stumbled in the path of duty surely he was a long way from the singleminded mapbuilder who had crossed the sulphur spring divide     xii  spring on the elk   spring came early in that latitude and curtis was profoundly thankful that his first winter had proven unusually short and mild for it enabled him to provide for his people far better than he had dared to hope the rations were insufficient at best and for several days of each alternate week the grown people were hungry as well as cold though no one actually perished from lack of food beyond the wood contract and the hauling of hides each month there was very little work to be done during the winter not enough to buy the tobacco the men longed for  they believed in swift eagle however for he visited every cluster of huts each month and became acquainted with nearly every family during the winter no agent had ever taken the like pains to shake the old women by the hand or to speak as kindly to the old men who sat beside the fire feeble and bent with rheumatism the little children all ran to him when he came near as if he were a friend and that was a good sign too some of the old chiefs complained of coursethere was so little else for them to do but they did not blame the little father they were assured of his willingness to do whatever lay within his power to mitigate their poverty jennie who was often at the beds of those who suffered had won wide acceptance of her lotions by an amused tolerance of the medicinemen whose mystic paraphernalia interested her exceedingly the men of magic came at last to sing their curious songs and perform their feats of healing in her presence together we will defeat the evil spirits they said and the health of the tribe continued to be very good in spite of unsanitary housing and the evil influence of the medicinemen when the missionaries came to have the native doctors suppressed curtis said my policy is to supplant not to suppress  the bill which called for the removal of the tetongs to another reservation was reported killed the compromise measure for buying out the settlers was hung up in the committeeroom and this delay on the part of congress exasperated the settlers beyond reason and at a convention held early in april at pinon city joseph streeter brazenly shouted if the government does not remove these injuns before the first of july well make it hot for all concerned and his threat was wildly cheered and largely quoted thereafter as the utterance of a man not afraid of congress or anybody else  seedtime came without any promise of change and the white settlers on the reservation went sullenly to their planting and the cattlemen drove their herds across the boundaries upon the tetong range as they had been doing for many years we are in for another season of it they said with the air of being martyrs in the cause of civilization  curtis immediately sent warning commands to all the outside ranchers to keep clear of the reservation and also notified streeter johnson and others of the settlers on the elk and the willow that their cattle must not be allowed to stray beyond certain lines which he indicated these orders according to calvin made the settlers redheaded as woodpeckers they think youre drawin the lines down pretty fine  i mean to replied curtis you original settlers are here by right and shall have full opportunity to graze your stock but those on the outside must keep out i will seize and impound all stock that does not belong on this land  calvin reported this statement to the outside men and its audacity provoked the most violent threats against the agent but he rode about unaccompanied and unarmed but not without defence for calvin said to one of the loudest of the boasters the man who jerks a gun on curtis runs a good chance of losing a lung or two and the remark took effect for calvin had somehow acquired a reputation for being plumb sassy when attackted  curtis had the army officers contempt of personal injury and in pursuance of his campaign against the invading stockmen did not hesitate to ride into their roundup camps alone or accompanied only by crow wing and no blusterer could sustain his reputation in the face of the agents calm sense of command  i am not speaking personally he said once to an angry camp of a dozen armed men i am here as an officer of the united states army detailed to special duty as an indian agent and i am in command of this reservation it is of no use to bluster your cattle must be kept from the tetong range  the grass is going to waste there the boss argued  that does not concern you it is not the fault of the tetongs that they have not cattle enough to fill the range  in the end he had his way and though the settlers and ranchers hated him they also respected him no one thought of attempting to bribe or scare him and political pull had no value in his eyes  jennie meanwhile had acquired almost mythic fame as a marvellously beautiful and haughty queen calvin was singularly closemouthed about her but one or two of the cowboys who had chanced to meet her with the agent spread the most appreciative reports of her beauty and of the garments she wore she was said to be a singer of opera tunes and that she played the piano to beat the jews one fellow who had business with the agent reported having met her at the door by mighty shes purty enough to eat he said to his chum her cheeks are as pink as peaches and her eyes are jest the brown i like shes a glad rag all right  made good use o your time didnt ye remarked his friend  you bet your life i werent lettin nothin git by me endurin that minute or two  i bet you dursnt go there again  i take yeill go tomorrow  without any business this time no excuse but jest to see her you aint got the nerve  youll see im the boy there aint no rag gay enough to scare me  it became a common joke for some lank brown chap to say carelessly as he rose from supper well i guess ill throw a saddle onto my baldfaced sorrel and ride over and see the agents sister in reality not one of them ever dared to even knock at the door and when they came to the yards with a consignment of cattle they were as selfconscious as schoolboys in a parlor and uneasy as wolves in a trap till they were once more riding down the trail then they broke loose whooping shrilly and racing like mad in order to show that they had never been afraid calvin continued to call and his defence of the agent had led to several sharp altercations with his father  the red people expanded and took on cheer under the coming of the summer like some larger form of insect life they were profoundly glad of the warmth the old men climbing to some rounded hilltop at dawn sat reverently to smoke and offer incense to the great spirit which the sun was and the little children seeing the sages thus in deep meditation passed quietly by with a touch of awe  as the soft winds began to blow the dingy huts were deserted for the sweeter and wholesomer life of the tepee which is always ventilated and which has also a thousand memories of battle and the chase associated with its ribbed walls its yellowed peak and its smouldering fires the sick grew well and the weak became strong as they passed once more from the foul air of their cabins to the inspiriting breath of the mountains uncontaminated by any smoke of white mans fire the little girls went forth on the hills to gather flowers for the teachers and the medicinemen taking great credit to themselves said see our incantations again prevailed the sun is coming back the grass is green and the warm winds are breathing upon the hills  ay but you cannot bring back the buffalo said those who doubted for there are sceptics among the redmen as elsewhere when you do that then we will believe that you are really men of magic  but the people did not respond cheerfully to curtis when he urged them to plant gardens they said we will do it little father but it is of no use for two years we tried it and each year the hot sun dried our little plants our corn withered and our potatoes came to nothing do not ask us to again plough the hard earth it is all a weariness to no result  to jennie curtis said i havent the heart to push them into doing a useless thing they are right i must wait until we have the water of the streams for our own use  the elder streeter was very bitter calvin reported but he aint no idyot he wont make no move that the law dont back him up in but some o these other yaps are talkin all kinds of gunplay but dont you lose any flesh they got to git by me before they reach you  curtis smiled calvin youre a loyal friend but i am not a bit nervous  thats all right captain but you cant tell what a mob o these lahees will do ive seen em make some crazy playsi sure have but ill keep one ear lapped back for signs of war     xiii  elsie promises to return   one beautiful may day curtis came into the house with shining face  sis our artists are coming back he called to jennie from the hall  are they oh isnt that glorious she answered running to meet him when are they to reach here whom did you hear from  lawson they cant come till some time in june however  jennies face fell in june i thought you meant they were coming nowright awaythis week  lawson furthermore writes that he expects to bring a sculptor with hima mr parker you remember those photographs he showed us of some statues of indians well this is the man who made the figures his wife is coming as chaperon for miss brisbane  she still needs a chaperon does she  it would seem so besides mrs parker goes everywhere with her husband  i hope shell be as nice as mrs wilcox  i dont think lawson would bring any crooked timber alongthere must be something worth while in them  well i am delighted george i confess im hungry for a message from the outside world and during the school vacation we can get away once in a while to enjoy ourselves  the certainty of the return of the artistic colony changed curtiss entire summer outlook work had dragged heavily upon him during february and march and there were moments when his enthusiasm ebbed it was a trying position he began to understand how a man might start in his duties with the most commendable desire even solemn resolution to be ever kindly and patient and selfrespecting and end by cursing the redmen and himself most impartially misunderstandings are so easy where two races are forced into daily contact without knowledge of each others speech and with only a partial comprehension of each others outlook on the world some of the employés possessed a small vocabulary of common tetong words but they could neither explain nor reason about any act they could only command curtis by means of the sign language which he had carried to marvellous clearness and swiftness was able to make himself understood fairly well on most topics but nevertheless found himself groping at times in the obscure caverns of their thinking  even after a man gets their thought he must comprehend the origin of their motives he said to wilson his clerk everything they do has meaning and sequence they have developed like ourselves through countless generations of life under relatively stable conditions these material conditions are now giving way are vanishing but the mental traits they formed will persist think of this when you are impatient with them  wilson took a pessimistic view i defy the angel gabriel to keep his temper if he should get himself appointed clerk if i was a married man i could make a better mark but there it isthey cant see me he ended with a deep sigh  curtis took advantage of lawsons letter to write again to elsie and though he considered it a very polite and entirely circumspect performance his fervor of gladness burned through every line and the girl as she read it fell to musing on the singularity of the situation he was in her mind very often now the romance and the poetry of the work he was doing began at last to appeal to her and the knowledge that she in a sense shared the possibilities with him was distinctly pleasurable she had perception enough to feel also the force of the contrast in their lives he toiling thanklessly on a barren sunsmit land in effort to lead a subject race to selfsupporting freedom while she dabbling in art for arts sake sat in a secure place and watched him curiously  how well he writes she thought returning to his letter his sentences clutched her like strong hands and she could not escape them as she read she drew again the splendid lines of his head in profile and then a sentence later it seemed that he was looking straight into her eyes grave of countenance involved in some moral question whose solution he considered essential to his happiness and to the welfare of his people surely he was a most uncommon soldier when she had finished reading she was sincerely moved to reply she had nothing definitely in mind to say and yet somehow she visualized him at his desk waiting an answer the worst of it is we seem to have no topic in common except his distressing indians she said as she returned to her work even art to him means painting the redmen sympathetically  but he could not be put aside he was narrow and onesided but he was sincere and manlyand handsome that was the very worst of it he was too attractive to be forgotten therefore she took up her pen again being careful to keep close to artistic motives she spoke of the success of her spring exhibition and said it has confirmed me in the desire to go on valiantly in the same line that is the reason i am coming back to the tetongs i feel that i begin to know themartistically i mean not as you know themand i need your blazing sunlight to drink up the fogs that i brought from holland and belgium the prismatic flare of color out there pleases me its just the white ray split into its primary colors but i can get it im going to do more of those canvases of the moving figure blended with the landscape they make a stunning technical problem in vibration as well as in values and then the critics shout over them too i sold the one you liked so well and also five portraits and feel vastly encouraged owen field was over from new york and gave me a real hurrah i am going to exhibit in new york next fall if all goes well with me among the tetongs     xiv  elsie revisits curtis   jennie thought her brother the handsomest man in the state as they walked up and down the station platform waiting for the express train which was bringing elsie and lawson and a famous parisianamerican sculptor and his wife curtis was in undress uniform and in the midst of the slouching crowd of weatherbeaten loafers he seemed a man of velvetgreen parade grounds and whitewashed palings commanding lines of polished bayonets  he was more profoundly stirred at the thought of elsies coming than he cared to admit but jennies delight was outspoken i didnt know how hungry for a change i was she said they will bring the air of the big city world with them  the whistle of the faroff train punctuated her sentences oh george doesnt it seem impossible that in a few moments the mistress of that great washington home will descend the carsteps to meet us  yes i cant believe it he replied and his hands trembled a little as he nervously buttoned his coat  the train came rapidly to a stop with singing rods grinding brakes and the whiz of escaping steam some ordinary mortals tumbled out and then the wonderful one  there they are cried jennie and oharent her clothes maddening  lawson descending first helped elsie to the platform with an accepted lovers firm touch she wore a bluecloth tailored suit which fitted marvellously and her color was more exquisite than ever admiring jennie fairly gasped as the simple elegance of elsies habit became manifest and she had only a glance for the sculptor and his wife  elsie with hands extended seized upon them both with cordial intensity a little flurry of handshakings followed and at last mr and mrs jerome parker were introduced he was a tall man with a bush of yellow beard while she was dark and plain but she had a pleasant smile and her eyes were nice and quiet  do you know im overjoyed to get back said elsie to curtis i dont know why i should be but ive been eagerly looking for the cleft butte all day jerome will tell you that i expressed a sort of proprietorship in every prairiedog  we are very glad to have you here again replied curtis and now that you are here we must get your belongings together and get away we are to camp tonight at the sandstone spring  a real camp  a real camp we could drive through of course but it would be tiresome and then i thought youd enjoy the camp  of course we shall its very thoughtful of you  everything will be ready for us i left two horns to look after it  then it will be right said lawson who was beaming with placid joy isnt it good to breathe this air again it was stifling hot in alta city i never knew it to be hotter in the month of june  while they talked cranes voice was collecting the trunks and in a few minutes with elsie by his side curtis drove his threeseated buckboard out upon the floor of the valley leaving the squalid town behind lawson and mrs parker occupied the middle seat and jennie and the tall sculptor sat behind they were all as merry as children elsie took off her hat and faced the sun with joyous greeting  isnt this glorious ive dreamed of this every night for a month  thats one thing the tetong hasgood fresh air and plenty of it said lawson  a thin diet sometimes curtis replied he turned to elsie your studio is all ready for you and i have spoken to a number of the head men about you youll not lack sitters they are eager to be immortalized at your convenience  you are most kindi am going to work as never before  you mustnt work too hard i have a plan for an outing one of my districts lies up in the headwaters of the willow i propose that we all go camping up there for a couple of weeks  do you hear that osborne she called turning her head  i did notwhat is it  curtis repeated his suggestion and parker shouted with joy just what i want to do he said  curtis went on well find the redman living there under much more favorable conditions than down in the hot valley we have a sawmill up in the pines and the ladies can stay in the superintendents house  oh no interrupted elsie we must camp dont think of putting us under a roof a little later she said in a low voice father is in chicago and expects to be out here later i mean hes coming to make a tour of the state  how is his health curtis asked politely  her face clouded hes not at all well he is older than he realizes i can see he is failing and he ought not to go into this senatorial fight after a pause she said he was quite ill in march and i nursed him he seemed very grateful and weve been very good friends since  im glad of that he replied and bent closely to his driving  you drive well captain  an indian agent needs to be able to do anything  may i drive  you will spoil your gloves  please ill take them off im a famous whip she smiled at him with such understanding as they had never before reached as she stripped her gloves from her hands and dropped them at her feet now let me take the reins she said he surrendered them to her unhesitatingly  i believe you can drive he said exultantly  her hands were as beautiful as her face strong and white and exquisitely modelled but he looking upon them with keen admiration caught the gleam of a diamond on the engagement finger this should not have chilled him but it did then he thought  it is an engagement ring she is now fairly bound to lawson and a light that was within him went out it was only a tiny wavering flame of hope but it had been burning in opposition to his will all the year  as she drove they talked about the grasses and flowers the mountain range far beyond the camping trip and a dozen other impersonal topics which did not satisfy curtis though he had no claim to more intimate phrase she on her part was perfectly happy and retained her hold of the reins and the whip in spite of his protest  you must not spoil your beautiful hands he protested they are for higher things please return the lines to me  oh no please just another halfhourtill we reach that butte im stronger than you think i am accustomed to the whip  she had her way in this and drove nearly the entire afternoon when he took the reins at last her fingers were cramped and swollen but her face was deeply flushed with pleasure  ive had a delicious drive she gratefully remarked  at the foot of a tall butte curtis turned his team and struck into a road leading to the left this road at once descended upon a crescentshaped natural meadow enclosed by a small stream like a babe in a sheltering arm all about were signs of its use as a campingground sweat lodges broken tepeepoles piles of blackened stones and rings of bowlders told of the many fires that had been built willows fringed the creek while to the south and west rose a tall bare hill on which a stone tower stood like a sentinel warrior  elsie cried out in delight of the place isnt it romantic already the sun sinking behind the hill threw across the meadow a mysterious purple gloom out of which a couple of tents gleamed like gray bowlders  there is your house tonight said curtis see the tents  how tiny they look elsie exclaimed in a hushed voice as though fearing to alarm and put them to flight  they are small but as night falls you will be amazed to discover how snug and homelike they can become  two horns came to meet them and parker cried out hello see the big indian  the chief greeted lawson with a deep and hearty hah nawsonmy friend how how and lawson with equal ceremony replied in dakota  i am well my brother how is it with you  my heart is warm towards you  elsie gave him her hand and he took it without embarrassment or awkwardness i know you you make pictures he said in his own tongue  jerusalem but hes a stunner said parker hello old man how you vass aint it and he clapped the old man on the shoulder  two horns looked at him keenly and the smile faded from his face huh big fool he said to lawson  you mustnt talk to an indian like that parker if you expect to have his friendship said lawson two horns hates overfamiliarity  oh he does does he laughed parker kind of a ward mcallister hey  lawson a little later said privately that was a bad break parker you really must treat these head men with decent respect or theyll hoodoo you so you cant get any models two horns is a gentleman and you must at least equal him in reserve and dignity or he will report you a buffoon  parker who had done his figures from models procured in paris from buffalo bills show opened his eyes wide  lawson youre joking  youll find every word i tell you true i advise you to set to work now and remove your bad impression from two horns who is one of the three principal chiefs you cant come out here and clap these people on the back and call em old hoss that will do in some of the stories you read but realities are different youll find money wont command these people either  i thought they liked to be treated as equals  they do but they dont like to have a stranger too free and easy you havent been introduced yet  while cranes voice attended to the teams jennie and two horns worked at getting supper their comradeship was charming to see and the parkers looked on with amazement two horns deft attentive careful anticipated every want nothing could be finer than the perfectly cheerful assistance he rendered the pretty cook his manner was like that of an elder brother rather than that of a servant  i didnt suppose indians ever worked around a camp and especially with a woman remarked parker  what you dont know about indians is still a large volume parker retorted lawson if you stay around with this outfit for a few weeks youll gather a great deal of information useful for a sculptor of redmen  elsie took lawson mildly to task for his sharp reply  lawson admitted that it made him impatient when a man like parker opened his mouth on things he knew nothing about you never can tell what your best friend will do can you parker is decidedly fresh if he keeps on hell become tiresome  elsie presumed on her enormous experience of three months on the reservation and gave parker many valuable hints of how to wheedle the tetongs in personal contact  it seems im being schooled he complained  you need it was lawsons disconcerting reply  as night fell and the fire began to glow in the cool sweet dark with increasing power they all sat round the flame and planned the trip into the mountains  i have some tetongs up there who are disposed to keep very clear of the agency red wolf is their head man you may all go with me and see my council with him if you like  oh that will be glorious fun cried elsie  but parker asked a little anxiously you think it safe which amused curtis and parker hastened to explain youve no idea what a bad reputation these tetongs have anyhow i would not feel justified in taking mrs parker into any danger  she is quite safe replied curtis i will answer for the action of my wards  well if you are quite sure  how far away washington seems now remarked elsie after a silence i feel as if i had gone back to the very beginning of things  it seems the end of things for the tetongs replied lawson we forget that fact sometimes when we are anxious to have them change to our ways barring out a few rudenesses their old life was a beautiful adaptation of organism to environment isnt that so curtis  it certainly had its idyllic side  but they must have been worried to death for fear of getting scalped said parker  oh they didnt war much till the white man came to disturb them by crowding one tribe into another tribes territory their wars were small affairshardly more than skirmishes that they were infrequent is evident from the importance given small forays in their winter counts  one by one the campers began to yawn and jennie and mrs parker withdrew into the tent reserved for the women but lawson and elsie and curtis still remained about the fire the girls eyes were wide with excitement isnt it delicious to be a little speck of life in this limitless world of darkness osborne why didnt we camp last year  i proposed it but mattie would not hear to it i have a notion that you also put my suggestion aside with scorn  she protested that he was mistaken it is the only way to get close to these wild people i begin to understand them as i sit here beside this fire what do you suppose two horns is thinking about as he sits over there smoking  as they talked lawson began to yawn also and at last said elsie bee bee i am sleepy and i know curtis is  not at all protested curtis im just coming to myself as the campfire smoulders the night is at its best besides im in the midst of a story  well i didnt sleep very well last night began lawson apologetically i thinkif you dont mind  go to bed sleepy head laughed elsie well excuse you  i believe i will and off he went leaving the two young people alone  go on cried elsie tell me all about it  curtis glowed with new fire at this proof of her interest well there we were sergeant pierce standing elk and myself camped in avalanche basin which at that time of the year is as full of storms as a cave is of bats a yelping cry on the hill back of them interrupted him there goes a coyote now the night is perfect he ended with a note of exultant poetry  she drew a little nearer to him i dont enjoy that cry as well as you do she said with a touch of delicious timidity in her voice thats the woman of it isnt it  i know how harmless he is after a pause he slowly said this is the farthest reach of the imaginablethat you should sit here beside my fire in this wild land it must seem as much of a dream to you as your splendid home was to me  i didnt suppose these things could shake me so how mysterious the world is when night makes it lone and empty i never realized it before that hill behind us and the wolfand see those willows by the brook they might be savages creeping upon us or great birds resting or any silent threatening creature of the darkness if i were alone my heart would stand still with awe and fear of them  they are not mysterious to me he made answer only in the sense that space and dusk are inexplicable after all the wonder of the universe is in our brains like love rather than in the object to which we attribute mystery or majesty to the tetong the simplest thing belonging to the white race is mysteriousa button a cartridge a tinplate how are they made what are they built for he asks so deeply considered all nature is inexplicable to us also we white children of the great ruler push the mystery a little further back that is all once i tried to understand the universe now i am content to enjoy it  tell me how did you first become interested in these people  he hesitated a little before he replied well i was always interested in them and when i got out among the payonnay i tried to get at their notions of life but they are a strange peoplea secretive peopleand i couldnt win their confidence for a long time one day while on a hunting expedition i came suddenly upon a crew of woodchoppers who had an old man tied to a tree and were about to burn him alive  horrible why  no reason at all so far as i could learn his wife sat on the ground not far away wailing in deep despair what treatment she had suffered i do not know naturally i ordered the men to release the old man and when they refused i cut his bands the ruffians were furious with rage and threatened to tie me up and burn me too by this time i was too angry to fear anything if you do you better pulverize the buttons on my uniform for the united states government will demand a head for every one of them had i been a civilian they would have killed me  they wouldnt have dared elsie shuddered  such men dare do anything when they are safe from discoveryand there is always the indian to whom a deed of that sort can be laid  did they release the old man  yes and he and his wife camped along with me for several days and their devotion to me was pathetic finally i came to understand that he considered himself dead so far as his tribe was concerned my life belongs to you he said i was just beginning the sign language at that time and i couldnt get very far with him but i made him understand that i gave his life back to him he left me at last and returned to the tribe thereafter every redman i met called me friend and patiently sat while i struggled to learn his language as i grew proficient they told me things they had concealed from all white men i ceased to be an enemy i became an adviser a chief  did you ever see the old man again  oh yes he was my guide on several hunting expeditions poor old siyeh he died of smallpox the white mans disease he called it bitterly he wanted to see me but when he understood that i would be endangered thereby he said it is welli will die alone but tell him i fold my hands on my breast and his hand is between my palms the soldiers voice grew hard and dry as the memory of the old mans death returned upon him  elsie shuddered with a new emotion you make my head whirlyou and the night did that determine your course with regard to them  yes i resolved to get at their heartstheir inner thoughtsand my commanders put me forward from time to time as interpreter where i could serve both the army and the redman in some strange way all the northwest tribes came to know of me and i could go where few men could follow me it is curious but they never did seem strange to me from the first time i met an indian i felt that he was a man like other mena father a son a brother like anybody else naturally when the plan for enlisting redmen into the cavalry came to be worked out i was chosen to command a troop of shiannay i received my promotion at that time my detail as indian agent came from the same cause i suppose i was known to be a friend of the redman and the department is now experimenting with curtis of the grayhorse troop he added with a smile such is the story of my life  how long will you remain indian agent  till i can demonstrate my theory that properly led these people can be made happy  i am afraid you will live here until you are old she said and there was a note of undefinable regret in her voice i begin to feel that you really have a problem to solve  it lies with us the dominant race he said slowly whether the red race shall die or become a strand in the woof of our national life it is a question of saving our own souls not of making them grotesque caricatures of american farmers i am not of those who believe in teaching creeds that are dying out of our own life to be clean to be peaceful to be happythese are the precepts i would teach them  i dont understand you and i think i would better go to bed she said with a return to her ordinary manner goodnight  goodnight he replied and in the utterance of those words was something that stirred her unaccountably  he makes life too serious and too full of responsibility she thought i dont like to feel responsible all the same he is fine she added in conclusion     xv  elsie enters her studio   elsie being young and of flamelike vitality was up and ready for a walk while two horns was building the fire and was trying to make him understand her wish to paint him when curtis emerged from his tent  goodmorning captain she called im glad youve come please tell two horns i want to have him sit for me  curtis with a few swift gestures conveyed her wishes to two horns who replied in a way which made curtis smile  elsie asked what does he say  he says yes how much  oh the mercenary thing  not at all replied curtis his time is worth something you artists think the redmen ought to sit for nothing  two horns ran through a swift and very graceful series of signs which curtis translated rapidly  he says i have heard of you you painted elks daughter i hear you sell these pictures and catch a great pile of money i think it is right you pay us something when we stand before you for long hours while you make pictures to sell to rich men in washington now i drive a team i earn some days two dollars driving team if i stop driving team and come and sit for you then i lose my two dollars  as he finished two horns smiled at elsie with a sly twinkle in his eyes which disconcerted her you sabbe he ended speaking directly to her  i sabbe she said in reply  good he held out his hand and she took it and the bargain was sealed he then returned to his work about the camp  isnt it glorious the girl cried as she looked about her its enough to do an artist all over new the grass and the willows sparkled with dewdrops the sky cloudless save for one long low orangeandpurple cape of glory just above the sunrise canopied a limitless spread of plain to the north and east while the high butte to the back was like the wall of a temple  oh lets take a run up that hill elsie said with sudden change of tone come and giving curtis no time to protest she scuttled away swift as a partridge he followed her calling  wait a moment please  when he overtook her at the foot of the first incline she was breathless but her eyes were joyous as a childs and her cheeks were glowing  let me help you he said and if you slip dont put your hand on the ground that is the way men get snakebitten  snakes she stopped short i forgotare there rattlesnakes here  there is always danger on the sunny side of these buttes at this time of the year especially where the rocks crop out  why didnt you tell me  you didnt give me time  do you really think there is danger  not if you walk slowly and follow me ill draw their poison after they bite me theyll have no virus left for you  she began to smile roguishly you are tiredyou want an excuse to rest  if i thought you meant that id run up to the summit and back again to show you that im younger than my years  she clapped her hands do it it will be like the knight in the storythe gloveandlion story  no on reflection i will not run it would compromise my dignity we will climb soberly side by side like darby and joan on the hill of life  with a demure countenance she took his hand and they scrambled briskly up the slope when they reached the brow of the hill she was fairly done up while he breathing easily showed little fatigue although she had felt his powerful arm sustaining her many times on the steeper slopes she could not speak and he smilingly said i hope i havent hurried you  youarestrong she admitted brokenly im not tired but i cant get breath  at length they reached the summit and looked about what is the meaning of those little towers of stone she asked after a moments rest  oh they have different meanings sometimes they locate the springs of water sometimes they indicate the course of a trail this one was put here by a young fellow to mark the spot from whence he saw a famous herd of buffalowhat time he made a wonderful killing  i suppose all this land has been the huntingground of these people for ages do you suppose they had names for hills like this and were fond of them like white people  certainly they had a geography of their own as complete in its way as ours and they are wonderfully sure of direction even now they seldom make a mistake in the correlative positions of streams or mountains even when confused by a white mans map  it is wonderful isnt itthat they should have lived here all those years without knowing or caring for the white mans world  they dont care for it nowbut i see two horns signalling that breakfast is ready so we had better go  lets run down  wait he caught her it will lame you frightfully i warn you  oh no it wont  very well experience is a fine school if you must run down well go down the shadowed side now ill let you get halfway down and beat you in after all one two threego  with her skirt caught up in her hand she started down the hill in reckless flight she heard his shout and the thud of his prodigious leaps and just as she reached the level he overtook her and relentlessly left her far behind discouraged and panting she fell into a walk and waited for him to return as she knew he would  oh these skirts she said resentfully what chance has a woman with yards of cloth binding her i nearly tumbled headlong  he did not make her suffer for her defeat and they returned to camp gay as a couple of children lawson smiled benevolently like an aged uncle while elsie told him of their climb said he when youre as old as i am you will wait for wonders to come your way you will not seek them  the breakfast was made merry by jennie who waged gentle warfare on parker whose preconceived ideas of the people resident on an indian reservation had been shaken  why youre very decent he admitted at last  they are all like usnit replied jennie were marked special  couldnt be any more like you sis said curtis  you shouldnt say that  well it needed saying and no one else seemed ready to do it if calvin had been here  who is calvin asked mrs parker  i know cried elsie hes one of the handsomest young cowboys you ever saw if you want to do a cowpuncher parker hes your model  i certainly must see him if i dont do a cowboy or a bucking bronco im a failure  as they were ready to start elsie again took her place beside curtis but lawson insisted on sitting behind with jennie its hard luck parker to have to sit with your wife he said compassionately  oh well im used to disappointments parker replied in resigned calm  elsie felt the need of justifying herself are you complaining am i the assistant driver or am i not if i am here is where i belong  when i was coaching in scotland once began lawson  oh never mind scotland interrupted elsie see that chain of peaks arent they gorgeous do we camp there  yes replied curtis just where that fanshaped belt of timber begins i hope to set our tent the agency is just between those dark ridges  it is strange elsie said after a pause last year i was wondering at everything now i am looking for familiar things  that is the second stage he answered the third will be sympathy  what will the fourth be  affection  and the fifth  devotion  she laughed you place too high a value on your western land  i admit there is to me great charm in these barren foothills and the great divide they lead up to he soberly answered  as they talked the swift little horses drummed along the hard road and by the time the agency flagpole came in view they had passed over their main points of difference and were chatting gayly on topics not controversial elsie was taking her turn with the reins her face flushed with the joy and excitement of it while jennie and mrs parker shrieking with pretended fear clung to their seats with frenzied clasp  curtis was as merry as a boy and his people seeing him come in smiling and alert looked at each other in amazement and crow wing said  our little father has found a squaw at last  whereas as her lover curtis had been careful to consider the effect of every word he now went to elsies service as frankly as lawson himself and his thoughtfulness touched her deeply her old studio had been put in order and contained all needful furniture and her sleeping apartment looked very clean and very comfortable indeed  jennie apologized of course its like camping compared to your own splendid home but george said you wouldnt mind that being an artist he has an idea an artist can sleep in a palace one night and a pigsty the next and rejoice  he isnt so very far wrong elsie valiantly replied of course the pigsty is a little bit extreme this is good enough for any one you are very kind she added softly it was good of him to take so much trouble  george is the best man i ever knew replied jennie thats why ive never been able to leave him for any other man she smiled shrewdly ill admit that eligible men have been scarce and my chances have been few well i must run across and look after dinner youre to eat with us till you get settled we insist on being hosts this time                                       surely said curtis as they rose from the table being indian agent is not the grim vexatious experience i once considered it if the charm of such company should get reckoned in as one of the perquisites of the office the crush of applicants would thicken into a riot i find it hard to return to my work in the office  dont be hasty we may turn out to be nuisances responded elsie     xvi  the camp among the roses   during the remainder of the day the agent found office work most difficult his mind wandered to other and pleasanter things and at last he began to make out a list of the necessaries for the camping trip  the next day about four oclock crow wing and crawling elk came into his office bringing a young tetong who said he had been struck on the head by a sheepherder  curtis was instantly alert sit downall of you he commanded now yellow hand tell your story  yellow hand a tall and sinisterlooking fellow related his adventure sullenly i was riding the line of the reservation as crawling elk had told me and as you commanded when i came upon this sheepman driving his flocks across the river i hollered to him to keep away but he kept on pushing the sheep into the river then i tried to drive them back this made him angry and he threw a rock at me and struck me here he touched his bandaged head i had no gun so i came away  did you throw rocks at him asked curtis  no i was on my horse  you rode among his sheep  yes  well that was wrong you should have reported to me and i would have sent a policeman you must not make trouble with these men come to me or report to grayman your head man over there the ranchers are angry at washington and we must be careful not to make them angry at us i will send crow back with you and he will remove this man  as they went out curtis said to wilson this is the second assault they have made on our boys they seem determined to involve us in a shooting scrape in order to influence congress we must be very careful i am afraid i ought not to take this camping trip just now  dont put too much importance on these little scraps major yellow hand is always getting into trouble hes quarrelsome  id disarm a few of these reckless young fellows if it would do any good  it wouldnt theyd simply borrow a gun of some one and it wont do to disarm the whole tribe for if you do these cowboys will swarm in here and run us all out  well caution every one to be careful im particularly anxious just now on account of our visitors  i dont think you need to be major you take your trip with your friends ill guarantee nothing serious happens down here and as you are not to leave the reservation i dont see as the department can have any roar coming  nevertheless it was with some misgiving that curtis made his final arrangements for the start cranes voice and two horns had interested elsie very much therefore he filled their places with other men and notified them to be in readiness to accompany the expedition an order which pleased them mightily mary the mother of cranes voice was to go along as chief cook under jennies direction while two horns took general charge of the camp  elsie burdened herself with canvases i dont suppose ill paint a picture while im gone but im going to make a bluff at it on the start she said as she came out and took her place with the driver amid the mock lamentations of lawson and parker and jennie  can any of you driveno replied elsie in german fashion then i am here  i like her impudence said lawson  as they drove up the valley curtis outlined his plan for using the water on a huge agency garden i would lay it out in lots and mark every lot with the name of a family and require it to be planted and taken care of by that family there are sites for three such gardens enough to feed the entire tribe but so long as a few white men are allowed to use up all the water nothing can be done but continue to feed the tetongs in idleness as we are now doing  as they rose the grass grew greener and at last elsie began to discover wild roses growing low in damp places and at noon when they stopped for lunch they were able to eat in the shade of a murmuring aspen with wild flowers all about them the stream was swift and cold and clear hardly to be classed with the turbid sluggish discouraged current which seeped past the agency  it is a different world up here elsie said again and again i cant believe we are only a halfdays drive from the agency i never saw more delicious greens  mrs parker being an amateur botanist was filled with delight of the thickening flowers it is exactly as if we had begun in august and were moving backward towards spring i feel as though violets were near it is positively enchanting  youll camp beside violets tonight replied curtis  lawson pretended to sleep parker smoked a pipe while striding along behind the wagon elsie drove and of course curtis could not leave her to guide the team alone necessarily they talked freely on many topics and all restraint all reserve were away at last it is difficult to hold a formal and carefully considered conversation in a jolting buckboard climbing towards a great range of shining peaks and every frank speech brought them into friendlier relation considered in this light the afternoon assumed vast importance  at last just on the edge of a small lake entirely enclosed by sparse pines they drew into camp to the west the top of a snow mountain could be seen low down and against it a thin column of blue smoke was rising the water dark as topaz and smooth as oil reflected the opposite shore the yellow sky and the peak with magic clearness and elsie was seized with a desire to do something  where is my paintbox here is the background for some actioni dont know whatsomething primeval  an indian in a canoe à la brush or a bear coming down to drink à la bierstadt suggested parker  dont mention that old fogy cried elsie  lawson interposed well now those old chaps had something to sayand thats better than your modern frenchmen do  she was soon at work with lawson and parker standing by her side overlooking her panel and offering advice  theres no color in that parker said finally its a blackandwhite merely its charm is in things you cant paintthe feel of the air the smell of pine boughs  go awayboth of you she commanded curtly and they retreated to the camp where curtis was setting the tents and jennie old mary and two horns with swift and harmonious action were bringing appetizing odors out of various cans and boxes what time the crackle of the fire increased to a gentle roar there they sat immovably shamelessly waiting till the call for supper came  they were all hungry and jennies cooking received such praise as comes from friends who speak and devourparker nearly devoured without speaking so lank and empty was he by reason of his long walk elsie seemed to have forgotten her life of luxury and was reverted to a primitive stage of culture wherein she found everything enjoyable her sketch propped up against a basket by curtis was admired unreservedly altogether the trouble and toil of civilized life were forgotten tyrants so far as these few souls were concerned they came close to the peace and the carefree tranquillity of the redman whose ideals they had come to destroy  as soon as supper was eaten and the men had lighted their cigars the whole party walked out to the edge of the little pond and lounged about on blankets and watched the light go out of the sky talk grew more subdued as the beauty and the mystery of the night deepened elsie listened to every sound and asked innumerable questions of curtis she insisted on knowing the name of every bird or beast whose call could be heard the young soldiers woodcraft both pleased and astonished her mrs parker with her lap full of botanical specimens was absorbed in the work of classifying them parker was a gentleman of leisure with nothing to do but watch the peaceful coming of the dusk and comment largely on the universe  it was natural that as host curtis should enjoy a large part of elsies company but neither of them seemed to realize that lawson was being left quite unheeded in the background but jennie was aware of this neglect and put forth skilful effort to break the force of it lawson himself seemed to be entirely unconscious of any loss or threatening disaster  a little later as they sat watching the fire grow in power in the deepening darkness curtis suddenly lifted his hand  hark  all listened two horns spoke first one man come on horse  some messenger for me probably said the captain composedly he is coming fast too  as the steady drumming of the horses hoofs increased in power elsie felt something chill creep beneath the roots of her hair perhaps the indians had broken out in war against the whites perhaps  a tall young tetong slipped from his tired horse and approached the captain in his extended hand lay an envelope which gleamed in the firelight as curtis took this letter the messenger squatting before him began to roll a cigarette his lean and powerful face was shadowed by a limp sombrero and his eyes were hidden but his lips were grave and calm a quirt dangled from his right wrist and in the two braids of his hair green eagleplumes were twisted the star on the lapel of his embroidered vest showed him to be a policeofficer from the intensity of his attitude it was plain he was studying his agents face in order to read thereon the character of the message he had brought  curtis turned the paper slowly and without excitement with rapid signs he dismissed the courier i have read it you will camp with two horns go get some food mary will give you meat  turning to his guests he then said it is nothing specialmerely some papers i forgot to sign before leaving  by george what a picture the fellow made sitting there said parker it was like an illustration in a novel why dont you paint that kind of thing bee bee  because i cant she replied dont you suppose i saw it id need the skill of zorn to do a thing as big and mysterious as that did you see the intensity of his pose he expected captain curtis to show excitement or alarm he was very curious to know what it was all aboutdont you think so  curtis was amused yes i suppose he thought the paper more important than it was the settlers have kept the tribe guessing all the spring by threats of running them off the reservation of course they wouldnt openly resort to violence but there are several irresponsibles who would strike in the dark if they found opportunity  in spite of his reassuring tone a vague fear fell over the camping party parker was frankly alarmed  if you think there is any danger captain i want to get out o here quick im not here to study the tetong with his warpaint on  if there had been any danger mr parker i would not have left my office i shall have a report similar to this every day while i am away so please be composed  the policeman came back resumed his squatting position before the fire and began a series of vigorous and dramatic gestures to which the captain replied in kind absorbed intent with a face as inscrutable as that of the redman himself the contrast between the resolute handsome young white man and the roughhewn tetong was superb theres nothing in it for me said parker but its great business for a painter  elsie seized a block of paper and with soft pencil began to sketch them both against the background of mysterious blackness out of which a pine bole gleamed ashy white  suddenly silently as though one of the treetrunks had taken on life another tetong appeared in the circle of the firelight and stood with deepsunk eyes fastened on the captains face another followed and still others till two old men and four young fellows ranged themselves in a semicircle before their agent with cranes voice and two horns at the left and a little behind the old men smoked a long pipe but the young men rolled cigarettes taking no part in the council listening the while with eyes as bright as those of foxes  it was all sinister and menacing to the parkers and all wondered till curtis turned to say they are my millhandsgood faithful boys too  millhands exclaimed parker they looked uncommonly like a scalping party  that is what imagination can do i thought your faces were extra solemn remarked curtis dryly but lawson knew that the agent was not so untroubled as he pretended for old crow killer had a bitter story to relate of the passage of a band of cowboys through his camp they had stampeded his ponies and shot at him one bullet passing so close to his ear that it burned the skin and he was angry  they wish to kill us these cattlemen he said sombrely in conclusion if they come again we will fight  happily his vehemence did not reach the comprehension of the women nor the understanding of parker and lawson smoked on as calmly as if these telltale gestures were the flecking of shadows cast by the leaping flames at last the red visitors rose and vanished as silently as they came they seemed to pass through black curtains so suddenly they disappeared  in spite of all reassurance the women were a little reluctant to go to bedat least mrs parker and elsie were  i wish the mens tent were not so far off mrs parker said to elsie plaintively  ill ask them to move it if you wish returned elsie and when jennie came in she said arent you a little nervous tonight  jennie looked surprised why no do you mean about sleeping in a tent  yes replied mrs parker suppose a wolf or a redman should come  jennie laughed you neednt worrywe have a powerful guard i never am afraid with george  but the men are so far away i wish their tent were close beside ours im not standing on propriety mrs parker added as jennie hesitated im getting nervous and i want jerome where he can hear me if i call to him  perceiving that elsie shared this feeling in no small degree jennie soberly conveyed their wish to curtis  very well well move over it will take but a moment  as she heard the men driving the tentpegs close beside her bed mrs parker sighed peacefully  now i can sleep there is no comfort like a man in case of wolves indians and burglars and the fact that the men were laughing did not disturb her  with a little shock elsie realized that curtis and not lawson was in her mind as her defender of course he was in command that accounted for it  nevertheless as she listened to the murmur of their voices she detected herself waiting for curtiss crisp clear bass and not for the nasal tenor of the man whose ring she wore her mind was filled too with the dramatic figure the young officer made as he sat in gesturetalk with his tetong wards in case of trouble the safest place on all the reservation would be by his side for his people loved and trusted him she did not go to sleep easily the excitement the strangeness of being in a tent kept her alert long after jennie and mrs parker were breathing tranquilly on their cots  one hears everything from a tent it seems to stand in the midst of the world it is like being in a divingbell under water life goes on almost uninterruptedly the girl heard a hundred obscure singular sibilant sounds as of serpents conferring mysterious footsteps advanced paused retreated whispered colloquies arose among the leaves giving her heart disquiet every unfamiliar sound was a threat the voices of birds and beasts no longer interested herthey scared her and try as she would to banish these fancies her nerves thrilled with every rush of the wind it was deep night before she dropped asleep     xvii  a flute a drum and a message   elsie dreamed she was at the theatre the opera was il trovatore and at the moment when the prison songthat worn yet evermournful cryshould have pulsed forth but in its stead another strain came floating from afar a short phrase equally sad which sank slowly as a fragment of cloud descends from sky to earth to become tears of dew on the roses over and over again it was repeated so sad so sweet so elemental it seemed that the pain of all loves vain regret was in it longing and sorrow and despair without relief without hope defiant of death  slowly the walls of the theatre faded the gray light of morning crept into the dreamers eyes and she was aware of the walls of her tent and knew she had been dreaming but the sorrowful song went on with occasional slight deviations of time and tone but always the same beginning on a high key it fell by degrees hesitating momentarily swooping upward yet ever falling till at last it melted in with the solemn moan of the pines stirring above her head then she drowsed again and seemed to be listening to the wailing song with some one whose hand she held as she turned to ask whence the music came a little shudder seized her for the eyes looking into hers were not those of lawson curtis faced her grave and sweet  with this shock she wakened but the song had ceased she waited in silence hoping to hear it again when fully aroused to her surroundings she was convinced that she had dreamed the music as well as the handclasp and a flush ran over her why should i dream in that way of him  she heard the soft lisp of moccasined feet outside the tent and immediately after the sound of an axe presently the fire began to crackle and the rising sun threw a flood of golden light against the canvas wall jennie lifted her arms and yawned and at last sat up and listened catching elsies eye she said goodmorning dear how did you sleep  deliciouslybut did you hear some one singing just before sunrise  nodid you  i thought i did but perhaps i dreamed it  where did it seem to come from  oh from away off and high upthe saddest songa phrase constantly repeated  oh i know it was some young tetong lover playing the flute they often do that when the girls are going for water in the morning isnt it beautiful  i never heard anything so sad  all their songs are sad george says the primitive lovesongs of all races are the same but two horns has the fire going and i must get up and superintend breakfast you need not rise till i call  mrs parker began to stir jerome what time is it  the girls laughed as jerome in the other tent replied sweetly  time to arise honey plum  mrs parker started up and stared around her eyes still misty with slumber i slept the whole night through she finally remarked as if in answer to a question and her voice expressed profound astonishment  didnt hear the wolves did you pet called parker  wolves no did they howl  howl is no name for it they tied themselves into double bowknots of noise  i dont believe it  elsie replied i didnt hear anything but the music did you hear the singing  lawson spoke you people have the most active imaginations all i heard was the wind in the pines and an occasional moose walking by  moose cried mrs parker why theyre enormous creatures  jennie began to laugh you people will need to hurry to be ready for breakfast im going to put the coffee on she slipped outside oh girls get up at once its glorious out here on the lake  curtis was busy about the campfire goodmorning sis here are some trout for breakfast  trout shouted lawson from the tent  trout echoed parker well be there and the tent bulged and flapped with his hasty efforts at dressing  in gay spirits they gathered round their rude table parker and jennie particularly jocular curtis was puzzled by some subtle change in elsie her gaze was not quite so frank and her color seemed a little more fitful but she was as merry as a child and enjoyed every makeshift as though it were done for the first time and for her own amusement  whats the programme for today asked parker  after i inspect the sawmill we will hook up and move over the divide to the headwaters of the willow and camp with red wolfs band  parker coughed well nowof course captain we are depending on you  curtis smiled perhaps youd like to go back to the agency  no sirree bob im sticking right to your coattails till were out o the woods  lawson interposed you wouldnt infer that parker had ever had a parisian education would you  parker was not abashed i know what you mean those are all expressions my father used they stick to me like flypaper  ive tried and tried to break him of his plebeian phrases but i cannot mrs parker said with sad emphasis  i wouldnt try replied jennie i like them  thank you lady thank you parker fervently made answer  curtis hurried away to look at the sawmill lawson and parker went fishing and elsie got out her paintbox and started another sketch the morning was glorious the air invigorating and she painted joyously with firm plashing strokes never had she been so sure of her brush life and art were very much worth whileonly now and then a disturbing wish intrudedit was only a vague and timid longing but it grew a little in power each time once she looked steadily and soberly at the ring whose jewel sparkled like a drop of dew on the third finger of her left hand  a halfhour later curtis came back walking rapidly seeing her at work he deflected from the straight trail and drew near  i think that is wonderful he said as he looked at her sketch i dont see how you do so much with so few strokes  that always puzzles the layman she replied but its really very simple  when you know how i hope youre enjoying your trip with us  she flashed a smile that was almost coquettish upon him it is glorious i am so happy im afraid it wont last  we always feel that way about any keen pleasure he replied soberly now i cant keep the thought of your going out of my mind every hour or two i find myself saying itll be lonesome business when these artists leave us  you mustnt speak of anything sorrowful this week lets be as happy as we can  he pondered a fitting reply but at last gave it up and said if you are satisfied with your sketch well start i see the teams are ready  oh yes im ready to go i just wanted to make a record of the valuesthey are changing so fast now and she began to wipe her brushes and put away her panel i dont care where we go so we keep in the pines and have the mountains somewhere in sight  it must have been in remorse of her neglect of lawson the preceding day that elsie insisted on sitting beside him in the back seat while mrs parker took her place with the driver the keen pang of disappointment which crossed his heart warned curtis that his loyalty to his friend was in danger of being a burden and the drive was robbed of all the blithe intercourse of the day before parker and jennie fought clamorously on a variety of subjects in the middle distance but curtis was hardly more than courteous to mrs parkerso absorbed was he in some inner controversy  retracing their course to the valley the two wagons crossed the stream and crawled slowly up the divide between the elk and the willow and at one oclock came down upon a sparse village of huts and tepees situated on the bank of a clear little streamjust where it fell away from a narrow pond which was wedged among the foothills like an artificial reservoir the year was still fresh and green here and the air was like may  dogs were barking and snarling round the teams as a couple of old men left the doors of their tepees and came forward one of them was grayhaired but tall and broadshouldered this was many coups a famous warrior and one of the historians of his tribe he greeted the agent soberly expressing neither fear nor love asking who are these with you i have not seen them before  to this curtis replied they are my friends they make pictures of the hills and the lakes and of chieftains like many coups  many coups looked keenly at elsie my eyes are old and poor he slowly said but now i remember this young woman was at the agency last year and he put up his hand which was small and graceful even yetthe hand of an artist i make pictures also he said  when this was translated elsie said you shall make a picture of me and i will make one of you  at this the old man smilingly answered it shall be so  where is red wolf asked curtis  he is away with tailfeathers to keep the cowboys from our land we are growing afraid little father  we will talk more of that byandbywe must now camp call your people together and at midafternoon we will council replied curtis  driving a little above the village curtis found a sheltered spot behind some lowgrowing pines and not far from the lake and there they hastened to camp the news flew from camp to camp that the little father was come but no one crowded unseasonably to look at him we will council many coups announced and began to array himself for the ceremony horsemen galloped away to call red wolf and others who lived down the valley never before had an agent visited them in their homes and they were disposed to make the most of it  by the time the white people had eaten their lunch all the red women were in their best dresses the pappooses were shining with the scrubbing they had suffered and each small warrior wore a cunning buckskin coat elaborate with beads and quills a semicircular wall of canvas was being erected to shield the old men from the mountain wind and a detail of cooks had started in upon the task of preparing the feast which would end the council  said curtis you will find in this camp the tetong comparatively unchanged red wolfs band is the most primitive encampment i know a few minutes later he added here comes many coups and his son in official garb  the two chieftains greeted their visitors as if they had not hitherto been seenwith all the dignity of ambassadors to a foreign court  please treat them with the same formality warned curtis it will pay you for the glimpse of the oldtime ceremony  the younger man was unpainted save for some small blue figures on his forehead on his head he wore a wide mexican hat which vastly became him his face was one of the handsomest and most typical of his race  this young man is the son of many coups and is called blue fox or the southern traveller because he has been down where the mexicans are his hat he got there and he is very proud of it explained curtis  jennie gave each of them a cup of coffee and a biscuit of which they partook without haste discussing meanwhile the coming council  we did not know you were coming some of our people will not get here in time said many coups  tonight after the council we wish to dance said blue fox meaning it as a request  it is forbidden in washington to dance in the old way  we have heard of that but we will dance for your wives they will be glad to see it  very well you may dance but not too long no wardanceonly the visitors dance  ay we understand said many coups as he rose and drew his blanket about him in one hour we will come to council red wolf will be there and hump shoulder and his son it may be others will return in time  the women were delighted at the promise of both a council and a dance and lawson unlimbered his camera in order to take some views of both functions though he expressed some dissatisfaction  the noble redman is thin and crooked in the legs he said to curtis why is this  all the plains indians who ride the horse almost from their babyhood are bowlegged they never walk and they are seldom symmetrically developed  they are significant but not beautiful said lawson  as they walked about the camp elsie exclaimed this is the way all redmen should live and indeed the scene was very beautiful they were far above the agency and the long valleys could be seen descending like folds in a vast robe reaching to the plain the ridges were dark with pines for a space but grew smooth and green at lower levels and at last melted into haze the camp was a summer camp and all about in pleasant places among the pines stood the tepees swarming with happy children and puppies under low lodges of canvas or bowers of pine branches the women were at work boiling meat or cooking a rude sort of cruller they were very shy and mostly hung their heads as their visitors passed though they soon yielded to jennie who could speak a few words to them  theres nothing in them for sculpture said parker critically at least not for beauty they might be treated as raffaelle paintsfor character  they grow heavy early jennie added but the little girls are beautifulsee that little one  the crier a tall old man toothless and wrinkled and gray began to cry in a hollow monotonous voice come to the council place and curtis led his flock to their places in the midst of the circle  the council began with all the oldtime forms with gravity and decorum red wolf was in the centre with many coups at his left the pipe of peace went round and those whose minds were not yet prepared for speech drew deep inspirations of the fragrant smoke in the hope that their thoughts might be clarified and when they lifted their eyes they seemed not to perceive their visitors or those who passed to and fro among the tepees the sun westering fell with untempered light on their heads but they faced it with the calm unconcern of eagles  to please his guests curtis allowed the utmost formality and did not hasten interrupt or excise the speeches were translated into english by lawson and at each telling point or period in red wolfs speech the women looked at each other in surprise  did he really say that asked elsie didnt you make it up  rather good for a ragamuffin dont you think said lawson as the old man took his seat  many coups spoke slowly sadly as though half communing with himself with nothing of the bombast the visitors had expected and he grew in dignity and power as his thought began to make itself felt through his interpreter  he is speaking for his race remarked lawson to elsie  by jove the old fellow is a good lawyer cried parker i dont see any answer to his indictment  curtis sat listening as though each point the old man made were newand this attitude pleased the chieftains very much  the speech in its general tenor was similar to many others he had heard from thoughtful redmen briefly he described the time when the redmen were happy in a land filled with deer and buffalo before the white man was we lived as the great spirit made us then the white man cameand now we are bewildered with his commands our eyes are blinded we know not where to go we know not whom to believe or trust i am old i am going to my grave troubled over the fate of my children agents come and go the good ones go too soonthe bad ones stay too long but they all go there is no one in whose care to leave my children it is better to die here in the hills than to live the slave of the white man ragged and spiritless slinking about like a dog without a friend we do not want to make war any morewe ask only to live as our fathers lived and die here in the hills  as he spoke these final tragic words his voice grew deep and trembled and elsie felt some strong force gripping at her throat and burning tears filled her eyes in the city it was easy to say the way of civilization lies over the graves of the primitive races but here under the sun among the trees when one of those about to die looked over and beyond her to the hills as though choosing his gravethe utterance of the pitiless phrase was difficult in any toneimpossible in the boasting shout of the white promoter she rose suddenly and walked awaybeing ashamed of her tears a painful constriction in her throat  the speakers who followed spoke in much the same wayall but blue fox who sharply insisted that the government should help them you have put us here on barren land where we can only live by raising stock you should help us fence the reservation and get us cattle to start with then byandby we can build good houses and have plenty to eat this is right for you have destroyed our gameand you will not let us go to the mountains to hunt you must do something besides furnish us ploughs in a land where the rain does not come  in answer to all this curtis replied using the sign language he admitted that red wolf was right the tetongs have been cheated but good days are coming i am going to help you i am going to stay with you till you are safely on the white mans road we intend to buy out the settlers and take the water in the streams so that you may raise potatoes for your children and you will then be glad because your gardens will bear many things good to eat do not despair the white people are coming to understand the situation now you have many friends who will help  as many coups rose and shook hands with the agent he was smiling again and he said your words are good  the old crier went forth again calling come to the dancehall the white people desire to see you dance come clothed in your best garments  then the drum began to utter its spasmodic signal and the heralds voice sounded faint and far off as he descended the path to the second group of tepees  shall we go now asked mrs parker  oh no it will be two hours before they begin the young men must go and dress we have time to sup and smoke a pipe  oh im so glad were going to see a real indian dance i didnt suppose it could be seen nownot the real thing  lawson smiled youll think this is the real thing before you get inside the door ive known tenderfeet to weaken at the last moment  parker pretended to be a little nervous suppose they should get hold of some liquor  this band is too far away from the white man to have his vices replied curtis with a slight smile he had wondered at elsies going but concluded she had grown weary of the old chiefs speech  there is great charm in this life said lawson as they all gathered before their tent and sat overlooking the village and the lake i sometimes wonder whether we have not complicated life without adding to the sum of human happiness  im thinking of this in winter said elsie ooo it must be terrible no furnace no bathtubs  the others laughed heartily at the sincerity of her shudder and curtis said  well now youd be surprised to know how comfortable they keep in their tepees in the old skin tepee they were quite warm even on the coldest days they always camp in sheltered places out of the wind and where fuel is plenty  at the same time i prefer my own way of living to theirswhen winter comes  i know something of your logic replied curtis but i think i understand the reluctance of these people when asked to give up the old things i love their lifetheir daily actionsthis man coiling a lariatthat childs outline against the tepeethe smell of their fresh breadthe smoke of their little fires i can understand a tetong when he says all this is as sweet to me as your own lifewhy should i give it up feeling as i do i never insist on their giving up anything which is not an impediment i argue with them and show that some of their ways are evil or a hinderance in the struggle for life under new conditions and they always meet me halfway  supper is ready called jennie and his audience rose  while still at meat the drum which had been sounding at intervals suddenly took on a wilder energy followed immediately by a high shrill yelping call which was instantly augmented by a halfdozen others all as savage and startling as the sudden burst of howling from a pack of wolves this clamor fell away into a deep throbbing chant only to rise again to the yelping whimpering cries with which it began  every woman stiffened with terror with wide eyes questioning curtis what is all that  the opening chorus he explained much amused a song of the chase  the dusk was beginning to fall and the tepees with their small sparkling fires close beside and the shadowy blanketed forms assembling slowly silently gave a wonderful remoteness and wildness to the scene to curtis it was quite like the oldtime village the husky voice of the aged crier seemed like a call from out of the years primeval before the white race with its devastating energy and its killing problems had appeared in the east the artist in elsie now fully awake dominated the daughter of wealth oh this is beautiful i never expected to see anything so primitive  knowing that his guests were eager to view it all curtis led the way towards the dancelodge elsie was moved to take her place beside him but checked herself and turned to lawson leaving mrs parker to walk at the captains elbow  to the ears of the city dwellers the uproar was appallingfull of murder and sudden death as they approached the lodge the frenzied booming of the drum the wild yelping howls the shrill whooping brought up in their minds all the stories of dreadful deeds they had ever read and parker said to jennie  do you really think the captain will be able to control them  jennie laughed im used to this clamor its only their way of singing  elsie said they must be flourishing bloody scalpingknives in there it is direful  wait and see said lawson  the dancehouse was a large octagonal hut built of pine logs partly roofed with grass and soil it was lighted by a leaping fire in the centre and by four lanterns on the walls and as curtis and his party entered the clamor in their honor redoubled in a first swift glance elsie apprehended only a confused jingling fluttering mass of colora chaos of leaping halfnaked forms and a small circle of singers fiercely assaulting a drum which sat on the floor at the right of the door  then red wolf calm stately courtly came before them carrying his wand of office and conducted them to seats at the left of the fire and the girls heart ceased to pound so fiercely looking back she saw jennie shaking hands with one of the fiercest of the painted and beplumed dancers and recognized him as blue fox turning she fixed her eyes on a middleaged man who was dancing as sedately as washington might have led the minuet his handsome face calm of line and the clip of his lips genial and placid plainly the ferocity did not extend to the dancers the singers alone seemed to express hate and lust and war  the music suddenly ceased and in an instant the girls mind cleared she perceived that the singers were laughing as they rolled their cigarettes and that the savage warrior dancers were gossiping together as they rested while all about her sat plump young girls in gay dresses very conscious of the eyes of the young men in her early life elsie had attended a country dance and her changed impressions of this mad bloodthirsty revel was indicated in her tone as she said  why its just an oldfashioned country hoedown  curtis laughed i congratulate you on your penetration he mockingly said  the old men came up to shake hands with the agent and on being presented to elsie smiled reassuringly their manners were very good indeed several of them gravely made a swift sign which caused curtis to color and look confused and when his answering sign caused them all to look at lawson elsie demanded to know what it was all about  do you think youd better know he asked  certainly i insist on knowing she added as he hesitated again  he looked at her but a little unsteadily they asked if you were my bride and i replied no that you came with lawson  it was her turn to look confused the impudent things was all she could find to say at the moment  red wolf called out a few imperative words the song began with its imitation of the wolves at war as before then settled into a pounding chantdeep resonant and inspiriting the dancers sprang forthnot all but a part of themas though their names had been called while a curious little bent and withered old man crept in like a gnome and built up the fire till it blazed brightly as they danced the younger men reenacted with abrupt swift violent yet graceful gestures the drama of wild life they trailed game rescued lost warriors and defeated enemies  you see it proceeds with decorum said curtis to elsie and mrs parker as the dancers returned to their seats they enjoy it just as white people enjoy a cotillion and barring the noise of the singers it is quite as formal and harmless  a little boy in full dancing costume now came on with the rest and the visitors exclaimed in delight of his grace and dignity he could not have been more than six years of age his companion an old man of seventy was a good deal of a wag and danced in comicwise to make the onlookers laugh  parker was fairly hooking his chin over curtiss shoulder to hear every word uttered and to see all that went on and curtis was in the midst of an explanation of the significance of the drama of the dance when a short sturdy bowlegged tetong dressed in a policemans uniform pushed his way in at the door and thrust a letter at his agents hand  instantly every eye was fixed on curtiss bent head as he opened the letter the dancers took their seats whispering and muttering the drum ceased and the singers turned into bronze figures stared solemnly a nervous chill ran though elsies blood and parker turned pale and cold  whats upwhats up he asked hurriedly this is a creepy pause  lawson laid a hand on his arm and shut down on it like a vice  red wolf brought a lantern and held it at the captains shoulder  jennie leaning over caught the words theres been a row over on the willow  curtis calmly folded the paper nodded and smiled his thanks to red wolf and then lifting his hand he signed to the policeman in full view of all the dancers  go back and tell wilson to issue just the same amount of flour this week that he did last and that red wolf wants a new mowingmachine for his people you need not return till morning then turning to red wolf he said go on with the dance my friends are much pleased  the tension instantly gave way every one being deceived but jennie who understood the situation and tried to help on the deception but her round face was plainly anxious  elsie as she ceased to wonder concerning the forms and regulations of the dance grew absorbed in the swirling forms the harsh clashing of colors the short shrill cries the gleam of round and polished limbs the haughty fling of tall headdresses and the lightness of the small and beautifully modelled feet drumming upon the ground but most of all she was moved by the aloofness of expression on the faces of many of the dancers for the most part they seemed to dreamto revisit the pastespecially the old men their lips were sad their eyes pensivesingularly soand mentally the girl said i must paint my next portrait of this qualityan old man dreaming of the olden time i wonder if they really were happy in those dayshappier than our civilization can make them and thoughts came to her which shook her confidence in the city and the mart for the first time in her life she doubted the sanctity of the steamengine and the orecrusher  as they took their seats from time to time the older men smoked their long pipes only the young men rolled their cigarettes to them the past was a childs recollection not the irrevocable dream of age they were the links between the old and the new  as the time came to go curtis rose and addressed his people in signs we are glad to be here he said all my friends are pleased my heart is joyous when you dance i do not forbid it sometimes washington tells me to do something and i must obey they say you must not dance the wardance any more and so i must forbid it this dance was pleasantit is not bad my heart is made warm to be with you i am visiting all my people and i must go tomorrow do not quarrel with the white man be patient and washington will do you good  each promise was greeted by the old men with cries of ay ay and the drummers thumped the drums most furiously in applause and so the agent said goodnight and withdrew     xviii  elsies ancient love affair   as they walked back to their camp jennie took her brothers arm  what is it george  i must return to the agency  that means we must all go  i suppose so the settlers seemed determined to make trouble they have had another row with gray mans band and shots have been fired fortunately no one was hurt we must leave here early say nothing to any of our guests till we are safely on the way home  elsie walking with lawson was very pensive i begin to understand why captain curtis is made indian agent he understands these people sympathizes with them  no one better and if the department can retain him six years he will have the tetongs comfortably housed and on the road to independence and selfrespect  why shouldnt he be retained  well your father may secure reelection to the senate next winter  i know she softly answered he dislikes captain curtis  more than thatin order to be elected he must pledge himself to have curtis put out o the way  that sounds like murder she said  oh no its only politicspolitics and business but lets not talk of thatlet us absorb the beauty of the night did you enjoy the dance  very much i am hopeless of ever painting it thoughit is so full of big significant shadows i wish i knew more about it  you are less confident than you were last year he looked at her slyly  i see more  and feel more he asked  yesim afraid im getting captain curtiss point of view these people arent the mendicants they once seemed the expression of some of those faces tonight was wonderful they are something more than tramps when they discard their rags  i wish youd come to my point of view he said a little irrelevantly  about what  about our momentous day suppose we say wednesday of thanksgiving week  i thought you were going to wait for me to speak she replied  he caught his breath a little so i willonly you wont forget my gray hairs will you  i dont think i willnot with your broad daily hints to remind me but you promised to be patient andjust friendly  he ignored her sarcasm it would be rather curious if i should become increasingly impatient wouldnt it i made that promise in entire good faith buti seem to be changing  thats what troubles me she said you are trying to hurry me  at this moment they came close to the parkers and she did not continue he had given her another disturbing thought to sleep on and that was would it hurt him much if i should now return his ring  mrs parker was disposed to discuss the dance but jennie said  we must all go to sleep george says we are to move early tomorrow                                       the walls of the tent could hardly be seen when the sound of the crackling flames again told that faithful two horns was feeding the campfire cranes voice could be heard bringing in the horses and in a few moments curtis called out in a low incisive voice  everybody turn out we must make an early start across the range  the morning was gray the peaks hidden in clouds and the wind chill as the women came from their beds two horns had stretched some blankets to keep off the blast but still elsie shivered and curtis roundly apologized im sorry to get you up so early it spoils all the fun of camping if youre obliged to rise before the sun an hour from now and all will be genial please wait for my explanation  breakfast was eaten in discomfort and comparative silence though parker with intent to enliven the scene cut a few capers as awkward as the antics of a sandhill crane almost before the smoke of the tepee fires began to climb the trees the agent and his party started back over the divide towards the mill no one in holiday mood there was a certain pathos in this loss of good cheer  once out of sight of the camp curtis turned and said friends im sorry to announce it but i must return to the agency tonight and i must take you all with me wilson has asked me to hasten home and of course he would not do so without good reason  what is the matter asked elsie  the same old trouble the cattlemen are throwing their stock on the reservation and the tetongs are resenting it  no danger i hope said parker popeyed this time with genuine apprehension  oh nonot if i am on hand to keep the races apart now im going to drive hard and you must all hang on i want to pull into the agency before dark  the wagon lurched and rattled down the divide as curtis urged the horses steadily forward with his foot in the brake he descended in a single hour the road which had consumed three long hours to climb conversation under these conditions was difficult and at times impossible  jennie intrepid driver herself clutched her brothers arm at times as the vehicle lurched but curtis made it all a joke by shouting it is always easy to slide into hadesthe worst is soon over  once in the valley of the elk the road grew better and curtis asked elsie if she wished to drive she being very selfconscious for some reason shook her head no thank you and rode for the most part in silence though lawson made a brave effort to keep up a conversation  by eleven oclock not even curtis and lawson together could make the ride a joke the women were hungry and tired and distinctly saddened by this sudden ending of their joyous outing  i wish these rampant cowboys could have waited till we had our holiday jennie grumbled as she stretched her tired arms  probably they were informed of the captains plans and seized the opportunity suggested parker  i wonder if cal is a traitor mused jennie  two horns and cranes voice came rattling along soon after curtis stopped for noon at their first campingplace and in a few minutes lunch was ready conversation still lagged in spite of inspiriting coffee and the women lay out on their rugs and blankets resting their aching bones while the men smoked and speculated on the outcome of the whole indian question  the teams were put to the wagons as soon as their oats were eaten and the homeward drive begun brisk and businesslike and for some mysterious reason curtis recovered his usual cheerful tone  it was midafternoon when the agency was sighted and the fiveoclock bell had just rung as they drove slowly and with no appearance of haste into the yard  wilson came out to meet them howdedo you made a short trip  how are things inquired curtis  nothing doingall quiet replied the clerk but curtis detected something yet untold in the quiver of his clerks eyelid  well im glad we got in  supper was eaten with little ceremony and very languid conversation and the artists at once sought their rooms to rest the parkers were too tired to be nervous and curtis was absorbed with some private problem  as lawson and elsie walked across the square in the twilight he announced meditatively  im going to be more and more impatientthat is now certain  osborne dont please dont take that tone i dont like it  why not dear he asked tenderly  becausebecause she turned in a swift overmastering impulse because if you do i must give you back your ring she wrung it from her finger i think i must anyhow  as she crowded the gem into his lax hand he said why what does this mean elsie bee bee his voice expressed pain and bewilderment  i dont know what it means yet only i feel that it isnt right now to wear it i told you when you put it on that it implied no promise on my part  i know it and it doesnt imply any now  yes it does your whole attitude towards me implies an absolute engagement and i cant rest under that take back your ring till i can receive it as other girls doas a binding promise you must do this or i will hate you she added with a sudden fury  why certainly dearestonly i dont see what has produced this change in you  i have not changedyou have changed  he laughed at this the womans last word well i admit it i have come to love you as a man loves the woman he wishes to make his wife im going to care a great deal elsie bee bee if you do not come to me some time  dont say that she cried and there was an imploring accent in her voice dont you see i must not wear your ring till i promise all you ask  they walked on in silence to the door as they stood there he said i feel as though i were about to say goodbye to you forever and it makes my heart ache  she put both hands on his shoulders then swift as a bird turned and was gone he felt that she had thought to kiss him but he divined it would have been a farewell kiss and he was glad that she had turned away there was still hope for him in that indecision  as for elsie life seemed suddenly less simple and less orderly she pitied osborne she was angry and dissatisfied with herself and in doubt about curtis im not in love with himit is impossible absurd but my summer is spoiled i shall go home at once it is foolish for me to be here when i could be at the seashore  after a moment she thought why am i here i guess the girls were right i am a crankan irresponsible why should i want to paint these malodorous tepee dwellers just to be different from any one else  as she sat at her open window she heard again the tetong lovers flute wailing from the hillside across the stream and the sound struck straight in upon her heart and filled her with a mysterious longinga pain which she dared not analyze her mind was active to the point of confusionseething with doubts and the wreckage of her opinions lawsons action had deeply disturbed her  they had never pretended to sentiment in their relationship indeed she had settled into a conviction that love was a silly passion possible only to girls in their teens this belief she had attained by passing through what seemed to her a fiery furnace of suffering at eighteen and when that selfeffacing passion had burned itself out she had renounced love and marriage and devoted herself to art healing herself with work for some years thereafter she posed as a manhater  the objective cause of all this tumult and flame and renunciation seemed ridiculously inadequate in the eyes of others he was the private secretary of senator stollwaert at the time a smug discreet pretty man of slender attainment and no great ambition happily he had afterwards removed to new york or washington would have been an impossible place of residence for elsie she had met him once since her returnhe had had the courage to call upon herand the familiar pose of his small head and the mincing stride of his slender legs had given her a feeling of nausea is it possible that i once agonized over this trig little man she asked herself  to be just to him mr garretson did not presume in the least on his previous intimacy on the contrary he seemed timid and ill at ease in the presence of the woman whose beauty had by no means been foreshadowed in her girlhood he was not stupid the splendor of her surroundings awed him but above all else there was a look on her face which too plainly expressed contempt for her ancient folly her shame was as perceptible to him as though expressed in spoken words and his visit was never repeated  of this affair elsie had spoken quite freely to lawson it only shows what an unmitigated idiot a girl is she is bound to love some one i knew quantities of nice boys and why i should have selected poor sammy as the centre of all my hopes and affections i dont know i dimly recall thinking he had nice ears and hands but even they do not now seem a reasonable basis for wild passion do they  lawson had been amused love at that age isnt a creature of reason  evidently not if mine was a sample  ours now is so reasonable as to seem insecure and dangerous  her intimacy with lawson therefore had begun on the plane of goodfellowship while they were in paris together and for two years he seemed quite satisfied of late he had been less contained  after her outburst of anger at her fathers ejectment of curtis she met lawson with a certain reserve not common to her at the moment she more than half resolved that the time had come to leave her fathers house for lawsons flat and yet her will wavered she said as little as possible to him concerning that last disgraceful scene as much on her own account as to spare curtis but her restlessness was apparent to lawson and puzzled him two or three times during the summer he had openly though jocularly alluded to their marriage but she had put him off with a keen word now that her father seemed intolerable she listened to him with a new interest he became a definite possibilitya refuge  encouraged by this slight change in her attitude towards him lawson took a ring from his pocket one night and said i wish youd wear this elsie bee bee  she drew back i cant do that im not ready to promise anything yet  it neednt bind you he pleaded it neednt mean any more than you care to have it mean but i think our understanding justifies a ring  thats just it she answered quickly i dont like you to be so solemn about our understanding you promised to let me think it all out in my own way and in my own time  i know i didand i mean to do so onlyhe smiled with a wistful look at heri would have you observe that i have developed three gray hairs over my ears  she took the ring slowly and as she put the tip of her finger into it a slight premonitory shudder passed over her  you are sure you understandthis is no binding promise on my part  it will leave you as free as before  then i will wear it she said and slipped it to its place it is a beautiful ring  he bent and kissed her fingers and a beautiful hand elsie bee bee  now lying alone in the soundless deep of the night she went over that scene and the one through which she had just passed hes a dear good fellow and i love himbut not like that and the thought that it was all over between them and the decision irrevocably made was at once a pain and a pleasure the promise slight as it was had been a burden now i am absolutely free she said in swift exultant rebound     xix  the sheriffs mob   the next day was cloudless with a south wind and the little crawling brook which watered the agency seemed about to seethe the lower foothills were already sere as autumn and the ponies came down to their drinkingplaces unnaturally thirsty and the cattle wallowing in the creekbed seemed at times to almost stop its flow the timid trees which curtis had planted around the schoolhouse and office were plainly suffering for lack of moisture and the little gardens which the indians had once more been induced to plant were in sore distress  the torrid sun beat down into the valley from the unclouded sky so fiercely that the idle young men of the reservation postponed their horseracing till after sunset curtis felt the heat and dust very keenly on his guests account and was irritated over the assaults of the cattlemen if they had but kept the peace we would still be in the cool sweet hills he said to lawson  this will not last lawson replied well get a mountain wind tonight the girls are wisely keeping within doors and are not yet aware of the extreme heat  i hope you are a true prophet but at this moment it seems as if no cool wind could arise out of this sunbaked land  any news from the willow  the trouble was in the west fort some cowboys raided a camp of tetongs no one was injured and so it must pass for a joke  some of those jokes will set something afire some of these hot days  but you know how hard it is to apprehend the ruffians they come and go in the night like wolves they spoiled our outing but i hope we may get away again next week  in the days which followed curtis saw little of elsie and when they met she seemed cold and preoccupied in conversation she seemed listening to another voice appeared to be pondering some abstract subject and curtis was puzzled and vaguely saddened jennie took a far less serious view of the estrangement its just a mood weve set her thinking shes under conviction as the revivalists used to say dont bother her and shell come through  curtis was at lunch on wednesday when wilson came to the door and said major streeter and a man named jenks are here and want to see you  more stolen cattle to be charged up to the indians i suppose  i reckon some such complaintthey didnt say  well tell them to waitor noask them to come over and lunch with me  wilson soon returned they are very glum and say theyll wait at the office till you come  as they prefer i will have finished in a few moments  he concluded not to hasten however and the ranchers had plenty of time to become impatient they met him darkly  we want a word in private major said jenks a tall longbearded man of most portentous gravity  curtis led the way to an inner office and offered them seats which they took in the same oppressive silence  the agent briskly opened the hearing what can i do for you gentlemen  jenks looked at streeterstreeter nodded go ahead hank  jenks leaned over aggressively your damned injuns have murdered one o my herders  curtis hardened what makes you think so he sharply asked  he disappeared more than a week ago and no one has heard of him since i know he has been killed and your injuns done it no one  wait a moment interrupted curtis who was he  his name is colehe was herdin my sheep  are you a sheepman  i am  where do you live  my sheep ranch is over on horned toad creek  where was this man when he disappeared  jenks grew a little uneasy he was camped by the mud spring  curtis rose and called wilson in wilson where is the mud spring  just inside our south line about four miles from the school  i thought so replied curtis your sheep were on the reservation are you sure this man was murdered  him and the dog disappeared together and haint neither of em been seen since  how long ago was this  just a week tomorrow  have you made a search for him have you studied the ground closely  streeter interposed weve done all that could be done in that line i know hes killed he told cal about two weeks ago that he had been shot at twice and expected to get wiped out before the summer was over there isnt a particle of doubt in my mind about it the thing for you to do is to make a demand  i am not in need of instructions as to my duty interrupted curtis wilson who is over from the willow creek  old elk himself  send him in i shall take all means to help you find this herder curtis said to the ranchers but i cannot allow you to charge my people with his death without greater reason than at present we must move calmly and without heat in this matter murder is a serious charge to make without ample proof  the elk smiling and serene entered the door and stood for a moment searching the countenances of the white men his face grew grave as the swift signs of his agent filled his mind with the story of the disappearance of the herder  i am sorry it is bad business he said  now crawling elk i want you to call together five or six of your best trailers and go with these men to the place where the herder was last seen and see if you can find any trace of him then turning to streeter he said you know crawling elk he is the one chief against whom you have no enmity if cole was murdered his body will be found until you have more proof of his death i must ask you to give my people the benefit of the doubt goodday gentlemen  as they turned to go two young reds were seen leaving the window they had watched curtis as he signed the story to crawling elk as the white men emerged these young fellows were leaning lazily on the fence betraying no interest and very little animation but a few minutes later they were mounted and riding up the valley at full gallop heavy with news of the herders death and streeters threats  now elk signed curtis say nothing to any one but your young men and the captain of police whom i will send with you to bring me word  after they had all ridden away curtis turned to wilson and said i didnt suppose i should live to see a sheepman and a cattleman riding side by side in this amicable fashion  oh theyll get together against the indian all right theyre mighty glad of a chance to make any kind of common cause that lazy herder has jumped the country he told me he was sick of his job  but the dog  oh he killed the dog to keep him from being traced there isnt a thing in it major  im inclined to think youre right but we must make careful investigation the people are very censorious of my policy  next morning crawling elk brought word that no trace of the man could be found the grass is very dry he explained and the trail is old we discovered nothing except some horses hoofmarks  keep searching till every foot of land is covered commanded curtis otherwise the white man will complain  on friday just after the bell had called the people to resume work at one oclock crow the police captain rode into the yard on a pony covered with ridges of dried sweat his face was impassive but his eyes glittered as he lifted his hand and signed  the white mans body is found  where asked curtis from the doorway  on the high ground near the spring he has three bulletholes in him three cartridgeshells were found where the horses hoofmarks were the ones who shot dismounted there and fired over a little knoll there are many white men over there now they are very angry they are coming here  be silent come in here once within the office curtis drew from crow wing all he knew he was just in the midst of giving his orders when wilson opened the door and said quietly though his voice had a tremulous intensity  major step here a moment  curtis went to the door he could not restrain a smile even while a cold chill went to his heart nothing could exceed the suddenness of the change which had swept over the agency as he had stood in the office door ten minutes before his ears had been filled with the clinkclank of the blacksmiths hammers the shouts of drivers and the low laughter of young women on their way to the store cranes voice was hitching up his team while lost legs and turkey tail were climbing to the roof of the warehouse with pots of red paint peter wolf was mending a mowingmachine and his brother robert was cutting wood behind the agency kitchen all about he had observed groups of whiteblanketed indians smoking cigarettes in the shade of the buildings while a crowd of nearly twenty others stood watching a game of duckontherock before the agency store  now as he looked over the yards not a redman could be seen at his work on every side the people without apparent haste but surely steadily and swiftly were scattering the anvil no longer cried out the teamsters were silent all laughter had ceased the pots of paint sat scorching in the sun there was something fiercely ominous as well as uncanny in this sudden silent dispersion of a busy merry throng and curtis skilled in indian signs appreciated to the full the distrust of the white man here expressed he understood this panic the settlers had long threatened war now the pretext had come and the sound of guns was about to begin  wilson said curtis calmly if the settlers fire a shot they will regret it see cranes voice if you can find him and send him to me he turned to crow and signed go tell your people i will not let the cowboys hurt them hurry call them all back tell them to go to work i will call the soldiers if necessary to keep the white man away there is no danger  crow was a brave and loyal man and weary as he was hastened to carry out his orders the call for assembly was rung on the signalbell and a few of the red employés responded to them curtis spoke reassuringly but his words were belied by thomas big voice the official interpreter who was so scared his knees shook  curtis sent wilson to quiet the teachers and hurried immediately to the studio where elsie was at work painting a portrait of old chief black bull the old man sprang to his feet the instant he caught sight of his agents face  friend what is the matter he asked  to elsie curtis said do not be alarmed  there is no danger he signed to black bull the white mans body has been found near the spring he was shot by two men with horses the white men are coming to see me about it but there is no need of alarm tell your people to go quietly to their camps i will protect them  the old chiefs face grew sterner as he flung his blanket over his arm i go to see he said the white men are very angry  wait called curtis keep your people quiet right where they are you must help me i depend on you you must not alarm them  i will do as you command bull replied as he went away but it was plain he apprehended violence  what is the matter inquired elsie  the settlers have discovered the body of the herder who was killed and crow brings word they are angry i dont think there is any danger but i wish you and jennie were at the fort for a few days i dont like to have you disturbed by these things  it was their first meeting alone since their return from the campingtrip but elsie was too much concerned with the serious expression of his face to feel any embarrassment  you dont think there will be trouble  no only a distracting wrangle which may prevent your getting models the indians are nervous and are even now getting out for the hills but i hope you will not be alarmed  im not a nervous person  i know youre notthat is the reason i dared to come and tell you what was going on i deeply regret  wilson rapped on the door major you are needed bowlegs reports two bodies of armed men riding up the valley the dust of their horses hoofs can be seen there are at least twenty men in the two squads wilson continued one came across from the west fork the other came from the south it looks like a prearranged invasion  very well wilson ill be at the office in time to meet them  curtis turned on elsie a look which went to her heart his voice was low as he said let me take you over to jennie i presume these men are coming to make a demand on me for the murderers they may or may not know who the guilty ones are but their coming in force by prearrangement has alarmed the people  as she laid down her brushes and took up her hat she said gleefully father wont be able to ask me what i know about warwill he will they begin shooting at once  i dont think they are likely to do anything as a body but some reckless cowboy may do violence to some tetong which will rouse the tribe to retaliation the settlers have too much sense to incite an outbreak at the door he said i wish you would go to jennie tell her not to get excited i will let you know what it is all about as soon as i find out myself it may be all a mistake  as he was crossing the road lawson joined him and when they reached the gate before the office several of the invaders had dismounted and were waiting the agents coming there were eleven of them all were deeply excited and two or three of the younger men were observably drunk and reckless streeter stepping forward introduced a short sullenfaced man as sheriff winters of pinon county  what name said curtis as he shook hands pleasantly  sheriff winters repeated streeter  what is the meaning of all this queried curtis  we have come for the man that killed ed cole we are a committee appointed by a convention of three hundred citizens who are holding an inquest over the body said winters we have come for the murderer  do you know who committed the murder  no but we know it was an injun  how do you know it they hesitated do you come as an officer of the law have you a warrant  no i have not but we are determined  then i deny your right to be here your coming is an armed invasion of federal territory said curtis and his voice rang like steel  here comes the other fellers called some one in the crowd turning his head curtis saw another squad of men filing down over the hill from the north he counted them and made out fifteen turning sharply to the sheriff he asked who are those men  i dont know  are you responsible for their coming  no sir i am not the sheriff replied plainly on the defence  as the second squad came galloping up the sheriffs party greeted them with nods and low words curtis heard one man ask wheres charley i thought he was coming and became perfectly certain that this meeting had been prearranged the newcomers mingled with the sheriffs party quite indistinguishably and made no further explanation of their presence  the young officer burned hot with indignation sheriff winters order these men to retire at once they have no business here  a mutter of rage ran over the mob and several hands dropped ostentatiously upon pistols  one loudvoiced young whelp called out an insulting word you go to  well retire when we get an injun not before  shut up you fool called the sheriff and turning to jenks began to mutter in consultation curtis advanced a step and raising his voice addressed the entire mob  as commander of this reservation i order you to withdraw your presence here is unlawful and menacing retire to the boundary of the reservation and i will use every effort to discover the murderer if he is in the tribe i will find him and deliver him to the county authorities  at this one of the same young ruffians who had challenged him before spurred his horse close to curtis and with his pistol in his hand shouted not by a d sight we come to take it out o these thieves and were goin to do it go ahead winterssay the word and well clean out the whole tribe  curtis looked the youth in the eye my boy i advise you to make war slowly even with your mouth  calvin streeter with his teeth clinched crowded his horse forward and struck the insolent hoodlum in the face with his hat shut up or ill pinch your neck off think youre sheriff the belligerent retired snarling wild curses  curtis addressed himself again to winters assuming a tone of respect and confidence which he did not feel mr winters you are here as a representative of the courts of pinon county i call upon you as sheriff to disperse all these men who are here without warrant of law  the sheriff hesitated for the cattlemen were now furious and eager to display their valor many of them were of the roughest types of cowboys the profane and reckless renegades of older communities and being burdened with ammunition and foolhardy with drink they were in no mood to turn tail and ride away they savagely blustered flourishing their revolvers recklessly  the sheriff attempted to silence them and said petulantly to curtis if i hadnt come youd a had a mob of two hundred armed men instead of twenty i had hard work to keep em back i swore in these ten men as my deputies this second crowd i dont know anything about they just happen to be here  curtis knew this to be a lie but proceeded to cajole the sheriff by recognizing him and his authority  in that case i shall act addressing the leader of the second party he said sheriff winters is the legal representative of the county you are an unlawful mob and i once more command you to leave the reservation which is federal territory under my command  no you dont we stay right here shouted several  well see whether the people of this state have any rights or not said jenks deeply excited we wont allow you to shield your murdering redskins under such a plea well be judge and jury in this case  curtis turned sharply to the sheriff officer do your duty dispose of this mob his tone was magnificently commanding i shall hold you responsible for further trouble said curtis turning a long look on winters which stung  the sheriff angrily addressed the crowd get out o this boys youre twisting me all up and doing no good vamoose now ive got all the help i need im just as much obliged but youd better clear out then to his deputies round em up boys and send em away  calvins face wore a smile of wicked glee as he called out  now you fellers git and spurring his horse into their midst he hustled them hunt your holes youre more bother than you are worth git out o here  while the sheriff and his deputies alternately pleaded and commanded the mob to withdraw lawson touched curtis on the arm and pointed to the crests of the hills to the west on every smooth peak a mounted sentinel stood silent and motionless as a figure on a monumentwatching the struggle going on before the agency gate  behind every hill young warriors are riding said lawson by sundown every man and boy will be armed and ready for battle if these noble citizens knew what you have saved them from they would bless you  the mob of cattlemen retreated slowly with many fierce oaths and a jangle of loud debate which curtis feared each moment might break into a crackle of pistol shots  that was a good stroke said lawson it sets up division and so weakens them you will be able to handle the sheriff now     xx  feminine strategy   having seen the horsemen ride away jennie and elsie came across the road tense with excitement  tell us all about it have they gone  who are they  we hope they are gone curtis replied as lightly as he could it was the sheriff of pinon county and a lynching party i have persuaded one mob to drive away the other they were less dangerous than they seemed  see those heads exclaimed lawson pointing out several employés who were peering cautiously over roofs and around corners not one has retained his hat he added if the danger sharpens off will come their shirts and trousers and those belligerent white men will find themselves contending with six hundred of the best fighters in the world  we must temporize said curtis a single shot now would be disaster he checked himself there but lawson understood as well as he the situation  jennie was not yet satisfied has the sheriff come for some one in particular  no he has no warrant hasnt even a clew to the murder he is really at the lead of a lynching party himself and has no more right to be here than the men he is driving away  what ought he to do asked elsie  he should go home it is my business as agent to make the arrest i have only a halfdozen police and i dare not attempt to force him and his party to leave the reservation  the whole situation is this explained lawson theyve made this inquest the occasion for bringing all the hotheaded fools of the country together and this is a bluff which they think will intimidate the indians  they wouldnt dare to begin shooting would they asked elsie  you cant tell what such civilized persons will do said lawson but curtis has the sheriff thinking and the worst of it is over  here they come again exclaimed wilson who surprised curtis by remaining cool and watchful through this first mutiny  at a swift gallop the sheriff and his posse came whirling back up the roada wild and warlike squadhardly more tractable than the redoubtables they had rounded up and thrown down the valley  i think you had better go in said curtis to elsie jennie take her back to the house for a little while  no let us stay cried elsie i want to see this sheriff myself if we hear the talk well be less nervous  curtis was firm this is no place for you these cowboys have no respect for god man or devil please go in  jennie started to obey but elsie obstinately held her ground  i will not i have the right to know what is threatening me i always hated to go below in a storm  in a cloud of dustwith snorting of excited horses the posse with the sheriff at its head again pulled up at the gate the young men stared at the two daintily dressed girls with eyes of stupefaction here was an unlookedfor complication a new element had entered the controversy the sheriff slid from his horse and gave a rude salute with his big brown fist  howdy ladies howdy it was plain he was deeply embarrassed by this turn of affairs  elsie seized curtis by the arm and whispered introduce me to himquick tell him who i am  curtis instantly apprehended her plan sheriff winters this is miss brisbane daughter of exsenator brisbane of washington  the sheriff awkwardly seized her small hand pleased to make your acquaintance miss he said i know the senator well  curtis turned to jennie who came forwardand this is my sister  ive heard of you the sheriff said regaining his selfpossession im sorry to disturb you ladies  elsie looked at him and quietly said i hope you will not be hasty sheriff my father will not sanction violence  youre being here makes a difference missof coursei  jennie spoke up you must be hungry mr sheriff she said and smiling up at calvin added and so are your men why not picket your horses and have some lunch with us  curtis took advantage of the hesitation thats the reasonable thing men we can discuss measures at our ease  the cowboys looked at each other with significant glances several began to dust themselves and to slyly swab their faces with their gay kerchiefs and one or two became noticeably redder about the ears as they looked down at their horses bridles  calvin broke the silence i dont let this chance slip boys im powerful keen myself  som i echoed several others  the sheriff coughed wellreallyim agreeable but im afeerd itll be a powerful sight o trouble miss  oh no let us attend to that cried jennie we shall expect you in fifteen minutes and taking elsie by the arm she started across the road  as the cowboys followed the graceful retreating figures of the girls lawson and curtis looked at each other with eyes of amazement lawson acknowledged a mighty impulse to laugh how unmilitary he muttered  but how effective replied curtis his lips twitching  the cowboys muttered among themselves say is this a dream  who said porkandbeans  does my necktie kiver my collarbutton asked a third  come boys called curtis cheerily while the sheriff and i have a little setto you water your ponies and dust off and be ready for cold potatoes youre a little late for a square meal but i think we can ease your pangs  with a patter of jocose remarks the cowboys rode off down towards the creek taking the sheriffs horse along with them  curtis turned to lawson i wish youd bring that code over to the house lawson i want to show that special clause to the sheriff  turning to winters he said come lets go across to my library and talk our differences over in comfort  the sheriff dusted his trousers with the broad of his hand well now im in no condition to sit down with ladies  ill give you a chance to clean up replied curtis who plainly saw that the girls had the rough bordermen on the ice and going as calvin would say a man can brag and swear and bluster out of doors or in a bare tobaccostained office but in a library surrounded by books in the hearing of ladies he is more humanmore reasonable jennies invitation had turned impending defeat to victory  curtis took winters into his own bedroom and put its toilet articles at his service and left him as the sheriff came out into the captains library five minutes later it was plain he had washed away a large part of his ferocity his hair plastered down smooth represented the change in his mental conditionhis quills were laid he was in fact fairly meek  curtis confidentially remarked in a low voice you see sheriff we must manage this thing quietly we mustnt endanger these women and especially miss brisbane if the old senator gets a notion his daughter is in danger  winters blew a whiff great god hed tear the state wide open no the boys were too hasty as i say i saw the irregularity but if i hadnt consented to lead a posse in here that whole inquest would have come arampin down on ye i said to em boys i says you cant do that kind of thing i says these tetongs are fighters i says and youll have a sweet time chasin em over the hillsjust go slow and learn to peddle i says  lawson entering with the code cut him short in his shameless exculpation and curtis said suavely mr winters i think you know mr lawson  weve crossed each others trail once or twice i believe said lawson here is the clause  curtis laid the book before the sheriff who pushed a stubby forefinger against the letters and read the paragraph laboriously his thick wits were moved by it and he said seems a clear case and yet the reservation is included in the lines of pinon county pears like the countyd ought o have some rights  well here comes the posse said curtis well talk it all over with them after lunch come in boys he called cheerily to the straggling herders who came in sheepishly one by one their spurs rattling their big limp hats twisted in their hands they had pounded the alkali from each others shirt and their red faces shone with the determined rubbing they had received all the wild grace of their horsemanship was gone and as they sidled in and squatted down along the wall they were anything but ferocious in manner or speech  ah now this is all right each man said when curtis offered chairs you take the chair jim you take it joethis suits me  lawson was interested in their cranial development and their alignment along the wall gave a fine opportunity for comparison they were for the most part shapeless and of small capacity he said afterwardsjust country bumpkins trained to the horse and the revolver but each of them arrogated to himself the judicial mind of the almighty creator  the sheriff leaning far back in the big morris chair wore a smirking smile which seemed to say boys im onto this luxury all right stuffed chair dont get me no backache nothings too rich for my bloodif i can get it  the young fellows were transfixed with awe of calvin for though the last to enter the house he walked calmly past the library door on into the diningroom and a moment later could be heard chatting with the girls sassy as a whiskeyjack  one big freckled young fellow nudged his neighbor and said wouldnt that pull your teeth that walleyed sorrel has waltzed right into the kitchen to buzz the women say his neck needs shortening  does he stand in or is it just gall  its nervenothing else we aint onto our job thats all  oh he knows em all right i heered he stands in with the agents sister  the hell he does lookin that way well i dont think its his brassbound cheek wait till we ketch him alone  cal appeared at the door well fellers come in grubs all spread out  what you got to say about it asked green  think youre the nigger that rings the bell dont ye remarked galvin were waitin for the boss to say when  not one of them stirred till curtis rose saying to the sheriff well well take time later to discuss that come right out and tame the wolf  the fact that curtis accepted calvins call impressed the crowd deeply  youd think he was one o the fambly muttered galvin wait till we get a rope round his neck  the table looking cool and dainty in its fleckless linen was set with plates of cold chicken and ham with pots of jelly and white bread at each end of the cloth beside big pitchers of cool milk to the cowboys accustomed only to their rude camps and the crude housekeeping of the settlers round about this dainty cleanliness of diningroom was marvellously subduing they shuffled into their seats noisily with only swift animallike glances at the girls who were bubbling over with the excitement of feeding this band of cossacks  as they drank their milk and fed great slices of bread and jelly into their mouths fighting indians seemed less necessary than they had supposed whiskey and alkali dust and the smell of sweating ponies were all forgotten in the quiet and sweetness of this pretty home the soft answer had turned wrath into shamefaced wonder and awkward courtesy  curtis sitting at the head of the board as host plied the sheriff with cold chicken discussing meanwhile the difficulties under which the tetongs labored and drew from that sorely beleaguered officer admissions which he afterwards regretted thats so i dont know as id do any better in their places but  jennie with a keen perception of her power over her guests went from one to the other inquiring in her sweetest voice wont you have another slice of bread please do  elsie less secure of manner followed her with the pitcher of milk while the young men bruised each others shins beneath the table in their zealous efforts to diminish the joy each one took in the alluring presence of his cupbearer  calvin sat near the end of the table and his assured manner made the others furious look at that stoatin bottle growled green out of the corner of his mouth he needs killin  ah well fix that tommycod replied galvin  while the girls were at the upper end of the table the man on calvins right leaned over and said  say cal pears like you got the run o the house here  calvin big with joy and pride replied oh i ride round and picket here once in a while it pays  well i should say yescarry all your cheek right with ye dont ye  as the boys began to shove back curtis brought out a box of cigars and passed them along the line  take hearty boys they dont belong to the government theyre mine and youll find them good  as they were all helping themselves the sheriff coughed loudly and called out boys the major and me has fixed this thing up i wont need but three of you the rest can ride back and tell the gang on the west fork its all right cal you and tom and green stay with me the rest of you can go as soon as your dinners settled  the ones not chosen looked a little disappointed but they made no protest as they rose to go out they all made powerful effort to do the right thing they lifted their eyes to the girls for a last glance and grumbled  much obliged ladies  and in this humble fashion the ferocious posse of the sheriff retreated from the house of their enemy  once outside they turned on each other with broad grins they straightenedtook on grace and security of manner again they were streaming with perspiration and their neckerchiefs were moist with the drip of it but they lit their cigars nonchalantly flung their hats rakishly on their heads and turned to take a last look at the house  elsie appeared at the door boys she called and her clear voice transfixed every soul of them you mustnt do anything reckless you wont will you  galvin alone was able to reply no miss we wont we wont do nothing to hurt you nor the majors sisteryou neednt be scart  you can trust captain curtis he will do what is right im sure of that goodbye  goodbye they answered one by one nothing further was said till they had crossed the road then one of the roughestlooking of the whole gang turned and said fellers that promise goes we got to keep that mob from goin to war while these girls are here aint that right  thats right  say fellers ill tell you a job that would suit me  haint got any work into it if it does  what is it  id like to be detailed to guard these queens from monkeys like you  the others fell upon this reckless one with their hats and gloves till he broke into a run and all disappeared down the road in a cloud of dust     xxi  in stormy councils   meanwhile the sentinels on the hills missed little of the movement in the valley they quivered with rage as the horsemen dismounted and entered the agents house for that seemed a defeat for their friend but when the strangers remounted and rode away all were reassured and two horns said i will go down and see what it all means  one by one the principal native employés reappeared cranes voice came out of the barn where he had lain with his eyes to a crack in the wall and peter bigvoice and robert wolf stepped cautiously into view from behind the slaughterpen old mary the cook suddenly blocked the kitchen doorway and with tremulous lips asked cowboys gone  yes all gone replied jennie much amused  good good replied the old woman  where have you been mary  her white teeth shone out in a sudden smile icehouseheap cold  what did you go in there for  cowboy no goodmebbe so shoot  they wont hurt you said jennie gently go to work again the captain will take care of you  little father no got guncowboy heap gun  little father dont need gun now you are all right jennie said and the old woman went to her work again though nervously alert to every sound  from nowhere in particular two sharpeyed lads sauntered up the road to play under the office window so that if any loud word should be spoken the tribe might know of it  jennie and elsie discussed the situation while sitting at the library window with a view of the agency front door  i cant for the life of me take a serious view of this episode said jennie these cowboys wouldnt be so foolish as to fire a first shot they are like big country schoolboys  the parkers cried elsie suddenly where are the parkers  jennie gasped true enough i had forgotten all about them i dont believe they have got back from their ride  they will be scared blue we must send for them  ill have cranes voice go at once said jennie i will go with him  dont do thatnot without letting the captain know how far is it  just over the hillnot more than five miles  but even as she was hurrying across to the corral to find an angel for this mission of mercy she saw the parkers coming down the hillside moving slowly for both were very bad riders it was plain they had heard nothing and as she watched them approach jennie cried  dont say a word they wont see anything suspicious  there was something irresistibly funny in the calm stateliness of the blond parker as he led the way past the store which was deserted of its patrons past the schoolhouse where the students were quivering with excitement and close beside the office behind whose doors curtis was still in legal battle with the sheriff  jennie met her visitors at the gate her hands clinched in the effort to control her laughter you are late are you hungry she asked  famished said parker i had to ride slow on mrs parkers account  i like that cried jennie as if any one could be a worse rider than you are  how do women get off anyway asked parker as he approached his wifes pony  fall off suggested jennie and this seemed so funny that she and elsie went off into simultaneous hysterical peals of laughter  you are easily amused remarked parker eying them keenly laugh on it is good for digestion excuse me from joining i havent anything to digest  putting his angular shoulder to mrs parkers waist he eased her to the ground awkwardly but tenderly upon facing the girls again and discovering them still in foolish mirth parker looked himself all over carefully then turned to his wife we seem to be affording these young ladies a great deal of hearty pleasure mrs parker  mrs parker was not so dense what is the matter she asked sharply what has happened this laughter is not naturalyou are both hysterical  both girls instantly became as grave as they had been hilarious a moment before  now i know something is wrong said mrs parker where is the captain what made you laugh that way have the savages broken out  jennie met parkers eyes fairly popping from his head and went off into another shout at last she paused and said breathlessly oh you are funny come into the house weve been entertaining a lynching partyall the indians are in the hills and the sheriffs in the office throttling the agent  while the parkers consumed their crusts of bread and scraps of cold meat jennie told them what had happened  parker rose to the occasion we must get out o hereevery one of us we should never have come in here your brother is to blame he deceived us  he did not replied jennie you shall not hold him responsible  he knew the situation was critical parker hotly retorted he knew an outbreak was likely it was criminal on his part  jerome parker you are a donkey remarked elsie calmly nothing has really happened if youre so nervous go home you cant sculp an indian anywaygrasshoppers and sheep are in your line she had reverted to the plain talk of the studios your nervousness amused us for a while but it bores us now please shut up and run away if you are afraid  youre not very nice said mrs parker severely  i dont think its very manly of your husband when he begins to blame captain curtis for an invasion of cowboys  you admitted you were scared pursued parker  well suppose we were we didnt weep and complain we set to work to tide over the crisis  jennie put in a word if youd feel safer in the camp of the enemy mr parker well set you down the valley with the settlers i intend to stay right here with my brother  so do i added elsie if there is danger it is safer here than with the cowboys but the mob is gone and the captain and osborne will see that we are protected  meanwhile the office resounded with the furious argument of the sheriff the whole western part of the state is disgusted with the way in which these indians escape arrest they commit all kinds of depredations and not one is punished this has got to stop we intend to learn this tribe it cant hide thieves and murderers any longer he ended blustering like a northwest wind  produce your warrants and ill secure the men replied curtis patiently you shall not punish a whole tribe on a pure assumption you must come to me with a proper warrant for a particular man and when you receive him from me you must prove his guilt in court as the case now stands you havent the slightest evidence that an indian killed this herder and i will not give over an innocent man to be lynched by you  as the sheriff stormed up and down the floor lawson said in a low voice delaydelay  curtis who had been writing a note slipped it to lawson who rose and went out of the door curtis continued to parley  i appreciate your feeling in this matter mr sheriff and i am willing to do what is right i have called a council of my head men tonight and i will ask them to search for the murderer an indian cannot keep a secret if one of the tetongs killed your herder he will tell of it i again suggest that you go back to your people and assure them of my willingness to aid in this affair give me three days in which to act  that crowd will not be satisfied unless we bring an injun with us weve got to do that or theyll come rompin in here and raise hell with you i propose to take old crawling elk himself and hold him till the tribe  if you attempt such a crime i will put you off the reservation replied curtis sharply  put me off by  i think i see you doing that why the whole state would rise and wipe you and your tribe out of existence he turned threateningly and towered over curtis who was seated  be quiet and keep your distance or ill put you in irons sit down  these words were not spoken loudly but they caused the sheriffs face to blanch and his knees to tremble there was a terrifying set glare in the officers eyes as he went on  what do you suppose would be the consequences of firing upon a captain of the united states army in the discharge of his duty by a sheriff acting outside the law you have only three men out there and one of them is my friend and you know the quality of calvin streeter i am still in command of this reservation mr sheriff  lawson reentering at this moment curtis said ask streeter to come in will you mr lawson  calvin entered smilingly well whats the upshot he asked  it is this calvin the sheriff has no warrant for anybody not even for a suspect i have asked him to go back and wait till i can find some clew to the murderer do you consider that reasonable  it sounds fair admitted calvin growing grave  now the question of whether the state or county authority covers a federal reservation or not is too big a question for us to settle you see that calvin  calvin scratched his head it sure is too many fer me  now ill compromise in this case mr sheriff you discharge the rest of your deputies and send them away while you and calvin remain with me to attend a councilnot to arrest anybody but to convince yourself of my goodwill in the matter i will not permit you to be armed nor to arrest any of my indians until we know what we are doing when we secure evidence against any man i will arrest him myself and turn him over to you but i insist that you send away the men in the outer office  calvin spoke up i reckon the majors right sheriff how ye goin to arrest a man if you dont know who he is i reckon you better do as he says i aint alookin fer no fuss with the agent and the united states army only fifty miles off  the sheriff growled surlily all right but there aint no monkey business about this i get my man sooner or later you bet your heart on that as he went out into the general office and announced the agents demand green blurted out defiant phrases  ill be damned if i would nostick it out do why take old elk and hold him till the tribe produces the right manthats the way we always done before  the arguments of calvin could not be heard but at last he prevailed and the sullen deputies withdrew the sheriff scrawled a hasty note to the county attorney to explain his failure to bring his man and the three deputies went out to saddle up their cursing was forceful and varied but they went  parker seeing them come forth met them inquiring anxiously  well what do you think of the situation  green looked at him surlily you belong here  no im just a visitor  well you better get out quick as godll let ye  why what is going to happen  just this were goin to have the man that killed cole or well cut this whole tribe into strips thats all and they moved on cursing afresh  parker fell back aghast and watched them in silence as they saddled their horses and rode off he then hurried to the office wilson after going in to see his chief came back to say the major will see you in a moment hes sending out his police  a few moments afterwards six of the indian policemen came filing out looking tense and grave and a couple of minutes later curtis appeared  what is it parker  what is going on captain i am very anxious  you need not be weve reached a compromise wait a moment and i will go over to the house with you  when he reappeared lawson was with him nothing was said till they were well in the middle of the road then curtis remarked carelessly  you attended to that matter lawson  yes cranes voice is ten miles on his way  there go two dangerous messengers said curtis lifting his eyes to the hillside up which the sullen deputies were climbing  parker was importunatehe wished to understand the whole matter curtis became a little impatient i will explain presently he replied and nothing more was said till they entered the library which was filled with the women of the agency jennie had reassured them as best she could but they were eager to see the agent himself miss colson the kindergarten teacher was disposed to rush into his arms  curtis smiled round upon them whats all thisa council of war  miss colson seized the dramatic moment oh major are we in danger tell us what has happened  nothing much has happened since dinner i have persuaded the sheriff to discharge all his deputies except calvin and they are to remain over i have sent for the head man to come in and we are going to council tonight the trouble is practically over for the sheriff has given up the attempt to arrest elk as a hostage now go back to your work all of you you should not have left your children he added rather sternly to miss colson they need you now  the women went out at once and in a few minutes curtis was alone with the members of his own little circle now i have another story for you he said turning to elsie while i am sure the worst of the sheriffs work is over i realize that there are two hundred armed men over on the willow and that it is better to be on the safe side therefore i have sent to fort lincoln for troops cranes voice will reach there by sundownthe troops should arrive here by sunrise tomorrow meanwhile i will talk with elk  suppose elk dont come asked jennie  curtis looked grave in that case i shall go to find him  elsie cried out you wouldnt do that  yes it would be my dutyi have promisedbut he will come he trusts me i have ordered him to bring all his people and camp as usual just above the agency store now of course no one can tell the precise outcome of all this and if you miss brisbane and mr and mrs parker want to go down to the white settlement i will send you at once mr lawson will go with you or i will ask the sheriff to take you  the safest place on the reservation is right here said lawson suppose the ranchers returnthey will take control here and use the agency as a base of supplies the fighting will take place in the hills besides our going would excite the settlers uselessly and put captain curtis deeper into trouble i propose that we stay right here and convince the employés and the indians that we are not alarmed i dont want to assume the responsibility of a panic and our going this afternoon might precipitate one  curtis was profoundly grateful to lawson for this firm statement i think you are right mr lawson he said formally you see my position clearly i feel sure i can control the sheriff by peaceable meansand yet my responsibility to you weighs upon me he looked at elsie again i think you can trust me will you stay  of course we will stay she replied and parker sank into his chair as if resigned to his fate  curtis went on i am not speaking to reassure myself perhaps i am too positive but my experience as an officer in the army has given me a contempt for these sixshooter heroes the thing i really fear is a panic among the settlers naturally i am disinclined towards the notoriety i would gain in the press but the troops will certainly be here tomorrow and that will settle the turmoil the sheriff is less of an embarrassment now that he has only calvin as deputy  send the sheriff over herewell entertain him by showing him the photograph album called jennie we helped out this forenoon and we can do it again  i dont think such heroic methods are necessary an extra good dinner will do quite as well replied curtis smiling im sorry mr parker that your expedition for material is coming to this grewsome end  elsie interposed it is precisely what he wants he will know from positive knowledge how a tetong brave dresses for war i have always claimed that no indian ever wore that absurd warbonnet  lawson added and you will gain valuable information as to the character of white settlers and indian outbreaks  i ought to telegraph papa  i have already done so replied lawsonin anticipation of the hullabaloo that will break forth in the papers of the state tomorrow  i shall wire the department a full statement tonight said curtis but we must be careful what we say at this point  isnt it a foolish thing not to have a telegraph line connecting the fort and the agency cried jennie the troops could have been halfway here by this time  its the same pennywise and poundfoolish method by which the indian service is run responded lawson  here comes one of my scouts said curtis as a young tetong galloped up to the gate threw himself from his reeking pony and strode into the hallway without knocking his spurs clattering his quirt dangling from his wrist as he stood before his chief delivering his message with shadowy silence and swiftness elsie thrilled with the dramatic significance of the scene the stern almost haughty face of the young man was in keeping with his duties  curtis dismissed the boy and translated his message he says the settlers below us have fled towards pinon city taking all their goods with them white wolfs band are all in camp except the young men who are scouting for the chiefs to see what it all means that mob of cowboys took delight no doubt in scattering consternation as they passed the settlers are in stampede  wilson is coming across the street said jennie and has an indian with him  another scout said curtis now i will let you know all that goes on but i must ask you all except mr lawson to leave me the library to transact this business in as elsie passed him she drew towards him with a little shrinking movement which moved him deeply it was as though she were clutched by a force greater than her will  its like being at army headquarters she said to jennie  it is a little like a commanders tent in the field i wish we dared to throw that old sheriff off the reservation he has no right to be snooping round here  parker slumped deep in a big rocker and mrs parker sat beside him and put her hand on his arm  dont worry about me jerome  he looked up gloomily i got you into this dearest and i must get you out if the soldiers come tomorrow i will ask for an escort to the fort and then we can reach the railway and get out of the cursed country id as soon live in a den of hyenas and rattlesnakes  elsie laughed parker you are too amusing you are pathetic when i think of you as you pranced about the campfire two days ago and look upon you now my heart aches for you  i dont think it generous of you to make fun of us at this time bee bee mrs parker replied reproachfully  oh let her go on her latin quarter english doesnt disturb me parker answered savagely  curtis at this moment appeared my message was from the farmer at willow spring he says all his employés with one or two exceptions have disappeared that the band of crawling elk was threatened by a mob of white men early this morning and that they are all breaking camp in order to flee to the hills all the settlers on the willow are hurrying their women and children down towards pinon city the whole country has been alarmed by the menace of the coroners inquest which is camped below the agency at johnsons ranch waiting the sheriffs return the deputies had not reached there when this letter was written added curtis the sheriffs message will disperse the crowds and i am sending a note of reassurance to the farmers and to the settlers  its getting mighty serious dont you think so asked parker i wish the troops were here cant we hurry them up  no all that can be done has been done i am telling you all that goes on and i must request you not to repeat it i wish you would all be specially guarded in the presence of the sheriff you might engage him in a game of cinch after dinner anything to keep him out of my way  well absorb him said jennie  one by one curtis called in his most trusted employés and quieting their fears put them to their duties special policemen were uniformed and sent to carry messages to the encampments on the hills asking the head men of each band to come at once to the agency for council and to order their people into camp the tranquillizing effect of the agents bearing made itself felt immediately the threads of the whole tangle were soon in his hands and made straight and when he received the sheriff at six oclock he was confident and serene of bearing                                       two horns came down from the hills and at the agents order gathered his band close around his own tepee to camp until the trouble was ended together they made a tour of the village and curtis made it plain that he would protect them and that no more armed men would come among them to incite violence  they have turned back for fear of the little father and of washington said two horns to the old men and they were glad of his words  curtis was by no means at ease as he recalled the threats of the cattlemen the encroachments of their flocks the vicious assaults made on crow killer and yellow hand he divined a growing antagonism which could go but little further without producing war his mind dwelt on the hurrying figure of cranes voice much depended on him he saw him as he faced the sentry if he should fail to reach the colonel but he will not fail and troops will be instantly despatched  from these considerations he turned to the growing trust and confidence which elsie was displaying that movement towards him slight as it was and the softened look in her eyes quickened his breath as he allowed his inward self to muse on their meaning she was looking to him for protection and this attitude was not only new it was disturbing and the soldier found it necessary to put away his pipe and fall savagely upon some work to keep his mind from ranging too far afield     xxii  a council at night   the sheriff came to dinner rather shamefacedly but calvin being profoundly pleased was on his very best behavior this being deputy suits me to the ground said he to wilson as he rose in answer to the call to dinner  as they were crossing the road he said confidentially now see here you mustnt talk politics round the ladies over there sheriff  politics  you know what i mean you keep to the weather and the crops and let this murder case alone for a minute or two or ill bat you one for luck  winters took this threat as a sign of their good understanding and remarked jocosely you damned young cub id break you in two for a leather cent  thats all right but what i say goes replied calvin and remembering old joe streeters political pull the sheriff did not reply  jennie kept the talk pleasantly inconsequential during dinner by a cheery tale of the doings of a certain chinaman she had once tried to train into a cook and calvin laughing heartily matched her experience with that of his mother while keeping house in pinon city one winter this left elsie to a little conversation with curtis  you must let me see this council tonight she said and her request had the note of a command  i know how you feel he said and i wish i could do so but i cant make an exception in your favor without offending the parkers  are you not the general she asked smilingly if you see fit to invite me and leave them out they can only complain im going to stay here with jennie anyhow  in that case we can manage it  do you know what i think youve instigated this whole affair to convert me to your point of view really the whole thing is like a play im not a bit frightenedat least not yet its precisely like sitting in a private box and seeing the wolves tear holes in davy crocketts cabin you are the manager of the show  well why not when the princess tours the provinces it is customary to present historical pageants in her honor this drama is your due and as he spoke he observed for the first time the absence of the ring from her significant finger the shock threw him into a moments swift surmise and when he looked up at her she was flushed and uneasy she recovered herself first and though her hand remained on the table it had the tremulous action of a frightened small animalobserved yet daring not to seek cover  i hope this council tonight will not fail i am eager to see what you will do with them she hastened to say  they will come he replied  calvin was relating a story of a mountainlion he had once treed for an eastern artist to photograph  just then the dern brute jumped right plum onto the feller and knocked him down machine and all for a minute or two it was just a mixture o man and lion then that feller come up top and the next thing i seen he batted the lion with his box and that kind o stunted the brute and he hit him again and glass began to fly he was game all right that feller was when the lion stiffened out he turned to where i was arollin on the pineneedles and says quietlike give me your revolver please i give it to him and he put it to the lions ear and finished him when he got up and looked at his machine he says how much is a mountainlion skin worth bout four dollars green i says he looked at the inwards of his box which was scattered all over the ground says he you wouldnt call that profitable would youa seventydollar instrument in exchange for a fourdollar pelt  everybody laughed at this story and the dinner came to an end with the sheriff in excellent temper lawson offered cigars and tolled him across the road to the office leaving curtis alone in his library  he resolutely set to work to present the situation of the sheriffs presence concisely to the department in a telegram and was still at work upon this when jennie entered the room closed the curtains and lit the lamp  elsie came in a little later to say sympathetically  are you tired captain curtis  he pushed his writing away  yes a little the worst of it is i keep saying if so and so happens then i must do thus and thus and that is the hardest work in the world i can deal with actual welldefined conditionseven riots and mobsbut fighting suppositions is like grappling with ghosts  i know what you mean she replied quickly but i want to ask youcould father be of any help if i telegraphed him to come  he sat up very straight as she spoke but did not reply till he turned her suggestion over in his mind noat least not now what troubles me is this the local papers will be filled with scareheads tomorrow morning your father will see them and will be alarmed about you  i will wire him that i am all right  you must do that i consider you are perfectly safe but at the same time your father will think you ought not to be here and blame me for allowing you to come in and worst of all he will wire you to come out  suppose i refuse to go would that be the best of all her face was distinctly arch of line  his heart responded to her lure but his words were measured as he answered sometimes the responsibility seems too great perhaps you would better go it will be hard to convince him that you are not in danger  she sobered there really is danger then  oh yes so long as these settlers are in their present mood i suppose there is nothing but the life of an injun will satisfy them their hate is racial in its bitterness  you think i ought to go then  he looked at her with eyes that were wistful and searching  yes it is a sad ending but perhaps captain maynard will be here tomorrow with a troop of cavalry andithink i must ask him to escort you to the railway  but the danger will be over then  to your father it will seem to be intensifying  i will not go on that account i feel that the safest place will be right here with you for your people love you i am not afraid when i am near you  curtis suddenly realized how dangerously sweet it was to sit in his own library with elsie in that mood seated opposite him the sound of a tapping on the window relieved the tension of the moment  another of my faithful boys he said rising quickly then turning to her with a tenderness almost solemn he added miss brisbane i hope you feel that if danger really threatened i would think of you first of all you will stay with jennie tonight  if you think best but we want to know all that goes on i cant bear to be battened down like passengers in a storm at sea there is nothing so trying to nerves i want to be on deck with the captain if the storm breaks  very well i promise not to leave you in ignorance and raising the curtain he signed to the man without to enter it was crow the captain of the police a short man with a goodhumored face now squared with serious dignity  two dog has just come in from willow creek he reported he says the cattlemen are still camped by johnsons ranch they all held a council this afternoon  are any of the head men here  yes they are all at my tepee they want to see you very bad  tell them to come over at once the council will take place here i want you but no more of the police i want only the head men of each band  after the officer went out curtis moved the easychairs to the back of the room and set plain ones in a semicircular row at the front hardly was he settled when elk grayman and two horns entered the room and after formally shaking hands took the seats assigned them their faces usually smiling were grave and graymans brow was knotted with lines of anxiety he was a small man with long brown hair braided and adorned with tufts of the fine feathers which grow under the eagles wings he was handsome and neatly dressed the direct antithesis to crawling elk who was tall and slovenly with a homely grandfatherly face deeply seamed with wrinkles a face that would be recognized as typical of his race he seemed far less concerned than some of the others  two horns also quite at his ease unrolled his pipe and began filling it while curtis resumed his writing  jennie looking in at the door recognized the chiefs and they all rose politely to greet her  im coming to the council she said to two horns  he smiled squaws no come councilno good  no no heap good she replied we come chiefs heap talkwe catchim coffee  good good he replied after council feast  one by one the other chiefs slipped in and took their places till all the bands were represented save that of red wolf who was too far away to be reached curtis then sent for the sheriff and calvin and elsie and lawson and when all were seated began his talk by addressing the chieftains he spoke in english in order that the sheriff could hear all that was said and lawson interpreted it into sioux  you know this young manhe pointed at calvin some of you know this manhe touched the sheriff he is the war chief of all the country beyond where grayman lives he comes to tell us that a herder has been killed over by the muddy spring he thinks it was done by an indian the white people are very angry and they say that you must find the murderer do you know of any one who has threatened to do this thing  one by one the chiefs replied i do not know who did this thing i have heard no one speak of it as a thing good to be done we are all sad  two horns added a protest i think it hard that a whole tribe should suffer because the white man thinks one redman has done a wrong thing  grayman spoke sadly my people have had much trouble because the cattlemen want to drive their herds up the willow and we are like men who guard the door on us the trouble falls it is our dutythe same as you should say to a policeman do not let anybody come in my house therefore we have been accused of killing the cattle and stealing things but this is not true i remembered your words and i did nothing to make these people angry but some of my young men threw stones to drive the sheep back and then the herder fired at them with revolver this was not our fault  he lies said the sheriff hotly when this was interpreted no one has fired a gun but his reckless young devils his men were riding down the sheep and the herder rocked em away  you admit the sheep were on the reservation then asked curtis  wellyestemporarily they were being watered  well we wont go into that now said curtis turning to the chiefs and speaking with great solemnity using the signlanguage at times and as he sat thus fronting the strongly wrought serious faces of his head men he was wholly admirable and elsies blood thrilled with excitement for she felt herself to be in the presence of primeval men  now grayman elk two horns standing elk lone man and crow listen to me among white men it is the law that when any one has done a wrong thingwhen he steals or murdershe is punished if he kills a man he is slain by the chief not by the relatives of the man who is slain as with you i am here to apply the white mans rule if a tetong has shot this herder he must suffer for ithe and no one else i will not permit the cattlemen to punish the tribe if you know who did this it is your duty to give him up to the law it is the command of the great fatherhe asks you to go back to your people and search hard to find who killed this white man when you find him bring him to me will you do this  no one answered but two horns who said ay we will do as you say and his solemnity of utterance attested his sincerity  listen to me said curtis again fixing their eyes with his dramatic action if my only brother had done this thing i would give him up to be punished i would not hesitate and i expect you to do the same  it is always thus standing elk broke out the cattlemen wish to punish all redmen for what one bad young warrior does we are weary of it  i know it has been so but it shall not be so again not while i am your chief curtis responded will you go home and do as i have commanded will you search hard and bring me word what you discover  one by one they muttered ay and curtis added heartily that is goodnow you may go  i want to say a word said the sheriff  not now replied curtis these people are in my charge whatever is said to them i will say and at his gesture they rose and crow standing elk and lone man went soberly out into the night  grayman approached curtis and took his hand in both of his and pressed it to his breast little father i have heard your words they are not easy to follow but they have entered my heart no white man has ever spoken to me with your tongue you do not lie your words are soft but they stand like rocksthey do not melt away my words shall be like yoursthey will not vanish like smoke what i have promised that i will fulfil as he spoke his slight frame trembled with the intensity of his emotion and his eyes were dim with tears and his deep sweet voice accompanying his gestures thrilled every soul in the room at the end he dropped the agents hand and hastened from the house like one afraid of himself  curtis turned to lawson to hide his own emotion mr lawson i assume the sheriff is as tired as the rest of us will you show him the bed you were kind enough to offer  sheriff winters if you will come with me ill pilot you to a couch it isnt downy but it will rest a tired man calvin you are to bunk alongside  all right professor calvin rose reluctantly and as he stood in the door he said in a low voice to jennie now if you want me any time just send for me  hold the sheriff levelthats what you do for us  ill see that he dont get gay he replied and his hearty confidence did them all good  after the sheriff and his deputy went out elsie said oh it was wonderful that old man who spoke last must be the edwin booth of the tribe he was superbly dramatic  he took my words very deeply to heart that was grayman one of the most intelligent of all my head men but he has had a great deal of trouble he comprehends all too much of the tragedy of his situation  elsie sat with her elbows on the table gazing in silence towards the empty fireplace she looked weary and sad  curtis checked himself i regret very deeply the worry and discomfort all this brings upon you  oh im not thinking of myself this time i am thinking of the hopeless task you have set yourself you cant solve this racial questionits too big and too complicated men are simply a kind of ferocious beast they go to work killing each other the way chickens eat grasshoppers  your figure is wrong if our christian settlers only killed indians to fill their stomachs theyd stop some time but they kill them because theyre like the boy about his mothertired of seeing em round  there was a time when elsies jests were frankly on the side of the strong against the weak but she was becoming oppressed with the suffering involved in the march of civilization what a fine face grayman has i couldnt help thinking how much more refined it was than winters as for the cowboys they were hulking schoolboys i was not a bit afraid of them after they were dismounted  unfortunately they are a kind of sixfooted beast always mounted there isnt a true frontiersman among them it angered me that they had the opportunity to even look at you  his intensity of gaze and the bitterness of his voice took away her breath for an instant and before she could reply jennie and lawson came in  lawson was smiling parker is righteously incensed he tried to enter the council an hour ago and your dusky minions stopped him he is genuinely alarmed now and only waiting for daylight to take flight  jerome is a goose said elsie  hes a jackass at times a man of talent but a bore when his yellow streak comes out turning to curtis he said very seriously is there anything i can do for you captain  you might wire your version of the disturbance to the secretary along with mine we can safely look for an avalanche of newspaper criticism and i would like to anticipate their outbreak  our telegrams will be at once made public  undoubtedly and for that reason we must use great care in their composition i have mine written please look it over  jennie who had dropped into a chair checked a yawn oh dear i wish it were morning  curtis looked at her and laughed i think you girls would better go to bed your eyes are heavylidded with weariness  arent you going to sleep asked jennie anxiously  i shall lie down here on the sofai must be where i can hear a tap on the window goodnight  both girls rose at his word and elsie said it seems cruel that you cannot go properly to bedafter such a wearisome day  you forget that i am a soldier he said and saluted as they passed he observed that lawson merely bowed when she said goodnight politely surely some change had come to their relationship  lawson turned i think i will turn in captain i have endorsed the telegram  it must go at once he tapped on the pane and almost instantly a tetong sleeping under the window rose from his blanket and stood with his face to the window alert and keeneyed tony i have a long ride for you  all right replied the faithful fellow cheerfully  i want you to take some letters to pinon city come round to the door  as he stepped into the light the messenger appeared to be a boy of twenty blackeyed and yellowskinned with thin and sensitive lips take the letters to the postoffice said curtis speaking slowly you understandand these despatches to the telegraphoffice  pay money  no pay can you go now  yes go now  very well take the best pony in the corral you better keep the trail and avoid the ranches goodnight  the young fellow put the letters away in the inside pocket of his blue coat buttoned it tightly and slipped out into the night and was swallowed up by the moonless darkness  arent you afraid they will do tony harm if they meet him  not in his uniform  i wouldnt want that ride well so long old man call me if i can be of any use  after lawson went out curtis sank back into his big chair and closed his eyes in deep thought as he forecast the enormous and tragic results of the return of that armed throng of reckless cattlemen he shuddered a war would almost destroy the tetongs it would nullify all he had been trying to do for them and would array the whole state the whole indianhating population of the nation against them jennie reentered softly and stood by his side its worrisome business being indian agent after all isnt it george she said with her hand in his hair  he forced himself to a cheerful tone of voice oh i dont know this is our first worry and it will soon be over it looks bad just now but it will be  a knock at the outer door startled them both that is a white manprobably barker he said and called come in  calvin streeter entered a little abashed at seeing jennie meeting curtiss look of inquiry he said with winning candor major i been astudyin on this thing a good eal and ive come to the conclusion that youre right on all these counts and ive concluded to ride over the hill and see if i cant argue the boys out of their notion to kill somebody  jennie clapped her hands good that is a splendid resolution i always knew you meant right  curtis held out his hand shake hands my boy there isnt a moment to be lost if they are coming at all they will start about sunrise i hope they have reconsidered the matter and broken camp  calvin looked a little uneasy well ill tell ye major im afraid them lahees that we sent back home will egg the rest on they sure were bilun mad but ill go and do what i can to head em off if i cant delay em ill come along with em but you can count on me to do any little job thatll help you after we get here goodnight  goodnight dont take any rest  oh im all right nobody aint huntin trouble with me  after he went out jennie said i call that the grace of god working in the soul of man  curtis looked at her keenly i call it the love of woman sanctifying the heart of a cowboy  she colored a little do we women go on the payrolls as assistant agents  not if we men can prevent it what kind of a report would it make if i were forced to say at this critical moment the charming miss soandso came to my aid and by inviting the men in to dinner with a sweet smile completely disarmed their hostility too much honor cannot be given etc  i guess if history were written by women once in a while those reports wouldnt be so rare as they are     xxiii  the return of the mob   curtis was awakened about four oclock by wilson at his window are you awake major  yes what is it  two of the scouts have just come in from the hills they are sure the ranchers are coming to make war bands of white men are crossing the county to join the camp it certainly looks owly major  curtis rose and went to the window the troops will be here by nine oclock at the furthest and the mob will not move till sunrise and cant reach here even by hard riding before eleven  shall i send a courier out to meet the troops and hurry them on asked wilson whose voice was untouched of fear  it might be well send two horns to me if you can find him keep silent as to these reports  all right major  curtis did not underestimate the dangers of the situation if the troops did not arrive and if the armed posse of the settlers should come and attempt to arrest elk war would follow that was certain meanwhile he was one days hard riding from either the fort or the telegraph line with the settlers between and no news could reach him for twentyfour hours  at that very moment the morning papers were being distributed bearing a burden of calumny the department would open his telegram in a few minutes but the secretarys reply could not reach him before sunset at the earliest and by that time i will be master of the situation or there will be war i must parleydelay them by any means till the troops arrive colonel daggett will forward the men at oncei hope under maynardand jack is no sluggard he will be here if only the colonel takes action  the sun rose as usual in a cloudless sky but the wind was again in the northwest and as he stood on the little porch looking up the valley he could see the smoke of the campfires in graymans camp and beyond him the crawling elk and his people occupied a larger circle of shining tepees the two villages seemed as peaceful as if the people were waiting for their rations but as he lifted his eyes to the hills he could see the mounted sentinels patiently waiting the coming of the sun and he knew that beyond and to the east every butte was similarly crested with spies these people of the wide spaces had their own signal service and were not to be taken unawares each movement of the enemy would be flashed from hill to hill miles in advance of the beat of their horses hoofs  as he was returning to his library elsie met him goodmorning captain did you sleep  oh yes indeed he spoke as lightly as he could but my messengers reporting disturbed me a little during the early morning  with bad news  oh no quite the contrary i think we are well out of our difficulty  im sure i hope so you look tired  im ashamed of it you must have slept wellyou are radiant i am sorry i cannot promise you the elk for a sitter today  i like him better as the leader of his people do we breakfast with the sheriff this morning  that affliction is bearing down upon us he replied he is even now moving morosely across the road i fear he is in bad temper  i think i will be late to breakfast in that case she said with a little grimace and fled  curtis greeted his guest pleasantly goodmorning sheriff  goodmorning major have you seen anything of my deputy  no has he left you  i didnt miss him till this morning replied winters sourly but hes gone horse and all  well the loss is not serious come in and break an egg with me  jennie was distinctly less cordial than before but she made her unwelcome guest comfortable and asked after his health politely she was just pouring his second cup of coffee when the furious clanging of the office bell made them all start  curtis looked at his watch good heavens it cant be the eightoclock bell what time have you  seven thirtythree  curtis sprang up its a signal of fire  at the word fire jennie turned white and rose elsie came flying downstairs crying  the indians are running  a wild shout arose stop that bell and a moment later wilson burst in at the doormajor the indians are signalling from the butteseverybody is taking to the hillsthe mob is coming  curtis gave elsie one piercing look i hope you will trust me you are in no danger even if this alarm is true i think it is a mistake i will return soon and let you know i beg you not to be alarmed  the alarum was true on the buttes horsemen were riding to and fro excitedly crossing and recrossing the same groundthe sign which means an approaching enemy on every hillside mounted warriors were gathering and circling boys with wild halloos were bringing in the ponies the women busy swarming like bees were dropping the tepees even as the agent mounted the steps to the office and looked up the valley the white canvases sank to the ground one by one as though melted by the hot sun war times were come again and the chanting cries of the old women came pulsing by on the soft west wind  a grim smile settled on the agents lips as he comprehended these preparations he knew the history of these people and admired them for their skill and their bravery war times were come again  our cowboy friends have set themselves a memorable task in trying to wipe out this tribe the ranchers never fight their own battles they always call upon the federal government and that is their purpose now to stir up strife and leave the troops to bear the burden of the war  i dont see our fellers said the sheriff who was deeply excited ill ride to meet them  they are a long way off yet said curtis the tetong sentinels have only signalled their start i hope the troops are on the way he said to the two girls who had followed and now stood close beside him as if for protection then he called to the sheriff who had started for his horse i depend on you to keep off this invasion sheriff i warn you and your men that this entrance here at this time is a crime against washington  winters did not reply and curtis knew that he would join the majority being a candidate for reelection he could not afford to run counter to the wishes of his constituents hastily mounting his horse he galloped furiously away  curtis strained his eyes down the valley hoping for a sight of the guidons of the th  what can you do asked elsie  nothing but await the issue he replied i have sent another courier to hasten the troops it is now a race between the forces of law and of order if the mob arrives first i must delay themprevent their advance if possible there is nothing else to be done  can we help  im afraid not there will be two or three hundred of the invaders this time if the sheriff is to be believed i am afraid to have you meet them i think it better for you all to keep within doors  i wish my father knewhe could stop this wailed elsie in sudden realization of her helplessness he could wire the authorities in pinon city i know they would listen to him  here come the parkers said jennie now look out for squalls  i had forgotten them said curtis with a comic look of dismay  parker was running half dragging his poor breathless wife while in their rear lawson appeared walking calmly quite irreproachable in a gray morning suit and the sight of him was a comfort to curtis for his forces were practically reduced to wilson and four or five clerks  now captain what are you going to do called parker you let us into this  being in no mood for squalls curtis cut parker short be quiet dont be uselessly foolish try and conduct yourself like a reasonable human being jennie go into the house and take the ladies with you youll have all the women of the agency to look after in a few minutes lawson i can depend on youwill you go over to the office with me  when they reached the office lawson threw back his coat and displayed two wickedlooking revolvers ive been known to fight when pushed too far he said smilingly  in the space of an hour the panic had become preparation on a low butte to the southwest a dark mass of armed and resolute warriors waited on their swift ponies ready for whatever came while behind them on a higher ridge a smaller group of dismounted chieftains sat in council up the slopes below and to the right the women and old men were leading the ponies laden with their tepees children and supplies precisely as in the olden times the wagons of the white men were of no use where they were now climbing the ways of the wheel were no longer desirable they sought the shelter of the trail  i am confident that the troops will arrive first said curtis  if the powers of evil have found a leader it will be hard to control them even with a troop of cavalry lawson replied soberly the sheriff will go with the mob when it comes to a show down  oh of course i do not count on him but calvin is loyal  before the office stood two or three of the white employés of the agency with their wives and children about them two policemen alone remained of all the throng of red employés usually to be seen about the yards the rest were out on duty or had joined their people in the hills  what shall we do cried miss colson a look of mortal terror on her face she crowded close to curtis and laid her hands on his arm let us stay near you  you are in no danger he replied those poor devils on the hillside are the ones who will suffer where are your children he asked sharply  they all disappeared like rabbits at sound of the bell only the kindergarten class remains  go and help take care of them he commanded sing to themamuse them wolf robe he called to one of the policemenhe of the bowlegsgo to the people on the hill and say to them to fear nothing washington protects them tell them they must not fight say to the mothers of the little ones that nothing shall hurt them go quick  wolf robe handed his sombrero his coat and his revolver to his friend beaver kill and ran away towards the corral agile as a boy  what did he do that for asked jennie  curtis smiled he is indian now he doesnt want to be mistaken for a cowboy  when he reappeared on his pony his long dark hair streaming a red handkerchief bound about his head he looked like a warrior stripped for battle there isnt a faithfuler man in the world said curtis and a lump rose in his throat he has been riding half the night for me but he charges that hill as if he were playing a game  i dont understand how you can trust them to do such things said elsie perhaps he will not come back how do you know he will do as you commanded  because that ugly little bowlegged tetong is a man replied curtis he would die in performance of his duty and something in his voice made the tears start to elsies eyes  the sentinels on the hills were quiet nowfacing the northeast motionless as weathervanes the camps had disappeared as if by magic nothing remained but a few wagons wolf robe diminishing to the value of a coyote was riding straight towards the retreating women even as curtis watched the chieftains on the higher hill rose and one of them started downward towards the warriors on the rounded hilltop then a small squad detached itself from the main command and slid down the grassy slope to meet the women as they rode slowly on the moving figures of those leading the camp horses gathered round them curtis understood some command was being shouted by the descending squad  separating themselves from the led ponies these scouts swept on down the hill directly upon the solitary and minute figure of wolf robe whose pony climbed slowly and in zigzag course  they will kill him said a woman  wolf robe halted and waited till the skirmishers rode up to him they massed round him closely listening while he delivered his message  when he returns we will know all that his people have learned of the invaders said curtis they will tell him what they have seen  it is strange exclaimed elsie in a low voice standing close beside him but im not afraid it is like a storya dream that i should stand here watching indians preparing for war and waiting for united states troops is incredible  i wish it were not true he replied but it is i have no fear of my people only of the rash act of a vicious white man  which way will the cattlemen come from asked jennie  probably down that trail he pointed to the northeast part of them may come up the valley road wolf robe has started on his return  the little squad of warriors returned to the group of chieftains while the loyal wolf robe came racing down the slope his hair streaming his elbows flapping in a few minutes he dropped rein at the gate and reentered the yard standing before his chief he delivered his message  their hearts are very glad at your good words but the women are crying for their babies they ask that you send them away before the bad white men come send them out towards the hills and they will come down and get themthis they said  what did the scouts say  they said that the sentinels on the hills saw the white men break camp and come this waymany of themso they say  where are they now  they are hidden in the pines of the valley they will soon be hereso they say  take a fresh pony and ride back and tell all who have children here to come down and talk with me tell them i will turn the white men away no one shall be harmed the children are safe there will be no war i will meet them in the old camp i keep repeating there is no danger because i believe it he said to the silent group around him after wolf robe rode away there is nothing to be done but wait so go about your duties he added with a note of command  one by one the employés dropped away till only wilson remained his only sign of nervousness was a quiver of the muscles of one cheek where he held his quid of tobacco his bright blue eyes were fixed on the sentinels while he leaned negligently against the fence lawson smoking a german pipe was watching the warriors on the hills a rapt expression on his face as if he were working out some problem in ethics which demanded complete concentration and absorption of thought the two girls had drawn close together as if for comfort their nerves aquiver with the strain  are you waiting for something to go off suddenly asked curtis  each one started a little and all laughed together  i think i was confessed elsie  you seemed to be holding your breath i wish youd both go in and rest he pleaded it is no use  theyre coming interrupted lawson  where where  the sentinels are signalling again  all turned to the east but nothing could be seenno smoke no dust no sign of horsemenyet the swift circling of the sentinels and the turmoil among the warriors on the butte indicated the menace of an approaching army another little band detached itself from the huddle of the camp and came down the hill slowly and in single file  the squaws are coming for their children even before wolf robe reaches them said lawson  and theres the mob said curtis and at his words a keen thrill of fear ran through the hearts of the women with set pale faces they looked away beneath levelled finger  thats right said wilson and two hundred strong  the sadcolored horsemen were pouring over a high pineclad ridge some two miles to the east and streaming down into a narrow valley behind a sharp intervening butte  now girls you must go in commanded curtis sharply you can do no good  george let us stay pleaded jennie we saved you yesterday and we may help today  what is the use of shutting us in the house im not afraid added elsie these men will do us no harm  i beg you will not interfere he said looking at jennie but elsie knew he included her as well it isnt a bit impressive to have an agent flanked with womenin a council of war  hang the looks theyre mighty effective sometimes remarked lawson  thats right chimed in wilson by the lord they look sassy he added referring back to the cowboys  they formed a sinister cavalcade as they came streaming down the rough road two and two like a monstrous swift serpent particolored sinuous silent save for the muffled clatter of their horses hoofs curtis nerved himself for the shock and though weakened and embarrassed by the presence of elsie and jennie he presented a soldierly breast to the mob had it been a question of protecting the women the case would have been different but to argue a point of law with them at his elbow exposed him to ridicule and to interruption  as the horsemen debouched upon the valley road a prodigious cloud of dust arose and sailed away on the wind completely hiding the rear ranks so that they could not be numbered as they drew near the sheriff could be seen riding at the head of the column side by side with a big man in a blue shirt they approached at a shacking trot which was more menacing than a gallop would have beenit was steady inexorable selfcontained as a charge of cavalry  as they reached the issuehouse curtis opened the gate and stepped out into the road and faced them alone and elsie grew cold with fear as the sheriff and his formidable following rode steadily up when almost upon the agent the leader turned and pushing his limp hat away from his eyes shouted  halt as the men pulled in their horses he added keep back there  the mob had found a leader and was organized for violence curtis with folded arms seemed small and weak as the army of invasion came to a stand filling the lane between the office and the agency house with trampling horses and cursing men  goodmorning growled the leader surlily were come for old elk and i want to say we get him this time no monkey business goes with old bill yarpe women cant fool me  calvin streeter rode out of the throng and pushed his way to the front  yarpe yelled hyar keep in line there  go to hell replied calvin as he rode past him im no nigger i want to hear what goes on and i tell ye right now you treat these people fair or youll hear from me  ill shoot you up a few if you aint keerful young feller replied the old ruffian  thats right general hes too fresh called some one  calvin spurred his horse alongside yarpes and looked him in the eye with a glare which made the older man wince you be decent before these women or ill cut the heart out o ye you hear me  curtis stepped forward careful streeterdont provoke trouble well protect the women  the sheriff rode between the two men cal git awayyoure my deputy remember  as cal reined his horse away curtis went to him and said in a low voice i appreciate your chivalry calvin but be careful dont excite them  as he looked into the big red whiskeybloated face of yarpe curtis was frankly dismayed the old ruffian was not only inflamed with liquor he was intoxicated with a subtler elixirthe pride of command as he looked back over his followers he visibly expanded and a savage glare lit up his eyes keep quiet boys ill settle this thing  curtis again stepped towards the sheriff what do you propose to do mr sheriff  yarpe broke in boisterously we want old elk bring him out or we go after him a chorus of applause followed  on what authority do you make this demand asked curtis facing yarpe  on the authority of the sheriff of pinon city replied yarpe and we come along to see he does his duty  the sheriff is present and can speak for himself he was my guest last night and made an agreement with me which as an honorable man he is disposed to keep  the sheriff avoided curtiss eye but yarpe replied  he showed the white feather he let you fool him but you cant fool this crowd bring on your injun or we go get him  have you a warrant  oh damn the warrant  the sheriff cleared his throat yes i have a warrant for crawling elk and grayman he said and began searching his pockets the decisive moment had arrived     xxiv  the grayhorse troop   curtis minutely studied the crowd which was made up very largely of reckless young mencowboys from all over the range together with the loafers and gamblers of the cowtowns the sheriffs deputies were all well to the front but were quiet they seemed to be a little abashed by the gaze of the women to whom they were indebted for their dinner of yesterday each member of the gang was burdened with ammunition and carried both rifle and revolver  the sheriff dismounted and handed a paper to curtis who took plenty of time to read it it was manifestly bogus manufactured for use as a bluff and had not been properly sworn out but to dispute it would be to anger the cattlemen there was only one chance for delay  very well he said at last this warrant calls for two of the head men among the tetongs of course i understand your motives you do not intend to charge these chiefs with the crime you only wish to force the tribe to yield some one else to your vengeance in face of such a force as this of yours mr sheriff i can only yield though i deny your right to lay hand on one of my charges i do all this under pressure if your men will retire a little i will call a messenger and communicate with the chiefs named and ask  yarpe glared communicate hell sheriff say the word and well go and get em  curtis fixed a calm gaze upon him you are a brave man mr yarpe but youll need all your resolution when you charge up that hill in the face of those desperate warriors as he swept his arm out towards the west all eyes were turned on the swarming mass of mounted tetongs the women had moved higher and were halted just on the eastern brow of the high ridge behind and to the right of the fighting men now what will you do mr sheriff pursued curtis act with me through the head men or make your demand of the whole tribe  a dispute arose among the crowd a few shouted noisily say the word and well sweep the greasy devils off the earth but the larger number like the sheriffs posse of the day before found it not easy to overawe this quiet soldier  calvin harangued the leader no i will not button my lip he shouted again confronting yarpe for you nor no other man you let the sheriff and the captain fix this thing up what are you in this thing for anyhow you dont own a foot of land nor a head o stock youre nothing but a bum you cant get trusted for a pound of tobacco nice man to lead a mob  shut him up bill shouted one fellow  cals right called another  dont let em fool ye bill we come fer a redskin and well have him or burn the town  calvin had a revolver in each hand and on his face was a look that meant war  curtis called to lawson take the women in quick he feared shooting among the leaders of the mob dont shoot calvin keep the peace  with tears of impotent rage filling her eyes elsie retreated towards the office under lawsons care curtis stepped to the side of the leader silence your gang he said  yarpe raised his bellowing voice keep quiet there ill settle this thing in a minute  keep back commanded the sheriff  the crowd fell back a little with calvin crowding them hard revolver in hand no more funny business with me he said and death blazed from his eyes get back  quiet having been restored the sheriff curtis and yarpe were revealed in animated argument curtis was talking against timeevery moment was precious  if you give in your chances for reelection aint worth a leatherette yarpe said to the sheriff  you crazy fool you wouldnt charge that hill asked the sheriff  thats what i would and thats what the boys come for  but what good would it do  it would learn these red devils a lesson they wouldnt forget and it would make you an me the most popular men in the county if you dont do it youre dead as the hinges of hell  if you charge that hill some of you will stay there put in curtis  yarpe turned and roared boys the sheriff has weakened will you follow me  we will shouted the reckless majority  at this precise moment while looking over the sheriffs head towards the pinonspotted hill to the west curtis caught the gleam of something white bobbing down the hill it disappeared but came into sight lower down a white globe based in a splash of blue it was a white helmet topping the uniform of a cavalry officer a sudden emotion seized curtis by the throathis heart warmed swelled big in his bosom oh the good old color now he could see the gauntleted gloves the broad shoulders the easy seat of blessed old jack maynard as he ambled peacefully across the flat  look there he cried turning to the group inside the gate his finger pointing like a pistol his voice rang out joyous as a morning bugle and the girls thrilled with joy  yarpe looked hell the cavalry were euchredclean  over the hill behind the officer appeared a squadron of gray horse marching in single file winding down the trail like a long serpent spotted with blue and buff the sun sparkling fitfully from their polished brass and steel when curtis turned to the sheriff his face was pale with excitement for the first time quivering exultant youll have the federal troops to deal with now he said at last we are on equal terms  a deep silence fell on the mob every ruffian of them seemed suddenly frozen into immobility and each sat with head turned and eyes widestaring watching the coming of the blueshirted horsemen  as the officer approached he was distinguishable as a powerful smoothfaced young man in a captains uniform as his eyes rested on curtis his plump red face broke into a broad smile it was plain that he was irish and not averse to a bit of a shindy  riding straight up to the agent he formally saluted and in a deep dry military voice said  colonel daggett presents his compliments to captain curtis and tenders squadron b at your service captain maynard in command  with equally impersonal decorum curtis acknowledged the courtesy  captain curtis returns the compliment and thanks captain maynard for his prompt and most opportune arrivaljack im mighty glad to see you  maynard dismounted and they shook hands same to you old man whats all the row  a clear distant boyish voice cried by columns of four into line and the bugle breaking voice caused the hair of the agents head to stand turning he saw the squadron taking form as it crossed the stream it required his most heroic effort to keep the tears from his eyes as his ear heard the dull rattle of scabbards and he watched the splendid play of the gray horses legs and broad chests as they came on weary but full of spirit yet there was something inexorable in their advance in their order their clean glitter their impersonal grace was expressed the power of the general government  turning to the sheriff he said sheriff winters this warrant is bogusforged this morning by some one of your lynchingparty the ink is hardly dry i decline to serve it and he tore it into strips and flung it on the ground  halt cried the oncoming commander and with creak of saddle and diminishing thunder of hoofs the gray squadron stopped within fifty feet of the agency gate and out of the dust a young lieutenant rode forward and saluted  hold your position mr payne commanded maynard  i just love captain maynard said jennie fervently  ill tell him said lawson  now said maynard whats it all about nice gang this  the mob that had been so loud of mouth now sat in silence as profound as if each man had been smitten dumb it was easy to threaten and flourish pistols in the face of an indian agent with a dozen women to protect but this wall of uncle sams blue was a different barriernot to be lightly overleaped the cowboys were not accustomed to facing such men as these when they shot up towns and raced the tetongs across the hills  now what is it all about repeated maynard composing his comedy face into a look of military sternness  curtis explained swiftly in a low voice and ended by saying this is in effect a lynchingparty on federal territory what would you do in such a case  order them off instanter  precisely i have done so but they refuse to go  do they maynard turned and remounted his horse saluting he said  captain curtis i am ready to execute any order you may choose to give  curtis saluted you will see that these citizens unlawfully assembled leave the reservation at once sheriff winters with all due respect to your office i request you to withdraw captain maynard will escort you to the borders of the reservation when you have a warrant properly executed send or bring it to me and i will use every effort to serve it goodmorning sir  captain maynard drew his sword tention squadron the tired horses lifted their heads as the dusty troopers forced them into line  maynards voice rang out left wheel into linemarch  youll hear from this said the sheriff youll find the state wont stand any such foolishness  yarpes ferocity had entirely evaporated bout face boys were not fightin the united states armyi had enough o that in 63 clear out our bluff dont go  the cowboys cursing under breath whirled their ponies and followed yarpe the redoubtable the sheriff brought up the rear still contending for the rights of the county but he retreated small as the dusty squadron looked it was too formidable both because of its commanders and because of the majestic idea it embodied  calvin was the last to leave i done my best major he said loudly in order that jennie might hear  i know it calvin come and see us again in your civil capacity replied curtis and waved a cordial salute  as the squadron fell in behind and was hidden by the dust of the passing cattlemen curtis turned to where elsie still stood he was smiling but his limbs were stiffened and inert by reason of the rigidity of his long position before the posse  we are saved he said in mockheroic phrase  oh wasnt it glorious to see the good old blueandbuff cried jennie the tears of her joy still on her cheeks i could have hugged captain maynard  there is chance yet said curtis hes coming back  elsie did not speak for a moment what would you have done if they had not come she asked soberly  i could have delayed them a little longer by sending couriers to elk and grayman but lets not think of that lets all go into the house you look completely tired out  elsie fairly reeled with weakness and curtis took her arm you are trembling he said tenderly  i havent stirred for a halfhour she said i was so tense with the excitement i feared you would be shot and the tribe isnt worth the sacrifice she added with a touch of her old spirit  i was in no physical danger he replied but i should have felt disgraced had the mob had its way  the people are coming back said lawson they have seen the soldiers  so they are exclaimed curtis they are shouting with joy cant you hear them the chiefs are riding this way already they know the army will protect them  the thick mass of horsemen was breaking up some of them were riding towards the women with the camp stuff others were crossing the valley while a dozen head men riding straight towards the agency began to sing a song of deliverance and victory joyous shouts could be heard as the young men signalled the good news  the cattlemen are goingthe soldiers have come     xxv  after the struggle   upon reaching the library each member of the party sank into easychairs with sighs of deep relief relaxed and nerveless the storm was over jennie voiced the feeling as she said thank the lord and colonel daggett elsie was physically weary to the point of drowsiness but her mind was active mrs parker was bewildered and silent even parker was subdued by the grave face of the agent  lawson with a curious halfsmile broke the silence there are times when i wish i owned a gatling gun and knew how to use it  curtis started up well its all over but the shouting i must return to the office and set things in order once more  you ought to rest a little said elsie you must feel the strain  i am a little inert at the moment he confessed but im hamlet in the play you know and must be at my post ill meet you all at lunch you need have no further worry  the employés responded bravely to his orders the cheerful clink of the anvil broke forth with tranquillizing effect the schoolbell called the children together the tepees began to rise from the sod as before and the sluggish life of the agency resumed its unhurried flow though beneath the surface still lurked vague forms of fear parker returned to his studio lawson sought his den and there stretched out to smoke and muse upon the leadings of the event while jennie planned a midday dinner for a round dozen it will be a sort of lovefeast to captain maynard she said roguishly  will he return so soon asked elsie  oh yes hell only go a little way jack maynard can smell a good dinner across a range of foothills didnt he look beautiful as he smiled i used to think he grinned but todaywell he looked like a heavenly cherub in the helmet of an archangel as he rode up  elsie was genuinely amused what is the meaning of this fervor has there been something between you and captain maynard in the past  not a thing oh i always liked himhes so goodnaturedand so comical can you peel potatoes  i never did such a thing in my life but ill try  about one oclock maynard came jogging back accompanied by a sergeant and a squad of men dusty tired and hungry  curtis met him at the gate send your horses down to the corral captain youre to take potluck with us  maynard dismounted slowly painfully ive been wondering about those girls he said after the horses were led away one is your sister jennie of course but who is the other shes what the boys would call a queen  youve heard of andrew j brisbane  you mean the erstwhile senator  yes this is his daughter  great himmel what is she doing here  shes an artist and is making some studies of indians  i didnt suppose a man of brisbanes blood and brawn could have a girl as fine as she looks to be  oh brisbane has his good pointsbut come over to the house of course the mob gave no further trouble  not a bit only the trouble of keeping them in sight they rode like jehu i left the chase to payneit was what cooper used to call a stern chase and a long chase your quarters arent so bad he added as they entered the library  jennie came in wearing an apron and looking as tasty as a dumpling how do you do colonel maynard she cried out most cordially  he gave his head a comical flirt on one side i beg pardon why colonel  ive promoted you for the brave deed of this morning  he recovered himself ohohyeshah i had forgotten you saw me put em to flight i was a little late but i gave service dont you think  you were wonderful but i know youre hungry were to have dinner soona real dinner not a lunch  he looked a little selfconscious wellishall be delighted you see i was awake most of the night and in riding one gets hungryand besides breakfast was a little hurried in fact i dont remember that i had any  why you poor thing ill hurry it forward cheer up and she whisked out of the room  maynard flecked a little dust from his sleeve and inquired carelessly your sister isnt married  no she sticks to me still shes a blessed good girl and i dont know what i should do without her  you mustnt be selfish remarked maynard reflectively but see here i must knock off some dust or i will lose the good impression i made on the ladies  make yourself at home here and well have something to eat soon said curtis at the door  the dinner was unexpectedly merry every one felt like celebrating the army and maynard as the representative of the cavalry arm came near blushing at the praise which floated his way on toasts which were drunk from a bottle of sherry a liquor jennie had smuggled in for cooking purposes  i admit i did it he rose to say but i hold it not meet to have it so set down  parker was extravagantly gay im going to do a statue of maynard on his horse rushing to our rescue he said it will be a tinted piece like the ancients used to do that white helmet shall flash like snow sheridan will no longer be the great equestrian  leave off the broad smile interrupted lawson captain maynards smile made light of our tragic situation  i dont think so it was the smile of combat exclaimed elsie it was thrilling  maynard bowed thank you miss brisbane  it was jack maynards murderin grin said curtis it was the look the boys used to edge away from at the academy i must tell you jack nearly got shunted into the ways of glory he could whip any man in west point in his day and a new york sporting man offered to back him for a career thereupon jack wrestled with the tempter and thrun im he now sees his mistake he might have been happy jack the holy terror by this time earning two hundred thousand a year like the great oneill  maynard sighed instead of which here i am rescuing beleaguered damsels like the hero of a dime novel on two thousand a year  jennie spoke up sharply i will not have captain maynard made fun of any more it was a noble deed and he deserves better treatment for it  maynard bowed i have one defender he said soberly  heres another cried elsie  with two such faithful defenders i defy the world he shouted valorously thereupon they left off joking him  as they rose from the table curtis turned to elsie would you like to go with me to make a tour of the camp  her eyes lighted up i should like it exceedingly  very well about three oclock we will go you will have time for a siesta you must be tired  oh no i am quite rested and ready to go any time and her bright eyes and warm color confirmed her words  with military promptness the horses were brought round and accompanied by maynard and jennie curtis with elsie by his side led the way to the camp she was a confident horsewoman and rode a fine brown pony and curtis who had never ridden with her before glowed with pleasure in her grace and skill  as they galloped off up the road a keen twinge of remorseful pity for lawson touched elsies heart he was grown suddenly older it seemed to her as though he had definitely given up the attempt to remain young and this thought made her rather sober he was being left out of her plans now almost unconsciously while the other  one of the real heroes in this affair curtis was saying is cranes voice he has been in saddle nearly thirtysix hours and is willing to start again to pinon city if i ask it  of course you will not  no i will send a white man the settlers might do even cranes voice an injury  all was quiet in the camps with little sign of the precipitate flight of the morning either in the faces of the men or in the disposal of the tepees the old men and some of the women came out to greet their little father and the soldier of the good heart and curtis gave out a tranquillizing message and asked have you called the council  ay for sunrise tomorrow answered elk and two horns  that is good he replied where are your young men  some are in the hills some are gone as messengers others are watching the ponies  call them all in i dont want them riding about tonight keep them in camp close by the soldiersthen no harm will come to them  so scattering greetings and commands he rode through the two circles of tepees the redmen were all eager to shake hands with maynard in whom they recognized a valiant friend as well as an oldtime enemy  they found the camp of grayman less tranquil for the stragglers were still coming in from the hills and scores of women were busy resetting their tepees grayman himself came forth nervous and eager ho little father my heart is glad that the soldiers have come  we are all glad replied curtis where is your son  grayman looked troubled i do not know he is away with cut finger my sisters son  cut finger is bad company for your son  i know it but they are bloodbrothers as is the way of young men where one is there the other is also  maynard and jennie were not as deeply interested in the camp as they had given out to be at starting he was recalling to her mind some of the parties they had attended together at fort sibley really captain maynard she was saying as they rode up you would have it appear that we saw a great deal of each other in those days  thats my contention entirely he replied and it is my intention to continue this indian outbreak indefinitely in order to go into cantonment here  you always were susceptible to good dinners captain maynard  say good company and youll be right entirely  curtis having caught maynards last remark called out in the biting tone of the upper classman at west point  are you on special duty captain maynard or riding in the park  he saluted imperturbably by good luck i am doing both at your service  merely cast your eye around so that you can report the tetongs peaceful and in camp then you may ride where you please  maynard swept his eyes over the village it is done now miss curtis lets try for the top of that hill  no no you have been riding all night  why so i have in the charm of your presence id forgotten it im supposed to be fagged  you dont look it remarked curtis humorously running his eyes over the burly figure before him at the same time i think youd better return your commissariat wagons will be rumbling in soon  maynard again saluted very well major it shall be so and wheeling his horse in such wise as to turn jennies pony they galloped off together leaving curtis and elsie to follow  its hard to realize that disaster came so near to us he said musingly and elsie shaded her eyes with her hand and looked up at the hills  there is a wonderful charm in this dry country i have never seen such blinding sunshine but life must be difficult here  you begin to feel that i expect to stay here at least five years providing i am not removed  she shuddered perceptibly five years is a long time to give out of ones lifewith so little to show for it  he hesitated a moment then said with deep feeling its hard its lonely but after all it has its compensations i can see results the worst side of it all isi can never ask any woman to share such a life with me i feel guilty when i consider jennieshe ought to have a home of her own she has no outlook here  she looked straight ahead as she replied you would find life here intolerable without her  i know it but in my best moments i realize how selfish it is in me to keep her  suppose you were to resign what would you do  i would try to secure a chance at some fieldwork for the ethnologic bureau it doesnt pay very well but it would be congenial and my proficiency in the sign language would i think make me valuable i have determined never to go back to garrison life without some special duty to occupy my mind  life isnt a bit simple when you are grown up is it  life is always simple if one does ones duty  that is a soldiers answer it is not easy for me to enter into that spirit i have my art and no sense of duty at all  your position is equally strange to me but duties will discover themselveslater a life without duties is impossible  i know what you mean but i do not intend to allow any duty to circumscribe my art this she uttered defiantly  i dont like to hear you say that life is greater than art  she laughed how different our points of view you are anglosaxon i am french art counts far more with us  was your mother french i did not know that  yesa canadian i have her nature rather than that of my father  sometimes i think you are your fathers daughter did your mother live to enjoy her husbands success  not to the full still she had a nice home in alta where i was born she died before he was elected senator they had nearly reached the agency now and she shook off her sober mood shall we go in with a dash  im agreed  she put quirt to her horse and they entered the lane at a flying gallop as he assisted her to alight at the studio door he said  i hope your father will not require you to join him in the east it is a great pleasure to have you here his voice touched something vibrant in her heart  oh i dont think he will when he fully understands the situation im sure i dont want to go i shall write him so  curtis rode away elate as a boy something which he did not care to define had come to him from her subtle as a perfume intangible as light and yet it had entered into his blood with most transforming effect he put aside its analysis and went about his duties content with the feeling that life was growing richer day by day  wilson seeing his shining face sighed and said to himself i guess the major has found his girl hes a lucky dog i wish i could pick up even a piece of plain calico id be satisfied and he ran through a list of the unmarried women within reach to no result as usual  meanwhile the supplywagons had arrived and captain maynard was overseeing the layingout of the camp just below the agency lieutenant payne and his command returned at five oclock and in a short time the little village of white tents was in order curtis came over to insist that the officers take dinner with them at the parsonage and as captain maynard had already spoken of the good company and the excellent dinner he had enjoyed in the middle of the day lieutenant payne was quite ready to comply especially as his lunch had been as light as his breakfast  the meal was as enjoyable as the midday dinner and the parkers derived much comfort from the presence of the soldiers  i guess im not fitted to be a pioneer artist parker confessed and the hearty agreement he met with quite disconcerted him  mrs parker was indignant at the covert ridicule of her husband and was silent all through the meal indeed the burden of the conversation fell upon jennie and maynard but they were entirely willing to bear it and were not lacking for words  it is good to hear the bugles again jennie remarked as one of the calls rang out on the still air sweet and sad and as far removed from war as a love song  theyre not so pleasant when they call to the same monotonous round of daily duties said mr payne  curtis smiled heres another disgruntled officer what would you dokill off the indians and move into the city  to kill off a few measly whites might insure completer peace and tranquillity replied maynard  you fellows couldnt be more righteously employed put in lawson you might begin on the political whoopers round about  what blasphemy cried jennie these noble pioneers  founding a mighty state added curtis  founding a state of anarchy retorted lawson they never did have any regard for law except a law that worked in their favor  parker got in a word lawson do you know what you are youre what norman bass used to call a blame arisstocrat this provoked a laugh at lawsons expense  i admit it said lawson calmly i am interested in the cowboy and the mineras wild animalsas much as any of you but as founders of an empire the hard and unlovely truth is they are representatives of every worst form of american vice they are ignorant filthy and cruel their value as couriers of the christian army has never been great with me  maynard was unusually reflective as he stared at lawson  thats mighty plain talk he observed in the pause that followed you couldnt run for office on speeches like that  lawsons living doesnt depend on prevarication remarked curtis if it did  if it did id lie like the besti mean the worst of you replied lawson  in a few years there will not be an indian left parker remarked  the world will be the poorer  they will all be submerged continued parker  why submerge them is the anglosaxon type so adorable in the sight of god that he desires all the races of the earth to be like unto it if the proselytizing zeal of the missionaries and functionaries of the englishspeaking race could work out the world would lose all its color all its piquancy hungary would be like scotland scotland would be cornwall cornwall would duplicate london and london reflect new york beautiful scheme for tailors shoemakers and preachers but depressing to artists  you must be one of those chaps the missionaries tell about who would keep men savage just to please your sense of the picturesque  savage theres a fine word what is a savage  a man who needs converting to our faith said jennie  a man to exercise the army on said maynard  a man to rob in the name of the lord said parker  youre stealing all my oratorical thunder complained lawson when a speaker asks a question like that he doesnt want a detailed answerhe is pausing for effect speaking seriously  oh said maynard then you were not serious  lawson went his oratorical way my conviction is that savagery held more of true happiness than we have yet realized and civilization as you begin to see does not by any construction advance the sum of human happiness as it should do  what an advantage it is to have an independent income mused maynard looking about the table theres a man who not only has opinions but utters them in a firm tone of voice  i am being instructed remarked elsie i used to think no one took the indians side now every one seems opposed to the cattlemen  when we are civilized enough to understand this redman he will have disappeared said curtis very soberly  judging from the temper of this state at present i reckon youre about right replied maynard well its out o my hands as the fellah says im not the almighty if i were id arrange things on a different basis  we are all transition types remarked curtis harking back to a remark of lawsons making  even these settlers are immortal souls said parker  consider exclaimed lawson how could we live without the indian question maynard would be like othellooccupation gone curtis would cease to be a philanthropist elsie bee bee would go sadly back to painting old hats and dead ducks i alone of all this company would be busy and well paid i would continue to study the remains of the race  jennie rose put a period there said she till we escape and remember if we hear any loud talk well come out and fetch you away and she hurried out into the sittingroom where elsie and mrs parker yielded up valuable suggestions about dress                                       as the parkers rose to go lawson approached elsie and asked in a low voice are you going home to the messhouse tonight if you are i want to go with you  ill be ready in a moment she replied but her eyes wavered as they stepped out together quite in the old way he abruptly but gently began  it is significant of our changed relations when i say that this is the first time ive had an opportunity for a private word since our camping trip there is no need of this constraint elsie i want you to be your good frank self with me ill not misunderstand it i am not charging anything up against you in fact i can see that you are right in your decision but it hurts me to have you avoid me as you have done lately  there was something in his voice which brought the hot tears to her eyes and she replied gently im very sorry osborne i hoped you wouldnt careso much and i didnt mean  ive tried not to show my hurt for my own sake as well as yours but the fact is i didnt realize how deeply youd taken root in my thoughts till i tried to put you away it is said that no two lovers are ever equal sharers in affectionone always gives more than the otheror one expects more than the other i was perfectly sincere when i made that bargain with you and i know you were but you are younger than i and that has changed the conditions for you i am older than you thought and i find myself naturally demanding more and more i think i understand better than i did two days ago why you gave me back the ring and i do not complain of it i shall never again refer to it but we can at least be friends this cold silence  she put out her hand dont please dont  i cant bear your being stiff and uncomfortable in my presence bee bee you even called me mister lawson there was a pathetic sort of humor in his voice which touched her let us be good comrades again  she gave him her hand very well osborne but you are mistaken if you think  time will tell he interrupted and his voice was strenuously cheerful anyhow we are on a sound footing again goodnight                                       the presence of maynard and the troop was a greater relief to curtis than he realized he laid down for a moments rest on his couch and fell into a dreamless sleep at once and jennie deciding not to arouse him spread a light shawl over him and withdrew softly maynards coming brought a deeper sense of security than a stranger could have given with twice the number of troops jack maynard is so dependable she said and a distinct note of tenderness trembled in her voice     xxvi  the warrior proclaims himself   the messengers from both riddell and pinon reported to curtis about daylight laden with papers and telegrams the telegrams naturally received first reading there was one filled with instructions from the secretary of the interior and one from the commissioner bidding him stand firm several anxious ones from various cities all of this tenor is there any danger my niece is one of your teachers etc in the midst of the others curtis came upon a fat one for elsie plainly from her father this he put aside till after breakfast when he permitted himself the pleasure of carrying it to the studio he found her at work painting a little brown tot of a girl in the arms of her smiling mother  i have a telegram for youfrom your father no doubt  she rose quickly and opened the envelope as she read she laughed poor papa he is genuinely alarmed read it  he took it with more interest than he cared to show and found it most peremptory in tone  reports from fort smith most alarming come out at once have wired the agent to furnish escort and conveyance shall expect you to reply immediately giving news that you have left agency you should not have gone there i will meet you at pinon city if possible if i do not take train for alta wire me your plans country is much alarmed i must hear from you at once or shall be worried  curtis looked up with an amused light in his eyes hes a little incoherent but sufficiently mandatory when will you start  i will send a telegram out at once that i am safe and all danger over he will not want me to leave now  very well a messenger will start at once with all our letters and messages anything you wish to send can go at the same time  what news have you  i only had time to glance at my mail but the papers are all that lawson has predicted if you would know how important a criminal i am read thesehe pointed at a bundle on a chair i must go back to the office now but i will wait for your letters and telegrams before despatching a messenger if you think it better to go than to stay i will ask captain maynard to escort you to the station  i will stay she replied  she wrote a brief telegram to her father saying i am quite safe and hard at work all quiet dont worry and also composed a letter giving vital details of the situation and taking strong ground against the way in which the cattlemen had invaded the reservation in conclusion she added i have a fine studio plenty of models and am in fine health i cannot think of giving up my work because of this foolish panic dont let these settlers influence you against captain curtis hes right this time  as she ran through the papers and caught the full significance of their precipitate attack on the agent her teeth clinched in hot indignation at the first breath before they were sure of a single item of news they leaped upon an honorable man accusing him of concealing stolen cattle and of harboring murderers and thieves as for the indians it is time to exterminate these vermin let the state wipe out this tribe and its agency and send this fellow curtis back to his regiment where he belongs was the burden of their song  as she read on tingling with wrath at these vulgarly written and utterly unchristian editorials the girl caught an amazing sideglimpse of herself and the views she once held she remembered reading just such reports once before and joining with her father in his desire to punish the redmen was lawson right had her notions of the brave and noble pioneers fighting the wild beast and the savage arisen from ignorance of their true nature had they always been as narrow as bigoted as relentless and as greedy as these articles hinted at some of lawsons cleancut relentless phrases came back to her at the moment and she began to believe that he was nearer right than she had been and her father would he sanction such libels as these at last the essential grandeur of the position held in common by both curtis and lawsonof the right of the small people to their place on the planetcame to her and in opposition to their grave sweet eyes she saw again the brutal leering faces of the mob and comprehended the feelings of a chief like grayman as he confronts the oncoming hordes of a destroying race                                       meanwhile in the grassy hollow between two roundtop hills the bands of elk and grayman were gathered in extraordinary council no one was in galadress no one was painted all were serious or sad or morose upon their folded blankets the head men sat in a small circle on the smooth sod exposed to the blazing sun behind them stood or knelt a larger circle the men and boys on one side the women on the other while in the rear mounted on their fleetest ponies some two hundred of the young men were ranked enthralled listeners to the impassioned speeches of the old men  crawling elk made the first address repeating the story which the agent had told and calling upon all those who sat before him to search for the guilty one and report to him if they found him his words were received in silence  then grayman rose and stepping into the circle began to speak in a low and sorrowful voice something in his manner as well as in his words enlisted the almost breathless interest of the crowd there was a tragic pathos in his voice as he called out you see how it is brothers we are like a nest of ants in a white mans field which he is ploughing we are only a few and weak while all around us our enemies press in upon us we have only one friendour little father we must do as he says we must give up a man to the war chief of the cowboys they will never believe that any one else killed the sheepman the cattlemen and sheepmen are always quarrelling but they readily join hands to do the tetongs harm  it is death to us to fight the white man i know it unless we all wish to be shot we must not become angry this time we must do as the little father says and if we cannot find the man who did this thing i will go and give myself into the hands of the white war chief a murmur of protest and anger ran round the circle it is better for one to suffer than many he said in answer to the protest and i am old my wife is dead i have but one son and he is estranged from me i say if we cannot find who did this thing then i am willing to go and be killed of the white people in order to keep the peace i have said it  standing elk leaped to his feet tall gaunt excitable we will not do this he said we will fight first and among the young warriors there was applause the tetongs are not dogs to be always kicked in the ribs i have fought the white man i have met long hair and bear robe in battle i am not afraid of the cattlemen i am old but my heart is yet big let us do battle and die like brave men  then crawling elk rose and his broad goodhumored face shone in the sun like polished bronze as he turned his cheek to the wind  the words of my brother are loud and quick he said slowly in the ancient time it was always so he was always ready to fight i was always opposed to fighting we must not talk of fighting now all that is put away it belongs to the suns that have gone over our heads we must now talk of cattleherding and ploughing we must strive always to be at peace with the cowboys i too am old i have not many years to live but you young men have a long time to live and you cannot be always quarrelling with the settlers you must be wise and patient our little father swift eagle is our friend you can trust him you can put your hand in his and find it strong and warm his heart is good and his words are wise if we can find the man who did this evil deed we must give him up it is not right that all of us should suffer for the wickedness of one man no it is not right that we who are old should die for one whose hands are red  this speech was also received in silence but plainly produced a powerful effect then one of the men who found the body rose and told what he knew of the case i do not think a tetong killed the man he said in conclusion  in this wise the talk proceeded for nearly two hours and then the council rose to meet again at sunset and word of what had been said was carried to curtis by crawling elk and grayman  to them curtis said i am pleased with you go over the names of all your reckless young men and when you reach one you think might do such a deed question him and his people closely the shells of the rifle were the largest sizethat may help you your old men would not do this thingtheir heads are cool but some of your young men have hot hearts and may have quarrelled with this herder  the old men went away very sorrowful grayman was especially troubled because he could not help thinking all the time of cut finger his nephew  running fox or cut finger as the white people called him he knew to be a morose and reckless young man and probably possessed of some evil spirit for at times he was quite crazy once he had forced his pony into the cookinglodge of bear paw for no reason at all and bear paw in a rage had snatched up his rifle and fired putting a bullet through the bridle hand of running fox who lost two fingers and gained a new name at another time the mad fool had tried to force his horse to leap a cliff and once he had attempted to drown himself and yet between these obsessions he could be very winning and there were many among elks band who pitied him he was comely withal and had married a handsome girl the daughter of standing wolf it was easy to imagine that cut finger was the guilty one and yet to think of him was to think of his sons intimate friend  when he reached his tepee grayman lit his pipe and sat down alone and remained in deep thought for hours he feared to find cut finger guilty for his own son was cut fingers friend or fellow and that means the closest intimacy there are no secrets between a tetong and his chum if cut finger is guilty then my son knows of it that i fear  when any one came to the door he motioned them away even his daughter dared not enter for she saw him in meditation as he smoked he made offering to the great spirit and prayed that he might be shown the right way and his heart was greatly troubled  crawling elk with a halfdozen of his head men was seated in his tepee calmly discussing the same question the canvas of his lodge was raised as much to insure privacy as to let the wind sweep through it was not easy to accuse any man of this crime or even to suggest the name of any one as capable of such a foolish deed of blood for relationships were close therefore it was that he too narrowed the investigation down to cut finger it is easier to accuse the son of a neighbor than your own son especially if that other is already a marked man among reckless youths  at five oclock grayman called his daughter and said send my sister standing cloud to me  standing cloud came and took a seat on the outside of the tepeeon the side where the canvas was fastened upand there sat with bent head her fingers busy with blades of grass while her brother questioned her she was a large and comely woman of middle age her expression was still youthful and her voice had girlish lightness she was at once deeply moved by her brothers questions she did not know where her son was he had not been to see her for several days she understood whereto the questioning tended and stoutly denied that her son would do so evil a deed nevertheless grayman was compelled to say  you know he has a bad head and he made the confused wavering sign of the hand which signifies crazy or foolish and the mother rose and went away sobbing  then grayman recalled the words of the little father if my own brother should do wrong i would give him up to the war chief he therefore said if my son and my sisters son are guilty i will give them up and he rose and sought out crawling elk and told him of his fears and repeated his resolution as they sat together while the sun was going down and the crier was calling the second council  it is right said elk those who are guilty must be punished but we do not know who fired the shot  the people were slow in coming together this second time and darkness was falling as the head men again took their seats a small fire was being built in the centre of the circle and towards this at last like nocturnal insects the larger number of the people in the two camps slowly concentrated  the wind had gone down and the night was dark and still and warm the people gathered in comparative silence though the laugh of a girl occasionally broke from the clustering masses of the women to be followed by a mutter of jests from the young men who stood close packed behind the older members of the bands excitement had deepened since the morning for in some way the news had passed from lip to lip that grayman had discovered the evildoer  on their part the chieftains were slow to begin their painful task they smoked in silence till the fire was twice replenished then began talking in low tones among themselves at last crawling elk arose and made a speech similar to that of the morning he recounted the tale of the murdered white man and the details of finding the body and ended by saying we are commanded by the agent to find the ones who have done this evil deed if any one knows anything about this let him come forward and speak it is not right that we should all suffer for the wrongdoing of some reckless young warriors  come forth and speak any one who knows called the head men looking round the circle he who remains silent does wrong  two horns rose we mean you young menyou too he said turning to the women if any of you have heard anything of this matter speak  then the silence fell again on the circle of old men and they bent their heads in meditation crawling elk was just handing the pipe to grayman in order to rise when a low mutter and a jostling caused every glance to centre upon one side of the circle and then decked in warpaint gay with beads and feathers and carrying a rifle cut finger stepped silently and haughtily into the circle and stood motionless as a statue his tall figure erect and rigid as an oak  a moaning sound swept over the assembly and every eye was fixed on the young man ahee ahee the women wailed in astonishment and fear two or three began a low sad chant and death seemed to stretch a black wing over the council by his weapons by his warpaint by his bared head decked with eagleplumes and by the haughty lift of his face cut finger proclaimed louder than words  i am the man who killed the herder  standing so he began to sing a stern song      i alone killed himthe white man     he was a thief and i killed him     no one helped me i alone fired the shot     he will drive his sheep no more on tetong lands     this dog of a herder     he lies there in the short grass     it was i cut finger who did it  as his chant died away he turned i go to the hills to fight and die like a man and before the old men could stay him he had vanished among the young horsemen of the outer circle and a moment later the loud drumming of his ponys hoofs could be heard as he rode away                                       curtis was sitting alone in the library when a tap at his window announced the presence of grayman  following a gesture the chieftain came in and with a look on his face which expressed high resolution and keen sorrow he said  the man who killed the herder is found he has proclaimed himself at our council and he has ridden away into the hills  who was he  cut finger  ah so well you have done your duty i will not ask you to arrest him crow will do that i hopehe hesitatedi hope your son was not with him  i alone did it he says my son is innocent  i am very glad replied curtis looking into the old mans tremulous face go home and sleep in peace  with a clasp of the hand grayman said goodnight and vanished  there was nothing to be done till morning and curtis knew the habits of the indians too well to be anxious about the criminal calling his faithful cranes voice he said  crane will you go to pinon city  cranes voice straightened tonight  yes tonight  if you will let me wear a blue coat i will go  curtis smiled you are a brave boy i will give you a coat that will protect you if you are caught by the white men saddle your pony  with a smile he turned on his heel and went out as cheerfully as though he were going on an errand to the issuehouse  in his letter to the sheriff curtis said i have found the murderer he is a halfcrazy boy called cut finger make out a warrant for him and i will deliver him to you you will need no deputies no one but yourself will be permitted to cross the line for the present  after crane had galloped off curtis laid down his pen and sat for a long time recalling the events of the evening he remembered that lawson and elsie went away together and a pang of jealous pain took hold upon him i never had the privilege of taking her arm he thought unreasonably     xxvii  brisbane comes for elsie   among other perplexities which now assailed the agent was the question of how to secure cut finger without inciting further violence he confidently expected the police to locate the fugitive during the day probably in the camp of red wolf on the headwaters of the elk  he cannot escape there is no place for him to go  he may have committed suicide said wilson discussing the matter with his chief the following morning  he may but his death will not satisfy the ranchers unless they are made the instrument of vengeance they would feel cheated and bitterer than ever replied curtis sombrely he must be taken and delivered up to the law  on his return to the office after breakfast curtis stopped at the door of elsies studio his brain yet tingling with the consciousness that no other mans claim stood between them now  she greeted him joyously i am starting a big canvas this morning she said come in and see it  he stepped inside to see but the canvas only had a few rude reddish lines upon it and elsie laughed at his blank look as he faced the easel  this thing here she pointed with her brush is a beautiful purple butte this yellow circle is the sun these little crumbly looking boxes are trees this streak is a river this jackinthebox here is crow wing on his horse  her joking helped to clear his brain though his blood was throbbing in his ears  ah im glad to know all that will you tag each anomalous hump  certainly you will recognize everything by number or otherwise she turned a suddenly serious face upon him i am determined to get back to work these last few days have been so exciting is there any news  yes the murderer proclaimed himself at a big council last night  he did oh tell me about it when  i dont know exactly the hour but the chieftains came to me about nine oclock i know him well he is a reckless handsome halfcrazy young man he broke off suddenly as heavybreast one of the policemen profoundly excited darkened the doorway cut finger is on the hill he signed and pointed away with trembling finger to a height which rose like a monstrous beehive just behind the schoolhouse on the rounded top looking like a small monument on a colossal pedestal sat a mounted warrior  what is he there for asked curtis  he wants to die like raven face he wants to fight the cowboys he says he dont want to hurt any one else he says only the cowboys and their war chief so he says  where is crow i want this man arrested and brought to me  now he will shoot any one who goes up the hill he has said so all the people are watching  curtis mused a moment can you send word to him  yes his wife is here  then tell him i will not let him fight tell him that shooting will do no good and that i want him to come down and see me  the officer trotted away  what did he say asked elsie what is that man on the hill for  that is cut finger the guilty man he proclaimed himself the murderer last night and now he is willing to die but wants to die on his horse  the whole agency was again tremulous with excitement the teachers the scholars the native employés were all gathered into chattering groups with eyes fixed on the motionless figure of the desperate horseman and in the camps above the agency an almost frenzied excitement was spreading the stark bravery of the boys attitude had kindled anew the flame of war and behind cut finger on the hills two groups of mounted warriors had gathered suddenly several of the more excitable old women broke into a warsong whose wail came faintly to the ears of the agent  two horns silence those singers said curtis sternly  elsie and jennie and the parkers joined the group around the agent and miss colson the missionary came flying for refuge at the side of her hero  what are you going to do asked parker if the fellow really means to shoot of course no man can go up to him you might send some soldiers  silence in the ranks commanded maynard and though he smiled as he said it parker realized his mistake he turned to elsie and his wife i tell you wed better get out of here i feel just like a man sitting on a powdermine theres no telling whats going to happen next  lawson turned towards him with a sarcastic grin i wish id realized the state of your nerves parker i should have invited you to asbury beach instead of the indian country  maynard brought his fieldglasses to bear on the desperado he has dismounted he said he is squatted beside his horse the bridlerein on his arm a rifle across his knees and is faced this way his attitude is resolute and sassy  curtis quietly said now friends i wish you would all go in and pay no further attention to this man miss colson go back to your work so long as he sees us looking at him he will maintain his defiant attitude he will grow weary of his bravado if ignored  quite right captain replied lawson and the little knot of visitors broke up and dispersed to sheltered points of observation  under the same gentle pressure the employés went back to work and the selfconvicted warrior was left to defy the wind and the sky even the tetongs themselves grew tired of looking when nothing seemed likely to happen and the forenoon wore away as usual well filled with duties maynards men got out for drill an hour later and their bugles voice pulsed upward to the silent and motionless watcher on the hill like mocking laughter the clink of the anvil also rose to him on the hot dry air and just beneath him the children came forth at recess to play he became tired of sitting on the ground at last and again mounted his horse but no one at the agency seemed to know or to care the sun beat remorselessly upon his head and his throat became parched with thirst slowly but surely the exaltation of the morning ebbed away and a tremulous weakness seized upon him so that when his wife came bringing meat and water he who had never expected to eat or drink again seized upon the food and ate greedily  then while she sat on the ground and repeated the agents message he stood beside his horse sullen and wordless the bell rang for noon and as the children came rushing out they pointed up at him again and the teachers also stood in a group for a moment with faces turned upward but only for a moment then went carelessly away to their meals  an hour passed the workbell rang the clerks returned to their duties and the agent walked slowly across the road towards the office cut finger lifted his rifle and pointed it i could shoot him now he muttered but he is a good man i do not want to kill him then the heat and silence settled over hill and valley and no sound but the buzzing of flies and the clatter of grasshoppers broke the hot brooding hush of the midday the wind was from the plain and brought no coolness on its wings  but he was not entirely forgotten elsie from her studio door kept close watch upon him theres something fine about him after all she said to curtis  its like the old mosaic timesan eye for an eye he knows he must die for this but he prefers to die gloriously as a warrior dies  a dust down the road caught curtiss attention the mail will soon be in and then we will see how all this affects the press of the state the chicago dailies will not reach us for a couple of days yet  send the papers over here please cried elsie im wild to see them  why not all assemble at the parsonage and ill bring them there  very well that will do as well she replied it will be such a joy to read our obituaries  as he entered the library with his armful of papers a halfhour later curtis exclaimed well now here is a feast the commotion on the outside is prodigious here are the copper city and alta papers and a dozen lesser lights and signals of progress in the state help yourselves he took out a handful of letters and telegrams and here are the prayers of anxious relatives a telegram for you miss brisbane and two for you lawson  elsies message from her father was brief have no word from you am en route for pinon city not finding you there will cross to agency at once why do you not come out  looking at the date she said papa is coming he is probably on his way to the agency at this moment  curtis looked a little troubled i hope not the roads are dusty and the sun is hot  by george this is fierce stuff said parker looking up from his paper  cut finger has left the hill announced jennie from the doorway he is nowhere to be seen  now he will submit to arrest exclaimed curtis his fine frenzy is gone  im sorry elsie soberly exclaimed must you give him up to that stupid sheriff  yes it must be done replied curtis my only claim to consideration lies in executing the law i fought lawlessness with the promise that when the sheriff came with proper warrant i would act  as the young officer went back to his duties the headlines of the papers he had but glanced at began to burn into his brain hitherto his name had been most inconspicuous only once or twice had it achieved a longprimer setting mainly it had kept to the security and dignity of brevier notices in the army and navy journal now here it stood blazoned in illsmelling ink on woodpulp paper in letters half an inch in height           curtis culpable      the agent shields his pets  while in the editorial columns of the copper city papers similar accusations though adroitly veiled were none the less apparent he had smiled at all this in the presence of his friends but inwardly he shrank from it just as he would have done had some tramp in the street flung a handful of gutter slime across the breast of his uniform a gust of rage made his teeth clinch and his face burn hot and he entered his office with lowering brows  wilson looked up with a grin well major the politicians are getting in their work on us  this is only the beginning we may expect an army of reporters to complete the work of misrepresentation  the wonder is they havent got here before they must be really nervous crane says the people in town have very bad hearts as near as i can make out they faced him up and threatened his life he says the mob is hanging round the edge of the reservation crazy for blood he got shy and took to the hills  did he see the sheriff  yes the sheriff is on the way  is crane still asleep  yes he didnt wait for grub he dropped like a log and is dead to the world  poor chap i shouldnt have sent him on this last trip where is tony  tonys out in the hills to keep an eye on cut finger will you go after him tonight  no not till morning the police will locate him and stay with him tonight and tomorrow morning i will go out and get him myself i dont want any shooting if it can be avoided what is it heavybreast he asked of a large tetong who entered at the moment his eyes bright with information  white man coming signed the redman  curtis rose and went to the door and looked down the road  three carriages were passing the issuehouseone a rather pretentious family surrey the others ordinary mountain wagons in the hinder seat of the surrey and beside the sheriff sat a grayhaired man  it is senator brisbane said curtis to wilson and a keen pang of anticipated loss came to him for he knew that brisbane had come to take his daughter away but his face was calm as he went down to the gate to meet his distinguished and powerful enemy  the exsenator was hot weary and angry he had arrived in pinon city on the early train just as the county attorney and the sheriff were about to set forth a few words with these officials assuaged his anxiety for his daughter but increased his irritation towards curtis leaving orders for another team to follow he had taken passage with the sheriff an action he regretted at once the seats were too low and too narrow for his vast bulk and his knees grew weary the wind came from the plain hot and insolent bringing no relief to the lungs on the contrary it filled his eyes and ears with dust and parched the skin like a furnace blast altogether the conditions of his ride had been torturing to the great man and he had ridden the latter part of it in grim silence mentally execrating both lawson and curtis for luring his daughter so far from civilization  no one spoke till the agent pacing calmly down to the gate stepped into the road and said  goodevening gentlemen will you get out and come in  even then brisbane made no reply but the sheriff spoke up i suppose well have to this is senator brisbane major he was very anxious about his daughter and so came in with me this is mr grismore our county attorney  curtis bowed slightly mr grismore i have seen senator brisbane i have met send your horses down to the corral sheriff and come in you cant return tonight  as the sheriff got out he said this second team is the senators and the reporter for the associated press is in there with streeter  brisbane got out slowly and painfully and a yellowgray pallor came into his face as he stood beside the carriage steadying himself by resting his hand on the wheel the young county attorney eager to serve the great politician sprang out and offered a hand and curtis with sudden pity in his heart made a step forward but brisbane put them both aside harshly  no no im all right now my legs were crampedthats all theyll limber up in a minute the seats were too low for a man of my height i should have stayed in the other carriage  after all he was elsies father and curtis relented senator if youll take a seat in my office ill go fetch your daughter  i prefer to go to her myself brisbane replied menacingly formal where is she  i will show you if you will permit curtis coldly replied and set out to cross the road  the old man hobbled painfully at first but soon recovered enough of his habitual power to follow curtis who did not wait for he wished to have a private word with elsie before her father came she was lying down as he knocked resting waiting for the dinner call  your father is here he said as she opened the door  her face expressed surprise not pleasure  here here at the agency  yes and on his way to the studio moreover he is very dirty very disgusted very crusty and not at all well  poor old father now hell make it uncomfortable for us all he has come for me of course who is with him  the sheriff the county attorney and some reporters  she smiled then he is after you too  it looks that way but you must not go away without giving me another chance to talk with you will you promise that he demanded abruptly passionately i have something to say to you  i dare not promise she responded and her words chilled him even more than her action as she turned away to the door how slowly he walks poor old papa you shouldnt have done this popsey she cried as she met him with a kiss on his cheek  curtis walked away leaving them alone a hand of ice at his heart  brisbane took her kiss without changing to lighter mood  why didnt you follow out my orders he demanded harshly you see what ive had to go through just because you are so foolishly obstinate that ride is enough to kill a man  her throat swelled with anger but she choked it down and replied very gently come into the studio and let me clean off the dust im sorry  he followed her in and sank heavily upon a chair i wouldnt take that journey again for ten thousand dollars why didnt you come to the railway as i ordered  because i saw no good reason for it i knew what i was doing captain curtis assured me  captain curtis he sneered youd take his word against mine would you  yes i would for he is on the ground and knows all the conditions he has the outbreak well in hand you have seen only the outside exaggeration of it he has acted with honor and good judgment  oh he has has he well well see about that his mind had taken a new turn he wont have anything in his hand six months from now no west point dude like him can set himself up against the power of this state and live  now papa dont start in to abuse captain curtis he is our host and it isnt seemly  oh it isnt well i dont care whether it is or is not i shall speak my mind his whole attitude has been hostile to the best interests of the state and he must get off his high horse  as he growled and sneered his way through a long diatribe she brought water and bathed his face and hands and brushed his hair her anger melting into pity as she comprehended how weak and broken he was she had observed it before in times of great fatigue but the heat and dust and discomfort of the drive had reduced the big body debilitated by lack of exercise to a nerveless lump his brain to a mass of incoherent and savage impulses no matter what he said thereafter she realized his pitiable weakness and felt no anger  as he rested he grew calmer and at last consented to lie down while she made a little tea on an alcohol lamp after sipping the tea he fell asleep and she sat by his side her mind filled with the fundamental conception of a daughters obligation to her sire to her he was no longer a great politician no longer a powerful aggressive business manhe was only her poor old dying father to whom she owed her every comfort her education her jewels her art he had never been a companion to herhis had been the rule absoluteand yet a hundred indulgences a hundred really kind and considerate acts came thronging to her mind as she fanned his flushed face  i must go with him she said it is my duty  curtis came to the door again and tapped she put her finger to her lips and so he stood silent looking in at her his eyes called her and she rose and tiptoed to the door  i came to ask you both to dinner he whispered  her eyes filled with quick tears thats good of you she returned in a low voice but he would not come hes only a poor old broken man after all her voice was apologetic in tone i hope you will not be angry they both stood looking down at him he has failed terribly in the last few weeks his campaigning will kill him i wish he would give it up he needs rest and quiet what can i do  curtis looking upon the livid old man inert and lumpish yet venerable because of his white hairsand because he was the sire of his loveexperienced a sudden melting of his own resolution his throat choked but he said  go with him he needs you  at the moment words were unnecessary she understood his deeper meaning and lifted her hand to him he took it in both his it may be a long time before i shall see you again ii ought not he struggled with himself and ceased to speak  her eyes wavered and she withdrew her hand my duty is with him now perhaps i can carry him through his campaign or dissuade him altogether dont you see that i am right  he drew himself up as though his generalinchief were passing duty is a word i can understand he said and turned away     xxviii  a walk in the starlight   having no further pretext for calling upon her curtis thought of elsie as of a strain of music which had passed he was rather silent at dinner but not noticeably so for maynard absorbed most of the time and attention of those present at the first opportunity he returned to his papers and was deep in work when jennie came in to tell him that elsie was coming over to stay the night  she has given up her bed to her father and so she will sleep here go over about nine and get her  if she knew how deeply this command moved him she was considerate enough to make no comment very well sis he replied quietly as soon as i finish this letter  but he did not finish the letterdid not even complete the sentence with which his pen was engaged when jennie interrupted him after she went out he sat in silence and in complete immobility for nearly an hour at last he rose and went out into the warm and windless night  when he entered the studio he found her seated upon one trunk and surveying another  this looks like flight he said  yes papa insists on our going early tomorrow morning isnt it preposterous i can only pack my clothing he says the trouble is only beginning and that i must not remain here another day  i have come to fetch you to jennie  i will be ready presently i am just looking round to decide on what to take be seated please while i look over this pile of sketches  he took a seat and looked at her sombrely youll leave a great big empty place here when you go  do you mean this studio  i mean in my daily life  she became reflective i hate to go and thats the truth of it i am just beginning to feel my grip tighten on this material i know i could do some good work here but really i was frightened at papas condition this afternoon he is better now but i can see that he is failing if he insists on campaigning i must go with himbut oh how i hate it think of standing up and shaking hands with all these queer people for months i oughtnt to feel so of course but i cant help it ive no patience with people who are halfbaked neither bread nor dough i believe i like old mary and two horns better  i fear you are voicing a mood not a conviction we ought not to condemn any one he paused a moment then added i dont like you to even say cruel things it hurts me as i look round this room i see nothing which has to do with duty or conviction or war or politics there is peace and beauty here you belong in this atmosphere you are fitted to your environment i admit that i was fired at first with a desire to convert you to my ways of thought now when a sense of duty troubles you takes you away from the joy of your art i question myself you are too beautiful to wear yourself out in problems i now say remain an artist there is something idyllic about your artist life as i now understand it it is simple and childlike in that respect it seems to have less troublesome questions of right or wrong to decide than science its one care seems to be what will produce and preserve beauty and so assuage the pain of the world no question of money or religion or politicsjust the pursuit of an ideal in a sheltered nook  you have gone too far the other way i fear she said sadly our lives even at the best are far from being the ideal you present it seems very strange to me to hear you say those things  i have given the matter much thought he replied if i have made you think of the woes of the world so you have shown me glimpses of a life where men and women are almost free from care we are mutually instructed he rose at this point and after hesitation said when you go i wish you would leave this room just as it is and when i am tired and irritable and lonely ill come here and imagine myself a part of your world of harmonious colors with no race questions to settle and no harsh duties to perform will you do this these few hangings and lamps and easels are unimportant to youyou wont miss them to me they will be priceless and besides you may come back again some time say you will it will comfort me  there was a light in his eyes and an intensity in his voice which startled her she stammered a little  why of course if it will give you the slightest pleasure there is nothing here of any particular value ill be glad to leave them  thank you so long as i have this room as it is i shall be able to persuade myself that you have not passed utterly out of my life  she was a little alarmed now and hastened to say i do not see why we should not meet again i shall expect you to call when you come to washington she checked herself im afraid my sense of duty to the tetongs is not strong dont think too hardly of me because of it  he seemed intent on another thought do you know youve given me a dim notion of a new philosophy i havent organized it yet but its something like this beauty is a sense of fitness harmony this sense of beautycall it tastedemands positively a readjustment of the external facts of life so that all angles all suffering and violence shall cease if all men were lovers of the beautiful the gentle then the world would needs be suave and genial and life harmoniously colored like your own studio and we would campaign only against ugliness to civilize would mean a totally different thing im not quite clear on my theory yet but perhaps you can help me out  i think i see what you mean but my world she hastened to say is nothing like so blameless as you think it dont think artists are actually what they should be they are very human eager to succeed to outstrip each other and they are sordid too no you are too kind to us we are a poor lot when you take us as a whole and the worst of it is the cleverest makers of the beautiful are often the least inspiring in their lives i mean theyre ignorant and spiteful and often dishonorable she stopped abruptly  im sorry to hear you say that it certainly shatters a beautiful theory i had built up out of what you and other artists have said to me after a little silence he resumed it comes down to this then that all arts and professions are a part of life and life is a compromise between desire and duty there are certain things i want to do today but my duties for tomorrow forbid you are right in going away with your fatherim not one to keep you from doing thatbut i must tell you how great has been the pleasure of having you here and i hope you will come again if you go tomorrow morning i shall not see you again  why not  i start at dawn to arrest cut finger  alone  no the captain of the police goes with me  her face paled a little oh i wish you wouldnt why dont you take the soldiers  they are not necessary i shall leave here about four oclock and surprise the guilty man in his bed he will not fight me he rose are you ready to go now  in a moment she said and softly crossed the floor to peep into the bedroom poor papa he looks almost bloodless as he sleeps  as they stepped out into the darkness curtis realized that this was their last walk together and the thought was both sweet and sad  will you take my arm he asked it is very dark though there should be a new moon  it has gone down i saw it she replied as she slipped her hand through his elbow how peaceful it all is it doesnt seem possible that tomorrow you will risk your life in the performance of duty and that i will leave here never to return i have a curious feeling about this place now it seems as though i were settled here and that i am to go on living here forever  i wish it were true women like youyou know what i mean there are no women like you of coursecome into my life too seldom i dread the empty futility of tomorrow as an indian agent i must expect to live without companionship with such as you i have a premonition that jennie is going to leave meas she ought  you will be very lonely then what will you do  work harder do more good and so cheat myself into forgetfulness that time is flying  you are bitter tonight  why shouldnt i be when you are going away it wouldnt be decent of me to be gay  your methods of flattery are always effective at one moment you discuss the weightiest matters with mewhich argues i have brainsand then you grow gloomy over my going and would seem to mean that i am charming which i dont think is quite true  if i werent a poor devil of an army officer id convince you of my sincerity by asking you not to go away at all  that would be convincing she said laughingly please dont do it  his tone became suddenly serious you are right i cant ask you to share a life like mine it is too uncertain i may be ordered back to my regiment next winter and then nothing remains but garrison duty i think i will then resign but i am unfitted for business or for any moneygetting and so ive decided that as an honorable man i must not imperil the happiness of a woman i claim to be a person of taste and the girl i admired would have other chances in life i cant afford to say to her give up all your comfort and security and come with me to the frontier she would be foolish to listenno woman of the stamp i have in mind could do it they were nearing the parsonage gate and he ended in a low voice dont you think i am right  the theory is that nothing really counts in a womans life but love she replied enigmatically  yes but theory aside  well then i can conceive of a girla very young girlleaving wealth and friends and even her art for the man she loved but  he waited a moment as a culprit listens to his judge but thenbut in case  if the girl were grown up and loved luxurious living and shared an enthusiasmsay for artthen she broke off and said wearily then she might palter and measure values and weigh chances and take account of the future and end by not marrying at all  they had reached the gate and he spoke with perceivable effort ive no right to ask it of course but if you take pity on my loneliness at any time and write to me your letters will be more welcome than it is seemly in me to say and ill promise not to bore you with further details of my injines will you be kind to me  i will be glad to write she replied but in her voice was something he did not understand as they entered the house elsie said captain maynard captain curtis is going out tomorrow morning to arrest that crazy indian do you think he ought to go alone  certainly not it would be too dangerous he shall have an escort replied maynard emphatically  no no said curtis decisively i am safer to go unarmed and alone  george protested jennie you shall not go out there alone why dont you send the police  maynard here interposed dont take on worry ill go with him myself  this last hour in elsies company was a mingled pain and pleasure to curtis for she was most charming she laid aside all hauteur all perversity and gave herself unreservedly to her good friends they were all at high tension and the talk leaped from jest to protest and back to laughter again agile and inconsequent the time and the place the past and the future counted for little to these four for they were young and they were lovers  at last jennie rose if you people are to rise at dawn you must go to sleep now goodnight come elsie bee bee  maynard followed jennie into the hall with some jest and curtis seized the opportunity to delay elsie he offered his hand and she laid hers therein with a motion of halfsurrender  goodnight captain i appreciate your kindness more than i can say  dont try i feel now that i have done nothingnothing of what i should have done but i didnt think you were to leave so soon if i had known  you have done more than you realize once more goodnight  goodnight he said in an unsteady voice and remember you promised to write  i will keep my promise she turned at the door dont try to write around your red people i believe id like to hear how you get on with them  defend me from mine enemies within the gates and ill work out my problem  ill do my best goodbye  no not goodbyejust goodnight  for a moment he stood meditating a further word then stepped into the hall elsie midway on the stairs had turned and was looking down at him with a face wherein the eyes were wistful and brows perplexed she guiltily lowered her lashes and turned away but that momentary pausethat subtle interplay of doubt and dreamhad given the soldier a pleasure deeper than words                                       jennie was waiting at the door of the tiny room in which elsie was to sleep her face glowing with admiration and love oh you queenly girl she cried with a convulsive clasp of her strong arms i cant get over the wonder of your being here in our little house you ought to live always in a castle  elsie smiled but with tears in her eyes youre a dear good girl i never had a truer friend  i wish you were poor said jennie as they entered the plain little room then you could come here as a missionary or something and we could have you with us all the time i hate to think of your going away tomorrow  you must come and see me in washington  oh no that wouldnt do said jennie half alarmed it might spoil me for life out here you must visit us again  there was a note of honest almost boyish suffering in jennies entreaties which moved the daughter of wealth very deeply and she went to her bed with a feeling of loss as though she were taking leave of something very sweet and elementally comforting  she thought of her first lover and her cheeks burned with disgust of her folly she thought of two or three good manly suitors whose protestations of love had left her cold and humorously critical on lawsons suit she lingered for he was still a possibility should she decide to put her soldierlover away but i have done sodefinitely she said to some pleading within herself i cant marry him our lives are ordered on divergent lines i cant come here to live  happiness is not dependent on material things argued her newly awakened self he loves youhe is handsome and true and good  but i dont love him  yes you do when you returned osborne lawsons ring you quite plainly said so  she burned with a new flame with this confession but she protested let us be sensible let us argue  you cannot argue with love  i am not a child to be carried away by a momentary gust of emotion see how impossible it is for me to share his workhis austere life  and here entered the farreaching question of the life and death of a race in a most disturbing measure this obscure young soldier represented a view of lifeof civilization antagonistic to her faith and in stern opposition to the teachings of her father in a subtle fashion he had warped the word duty from its martial significance to a place in a lofty philosophy whose tenets were only just beginning to unfold their inner meaning to her  was it not true that she was less sympathetic with the poor brown peoples of the earth than with the animals how can you be contemptuous of gods children whom the physical universe has colored brown or black or yellowyou who are indignant when a beast is overburdened if we repudiate and condemn to death those who do not please us who will live  she felt in herself some singular commotion conceptions hitherto mere shells of thought became infilled with passion and pity hitherto a feeble sentiment with her expanded into an emotion which shook her filled her throat with sobs discrediting her old self with her new self till the thought of her mean and selfish art brought shame how small it all was how trivial beside the consciousness of duty well done measured against a life of selfsacrifice such as that suggested by this man whose eyes sought her in worship  could there be any greater happiness than to stand by his side helping to render a dying captive race happierhealthier could her great wealth be put to better use than this of teaching two hundred thousand red people how to meet and adjust themselves to the white mans way of life their rags their squalor their ignorance were more deeply depressing to her lover than the poverty of the slums for the tetongs had been free and joyous hunters their condition was a tragic debasement she began to feel the arguments of the indian helpers their words were no longer dead things they had become electric nodes they moved her set her blood aflame and she clinched her hands and said i will help him do this great work     xxix  elsie warns curtis   brisbane was early awake abrupt and harsh in command come we must get out o here he said i dont want to be under the slightest obligation to this young crank i intend to break him  she flamed into wratha white radiance when you break him you break me she said  what do you mean  i mean ive changed my mind i think hes right and you are wrong  the entrance of the sheriff prevented a full accounting at the moment but it was merely deferred once in the carriage brisbane began to discredit her lover dont tell me curtis is disinterested he is scheming for some fat job his altruistic plea is too thin  you are illfitted to understand the motives of a man like captain curtis elsie replied and every word cut what have youor iever done that was not selfish  ive given a thousand dollars to charity for every cent of his  yes and thats the spirit in which you gavenever to help only to exalt yourself just as i have done captain curtis is giving himself he and his sister have made me see myself as i am and i am not happy over it but i wish you would not talk to me any more about them they are my friends and i will not listen to your abuse of them  it was a most fatiguing ride brisbane complained of the heat and the dust and of a mysterious pain in his head and elsie alarmed by his flushed face softened poor papa im so sorry you had to come on this long ride lawson was also genuinely concerned over the senators growing incoherency and privately told the driver to push hard on the reins  when they rounded the sharp point of the black bear mesa and came in sight of the long low halfway house lawson sat up with a jerk there is the mobcamped and waiting for the sheriff  as elsie looked at the swarming figures of the cowboys her mind forecasted tragic events the desperadoes were waiting to lynch cut fingerthat was plain curtis had said he would not surrender his prisoner to be lynched he was coming he would be met by this mob  she clutched lawson by the arm we must warn him  he merely nodded but a look in his eyes gave her to understand that he would do his duty  the cattlemen seeing the wagon whirling round the mesa mounted and massed in stern array believing that the carriage contained the sheriff and his prisoner they were disappointed and a little uneasy when they recognized brisbane the great political boss but with ready wit johnson rode along in front of the gang saying with a wink put up your guns boys this is a meeting in honor of senator brisbane then as a mutter of laughter ran down the line he took off his hat and lifted his voice  boys three cheers for senator brisbanehip hip hurrah  after the cheers were given the horsemen closed round the carriage with cries for a speech  brisbane practised orator and shrewd manipulator rose as the carriage stopped and removed his hat his eyes were dim and the blood seemed about to burst through his cheeks but he was not without selfpossession  gentlemen i thank you for this demonstration but i must ask you to wait till i have rested and refreshed myself with your permission i will then address you  rightright  we can wait they heartily responded and opened a way for the carriage  elsie shuddered as she looked into the rude and cruel faces of the leaders of this lynching party they no longer amused her she saw them now from the standpoint of captain curtis and his wards and realized how little of mercy they would show to their enemies on lawsons lips lay a subtly contemptuous smile and he uttered no worddid not lift a hand till the carriage was at the door  streeter helped the senator out and with unexpected grace presented his hand to elsie i do not need help she said coldly and brushed past him into the little sittingroom which swarmed with excited scrawny tired and tearful women  what is goin on out there have the soldiers put down the pizen critters asked one  youre miss brisbanewe heerd you was all killed at the agency werent you scared  almost contemptuously elsie calmed their fears and by a few questions learned that this house had been made a rallyingpoint for the settlers and that the women were just beginning to feel the depressing effects of being so long away from their homes without rest and proper food  do you think we can go home now  certainly captain curtis will see that you are not harmed she replied and she spoke with all a wifes sense of joy and pride in her husband  weve been camping here for most a week seems like an were all wore out wailed one little woman who had three small children to herd and watch over  brisbane inspirited by an eggnog and a sandwich mounted a washtub on the low porch and began a speecha suave diplomatic utterance wherein he counselled moderation in all things we cant afford at this time to do a rash thing he said and winked jovially at johnson the election coming on is after all the best chance for us to get back at these fool injun apologists so go slow boysgo slow  as these smooth words flowed from his lips elsie burned with shame and anger some newly acquired inward light enabled her to read in the halfhearted dissuasion of her fathers speech a subtle heartless encouragement to violence after election while the cheers were still ringing in her ears at the close of the address elsie felt a touch on her shoulder and turned to face calvin standing close beside her timid and flushed  she held out her hand with a swift rush of confidence  why how do you do mr streeter  im pretty well he said loudly and added in a low voice i want to see you alone he looked about the room the corner least crowded was occupied by a woman nursing a wailing baby come this way shes norwegian she cant understand us  elsie followed him and when he spoke it was in a rapid low mutter is the major goin to come with cut finger  im afraid so  he mustnt you know what this gangs here for  what can we do cant we warn him  well im goin to take a sneak and try it its all my neck is worth to play it on the boys but its got to be done for the major is a fighter and if this mob meets him there will be blood on the moon now dont worry im going to slide right out through the first gate i see and head him off mebbe youd like to write a word or two  you are a real hero she said as she put a little slip of paper into his hand and pressed it there with both of hers  dont do that he said hurriedly theyll think somethings up im doin it for the major hes treated me white all the way along and ill be derned if i let this gang do him  a pain shot through her heart putting her hand to her bosom she said it means everything to me calvin goodbye i am trusting youits life or death to me goodbye     xxx  the capture of the man   the east was saffron and paleblue as crow and the agent drove out of the corral and up the road to the south two horns was the driver crow alone was armed and he wore but his official revolver maynard had been purposely left out of the expedition for curtis did not wish to seem to question in the slightest degree the obedience of his people he preferred to go unarmed and without handcuffs or rope as a friend and adviser not as an officer of the law  the morning was deliciously cool with a gentle wind sliding down from the high peaks which were already glowing with the mornings pink and yellow from some of the tepees in graymans camp smoke was already rising and a few old women could be seen pottering about the cooking lodges while the morning chorus of the dogs and coyotes thickened there was an elemental charm in it all which helped the young soldier to shake off his depression  passing rapidly through the two villages two horns turned to the left and entered upon a road which climbed diagonally up the side of a long low ridge this involved plodding and by the time they reached the summit the sun met them fullfronted in the smaller valley which lay between this ridge and the foothills a rough trail led towards the mountains this way two horns took driving rapidly and silently and soon entered the pines and pinons which form the lower fringe of the vast and splendid robe of green which covers the middle heights of the rocky mountains  after an hour of sharp driving with scarcely a word or gesture crow turned and said cut finger there black wolf his tepee  the trail here took a sharp curve to the left to avoid a piece of stony ground and from a little transverse ridge curtis could look down on a small temporary village the band of black wolf who had located here to cut hay on the marsh  we must surprise him if we can said curtis to crow we must not shoot i will talk to him if he cocks his gun kill him but i dont think he will want to fight  the lads could be heard singing their plaintive songs as they climbed the hills for their ponies smoke was rising from each lodge and children dogs and hens were outdoing each other in cheerful uproar as two horns drove up to where black wolf stood an old man with thin gray hair shielding his eyes with the scant shadow of his bony wrist  ho agent he cried why do you come to see us so early  is cut finger here  yes he is in there he pointed to a tepee near  be silent commanded curtis as he alighted swiftly but without apparent haste or excitement crow instantly followed him alert and resolute as they entered the tepee cut finger still half asleep on his willow hammock instinctively reached for his rifle which lay beneath him on the ground dangerous as a halfawakened rattlesnake  curtis put his foot on the weapon and said pleasantly goodmorning cut finger you sleep late  the young man sat up and blinked stupidly while crow took the gun from beneath the agents foot  curtis signed to black wolf this boy has killed a herder and i have come for him you knew of his deed  i have heard of it the old man replied with a gesture  it is such men who bring trouble on the tribe pursued curtis they must be punished cut finger must go with me down to the agency he must not make more trouble  the news of the agents mission brought every soul hurrying to the tent for cut finger had said i will fight the soldiers if they come  curtis heard them coming and said crow tell all these people outside that cut finger has done a bad thing and must be punished that unless such men are cast out by the tetongs they will always be in trouble  crow lifted up his big resounding voice and recounted what the agent had said and added you shall see we will take this man i crow have said it it will be foolish for any one to resist  the agent sitting before cut finger addressed him in signs i am your friend i am sorry for you i am sorry for any man who does wrong and suffers punishment but you have injured your people you made the white man very angry he came ready to shootyou saw how i turned him away i said i will find the man who shot the herder i will bring himi do not want any one else to suffer then you proclaimed yourself you said i alone did this thing then you went on the hill to fighti cannot allow that no more blood will be shed i will not lie i have come to take you you will be punished you must go with me to the white mans stronghouse  a whimpering cry arose a cry which ended in a sighing moan of heartpiercing uncontrollable agony and curtis turning his face saw the wife of cut finger looking at him from her blanket on the opposite side of the tepee a shout of warning from crow made him leap to his feet and turn  cut finger confronted him his eyes glowing with desperate resolution  sit down commanded the captain using his fist in the sign with a powerful gesture the fugitive could not endure his chiefs eyes he sank back on his couch and sat trembling  if you touch the little father i will kill you said crow gruffly as he stood with drawn revolver in his hand i crow have said it  black wolf was looking on with lowering brow he says the white man was driving his sheep on our land  so he was replied curtis but it is bad for the tetongs when a white man is killed it is better to come and tell me when a redman kills a white man the white men say let us kill all the tetongsspare no one cut finger said he was ready to die well then let him go with me and i will make his punishment as light as i can i am his frienda friend to every tetong i will tell the war chief at pinon city how it was and he will say cut finger was not alone to blamethe white man was also to blame thus the punishment will not be so heavy cut finger is a young man he has many years to live if he will do as i tell him he will come back to his tribe byandby and be a good man  so by putting forth all his skill in gesture he conveyed to cut fingers mind a new ideathe idea of sacrificing himself for the good of the tribe he also convinced the members of black wolfs band that their peace and safety lay in giving him up to their agent and so at last the young desperado rose and followed his chief to the wagon wherein two horns still sat impassive and unafraid  as he put his hand on the carriageseat a convulsive shudder swept over cut finger he folded his arms and lifting his eyes to the hills burst forth in a deathsong a chant so sad so passionate and so searching that the agents heart was wrenched answering sobs and wails broke from the women and the young wife of the singer came and crouched at his feet her little babe in her arms and this was his song      i am going away     i go to my death     the white man has said it     i am to die in a prison     i am young but i must go     i have a wife but i must go     to die among the white men     in the dark     so says the soldier chief  curtis looking into the eyes of black wolf perceived that the old man wavered the wailing of the women the young mans song had roused his racial hatredwhat to him was the killing of a white robber  be quiet commanded curtis and the song ceased get in quick no more singing  the ending of the song left the prisoner in a mood of gloomy yet passive exaltation he took the place indicated and sat with bowed head his hands limply crossed  go on commanded curtis and two horns brought the whip down on the horses as they sprang forward a wail of agony burst from the lips of the bereaved young wife at this cry cut finger again turned upon the agent with hands opened like the claws of a bearhis face contorted with despair curtis seized him in a grip whose crunching power made itself felt to the marrow of the tetongs bones and his eyes piercing with terrible determination shrivelled the resolution of the halfcrazed man he sank back into his seat a hopeless lump of swaying flesh his face a tragic mask and uttered no further word till the sound of a galloping horse made them all turn to see who followed  my wife the prisoner said she carries my baby  this was indeed true the sad little wife was galloping after riding a strong bay pony the reins flapping loose while across the pommel of her saddle she held her small pappoose whose faint wailing told of his discomfort and terror  waitme take pappoose the prisoner said in english with a note of command  curtis was deeply touched he ordered two horns to halt and crow got out and took the babe and handed it to cut finger who received it carefully in his long arms no woman could have been tenderer  as they drove on a big lump rose in the soldiers throat it seemed a treacherous and sinful thing to hand this man over to a savage throng of white men perhaps to be lynched on the road i will not do it he said i will take him to pinon city myself he shall have trial as if he were white i will yield him to the law but not to vengeance  cut finger thereafter spoke no word did not even look back though curtis detected him turning his head whenever the sound of the galloping horse grew faint or died away for a few moments the baby ceased to wail and on the rough ground when the wagon jarred the father held the little one high as in a sling  upon entering the camp of crawling elk they found all the people massed waiting listening and their presence excited the prisoner greatly and he began again to sing his deathchant which now seemed infinitely more touching by reason of the small creature he cradled so lovingly in his arms  be silent commanded curtis you must not sing drive fast two horns  answering wails and fragments of chanting broke from the women one or two cried out take him from the agent but the men shook their heads and sadly watched them pass he has done a foolish thing he must now suffer for it said crawling elk  as they drew up before the door of the parsonage curtis sprang out and said to cut finger  give me the baby he shall be well cared for  the father gave up the child passively and curtis called to jennie  here is a babe that is tired and hungrybe good to it  where is the mother asked jennie as she tenderly received the little brown boy  she is coming he said and the mother galloped up in a few moments and fairly tumbled off her horse see curtis said to her and to the father my sister will give the baby milk and its mother shall also be fed you need not fear both will be taken care of we are your friends  cut finger watched jennie as she carefully carried the baby into the house and as he turned away a look of apathetic misery more moving than any cry settled on his face  maynard who had been standing in the door said in a tone of astonishment did that wild injun carry his papoose all the way down  yes and was as tender of it as a woman too  well ill be hanged theres a whole lot for me to learn about injuns yet want a guard  yes i think it safer there is a good deal of sympathy for this poor chap  i dont blame em very much said maynard take him right down to our guardhouse and ill have payne detail a squad of men to take care of him  i intend taking him to pinon myself i cant find it in my heart to give him over into the hands of these whitestheyd lynch him sure  i believe it replied maynard with conviction  as they passed the agency gate winters and the county attorney stepped out as if they expected to receive the prisoner but the savage grin on the sheriffs face died out as curtis nodded coldly and drove past  that fellow is a wolf did you have any trouble asked maynard  not a bit we surprised him in bed as i planned to do  nice thing your leaving me out in this way  have the brisbanes gone  yes got away about eight oclock lawson went with them though hes coming back to see you clear of this war hes a crackerjack is lawson but the old man has you marked for slaughter  it was good to be able to turn his prisoner over to the bluecoats and feel that he would not be taken away except properly and in order lynching does not flourish under the eyes of a commander like maynard as curtis led his man into the guardhouse and motioned him to a seat he said in signs  you are safe now from the cattlemen i am your friend remember that i myself will take you to the white chiefs big village i will not let the war chief have you i will turn you over to the wise manthe man who will judge your case i will let your wife and your little son go with you so you see i am still your little father i am very sorry you have shot this man but you must be punished i cannot prevent that  as he met the sheriff he said quietly i have decided to accompany you to pinon city  the sheriff was not greatly surprised  oh very well but i dont see the need of it  i do replied curtis and his tone silenced opposition  going immediately to the house curtis flung himself down in his chair and submitted to jennies anxious care she brought him some coffee and biscuit and stood with her hand on his shoulder while he ate well theyre gonelawson and all i never saw a greater change in any one than in that girl do you remember how she was last fall i never supposed i should come to love her i hated her for the treatment of you then buti think she has a different feeling towards us nownot excepting you i thinkshe was crying because she wasgoingawayfromyou  he looked up at her and smiled incredulously your loyalty to me sis is more than i deserve  curtis seized a moment to cross the square to elsies studio eager to see whether she had regarded his wishes or not it was an absurd thing to ask of her and yet he did not regret having done so it would serve as a sort of test of her regard her sympathy now as he stood at the door he hesitatedif it should be bare  he turned the knob and entered the effect of the first impression was exalting satisfying all was in order and the air was deliciously cool and fragrant infilled with some rare and delicate odor each article was in its placeshe had taken nothing but the finished pictures and some sketches which she specially needed scraps of canvas covered with splashes of color were pinned about on the walls the easel stood in the centre of the room and her palette and brushes were on the table the young soldier closed the door behind him and took a seat in deep emotion at that moment he realized to the full his need of her and his irreparable loss all he had suffered before was forgottenswallowed up in the empty hungry ache of his heart the curtains and draperies were almost as much a part of her as her dress and he could not have touched them at the moment so intimately personal did they seem  it appeared that he had not fully understood himself after all this empty temple where she had lived and worked these reminders of her beautiful self were not to be a solace and a comfort after all but a torture he felt broken and unmanned and the aching in his throat grew to an intolerable pain and with a reaction to disdain of himself he rose and went out closing and locking the door     xxxi  outwitting the sheriff   maynard came over just as the wagon was being brought round and with a look of concern on his big red face began now see here curtis youd better take an escort those devils may be hanging round the edge of the reservation say the word and ill send payne and a squad of men  i dont think it at all necessary maynard i dont want to excite the settlers and besides the troops are all needed here i have no fear of the mob while daylight lasts they will not attempt to take the man from me i leave you in command wilson will keep the police out on the hills and report any movement of the mob  maynard saluted very well major when may i look for you to return  not before tomorrow night i shall get in by sundown today for it is all the way down hill the return will be slower  i dont like to see you go away with that cutthroat sheriff  i am not alone said curtis i have two of the faithfulest men in the worldtwo horns and crowboth armed and watchful dont worry about me jack keep yourself alert tonight  the wagon was now standing before the guardhouse and the prisoner was being brought forth by crow cut finger blinking around him in the noonday glare saw his wife already in the wagon and went resignedly towards the agent who beckoned to him  you may sit beside her curtis signed and the youth climbed submissively to his seat mr sheriff you are to take a place beside the driver  winters swollen with rebellion because of the secondary part he had to play surlily consented to sit with two horns  crow you camp here called curtis and the trusted tetong scrambled to his seat drive on two horns  for an hour and more no one spoke but two horns gently urging the horses to their best pace curtis welcomed this silence for it gave him time to take account of many things chief of which was brisbanes violent antagonism he overestimates my importance he thought but that is the way such men succeed they are as thoroughgoing in destroying the opposition as they are in building up their own side  he thought too of that last intimate hour with elsie and wished he had spoken plainer with her it would have been definite if i had secured an answer it would have been a negative of course and yet such is my folly i still hope and so long as there is the slightest uncertainty i shall waste my time in dreaming his mind then turned to the question of the mob there came into his mind again the conviction that they were waiting to intercept the sheriff at the boundary of the reservation but he was perfectly certain that they would relinquish their designs when they found the sheriff reinforced by three determined menone of them an army officer and the agent he had no fear on that score he only felt a little uneasy at leaving the agency  a sharp exclamation from crow brought his dreaming to an end and looking up he saw a horseman approaching swiftly his reins held high his elbows flapping thats young streeter he said on the impulse  so it is replied winters hot with instant excitement i wonder whats his hurry  calvin came up with a rush and when opposite set his horse on his haunches with a wrench of his powerful wrist calling in lazy drawl howdy folks howdy well i see youve got im he remarked to curtis  youve been ridin hard said winters whats your rush anything doin  calvin looked down at his panting reeking horse and carelessly replied oh no im just takin it out o this watcheyed bronco he exchanged a look with the sheriff i thought id ketch ye fore ye left the agency id like a word with you sheriff tumble out here for a minute youll wait a second wont you major  curtis looked up at the sun yes but be quick  calvin slid from his horse and while the sheriff was climbing stiffly down on the opposite side slipped a note into curtiss hand  as the sheriff listened to calvins lowvoiced report curtis glanced at the paper it was in pencil and from elsie the mob is waiting at the halfway house cruel as wolvesturn backfor my sake  curtis crumpled the paper in his hand and called out imperatively come sheriff winters i cannot wait  winters turned away smilingly thats all right cal i didnt understand thats all im glad the boys went home of course the troops settled everything  curtis caught calvins eye and a nod almost imperceptible passed between them and the cowboy was aware that the soldier understood the situation where did you leave the senator  at the halfway house  how was he  feeling well enough to make a speech replied calvin  the other team containing grismore and the reporters was by this time but a few rods away and watching his opportunity curtis signalled stop that wagonhold them here calvin again nodded drive on called curtis and winters smiled with rare satisfaction  some miles before reaching the border of the reservation two horns at a sign from curtis left the main road and began to climb a low ridge to the east  the sheriff turned and called sharply where is he going  he has his orders mr sheriff  hes taking the wrong road it is five miles farther that way  he is following my orders  but i dont see the sense of it  you are only a passenger if you dont care to ride with us you can walk replied curtis and the sheriff settled back into his seat with a curse the second wagon had been left far behind and would undoubtedly keep the main road a mishap curtis had calculated upon  an hour or two of extra travel would not matter especially as the mob was being left safely on the left  the warning from elsie had a singular effect upon the soldier he grew almost gay at the thought of her care of him in some occult way the little card meant a great deal more than its few words if they were delayed at the halfway house they might not reach pinon in time for the afternoon train and soi may see her again  as he neared the boundary of the reservation the sheriff gained in resolution looking backward he saw his own team following outlined like a rock against the sky just topping a ridge and reaching over he laid his hand on the reins and pulled the horses to a stand  right here i take charge he growled im on my own ground get out o there he said to the prisoner and as he spoke he drew his revolver and leaped to the ground  cut finger turned towards curtis whose face was set and stern sit still he commanded with a gesture put up your gun he said to crow who had drawn his revolver ready to defend his prisoner  winters flew into bluster do you defy my authority now im sheriff of this county he shouted your control ends right here this is state territory  curtis eyed him calmly i started out to give this man safe convoy to the prison and im going to do it not only thathe is a ward of the government even when lodged in the county jail and it is my duty to see that he has fair trial then and not till then will i abandon him to the ferocity of your mob i know your plan and i have defeated it do you intend to ride with us  the sheriffs courage again failed him as he looked up into the direct unwavering eagle gaze of the young officer he began to curse well have your hide for this youve gone too far youve defied the laws of the county  drive on said curtis and two horns touched his ponies with the whip  halt or i fire shouted winters  drive on commanded curtis and two horns laid the whip hard on the back of his off horse  winters fired but the bullet went wide he dared not aim to kill cut finger rose as if to leap from the wagon but crow seized him with one great brown paw and thrust his shining gun against his breast sit down brother he said grimly well care for you  the prisoner sank back into his seat trembling with excitement while the wife began to cry piteously  curtis looking back saw the sheriff waving his revolver maniacally but his curses fainted on the way a sudden reaction to humor set in and the young agent laughed a hearty chuckle which made his faithful tetong aids break into sympathetic grins  nevertheless the case was not entirely humorous in a certain sense he had cut athwart the law in this last transaction though in doing so he had prevented an act of violence which would have still further embittered the tribe i am right he said and put away all further doubt  the drive now settled into a race for the jail the sheriff after being picked up by his own party will undertake to overhaul us reasoned curtis but that did not trouble him so much as the thought of what lay before him  the road ran along willow creek winding as the stream itself and curtis could not avoid the thought of an ambuscade on the right were clumps of tall willows capable of concealing horsemen while on the left the hot treeless banks rose a hundred feet above the wagon and the loopings of the track prevented a view of what was coming if the mob should get impatient or if they should suspect his trick it would be easy to send a detachment across the hills and intercept him push hard he signed to two horns  the road was smooth and dusty and descended rapidly so that the horses had little to do but guide the tongue as the wagon rocked and reeled past the ranch houses the settlers had hardly time to discern what manner of man was driving but they were thrown into fierce panic by the clatter of fleeing horses and the cloud of prophetic dust the sheriff was not in sight and no sound of him could be detected in the whiz of their own wheels  at last two horns with his moccasined foot on the brake broke through the hills out upon the valley land with pinon city in sight the mob and the sheriff were alike left behind ambush was now impossible  easy now two horns called curtis with a smile and an explanatory gesture were safe now the angry white men are behind and the reeking dusty begrimed horses fell into a walk  the hour for their arrival in pinon city was fortunate the town was still at supper and in the dusk curtis and prisoner escaped notice they hurried across the main street and on towards the jail which stood on a little knoll just outside the town  as they drew up before the door a young man came out and stared with inquiring gaze  curtis spoke first are you the turnkey  im in charge here yes sir  i am captain curtis the agent this is cut finger charged with the murder of a white man i have brought him in the sheriff is just behind he turned to the prisoner and signed get down here is the stronghouse where you are to stay  cut finger clambered slowly down his face rigid his limbs tremulous with emotion to go to the dark room of the stronghouse was the worst fate that could overtake a free man of the hills and his heart fluttered like a scared bird  it would be a good plan to let his wife go in with him suggested curtis it will save trouble  the poor whimpering girlwife followed her culprit husband up the steps and into the cold and gloomy hall to which they were admitted her eyes on the floor her sleeping child held tightly in her arms when the gate shut behind him curtis signed to the prisoner this advice  now be good do not make any trouble do what these people tell you eat your food i will ask the sheriff to let your wife see you in the morning and then she will go home again she can come once each month to see you he touched the wife on the arm and when she comprehended his gesture she uttered again that whimpering moan and as she bent her head in dumb agony above her babe curtis gently led her to the door leaving cut finger to the rigor of the white mans law     xxxii  an eventful night   at the railway station curtis alighted go to paul ladues he said to two horns put the horses in his corral and feed them well sit down with paul and tomorrow morning at sunrise come for me at the big hotel be careful dont go on the street tonight the white men have evil hearts  we know said crow with a clip of his forefinger we will sleep like the wolf with one eye open  as they drove away curtis hurried into the station and calling for a blank dashed away at a brief telegram to the commissioner while revising it he overheard the clerk say in answer to a question over the telephone no senator brisbane did not get away on sixteen he is still at the sherman house  curtis straightened and his heart leaped then i can see elsie again he thought hastily pencilling two or three shorter messages he handed them in and hurried up the street towards the hotel eager to relieve her anxiety  by this time the violet dusk of a peaceful night covered the town the moon low down in the west was dim but the stars were beginning to loom large in the wonderful deep blue to the east the air was windless no cloud was to be seen and yet the soldier had a touch of uneasiness i wish i had brought my faithful men with me to the sherman house however there is no real cause to worry paul is more tetong than bordermanand will protect themif only they keep off the street  he began to meet men in closepacked groups on the sidewalkroughly clad citizens who seemed absorbed in the discussion of some important event a few of them recognized him as he passed and one called in a bitter tone there goes the cur himself curtis did not turn though the tone more insulting than the words made his heart hot with battle it was plain that the sheriff and his party had already entered and reported their defeat a saloon emptied a mob of loudvoiced men upon the sidewalk before him and though he feared trouble he pushed steadily forward the ruffians gave way before his resolute feet but he felt their hate beating like flame upon his face he dared not turn a hairsbreadth to the right nor to the left nothing was better than to walk straight on they will not shoot me in the back he reasoned and beyond a volley of curses he remained unassaulted  the rotunda of the hotel was filled with a different but not less dangerous throng of excited politicians and leading citizens who had assembled to escort brisbane to the operahouse the talk though less profane than that of the saloon loafers was hardly less bitter against the agent mingled with these district bosses were a halfdozen newspaper men who instantly rushed upon curtis in frank and boyish rivalry captain what is the news they breathlessly asked with pads and pencils ready for his undoing  all quiet was his curt reply  butbuthow about  all lies he interrupted to say and pushed on to the desk is senator brisbane and party still here he asked as he signed his name in the book  the clerk applied the blotter yes he is still at supper  the young soldier took time to wash the dust from his face and hands and smooth his hair before entering the diningroom at the threshold he paused and took account of his enemies brisbane and three of his most trusted supporters still sitting at coffee were holding a lowvoiced consultation at a corner table while lawson and elsie sat waiting some distance away and near an open window the parkers were not in view  elsie at sight of her lover rose impulsively and her face tired and pale flushed to a beautiful pink her lips formed the words why there is captain curtis but her voice was inaudible  he hastened forward with eyes only for her and she met him with both hands outstretchedeager joyous  oh how good it is to see you we were so alarmedcalvin warned you  yes he met me just before i left the reservation  but i expected you to bring soldiers how did you escape did you find the cattlemen gone  i flanked them his face relaxed into humor discretion is a sort of valor sometimes i took the willow road  lawson now joined them and in his handclasp was a brothers regard for the soldier his smile was exultant good work i knew calvin could be trusted it looked bad for cut finger when we reached the halfway house  you must be hungry exclaimed elsie sit here and i will order something for you  i was hungry an hour ago he said meaningly but now i am not but i am tired he added where are the parkers  elsie laughed on their way to civilization they fled on the uptrain  the town is aflame said lawson you and your tetongs are an issue here tonight a big meeting is called and the senator is to speak he has just discovered you he added glancing towards brisbane who had risen and was glaring at curtis his small eyes hot as those of an angry bear  excuse me wont you pleaded elsie rising hastily i must go to him  curtis also rose and looked soberly into her eyes may i not see you again  she hesitated yes im not going to the meeting come to our parlor when you are finished supper  he remained standing till she joined her father and passed from the room then he turned towards lawson who said  seriously my dear curtis you are in danger here i hope you will not go out this evening even uncle sams blue might not prove a protection in the dark of a night like this where did you house your men  at ladues with orders not to leave the corral  quite right where is the sheriff  this question brought a humorous light into the young soldiers eyes when i saw him last he was on sagehen flat swinging his revolver and cursing me and he told the story  lawson grew grave im sorry you had to do that it will give your enemies another grip on you its a mere technicality of course but theyll use it you must watch every one of your clerks from this on theyll trump up a charge against you if they can and secure a courtmartial this election is really the last dying struggle of the political banditti of the state and they will be defeated take tonight as an example the reckless devils the loud of mouth are alone in evidence the better class of citizens dare not protestdare not appear on the streets but dont be deceived you have your supporters even here in the midst of this saturnalia of hate you are an issue  curtis grimly smiled i accept the challenge they can only order me back to my regiment  as for brisbane he is on the point of collapse he has lost his selfcontrol he has attained a fixed notion that you are his most dangerous enemy the mention of your name throws him into fury i lost patience with him today and opened fire you are doomed to defeat i said to him you represent the ignoble greedy conscienceless hustler and speculator not the peaceful justiceloving citizen of this state your dominion is gone the reign of order and peace is about to begin if it were not for elsie i would publicly denounce him for his election would work incalculable injury to the west but he cant fill the legislature with his men as he did twelve years ago he will fail of election by fifty votes  i hope so responded curtis with a sigh as lawson rose but i have no faith in the courage of the better element virtue is so timid and evil is always so fully organized  after lawson left him curtis hurriedly finished his supper and went his way to his room for a moments rest through the open windows he could hear the cheering which greeted brisbanes entrance into the operahouse which faced upon the little square before the hotel the street was thronging with noisy boys and at intervals a band of young herders clattered into the square their horses thickened along the hitchingpoles and the saloons swarmed with men already inflamed with drink the air seemed heavy oppressive electrical and the shrill cheers which rose above the dull rumble of pounding bootheels in the hall possessed a savage animal vehemence again a sense of impending disaster swept over the young officer i am tired and nervous he thought surely law and order rules in a civilized community like this  he put away all thoughts of war as he followed the boy up the stairway to the brisbane private parlor and became the lover palpitant with the hope that he was about to see elsie alone  she met him at the door her face aquiver with feeling a note of alarm in her voice have you heard the cheering they are denouncing you over there  i suppose so but lets not talk of such unimportant matters this is our last evening together and i want to forget the storm outside since i left you last night i have had a most remarkable experience and i  oh you mean catching the murderer tell me about it  no oh no that is not worth telling i mean something more intimately personal shrill yells from across the way interrupted him and elsie rose and shut the window i hate them they are worse than savages she said please dont mind them  he went on i was about to say i had a deal of time to think on my long ride this morning and i reached some conclusions which i want to tell you about when my prisoner was safe in the guardhouse i went over to see how my little temple of art lookedi mean your studio of course i closed the door and dropped into one of the big chairs hoping to gain rest and serenity in the beauty and quiet of the place but i didnt i was painfully depressed  she opened her eyes very wide at this why  because everything i saw there emphasized the irrevocable loss i had suffered i couldnt endure the thought of it and i fled i could not remain without weeping and you know a man is ashamed of his tears but when i got your note of warning i flung conscience to the winds it is not a crime to love a woman i said i will write to her and say to her i love you no matter what happens and now i find you here i tell it to you instead of writing it  she was facing him with a look of perplexity and alarm one hand laid upon her throat seemed to express suffering when she spoke her voice was very low  what do you expect me to say you make it so hard for me why do you tell me this  because i could not rest till i had spoken for a long time i thought you were bound to lawson and since then ive tried to keep silent because of my poverty andno one knows better than i the unreason of it alli do not ask you to speak except to say i am sorry when i found you were still within reach the desire to let you know my feeling overcame every other consideration i cant even do the customary thing and ask you to wait for my future is as uncertain as my present but if you could say you loved mea little he paused abruptly as though choked into silence by a merciless hand  elsie remained silent with her eyes turned towards the window her hands in her lap and at last he went on  if your father is a true prophet i shall be ordered back to my regiment that will hurt me but it wont ruin me exactly it would be a shameful thing if the department sacrificed me to expediency but politicians are wonderful people if you were not so much an artist and andrew brisbanes daughter i would ask you to come to me and help me do my work but i cant quite do thatyet i can only say you are more to me now than any other soul in the world i do this because i cant keep from it he repeated in poor ending  ive heard that the best way to make a woman love a man is to persecute the man she replied smiling a little though her eyes were wet when you were apparently triumphant i hated younow she hesitated and a sudden timidity shook her  he sprang up can you carry out the figure i dare you to finish the sentence do you care for me a little his face suddenly illuminated moved her powerfully  im afraid i dowait please she stopped him with a gesture you mustnt think i mean more than i do my mind is all in a whirl now it isnt fair to hurry me i must take time to consider your being poor and an indian agent wouldnt make any difference to me if ibut i must be sure i respect youi admire you very muchand last night when i said goodbye i felt a sharp pain here she put her hand to her throat but i must be sure there are so many things against it she ended covering her eyes with her hand in piteous perplexity  his eyes were alight his voice eager it would be such a glorious thing if you could join me in my work  the mention of his work stung her oh no it is impossible i should die here i have no sense of duty towards these poor vagabonds im sorry for thembut to live hereno no you must not ask it you must go your way and i will go mine you are only torturing me needlessly  forgive me he pleaded i did not mean to do so  she continued wildly cant you see how crazy how impossible it is i admire youi believe in your workit is magnificent but i cant live your life my friends my art mean too much to me  there was a tremulous passionate pleading which failed of finality it perplexed her lover it did not convince him  you are right of course you are right he said again but that does not help me to bear the pain of your loss i cant let you go out of my lifeutterlyi cant do iti will nothark what is that  a faint faroff thundering sound interrupted him a rushing roar as of many horsemen rapidly approaching hastening to the window curtis bent his head to listen it sounds like a cavalry charge here they come cowboysa mob of them can it be yarpes gang yes that is precisely what it is yarpe leading them into some further deviltry  whooping and cursing and urging their tired horses with quirt and spur the desperadoes somewhat thinned of ranks pouring by in clattering pounding rushas orderless as a charging squad of sioux warriorsturned up a side street and disappeared almost before any one but curtis was aware of them  they are bent on mischief said the soldier as he turned upon the girl all personal feeling swept away by the passing mob they have followed me in to force the jail and hang cut finger he caught up his cap i must prevent it  no no cried elsie seizing his arm you must not go out in the street tonightthey will kill youplease dont goyou have done your duty now let the mayor act i beg of you  dear girl i must thwart this lynching party i would be disgraced dont you see they have seized the moment when the citizens are all in the hall away from the jail to do this thing i must alarm the town and prevent them  even as he pleaded with her the tumult in the hall broke forth again roared for a moment in wild crescendo and then ceased instantly strangely a moments silence followed and a confused murmur arose quite different from any sound which had hitherto emanated from the hall a powerful voice dominated all others and through the open windows the words of command could be distinctly heard keep back there keep your seats  the meeting is breaking up exclaimed curtis some one has alarmed them see they are pouring out to prevent this crazy mob from carrying out its plan  the shouting ceased but the trample of feet and the murmur of voices thickened to a clamor and elsie turned white with a new fear they are rushing across the square perhaps they are coming for you  i dont think so they would not dare to attack methey hate me but  her overwrought nerves gave way a panic seized her hide hide they will kill you she cried out hoarsely  no i am going to help them defend the jail  for my sake she pleaded dont leave me listen they are coming she whispered the sound of many feet could be heard in the lobby below the roar of a hundred voices came up the stairway but even the excited girl could now detect something hushed and solemn in the soundsomething mournful in the measured footsteps up the stairs  it is father she cried with a flash of divination something has happened to him and with this new terror in her face she hurried out into the hall  curtis reached her side just as the head of the procession topped the stairway  brisbane upborne by lawson and a tall young stranger first appeared followed by a dozen men who walked two and two with bared heads and serious faces as if following a hearse the stricken mans face was flushed and knobby and his eyelids drooped laxly like those of a drunkard he saw nothing and his breathing was labored  father what has happened called elsie tell mequick  a touch of vertigo answered lawson soothingly the doctor says nothing serious  are you the doctor she turned to the young man  yes dont be alarmed the senator has overtaxed himself a little that is all and needs rest show me his bed and we will make him comfortable  elsie led the way to the bedroom while curtis stood helplessly facing the crowd in the hall lawson relieved the situation by coming out a few moments later to say  gentlemen the doctor thanks you and requests you to leave the senator to rest as quietly as possible  after this dismissal had dispersed the onlookers lawson turned to curtis the old mans work as a speaker is done rather tragic business dont you think he was assailing you with the utmost bitterness his big right fist was in the air like a hammer when he fell but it was his last effort  curtis seized his hand and said i envy you your chance to go with her and serve her his voice changed the mob did you hear yarpe and his men pass  no when  not ten minutes ago i fear some mischief  the doctor appeared mr lawson a moment  as lawson hurried into the sickroom a faroff faint volley of pistolshots broke the hush that had settled over the square distant yells succeeded accompanied by a sound as of some giant hammering the young soldier lifted his head like a young lion listening to a battlecall they are beating in the gates he said for a moment he hesitated but only for a moment she is safe he thought with a glance towards elsies door my man and the poor little wife are not and he rushed down the stairway and out into the street with intent to find and defend his faithful men     xxxiii  elsie confesses her love   as he paused on the steps to the hotel a gust of bitter rage swept over him what can i do against this implacable town oh for a squad of the boys in blue  the street and square were filled with men all running as to a fire from left to righta laughing jesting throng along the hitchingpoles excited and jocular cowboys were loosing their ponies and leaping to their saddles some excitable citizen had begun to ring the firebell and women bareheaded and white with fear were lining the sidewalks and leaning from windows the town resembled an anthill into which a fleeing bison has planted a foot  oh sir cried one young mother as she caught sight of curtis are the injuns coming  no he replied bitterly these marauders are not indians they are noble citizens and set off at a run towards the corral in which two horns and crow were camped the tumult behind him grew fainter and at last died to a murmur and only one or two houses showed a light  ladues was an old ranch on the river around which the town of pinon had for twenty years been slowly growing the cabin was of stone low and strong and two sides of it formed the corner of a low corral of cottonwood logs in this enclosure teamsters for two bits were allowed to camp and feed their horses a rickety gate some fifty feet south of the house stood ajar and curtis entered the yard calling sharply for crow wing and two horns no one replied searching the stalls he found the blankets wherein they had lain but the tumult had undoubtedly called them forth into danger  hurrying to the house he knocked most vigorously at the doorto no effect the shack was also empty closing the door with a slam the young officer now thoroughly alarmed turned back towards the hotel a vast confused clamor growing each moment louder added edge to his apprehension the crowd was evidently returning from the jail jubilant and remorseless upon reaching the corner of the square curtis turned to the left with the design of encircling it hoping to find the two redmen looking on from a doorway on the outskirts of the throng  he had crossed but one side of the plaza when a band of cowboys dashed in from the opposite corner with swinging lariats whooping shrilly in close pursuit of a flying footman a moment later a rope looped the fugitive fell and the horsemen closed round him in joyous clamor like dogs around a fox  with a fear that this was one of his men curtis raised a great shout but his voice was lost in the rush and roar of the throng pouring in towards the fugitive in fierce rage he rushed straight towards the whirling mass of horsemen but before he had passed half the intervening space a horseman circled the pavilion and the popping of a revolver swift yet with deliberate pauses began wild yells broke forth the pursuers scattered other revolvers began to crack and as the press of horsemen reeled back curtis perceived calvin dismounted and bareheaded with his back against the wall of the little wooden bandstand defiant a revolver in each hand holding the mob at bay while over his head a light sputtered and sizzled  a lane seemed to open for curtis as he ran swiftly in towards the writhing ensnared captive on the ground it was two horns struggling with the ropes which bound him and just as his little father bent over him the big tetong freed himself and with a sliding rush entered the shadow by calvins side instantly his revolver began to speak  curtis left alone in the full light of the lamp on the pavilion raised his arms and shouted hold cease firing the crowd recognized him and fell silent the army blue subdued them and those who had done the shooting began to edge away  for a moment the young soldier could not speak so furious was he but at last he found words cowards is this your way of fightinga hundred to one where is your mayor have you no law in this town he turned to calvin who stood still leaning against the pavilion are you hurt  calvin lifted one dripping hand i reckon im punched a few my right arm feels numb and the blood is fillin my left boot but im all here sure thing but even as he spoke he reeled curtis caught him he smiled apologetically that left leg o mine sure feels like a hitchinpost reckon some one must o clipped a nerve somewhere  two horns seized him by the other arm just as winters blustered into the circle whats going on here whos doin this shootin  this is a good time to ask that remarked curtis where were you twenty minutes ago  calvin struggled to get his right hand free let me have a crack at the beast he pleaded i saw you he said to winters you were in the lynching crowd you sneak you hung round in the shadow like a coyote  curtis tried to calm him come this wont do calvin you are losing blood and must have a doctor come to the hotel  as they halfcarried him away the young rancher snarled back like a wounded wolf i disown the whole cowardly pack of ye i put my mark on some of ye too  the crowd was now so completely with calvin that winters hastened to explain cal is my deputy he was acting inside his duty he was trying to keep the peace and you had no business fightin and proceeded to arrest some fairly innocent bystanders while the wounded desperadoes were being swiftly hidden away by their friends and the remaining citizens of the town talked of what should have been done  calvin continued to explain as they hurried him through the excited throng i tried to stand em off at the jail he said but i couldnt get near enough my cayuse was used up oh you was there he called to a tall man with a new sombrero i saw you bill vawney and ill get you for it ive spotted you  he was enraged through every fibre of his strong young body and only the iron grip of the persistent men kept him from doing battle  as they neared the hotel curtis looking up glimpsed elsies white face at the window and waved his cap at her she clapped her hands in joy of his return but did not smile the hotel lobby was packed with a silent mass of men but the landlord with authoritative voice called out clear the way gentlemen and a lane opened for them right in here he added and led the way to the parlor bedroom the captain and calvin were now most distinguished of citizens nothing was too good for them  bring a physician said curtis  right here replied a cool clear voice and doctor philipps stepped to calvins side and relieved two horns  the young rancher sank down on the bed limply but smiled as he explained im only singed a little doc they had me foul you see i was in the light but i handed one or two of them something they didnt like i left a keepsake with em they wont forget me soon  the physician pressed him back upon the bed and began to strip his clothes from him be quiet for five minutes and ill have you in shape we must close up your gashes  curtis relieved of part of his anxiety then asked how is the senator  pretty comfortable no danger  dont leave me major called calvin as curtis turned away to seek elsie dont let this chap cut me up im no centipede i need all my legs  there was genuine pleading in the boys voice and curtis came back and took a chair near him while the doctor probed the wounds and dressed them the officers heart was very tender towards the reckless warmhearted young rancher as he watched his face whiten and the lips stiffen in the effort to conceal his pain calvin youve been loyal all through he said and we wont forget it  at last when the wounds were bandaged and the worst of the pain over curtis turned to two horns and signed  where is crow and the wife of cut finger  i do not know  i will go find him you remain here do not fear you are safe now sit down by calvins bed you will sleep here tonight  as he made his way through the closepacked mass of excited men in the lobby and before the hotel curtis met no hostile face it seemed that all men were become his friends and eager to disclaim any share in the mobs action he put their proffered hands aside and hurried back to ladues which he found closebarred and dark  whos there called a shaking voice as he knocked  captain curtis where is crow  in here was the answer in joyful voice as he opened the door ladue reached his hand to the agent my god im glad it is you i was afraid youd been wiped out where is two horns  crow with his revolver still gripped in his hand stepped forward his face quivering with emotion little father it is good to see you you are not hurt where is two horns  safe in the big house with me the evil white men are gone you will camp here you and the wife of cut finger he signed as he saw the cowering form of the little wife  ladue a big hulking pockmarked halfbreed began to grin i was ascared i sure was i thought we was all goin to hang old bill yarpe was out for game  the better citizens are in control now replied curtis you are safe but youd better remain in the house till morning  as curtis made his way through the crowd some one raised a cheer for major curtis and the cry was taken up by a hundred voices indignant citizens shouted well stand by you major well see justice done  curtis as he reached the stairway turned and coldly said make your words good for four days a mob of two hundred armed men have menaced the lives of my employés and my wards and you did nothing to prevent them i am glad to see you appreciate the horror and the disgrace of this nights doings if you mean what you say let no guilty man escape make this night the memorable end of lawlessness in your country  we will roared a big broadfaced blackbearded man and the crowd broke into another roar of approval  elsie was waiting at the top of the stairs tense and white her eyes burned down into his with a singular flame as she cried out  why didnt you come to me sooner why do you walk so slowly are you hurt tell me the truth  no only tired he answered as he reached her side  she put out her hand and touched his breast you are you are all bloody take off your coat let me see  no its not mine it is poor calvins he was badly wounded he leaned against me  but i saw you standing in the pistolfire take it off i say her voice was almost frenziedly insistent  he removed his coat in a daze of astonishment and she cried out triumphantly see i was right your shirt is soaked you are wounded  true enough he replied looking down in surprise at a big stain on his shoulder ive been singed as calvin calls it it cant be serious for i have not felt it  a sudden faintness seized upon elsie as she gazed fixedly upon the telltale stain a gray whiteness passed over her face oh god suppose you had been killed she whispered  in that shuddering whisper was the expression of the girls complete and final surrender and curtis did not question did not speak he took her in his arms to comfort her  my sweetheart you do love me i doubt no more my poverty your wealth what do they matter  she suddenly started away oh your wound where is the doctor go to him  the touch of your lips has healed me he protested but she insisted  go you are bleeding she commanded and so reluctantly lingeringly with most unmilitary sloth he turned away made numb to any physical pain by the tenderness in her voice  as the young surgeon was dressing the gash he said well captain things happen in the west  yes the kind of things which ought not to happen anywhere i suppose they lynched poor cut finger  no they merely shot him and dragged him to death as near as i can learn  curtis clinched his fists ah the devils where is the body  back in the corridor of the jail  curtis pondered the effect of this news on the tribe its a little difficult to eliminate violence from an inferior race when such cruelty is manifested in those we call their teachers  he sent for ladue who was deep in discussion of the evenings events with crow and two horns and said to him do not tell the wife of cut finger of the death of her husband wait till morning what the sheriff will do with the body i do not know tomorrow say to her all is over go with the agent it will do her no good to remain here goodnight                                       it was hard to realize in the peaceful light of the following morning that the little square had been the scene of so much cruelty and riot the townspeople came forth yawning and lax and went about their duties mechanically crow wing and two horns who would camp nowhere but on the floor of curtiss room were awake at dawn conversing in signs in order not to disturb the little father  he waking a little later called to them in greeting and said now all is quiet the white men are sorry you are safe go to pauls eat and get ready we must start at once for the agency cut finger did an ill deed and brought trouble on us all now he is dead but good may come out of it go tell the little wife be gentle with her say to her i wish her to go home with us  silently soberly the two redmen left the room and curtis dressed and went at once to find calvin the boy looked up as curtis entered and cheerily called hello major ive had a lively dream i dreamed there was some gunplay goin on out in the square and you and i were in it was that right  ive a sore place here on my shoulder that says you are how do you feel can you travel if you can ill take you home in my buckboard  i can travel all right but i havent any home to go to the old man and i havent hitched very well for a year and this will just about turn me out on the range  well come home with me then jennie will soon have you all right again shes a famous nurse and will look out for you till your mother comes over as she will mothers dont go back on their boys  a curious dimness came into the bold keen eyes of the wounded youth major thatll suit me better than anything else i know  very well if the doctor says you can travel well go along together replied curtis  he was eager to see elsie and was pacing impatiently up and down the hall when lawson met him smiling imperturbable well captain how are you this morning  have you seen miss brisbane  no she is still asleep i hope the senator is conscious but in a curious state seems not to know or care where he is his troubles are over  even as he spoke a maid came from elsies room to say that her mistress would breakfast in her own parlor and wished both mr lawson and captain curtis to join her in half an hour  lawson in discussing the events of the night was decidedly optimistic this outbreak will bring about a reaction he said with conviction you will find every decent man on your side today  i hope so responded curtis but last nights mob made me long for my grayhorse troop  when they entered the little parlor elsie rose and passed straight to curtis without coquetry or concealment how is your wound did you sleep  he assured her that he was almost as well as ever and not till she had convinced herself of the truth did she turn to lawson osborne i can never thank you enough for your good kind help  osborne protested that he had done nothing worth considering and they took seats at the tablea subdued and quiet group for lawson was still suffering from his loss and the lovers could not conceal from themselves the knowledge that this was their last meeting for many long months elsie was a being transformed so tender so wilful so strangely sweet and womanly was she in every smile and in every gesture  they dwelt upon impersonal topics so long as lawson remained but he being ill at ease hastened with his coffee and soon made excuse to withdraw leaving them alone for a moment they faced each other and then with a wistful cadence in his voice curtis said dear girl its hard to say goodbye now just when i have found you but i must return at once  oh must you cant you wait till we gothis afternoon  no i must be the first to carry this dreadful news to my people  you are right of course but ill miss you so and you need me say you need me  need you of course i do but you cannot stay with me and i cannot go with you  i know i know she sighed resignedly but it hurts all the same  this tumult will die out soon he went on in the effort to comfort her and then i can come on to washington for a visit i warn you ive lost all my scruples seventeen hundred million dollars are as straws in my path now that i know you really care for me  i dont feel rich now i feel very poor you must come to washington soon  i warn you that when i come i will ask hard things of you he rose and his face darkened but my duty calls  she came to him and yielded herself to his embrace my queenly beautiful girl it is sweet to have you here in my arms but i must say goodbyegoodbye  in spite of his words he held her till she with an instinctive movement pushed from his arms gogo quick she exclaimed in a low imperative voice  not staying to wonder at the meaning of her strange dismissal he turned and left the room without looking back  only after he had helped calvin into the wagon and had taken his seat beside him did the young soldier lift his eyes in search of her face at the window she was looking down upon him tears were on her cheeks but she blew a kiss from her fingertips not caring if all the world were there to see     xxxiv  seedtime   as lawson predicted the very violence of this outburst of racial hatred was its cure a reaction set in the leaders of brisbanes party with loud shouts ordered their harriers back to their lairs while the great leader himself oblivious to daylight or to darkness was hurried home to washington the tetongs returned to their camps and haymaking the troops drilled peacefully each afternoon in the broiling heat while curtis bent to his work again with a desperate sort of energy as if by so doing he could shorten the long hot days which seemed wellnigh interminable after the passing of elsie and her friends  in a letter announcing their safe arrival in washington elsie said       i am going to see the president about you as soon as he      returns from the mountains papa is gaining but takes no      interest in anything he is pitifully weak but the doctor      thinks he will recover if he will only rest his brain is worn      out and needs complete freedom from care congress has      adjourned finally i am told that your enemies expect to secure      a courtmartial on the charge of usurping the authority of the      sheriff osborne says not to worry for nothing will be done      now till the president returns and he is confident that the      department will sustain youthe fact that the violence you      feared did actually take place has robbed your enemies of their      power  nevertheless the fight against the tetongs and himself went on with everincreasing rancor during july and august and each congressional candidate was sharply interrogated as to his attitude towards the removal bill the antiadministration papers boldly said if we win and we will well cut the comb of this bantam well break his sabre over his back  to this the opposition made answer were no lovers of the redman but captain curtis is an honorable soldier doing his duty and it will not be easy for you even if victorious to order a courtmartial  this halfhearted defence gave courage to those who took the high ground that the time for lynching had gone by the tetongs have rights which every decent man is bound to respect no matter how much he personally dislikes the redskin  during the last days of august a letter came from elsie full of comforting assurances both public and private being more intimate and tender in tone than any that had preceded it and full of sprightly humor too it began       my dear soldierive been so busy fighting your enemies i      couldnt write a letter ive met both the secretary and the      commissionertheir desks are said to be full of screeds      against youand ive been to see the president he wasnt a      bit gallant but he listened he glowered at me not unkindly      while i told your story im afraid i didnt phrase it very      well but he listened i brought out all the good points i      could think of i said mr president captain curtis is the      most disinterested man in the indian service he is sacrificing      everything for his plans what are his plans he asked so      abruptly that i jumped i then spoke learnedly of irrigating      ditches and gardens you would have laughed had you heard me      and i said if he is ordered back to his regiment mr      president these poor people will be robbed again does mr      blank of new york endorse captain curtis he asked i didnt      see what this led to but i answered that i did not know hes      a friend of yours isnt he he asked whom do you mean i      said and my cheeks burned then he smiled you neednt      worry he said banging the table with his fist ill keep      captain curtis where he is if every politician in the state      petitions for his removal i liked his wooden cussword and i      thanked him and jumped up and hurried home to write this      letter the secretary told osborne that the bill for buying out      the settlers would certainly go through next winter and that      your plans were approved by the whole department so you see      you are master of the situation and can plan as grandly as you      wishthe entire reservation is yours       it is still hot here and now that my lobbying is done i am      going to the seashore where papa is and i know i shall wish      you were with me to enjoy it i am so sorry for you and jennie      my heart aches for you think of it the cool beautiful ocean      will be singing me to sleep tonight i wish i could send you      some fruit and some ices i know you are longing for them       i wonder how it will all turn out will you be east this      winter perhaps ill help you celebrate the opening of your new      gardens next spring wouldnt you like me to come out and      break a bottle of wine over the first plough or watergate or      something if you do maybe ill come if you write address me      at the brunswick crescent beach i wish you could come and see      me hereyou look so handsome in your uniform  the soldiers answer was not a letter it was a packet he began by writing sorrowfully       dearest girli fear i shall not be able to get away this      winter there is so much here that requires my care if the      bill passes the people will be stirred up if it doesnt pass      the settlers will be uneasy and i shall be most imperatively      necessary here nothing would be sweeter to me than a visit to      you at the beach as a boy i knew the seashore intimately and      to wall the sands with you would be to revive those sweet      careless boy memories and unite them with the deepest emotions      of my lifemy love for you dear one it almost makes me      willing to resign in a sense it would be worth it i would      resign only i know i am not losing the delight foreveri am      only postponing it a year       i have thought pretty deeply on my problem dearest and ive      come to this conclusion when two people love each other as we      do neither poverty nor richesnothing but duty should      separate them your wealth troubled me at first i knew i could      not give you the comfortsnot to say luxuriesyou were      accustomed to and i knew that my life as a soldier would      always make even a barrack a place of uncertain residence i      must stand to my guns here till i have won my fight then i may      ask for a transfer to some field where life would not be so      hard if only there were ways to use your great wealth in      helping these people i would rejoice to be your agent in the      matter       i am a penniless suitor but a good soldier i can say that      without egotism i think i could have acquired money had i      started out that way of course i cannot do it now perhaps my      knowledge and training will come to supplement and give power      to your wealth i must work i am not one to be idle if i go      on workingdevisingin my own way then my selfrespect would      not be daunted even though you were worth ten millions instead      of one i am fitted to be the head of a departmentlike that      of forestry or civil engineering after my work here is      finished i may ask for something of that kind but i am      resolved to do my duty here first i like your suggestion about      the watergate i hold you to that word my lady one year from      now when my gardens are ready for the sickle i will have the      criers announce a harvesthome festival and you must come and      dance with me among my people and then perhaps i will take a      little vacation and return with you to the east and be happy      with you among the joyous of the earth for a little season      beyond that i dare not plan  the administration was sustained and brisbanes forces were beaten back the better elements of the state long scattered disintegrated and without voice spoke and with majesty rebuking the cruelty the barbarism and the blatant assertion of men like musgrove and streeter who had made the state odious even winters the sheriff was defeated and a fairly humane and decent citizen put in his place and this change close down to the people was most significant of all now i have hope of the courts said curtis to maynard  if the tetongs did not at once apprehend the peace and comfort which the defeat of brisbanes gang and the passage of the purchase bill assured to them they deeply appreciated the significance of the immediate withdrawal of the settlers they rejoiced in fulltoned song as their implacable and sleepless enemies drove their heavily laden wagons across the line leaving their farms sheds and houses to the government for the use of the needy tribe  the urgency of the case being fully pleaded the whole readjustment was permitted to be made the following spring and the powers of the agent and his employés were taxed to the uttermost when the order actually came to hand curtis mounted his horse and rode from camp to camp carrying the good news calling the members of each band around him he told the story of their victory  your days of hunger and cold will soon be over he said the white man has gone from the reservation the water of the streams the ploughed fields are all yours now we must set to work every one will have good ground all will share alike and every one must work we must show the great father at washington that we are glad of his kindness our friends will not be ashamed when they come to see us and look upon our corn and wheat  every man woman and child did as they had promised they laid hands to the duties appointed them and did so merrily they moved at once to the places designated a mighty shifting of dwellings took place first of all and when this was finished they set to work they built fences they dug ditches they ploughed and they planted cheery as robins even the gaunt old women lifted their morose faces to the sun and muttered unaccustomed thanks the old men no longer sat in complaining council but talked of the wonderful things about to be  ho have you heard cried one grayman lives in the house the white man has left elk too two horns sleeps in the house above grayman and is not afraid ah it is wonderful  the more thoughtful dwelt in imagination on the reservation completely fenced and saw the hills swarming with cattle as in the olden time it swarmed with the wild black buffalo they helped at the gardens these old men and as they rested on their hoes and listened to the laughter of the women and children they said one to the other our camp is as it was in the days when game was plenty every one is smiling our worst days are over the white mans road is very long and runs into a strange country but while swift eagle leads we follow  there was commotion in every corral where longhaired men in leggings and with feathered ornaments in their hats were awkwardly breaking fiery ponies to drive for teams were in sharp demand the young men who formerly raced horses for lack of other things to do and in order not to die of inertness now became the hilarious teamsters of each valley every person white or red who could give instruction in ditching and planting was employed each hour of the day the various camps were as busy as anthills and as full of cheer as a flock of magpies  curtis was everywhere superintending the moving of barns the building of cabins and the laying out of lands each night he returned to his bed so tired he could not lie flat enough but happy in the knowledge that some needed and permanent improvement had that day been made lawson faithful to his post came on from washington and was a comfort in ways less material than wielding a hoe he went about encouraging the people at their work and his words had the quality of a poem  you see how it is he said you need not despair it is not true that the redmen are to vanish from the earth they are now to be happy and have plenty of food the white people at last have found out the way to help you  maynard got a short leave of absence and came over to see the hustle as he called it and to visit jennie who still refused to leave her post though she had practically consented to his proposal we will see she had said if george marries then i will feel free to go with you but not now  maynard expressed the same astonishment as ever a man may fight a people a lifetime and never really know em now i consider it marvellous the way these devils work  calvin after his recovery came seldom to the agency he recognized the power and the fitness of captain maynards successful courtship and though jennie wrote twice inviting him to call he did not come and did not even reply till she had almost forgotten her own letters in a very erratic and laborious screed he conveyed his regrets im powfle bizzy just now the old man is gone east an that thros all the work of the ranch onto me ime just as mutch obliged jennie did not laugh at this letter she put it away with a sighpoor boy     xxxv  the battle with the weeds   between the planting and the reaping lay the sunsmitten summertime and a battle with the weeds it was a period demanding patience and understanding in curtis for as the first flush of enthusiasm over the sowing died away apathy and indifference sprang up naturally as thistles these childlike souls said behold we have done our part now let mother earth and the father sun bring forth the harvest we cannot ripen the grain we can only wait besides we are weary  to them harvest should follow seeding without further effort they were like boys wearied with waiting for the trees to grow the seed and the apple were too far apart curtis understanding this lack of training in their lives did not allow himself to express the impatience he sometimes felt he told them that the new life they were to lead involved constant care but care would bring a reward in the old days when you hunted these things were not so he also made honorable examples of men like two horns and cranes voice who kept their gardens clean of all noxious plants  he organized mimic warparties today he said the warriors of elk will go forth with me against these evil ones the weeds each man will be armed with a bright hoe elk old as he is will lead and i will go by his side we will work busily till the sun has climbed halfway to his hill then we will smoke  his knowledge of their needs their habits their modes of thinking made all that he did successful he allowed the women to bring cool drinks flavored with herbs and to build little bowers to shade their sons and husbands from the fierce sun while they rested there was grumbling there was envy naturally but less than he expected  on the first day of july he was confident of a big crop and wrote to elsie saying the potatoes are in bloom the wheat is waving in the wind like a green sea i am waiting  to this she replied papas mind turns to the mountains these hot days and so we are coming also my heart yearns for a certain soldier in the westa commander of shining hoes and a leader of destructive red ploughmen i ought for my own peace and comfort to forget this singular creature but alas i cannot my perplexity grows daily i long to see him yet i am afraid  these words made him tireless and of joblike patience you need not wait till the harvest is ended he wrote in reply come and watch the grain ripen so that you will be garmented duly and ready for the feast moreover we will snatch so many more days of joy out of the maw of devouring time  to this she answered your expressed reasons are not overwhelming but as the sun is scorching now we leave soon we will reach pinon city in about ten days father is quite well but restless with the heat i am well but restless for other reasons i dont see that the problem of our lives is any nearer solution do you what can i do what can you do is there any common ground  there are no problems now that you are coming he replied  it was with a deep surprise and joy that she found herself trembling before each of his letters all the oldtime ecstasy and breathless passion of her girlhood came back to her but enlarged and based deeper a womans care and introspection giving it greater significance and power  the next day after elsies definite promise curtis rode over to the first camp and called the people round him and said  next week we will hold our feast to give thanks for the good things the earth has given to us and after we have councilled together we will feast and have a dance let everything be in order come in your finest dress let every garment be as it was of old let the young girls be very beautiful in whitened buckskin and beads i do not despise your oldtime dress i like it hereafter when you work you will need to wear white mans clothes for they are more comfortable but when you wish to have a good time then your old dress will be pleasant i do not ask you to forget the old time it is past but it is sweet to you i want you to be happy for i am happy     xxxvi  the harvesthome   the hayharvest was still going on when curtis and jennie drove down the valley to meet elsie and lawson at pinon city father is much changed elsie had written you will hardly know him now he has forgotten all about his campaign he remembers you only momentarily so that you need not feel any resentment he will probably meet you as if he had never seen you before please do not show any surprise no matter what he says  curtis expected to find brisbane a poor shambling wreck of a man morose and sorrowful to look upon and his astonishment was correspondingly profound as the exsenator descended from the train his step was vigorous and his face was placid and of good color thus much the young soldier took in at a glance then he forgot all the world in the radiant face of his hearts beloved  as she put up her lips to be kissed elsies eyes were dim with tears and she hurried to jennie as if for relief from her emotion when she turned her father was shaking hands urbanely with curtis  glad to meet you sir he said in the tone of the suave man of position i didnt catch the name  a spasm of pain crossed elsies face this is mr curtis papa dont you remember captain curtis  ah yes so it is he replied i remember you spoke of him once before i am very glad to make your acquaintancevery glad indeed sir  to meet this calm politeness in a man who in his right mind would have refused to shake hands was deeply moving to the young officer to all outward appearance the great promoter was the same and on all matters concerning his first campaign and first term and especially on the events of his early life he spoke with freedom even with humor but of the incidents of the later campaign he had no recollection that he had been defeated and humbled seemed also to have left no lasting mark upon his mind  the fact is my memory has grown very bad he explained i can remember faces in a dim way but anything that is said to me i forget instantly  for a time the thought of brisbanes mental decay threw a gloom over the party but elsie said please dont mind him i have reached a certain philosophic calm in the matter i can do him no good by sorrowing i have therefore determined to be as happy as i can  curtis cheerfully called we must start at once will your father go with us  oh no i am afraid to have him undertake that he will go on to copper city with his secretary  of course that is best replied curtis vastly relieved  brisbane parted with elsie quite matteroffactly and his urbanity remained unbroken as he shook hands with curtis pleased to have met you sir he said and in spite of her resolution the tears filled the daughters eyes the old warriors smiling forgetfulness of feuds was tragic  as they rode homeward curtis and elsie sat as before on the forward seat and he detailed what had taken place at the agency and she listened genuinely absorbed she laughed and she wept a little as his story touched on the pathetic incidents of the year  you are like a father confessor she said you hold in your hands the most intimate secrets of your people i dont understand your patience with them do you feel that you have made your demonstration  what i have done is written in lines of gold and green on the earth the sky is too bright to remember my gray days he replied most exultantly  she looked at him quizzically you are developing new and singular powers  i have a new and singular teacher  new she queried  new to me he answered and in such enigmatic way they expressed their emotion while lawson and jennie chatted gayly and in clear prose behind part of the time elsie drove and that gave curtis an excuse to lay his hand on her wrist when he wished her to drive slow at the halfway house she shuddered and made a mouth of disgust lets hurry past here i have a bad heart when i think of those horrible men  they are thinning out and this ranch has changed hands as they say on restaurant signs in chicago heres our north line of fence he said as they came to a big new gate i hastened to build this at once before anything happened to prevent this keeps the stock of the white man out and has stopped all friction  as they came in sight of the flagpole elsie cried out just think this is the third time i have driven up this road in this way twice with you  i know it is wonderful i dont intend you to go away without me  she was ignoring every one of his suggestions now but the flush of her cheek and a certain softness in her eyes encouraged him to go on  as they alighted at the door jennie remained to look after her bundles and curtis and elsie entered the library together he who had waited so eagerly for this moment turned and folded her close in his arms i need you sweetest ill never let you go again never  this was her moment to protest but she was silent with her face against his shoulder  jennie bounced into the hall with a great deal of premonitory clatter and hurried elsie to her room to rest  and now youre to be my really truly sister she said closing the door behind her  i thinkgeorge she hesitated a little and blushed before speaking his name expects itrather confidently  then give me a good hug you glorious thing     xxxvii  the mingling of the old and the new   early on the morning of the great daybefore the dawn in truththe tetongs came riding in over the hills from every quarter of the earth bringing their finest clothing their newest blankets and their whitest tepees all lashed on long poles between which the patient ponies walked as in the olden time every man woman and child able to sit a horse was mounted no one wore a white mans hat or shoes or vest all were in leggings and moccasins fringed and painted and they carried their summer blankets as they once carried their robes of the buffaloskin even the boys of six and seven wore suits cunningly fashioned and decorated like those of their elders the young warriors painted and with fluttering feathers rode their fleetest ponies with shoulders bare and gleaming like bronze in the sun  with all due form without hurry or jostling the whole tribe camped in a wide ellipse each clan in its place each family having a fixed position in the circle the tepees rose like magic and their threads of smoke began to creep up into the clear sky like mysterious plants slender and wavering  greetings passed from camp to camp the head men met in council and as the sun rose higher swarms of the young men galloped to and fro laying out a racingcourse and making up for a procession under wilsons direction  curtis said i am not interdicting any of their customs merely because they belong to their old life but because some of them are coarse or hurtful their dance is not harmful unless protracted to the point of interfering with their work that they are all living somewhat in the past today is true but they will put away this finery and go to work with me tomorrow to cut them off from all amusement is cruel fanaticism no people can endure without amusement  how appropriate their gay colors seem in this hot dun land remarked elsie they would look gaudy in a studio but out here they are grateful to the sense  in the centre of the wide circle of tepees a huge bower of pines was being erected for the dance and pulsing through the air the voice of the criers could be heard as they rode slowly round the circle publishing the programme of the day  looking over the camp towards the hills it is not difficult to imagine ones self back in the old days said maynard i saw sitting bull camped like this see here is the soldier lodge or chiefs headquarters and he pointed to a large handsome tepee set in one of the foci of the big ellipse  everywhere they went curtis and his friends met with hearty greeting hohhoh the little father the old men cried and came to shake hands and the women smiled looking up from their work the little children though they ran away at first came out again when they knew that it was the captain who called jennie gave hints about the cooking and praised the neat tepees and the pretty dresses while elsie looking upon it all with reflective eyes could not help thinking such will be my work if i do my duty as a wife  once she looked at the firm bold facial outlines of the man she had learned to love and snuggled a little closer into his shelter he would toil to make every hardship light that was certain but oh the dreary winters there were moments when she took to herself a part of the love and obedience this people showed curtis here was a little kingdom over which curtis reigned a despotic monarch and she if she did her duty would reign by his side it had at least the virtue of being an unconventional selfsacrifice and then again she smiled to think that elsie bee bee should feel a touch of pride in being the wife of an indian agent  driving his guests back to the agency curtis returned to the camp and moved about on foot among his people wherever he went he seemed to give zest to the sports and knowing this he remained with them till noon and only came in to rest his weary feet and aching eyes for half an hour before lunch  it was unutterably sweet to stretch out in his big battered easychair in the shaded coolness of the library and feel elsies smooth light hand in his hair  and you are never to leave me he said dreamily i cant realize it yet after a pause he added i am demanding too much of you sweetheart  you are demanding nothing sir if you did you wouldnt get it if i choose to give you anything you are to be grateful and discreetly silent  cant i say thank you  not a word  i am content he said and closed his eyes again to express it and she being unasked bent and kissed his forehead  rousing up a few minutes later he said i have a present in keeping for you  have you what is it is it from you why didnt you let me see it before  he rose and opened a closet door because the proper time had not come before i show it to you i want you to promise to wear it  i promise she instantly replied  dont be so ready i intend it to be a symbol of your change of heart  well then i dont promise she said backing away  i dont mean your change of heart towards me i have a ring to express that this is to express your change of heart towards  towards injuns  no towards all the small peoples of the earth  well then i cant wear it i havent changed down with them she shouted in smiling bravado  he closed the door very well then you shall not even see the present you are not worthy of it  oh please please ill forgive all the heathens of africa if you will only let me see  i dont believe i like that either he replied you are now too flippant however ill hold you to the word if you dont mean it now you will byandby  elsie clapped her hands with girlish delight as he held up a fine buckskin dress beautifully adorned with beads and quills it was exquisitely tanned as soft as silk and a deep cream color  isnt it lovely ill wear it whether my heart is changed or not  here are the leggings and moccasins to match  she gathered them all up at a swoop im going to put them on at once  wait he commanded small bird who made these garments is out in the kitchen i want to call her she can be your maid for this time  as small bird sidled bashfully into the hall elsie cried out in delight of her she was dressed in the oldtime tetong dress and was exceedingly comely her face was carefully painted and her hair shone with much brushing and oil her teeth were white and even  can she speak english asked elsie  not very well but she understands small bird the lady says thank you she thinks they are very fine her heart is glad go help her dress  come cried elsie eagerly and fairly ran up the stairs in her haste to be transformed into a woman of the red people  when she returned she was a sister to small bird her dark hair was braided in the tetong fashion her face was browned and her little feet were clothed in glittering beaded moccasins  you look exactly like some of the old engravings of mohawk princesses cried curtis now you are ready to sit by my side and review the procession  are we to have a procession  indeed we are as significant as any mediæval tournament i am the resident duke before whom the review takes place and i shall be in my best dress and you are to sit by my sidemy brideelect  oh no  oh yes it is decided he drew himself up haughtily i have said it and i am chief today it is good small bird he said as the tetong girl started to go my wife likes it very much  elsie ran towards the girl and took her by the shoulders as if to make her understand the better thank you thank you  small bird smiled but surrendered to her timidity and turning ran swiftly out of the room  curtis hooked elsie in his right arm now all is decreed you have put on the garb of my people and his kiss stopped the protest she struggled to utter  surely the day was a day strangely apart everything that could be done to make it symbolic to make it idyllic was done curtis appeared after lunch in a fine costume of buckskin trimmed with green porcupine quills and beads and for a hat he wore a fillet of beaverskin with a single feather on the back across his shoulder he carried the sash of a finely beaded tobacco pouch and in his hand a long fringed bag very ancient containing a peacepipe which had been transmitted to crawling elk by his fathers father a very precious thing worn only by chieftains  oh i shall paint you in that dress cried elsie  so accoutred he led the way to the canopied platform under the flagpole where the reviewing party were to sit in order that no invidious distinctions might be drawn two or three of the old chiefs and their wives had been given seats thereon and they were already in place not many strangers were present for curtis had purposely refrained from setting a day too long ahead but lawsons friends and some relatives of the employés and several of the young officers from the fort made up the outside representation maynard was in his brightest uniform and jennie looking very nice in a muslin gown and a broad white hat sat by his side  from the seats in the stand the camp swarming with horsemen could be seen wilson as grand marshal was riding to and fro assisted by lawson who had entered into the game with the selfsacrificing devotion of a drummajor his makeup was superb and when at last he approached leading the cavalcade elsie did not recognize him his lean face dark with paint was indistinguishably tetong seen from a distance and he sat his horse in perfect simulation of his red brethren he was but reenacting scenes of his early life his huntingshirt was dark with use and his splendid warbonnet trailed grandly down his back he rode by looking neither to the right nor the left singing a new song      we are passing     see us passing by     we are leaving the old behind us     the new we seek to find we are passing passing by  crawling elk followed holding aloft a spear with a green plume it was a turnip thrust through with a sharppointed blackened stick and behind him two and two came fifty of his young warriors carrying shining hoes upright as of old they carried their lances while at their shoulders where quivers of arrows should have swung dangled trim sheaves of green wheat and golden barley the free fluttering of their featherornamented hair the barbaric painting on their faces and hands symbolized the old life as the green arrows of the grain prefigured the new behind them rode their women each bearing in her left hand a bunch of flowers those who could read wore on their bosoms a small shining medal and in their hair an eagle feather no tetong woman had ever worn a plume before  standing elk quaint and bent rode by singing a warsong magnificent in his dress as war chief leading some twenty young men his hands were empty of the signs of peace and his face was rapt with dreams of the past but his young men carried longhandled forks which flamed in the sun and bracelets of green grass encircled their firm brown arms they too were painted to signify their clan and their ancestry and the medicine they affected was on their breasts their wives were close behind each bearing a stalk of corn in bloom their beaded saddles and gay blankets were pleasant to see every weapon bespoke warfare against weeds every ornament represented the better nature the striving the aspiration of its wearer  then came the schoolchildren adding a final note of pathos poor little brown men and women trudging on foot to symbolize that they must go through life plodding in the dust of the white mans chariot wheeltheir toes imprisoned in a shapeless box of leather their hair closely clipped their clothing hot and restrictive each carried a book and a slate and their faces were very intent and serious as they paced by on their way from the old to the new they were followed by the schoolband playing the starspangled banner with splendid disregard of the broken faith of the government whose song it was  and so they streamed by these folk accounted the most warlike of all red men genially carrying out the wishes of their chief illustrating without knowing it the wondrous change which had come to them the old men still clinging to the past the young men careless of the future the children already transformed and as they glanced up some smiling some grave and dreaming elsie shuddered with a species of awe it seemed as if a people were being disintegrated before her eyes that the evolution of a race having proceeded for countless ages by almost imperceptible degrees was now and here rushing as by mighty bounds from war to peace from hunting to harvesting from primitive indolence to ordered thrift they were indeed passing as the plains and the wild spaces were passing as the buffalo had passed as every wild thing must pass before the everthickening flood of white ploughmen pressing upon the land  twice they circled and then as they all massed before him curtis rose to sign to them  i am very proud of you all my friends are pleased my heart is big with emotion and my head is full of thoughts this is a great day for you and also for me some of you are sad for you long for the old thingsthe big broad plain the elk and the buffalo so do i i loved those things also but you have seen how it is the water of the stream never turns back to the spring the old man never grows young the tree that falls does not rise up again so the old things come never again we have always to look ahead perhaps in the happy huntingground all will be different but here now we must do our best to live upon the earth it is the law that now the game being gone we must plough and sow and reap the fruit of the soil that is the meaning of all we have done today we have put away the rifle we here take up the hoe  i am glad my heart is like a bird it sings when i see you happy listeni will tell you a great secret you see this young woman he touched elsie you see she wears the tetong dress the same as i that means much it signifies two things last year her heart was hard towards the tetongs now it is soft she is proud of what you have done she wears this dress for another reason she is going to be my wife and help me show you the good way at this moment a chorus of pleased outcries broke forth now go to your feast let everything be orderly tonight we will come to see you dance  with an outburst of jocular whooping the young men wheeled their horses and vanished under cover of a cloud of dust while the old men and the women and the children moved sedately back to camp the women chattering gayly over the days exciting shows and in anticipation of the dance which was to come                                       there were tears in elsies eyes as she looked up at curtis they have so far to go poor things they cant realize how long the road to civilization is  i do not care whether they reach what you call civilization or not the road to happiness and peace is not long it is short they are even now entering upon it they can be happy right here and so can we he ended looking at her with a tender wistfulness cant you understand  you have conquered she said with deep feeling under the spell of this day i feel your work to be the only thing in the world worth doing her words her voice so moved him that he bent and laid a kiss upon her lips when he could speak he said now i want to ask something of you i have a leave of absence for six months show me the old world  she sprang up ah can you go  when the crops are garnered and sifted and my people clothed and sheltered  id rather show you paris than anything else in the world she cried id almost marry you to do that  very well marry me we will spend our honeymoon there perhaps then you will be willing to spend one more year here with me and thenwellnever cross the range till you get to it is a maxim of the trail  the end
