88650438	night watches  by ww jacobs     the vigil  im the happiest man in the world said mr farrer in accents of dreamy tenderness  miss ward sighed  wait till father comes in she said  mr farrer peered through the plants which formed a welcome screen to the window and listened with some uneasiness  he was waiting for the firm springy step that should herald the approach of exsergeantmajor ward a squeeze of miss wards hand renewed his courage  perhaps i had better light the lamp said the girl after a long pause i wonder where mothers got to  shes on my side at any rate said mr farrer  poor mother  said the girl  she darent call her soul her own  i expect shes sitting in her bedroom with the door shut  she hates unpleasantness  and theres sure to be some  so do i said the young man with a slight shiver  but why should there be any  he doesnt want you to keep single all your life does he  hed like me to marry a soldier said miss ward  he says that the young men of the present day are too soft  the only thing he thinks about is courage and strength  she rose and placing the lamp on the table removed the chimney and then sought round the room for the matches  mr farrer who had two boxes in his pocket helped her  they found a box at last on the mantelpiece and mr farrer steadied her by placing one arm round her waist while she lit the lamp  a sudden exclamation from outside reminded them that the blind was not yet drawn and they sprang apart in dismay as a grizzled and upright old warrior burst into the room and confronted them  pull that blind down  he roared  not you he continued as mr farrer hastened to help  what do you mean by touching my blind  what do you mean by embracing my daughter  eh  why dont you answer  wewe are going to be married said mr farrer trying to speak boldly  the sergeantmajor drew himself up and the young man gazed in dismay at a chest which seemed as though it would never cease expanding  married exclaimed the sergeantmajor with a grim laugh  married to a little tame bunnyrabbit  not if i know it  wheres your mother he demanded turning to the girl  upstairs was the reply  her father raised his voice and a nervous reply came from above  a minute later mrs ward pale of cheek entered the room  heres fine goingson  said the sergeant major sharply  i go for a little walk and when i come back thisthis infernal cockroach has got its arm round my daughters waist  why dont you look after her  do you know anything about it  his wife shook her head  five feet four and about thirty round the chest and wants to marry my daughter said the sergeantmajor with a sneer  eh  whats that what did you say  what  i said thats a pretty good size for a cockroach murmured mr farrer defiantly  besides size isnt everything  if it was youd be a general instead of only a sergeantmajor  you get out of my house said the other as soon as he could get his breath  go on sharp with it  im going said the mortified mr farrer  im sorry if i was rude i came on purpose to see you tonight  berthamiss ward i meantold me your ideas but i couldnt believe her  i said youd got more common sense than to object to a man just because he wasnt a soldier  i want a man for a soninlaw said the other  i dont say hes got to be a soldier  just so said mr farrer  youre a man aint you  well ill do anything that youll do  pph said the sergeantmajor  ive done my little lot  ive been in action four times and wounded in three places  thats my tally  the colonel said once that my husband doesnt know what fear is said mrs ward timidly  hes afraid of nothing  except ghosts remarked her daughter softly  hold your tongue miss said her father twisting his moustache  no sensible man is afraid of what doesnt exist  a lot of people believe they do though said mr farrer breaking in i heard the other night that old smiths ghost has been seen again swinging from the apple tree  three people have seen it  rubbish said the sergeantmajor  maybe said the young man but ill bet you mr ward for all your courage that you wont go up there alone at twelve oclock one night to see  i thought i ordered you out of my house just now said the sergeant major glaring at him  going into action said mr farrer pausing at the door is one thing you have to obey orders and you cant help yourself but going to a lonely cottage two miles off to see the ghost of a man that hanged himself is another  do you mean to say im afraid blustered the other  mr farrer shook his head  i dont say anything he remarked but even a cockroach does a bit of thinking sometimes  perhaps youd like to go said the sergeantmajor  i dont mind said the young man and perhaps youll think a little better of me mr ward  if i do what youre afraid to do  mrs ward and her daughter flung themselves hastily between the sergeantmajor and his intended sacrifice  mr farrer pale but determined stood his ground  ill dare you to go up and spend a night there alone he said  ill dare you said the incensed warrior weakly  all right ill spend wednesday night there said mr farrer and ill come round on thursday and let you know how i got on  i dare say said the other but i dont want you here and whats more i wont have you  you can go to smiths cottage on wednesday at twelve oclock if you like and ill go up any time between twelve and three and make sure youre there  dye understand  ill show you whether im afraid or not  theres no reason for you to be afraid said mr farrer  i shall be there to protect you  thats very different to being there alone as i shall be  but of course you can go up the next night by yourself and wait for me if you like  if you like to prove your courage i mean  when i want to be ordered about said the sergeantmajor in a magnificent voice ill let you know  now go before i do anything i might be sorry for afterwards  he stood at the door erect as a ramrod and watched the young man up the road  his conversation at the suppertable that night related almost entirely to puppydogs and the best way of training them  he kept a close eye upon his daughter for the next day or two but human nature has its limits  he tried to sleep one afternoon in his easy chair with one eye open but the exquisite silence maintained by miss ward was too much for it  a hum of perfect content arose from the feature below and five minutes later miss ward was speeding in search of mr farrer  i had to come ted she said breathlessly because tomorrows wednesday  ive got something to tell you but i dont know whether i ought to  tell me and let me decide said mr farrer tenderly  iim so afraid you might be frightened said the girl  i wont tell you but ill give you a hint  if you see anything awful dont be frightened  mr farrer stroked her hand  the only thing im afraid of is your father he said softly  oh said the girl clasping her hands together  you have guessed it  guessed it said mr farrer  miss ward nodded  i happened to pass his door this morning she said in a low voice  it was open a little way and he was standing up and measuring one of mothers nightgowns against his chest  i couldnt think what he was doing it for at first  mr farrer whistled and his face hardened  thats not fair play he said at last  all right ill be ready for him  he doesnt like to be put in the wrong said miss ward  he wants to prove that you havent got any courage  hed be disappointed if he found you had  all right said mr farrer again  youre an angel for coming to tell me  father would call me something else i expect said miss ward with a smile  goodbye  i want to get back before he wakes up  she was back in her chair listening to her fathers slumbers half an hour before he awoke  im making up for tomorrow night he said opening his eyes suddenly  his daughter nodded  shows strength of will continued the sergeantmajor amiably wellington could go to sleep at any time by just willing it  im the same way i can go to sleep at five minutes notice  its a very useful gift said miss ward piously very  mr ward had two naps the next day  he awoke from the second at twelve thirty am and in a somewhat disagreeable frame of mind rose and stretched himself  the house was very still  he took a small brown paper parcel from behind the sofa and extinguishing the lamp put on his cap and opened the front door  if the house was quiet the little street seemed dead  he closed the door softly and stepped into the darkness  in terms which would have been understood by our army in flanders he execrated the forefathers the name and the upbringing of mr edward farrer  not a soul in the streets not a light in a window  he left the little town behind passed the last isolated house on the road and walked into the greater blackness of a road between tall hedges  he had put on canvas shoes with rubber soles for the better surprise of mr farrer and his own progress seemed to partake of a ghostly nature  every ghost story he had ever heard or read crowded into his memory  for the first time in his experience even the idea of the company of mr farrer seemed better than no company at all  the night was so dark that he nearly missed the turning that led to the cottage  for the first few yards he had almost to feel his way then with a greater yearning than ever for the society of mr farrer he straightened his back and marched swiftly and noiselessly towards the cottage  it was a small tumbledown place set well back in an overgrown garden the sergeantmajor came to a halt just before reaching the gate and hidden by the hedge unfastened his parcel and shook out his wifes best nightgown  he got it over his head with some difficulty and with his arms in the sleeves tried in vain to get his big hands through the small lace trimmed wristbands  despite his utmost efforts he could only get two or three fingers through and after a vain search for his cap which had fallen off in the struggle he made his way to the gate and stood there waiting  it was at this moment that the thought occurred to him that mr farrer might have failed to keep the appointment  his knees trembled slightly and he listened anxiously for any sound from the house  he rattled the gate and standing with white arms outstretched waited  nothing happened  he shook it again and then pulling himself together opened it and slipped into the garden  as he did so a large bough which lay in the centre of the footpath thoughtfully drew on one side to let him pass  mr ward stopped suddenly and with his gaze fixed on the bough watched it glide over the grass until it was swallowed up in the darkness  his own ideas of frightening mr farrer were forgotten and in a dry choking voice he called loudly upon the name of that gentleman  he called two or three times with no response and then in a state of panic backed slowly towards the gate with his eyes fixed on the house a loud crash sounded from somewhere inside the door was flung violently open and a gruesome figure in white hopped out and squatted on the step  it was evident to sergeantmajor ward that mr farrer was not there and that no useful purpose could be served by remaining  it was clear that the young mans courage had failed him and with grey head erect elbows working like the sails of a windmill and the ends of the nightgown streaming behind him the sergeantmajor bent his steps towards home  he dropped into a walk after a time and looked carefully over his shoulder  so far as he could see he was alone but the silence and loneliness were oppressive  he looked again and without stopping to inquire whether his eyes had deceived him broke into a run again alternately walking and running he got back to the town and walked swiftly along the streets to his house  policeconstable burgess who was approaching from the other direction reached it at almost the same moment and turning on his lantern stood gaping with astonishment anything wrong  he demanded  wrong  panted the sergeantmajor trying to put a little surprise and dignity into his voice  no  i thought it was a lady walking in her sleep at first said the constable  a tall lady  the sergeantmajor suddenly became conscious of the nightgown  ive beenfor a little walk he said still breathing hard  i felt a bit chillyso iput this on  suits you too said the constable stiffly  but you army men always was a bit dressy  now if i put that on i should look ridikerlous  the door opened before mr ward could reply and revealed in the light of a bedroom candle the astonished countenances of his wife and daughter  george  exclaimed mrs ward  father  said miss ward  the sergeantmajor tottered in and gaining the front room flung himself into his armchair  a stiff glass of whisky and water handed him by his daughter was swallowed at a gulp  did you go  inquired mrs ward clasping her hands  the sergeantmajor fully conscious of the suspicions aroused by his disordered appearance rallied his faculties  not likely he said with a short laugh  after i got outside i knew it was no good going there to look for that young snippet  hed no more think of going there than he would of flying  i walked a little way down the roadfor exerciseand then strolled back  butmy nightgown  said the wondering mrs ward  put it on to frighten the constable said her husband  he stood up and allowed her to help him pull it off  his face was flushed and his hair tousled but the bright fierceness of his eye was unquenched  in submissive silence she followed him to bed  he was up late next morning and made but a poor breakfast  his after dinner nap was disturbed and tea was over before he had regained his wonted calm  an hour later the arrival of a dignified and reproachful mr farrer set him blazing again  i have come to see you about last night said mr farrer before the other could speak  a jokes a joke but when you said you would come i naturally expected you would keep your word  keep my word  repeated the sergeantmajor almost choking with wrath  i stayed there in that lonely cottage from twelve to three as per agreement waiting for you said mr farrer  you were not there shouted the sergeantmajor  how do you know  inquired the other  the sergeantmajor looked round helplessly at his wife and daughter  prove it said mr farrer pushing his advantage  you questioned my courage and i stayed there three hours  where were you  you were not there said the sergeantmajor  i know  you cant bluff me  you were afraid  i was there and ill swear it said mr farrer  still theres no harm done  ill go there again tonight and ill dare you to come for me  dare said the sergeantmajor choking  dare  dare repeated the other and if you dont come this time ill spread it all over marcham  tomorrow night you can go there and wait for me if you see what i saw  oh ted  said miss ward with a shiver  saw said the sergeant major starting  nothing harmful said mr farrer calmly  as a matter of fact it was very interesting  what was demanded the sergeantmajor  it sounds rather silly as a matter of fact said mr farrer slowly still i did see a broken bough moving about the garden  mr ward regarded him openmouthed  anything else  he inquired in a husky voice  a figure in white said mr farrer with long waving arms hopping about like a frog  i dont suppose you believe me but if you come to night perhaps youll see it yourself  its very interesting  werwerent you frightened  inquired the staring mrs ward  mr farrer shook his head  it would take more than that to frighten me he said simply  i should be ashamed of myself to be afraid of a poor thing like that  it couldnt do me any harm  did you see its face  inquired mrs ward nervously  mr farrer shook his head  what sort of a body had it got  said her daughter  so far as i could see very good said mr farrer  very good figure not tall but well made  an incredible suspicion that had been forming in the sergeantmajors mind began to take shape  did you see anything else  he asked sharply  one more said mr farrer regarding him pleasantly  one i call the running ghost  run began the sergeantmajor and stopped suddenly  it came in at the front gate pursued mr farrer  a tall wellknit figure of martial bearingmuch about your height mr wardwith a beautiful filmy white robe down to its knees  he broke off in mild surprise and stood gazing at miss ward who with her handkerchief to her mouth was rocking helplessly in her chair  knees he repeated quietly  it came slowly down the path and half way to the house it stopped and in a frightened sort of voice called out my name  i was surprised naturally but before i could get to it to reassure it  thatll do said the sergeantmajor rising hastily and drawing himself up to his full height  you asked me said mr farrer in an aggrieved voice  i know i did said the sergeantmajor breathing heavily  i know i did but if i sit here listening to any more of your lies i shall be ill the best thing you can do is to take that giggling girl out and give her a breath of fresh air  i have done with her
